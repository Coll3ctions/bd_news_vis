That is because it has done away with the earlier eligibility criteria of rescheduling bank loans, payment of utility arrear bills and providing eight pieces of vital personal information one year before filing nomination papers for the Union Parishad elections. For, by allowing the candidates to reschedule their loan and pay up arrear bills just one day before the filing of nomination papers is tantamount to issuing a 'no objection to loan default' as far as eligibility for participation in the local elections is concerned thereby virtually denying the public the right to choose their representatives from amongst candidates with clean records. What is important to note is that there will be no mechanism now to check the veracity of any statement submitted by the candidate within a span of twenty-four hours.//////NATURE has been doing its worst in large parts of Asia. In these past couple of days, a tsunami has hit Samoa, a typhoon has devastated lives in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, destruction has been wreaked in the Philippines and an earthquake has laid lives low in Indonesia. Natural disasters are of course to be expected and have been happening over the centuries. But for such disasters to strike in such quick frequency and in such damaging manner certainly causes alarm among various parts of the globe. Here in Bangladesh, instances of low intensity earthquakes have been recorded over the past few months, something that has people worried about the consequences should a major earthquake occur. There are already the dire predictions of the devastation which could descend in such a situation. As many as seventy per cent of building structures in the capital are feared to be vulnerable. One can only shudder at the possibility.//////REPRESENTING 85 percent of the world's economy, G-20 leaders gathered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 24-25 September 2009.

One of the likely issues for discussion was how to ensure better behavior from bankers. //////"The taste of victory is the burden of responsibility," said Dalia Grybanskaite, the first woman elected as president of Lithuania.

It has proved wrong the age-old maxim - "All things that go up must come down."

Market mechanism misunderstood and unknowingly mismanaged by drives and dictate has set the chain reaction and price overheat which is now beyond the control of the administration.//////One hundred and twenty three more cases are to be dropped. The govt. scrutiny committee finds them 'politically motivated'-- cases filed during the last BNP-Jamaat coalition and the subsequent caretaker rule.

The government has so far decided to withdraw 572 cases filed against the leaders of ruling Awami League and its allies and only Moudud Ahmed from main opposition BNP.(The Daily Star,17-09-09). Those who filed those cases seem to have done it by misusing power with ulterior motive at the cost of govt. money. In the process of doing these unjustified activities, lots of valuable Govt. manpower hour and money have been exhausted.//////There have been a lot of controversies on crossfire issue in my native land, Bangladesh. The civilized nations, especially the West, are against it, calling it violation of Human Rights. Of course it is a violation of Human Rights but in Bangladesh context it became necessary and is still necessary to contain crime. Killing a man by law enforcement agencies in the guise of crossfire is an extra-judicial killing and surely the civilized nations have the right to criticise us. But when the action is taken for security and safety of other innocent lives in desperation, it may be condoned. //////BSF men have been killing Bangladeshi cattle traders, businessmen, farmers, general people in the border areas for no reason.

May be he shall become the most powerful Minister in the cabinet. He has already made his mark in the political arena. Subsequently he shall adorn himself with sumptuous titles philanthropist, social worker etc.//////Last Thursday I went to the diplomatic area in Gulshan. I saw drains and manholes full of filth and water. And water flowing from these was flooding the footpaths of Natunbazar-Malibag road.//////The Quranic word 'zakat' not only has the meaning of charity, alms, official tax and voluntary contribution, but it also has a strong spiritual motive. The way the Holy Quran induces the well-off to give zakat is courteous yet firm. If they give the poor their due, Allah will pay back them many times over with blessings in this world and the next (57:11, and 73:23). That is why, alms giving is often represented in the Holy Quran as a transaction between man, who is temporary, and Allah, who is Permanent, the Generous -- Who has created everything. The Holy Quran says, "Who is it that will lend Allah a goodly loan so he multiplies it to him manifold? And Allah withholds and extends and to Him you shall return."//////Lately, there have been a few quakes that jolted Dhaka, Mymensingh, Sylhet encompassing a vast swath of Eastern Bangladesh. Experts say tremors, if frequent, are precursors to a catastrophic earthquake. Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated regions of the globe having a population of 150 plus million living in an area measuring about 55 thousand sq. miles. The country sits on a fault line having active Himalyan tectonic plates. The UN has also designated Dhaka as the most vulnerable city to earthquake close on the heels of Teheran.//////I write this letter to inform you of a news report that caught everyone's attention a couple of weeks ago on television. The news was read so fast that we missed out on the names that were mentioned and I apologize for not being able to provide that information but I assure you any news sources will be able to confirm the incident. The story is about a very young schoolgirl who was raped and murdered in her own home and left it to her parents to find her upon their return from work. The news was a follow-up of the incident. I am not writing to talk about the crime that took place. It is unimaginable and a disgrace to the human race. I am writing about the follow-up which mentioned that until that day the girl's parents have not seen the light of justice. That is because they are threatened by some men close to the miscreants, and the police officer in charge of the investigation was recently transferred without being able to re-assign the particular 'file' to the new investigation officer.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.

Shahabuddin profoundly established himself as an ardent and devoted painter over the decades. His signature traits are vibrant figures and their poignant movements. The movements are quite dissimilar from those of his contemporaries. Each movement makes what amounts to a distinct look and language. The language is closely connected to the time of the country's turbulent birth and its significant aspects. His paintings encapsulate ecstasy, affections and torment. He wants to visually document a certain time, moments, and he has a great tendency to mingle an era with others. //////Theatre troupe Nagarik Natya Sampraday staged its latest production "Kathal Bagan" at the Experimental Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on September 30.

There was a major emphasis in the PM's speech on food governance and more equitable trade relations favourable to the developing world and particularly the least-developed countries (LDC). I will confine my comments to research-oriented development activities necessary for implementing her proposals for achieving food security.//////GROWTH, as we know, does not accomplish enough by itself, and sometimes has unfortunate consequences. It is said that the hallmark of cancer is growth without development. Development in a normative concept, which implies choices about goals for achieving what Mahatma Gandhi called "realisation of human potential." Development involves major changes in social structures, which may be achieved by reduction of inequality and eradication of absolute poverty. //////RIVERS are the lifelines of Bangladesh. Of the few riverine countries in the world, Bangladesh figures prominently. The rivers, their tributaries, and the innumerable canals they feed, form a well-knit but complex network of arteries that support the ecology and life-system of Bangladesh. Our lifestyle, culture and livelihood are the outcome of our river system. Any gross violation that blocks the arteries of this system shakes menacingly the lives of its millions.//////What would it be like if all the world's cars stopped harmful emissions and all our power needs were met by a single battery a fuel cell that would give us the power to charge our portables as well as provide all the electricity needs for our homes?
