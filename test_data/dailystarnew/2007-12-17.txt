The nation celebrated 36 years of independence yesterday, saluting the gallant sons and daughters of the soil who had unflinchingly sacrificed their lives in the Liberation War of 1971 to translate the national dream of an independent motherland into a reality.//////The major political parties, socio-cultural organisations and war heroes yesterday boycotted the Victory Day reception at the Bangabhaban to protest invitation to the anti-liberation forces.//////Unavailability of tickets of buses, trains and launches has as usual caused suffering to many city dwellers ahead of Eid-ul-Azha as almost all tickets for three days before the vacation starts have already been sold out.//////World Bank Vice-president Praful C Patel said the results of the caretaker government's performance over the past year are mixed, with some concerns matched by major achievements in anti-corruption and institutional reforms.//////The families of the seven Birshreshthas yesterday said they would never be able to celebrate the victory wholeheartedly until the war criminals are punished.//////The sector commanders of the Liberation War yesterday strongly demanded that the caretaker government form a special tribunal for trying the war criminals before facing the wrath of the people. //////Hundreds of people from all walks of life formed a human chain on Dhaka University campus yesterday, the Victory Day, demanding trial of the war criminals.//////Small entrepreneurs affected by Cyclone Sidr are now at the mercy of loan sharks, also known locally as 'mahajans', as the NGOs in the district stopped disbursing fresh loans.//////The power ministry today seeks the nod of the caretaker government's purchase committee on seven rental power bids of 250 megawatt capacity with three local and foreign entities that submitted offers in October.//////Although it was the eighth day into the collapse of the upper floors of Rangs Bhaban in the capital, relatives of the remaining trapped demolition workers who are surely dead by now according to experts, were seen waiting still for the bodies of their loved ones yesterday.//////Sparse supply of cattle and huge losses of livestock caused by Cyclone Sidr might raise prices of cattle and other sacrificial animals at cattle markets set up on the eve of Eid-ul-Azha this year, said traders.//////Incarcerated top graft suspects and other VIP prisoners were excluded from Victory Day programmes inside jails yesterday.//////The laid-off workers of state-owned Alim Jute Mills at Atra Industrial Area in the city will put up barricades today at different points of Khulna-Jessore Highway demanding withdrawal of layoff notice and payment of arrears.//////Pakistan's election campaign began in earnest yesterday, a day after President Pervez Musharraf lifted his unpopular emergency rule and restored the constitution. //////Iraq formally took over security control of the southern oil province of Basra from British forces on Sunday paving the way for Britain to sharply reduce its nearly 5,000-strong troop presence. //////THE outcome from Bali climate conference can be seen in a positive light given that the USA is party to a consensus which it has not been during the Kyoto protocol days since 1997. In a last-minute dramatic turn, the US reached a compromise with the European Union, tilted towards itself though, to the effect that no numeric range in slashing green house gas emissions was adopted in the declaration. Aside from the USA, it does not also require two of the largest emitters of the world, India and China to take on reduction commitments. Yet, a framework to launch negotiations and a timeline for reaching an accord by 2009 to fight climate changes has been spelt out. //////THE major nationwide electricity failure on Saturday came like a bolt from a clear sky with no gale or cyclone in the vicinity whatsoever. It was a mechanical failure at the national power grid originating at Ashuganj and it took hours for the PDB technicians to repair the glitch and bring back normalcy in life. Our guess is there is hardly a functional auto-reactive mechanism in place to arrive at a solution within the shortest possible time. By all means, it was an irritant of a large scale as day to day work almost came to a halt at many places. Among the mentionable sufferings, trade and commerce activities and hospital services were severely disrupted because of the obstruction. To say the least, the experience made the citizens ponder anew the dismal state of our existing electricity generation and distribution system. //////WITHIN the Islamic world of about 1.4 billion of people, disparity between rich and poor is stark. The leaders of Islamic community have not been able to rescue many of them from oppression and humiliation.//////Is this the ultimate opinion poll? In early December a press release issued in Islamabad cited an opinion poll conducted by a Boston-based organisation called, slightly obviously, International Public Opinion Polls (IPOP: was the acronym significant?). The respondents in Pakistan, it said, had been interviewed by phone or Internet and concluded that a very satisfying 74% thought that President Pervez Musharraf's popularity had risen ever since his tailor had the good sense to change his dress code to civvies. To complement such good news, 55% of the respondents thought that the general elections in Pakistan should be held in early January as announced by the government, without any delay. //////WHEN victory showered this nation on December 16, 1971, two things came to our then young mind: the birth of a free nation and at last the enemy has been defeated. It is not possible to put in words now after so many years elapsed, the relief sweet victory brought to this nation. //////Bangladesh's match-preparation on their New Zealand tour got off to an inauspicious start when the Northern Districts Knights eased to a seven-wicket victory with seven and a half overs to spare chasing a target of 223 in the first warm-up at Seddon Park on Sunday.

But all the meetings and discussions proved futile due to US-Israel secret deals, intrigue and dilly-dally tactics. We feel the Annapolis conference sponsored by US President George Bush would again end in a fiasco.//////As Bangladeshi we all are familiar with different types of natural calamities. The repeated floods and the recent Sidr led to deaths of thousands of people and dislocated many other things. But Sidr could not destroy our mental strength. We can rise up again.//////The Sun Temple of Konark is situated at Konark city in the eastern part of Orissa in India. During our family trip to India, I longed so much to have a glimpse of Sun Temple which is very famous worldwide for its intricate sculptures and carvings. At last, after lots of persuasions and arguments, finally I managed to make my father agree to go to Konark. //////The number of street beggars has increased enormously in the metropolitan Dhaka city, especially, in most of the traffic signals, foot overbridges, in front of mosques. Many of them are crippled (amputated foot or arm) walking with the support of crutch. Blinds are begging with the support of either son/daughter or a caring person. //////Much as I appreciate your publishing my article on the above subject in your today's issue (29th November 2007), I have to convey that there have been some mistakes in understanding my technical paper which are as follows: //////It is great news that the four teachers of Rajshahi University have been released unconditionally and that has really reflected the hidden feelings of general public. We are also very eagerly waiting to see the government decision on the release of respected teachers of Dhaka University as well. //////Teachers have the greater burden of setting the moral standards not only by teaching the same in the classroom but by living by them. When a teacher teaches about moral behaviour and discipline in his classroom, only the students sitting inside the four walls of the classroom have the opportunity to learn. But when they live by that, the rest of the world have the opportunity to learn the same. As you can see the later form of teaching not only has an exponential effect compared to the former. //////I disagree completely with the writer under this heading (10 Dec) that an MP candidate must have 15 years of political experience at union, thana, zilla level etc. Such a requirement will fossilize the political process for career politicians and there will be no newcomers and no new big ideas. The writer has also been misinformed about such a process in other countries; for instance in the UK there is no such requirement. That is why Una King could be nominated and won the Tower Hamlets seat for Labour in 1997 when the local career politician with long experience Ms. Paula Uddin made way for her.//////Cyclone Sidr hit Barisal Division and parts of Khulna & Dhaka divisions last November. As most of the inhabitants of the affected areas are poor, they cannot even think of PCC/RCC building. They have to reconstruct their shelters with wood, bamboo and Corrugated Iron (CI) sheets. But the price of CI sheet has gone sky high in the last one year. General people cannot afford it. In the international market the main raw materials of CI sheet, Hot Rolled Coil (HR Coil) and Zinc Ingot have risen sharply. //////In BTV news on the Armed Forces Day on Wednesday, 21 November last, it was mentioned that the Bangladesh Armed Forces comprising the Army, Navy and Air Force had come into being on 21 November 1971. The information is not correct. Neither the Armed Forces, nor the Army the Navy, the Air Force was formed on 21 November 1971.//////The exploitation of the third world by the rich industrialised countries, that is colonialism, continues, directly or indirectly. Today the DCs and the LDCs are facing additional pressures: natural disasters, relocation of factories, and the hunt for untapped sources of natural energy. Bangladesh is a victim, and is under increasing social pressure due to turbulences in religious escape routes, for economic salvation, and the trappings of western democracy templates. The newly emerging nations are facing the indirect effects of the global village syndrome. The IT effect on societies has increased the awareness of the masses [note the hartal on shortage of fertilisers]. The reduction of the communication gaps in the have-not societies has made corruption a hard issue to tackle by the regimes, lured by the economic disparities between the first and third worlds. Now religious extremism is sought as an escape route back to religion, not back to virtual politics.//////The low investment, low technology and labour intensive garments industry has developed tremendously in the last two decades in Bangladesh. Huge demand of production ingredients like, nit & woven fabric, button, jeepers, level and packing materials of the garments industry created scope for backward linkage industrial units. A good number of industrial units have been set up in the last couple of years to cater to the demand of the garments industry, especially yarn producing spinning factories, fabric producing factories, processing dying and washing plants that have come up and created a good number of jobs. But these backward linkage industrial units are confronting shortage of technical experts in textile technology these days. On the other hand, every year thousands of crore is spent by the government of Bangladesh to impart general and religious education in public and private school and collages, which ultimately increases the number of unemployed educated youths. What a pity! //////Now-a-days divorce, a widespread social disease, is affecting our family life. But have we ever deliberated on what the possible factors and consequences are and what remedial measures we have to adopt to redeem our people from its gangrenous effect? Actually, it is high time we did so and any procrastination may deteriorate the situation hampering all possibilities of finding out a desired remedy. However we have to diagnose the ominous trend with a critical and analytical attitude. In doing that the most obvious factors that come out are conflict in personality, impact of satellite channels, extra marital relations and so on. In this case we have to remember that marriage is a holy bond that can never be defiled by noxious causes as mentioned above, it is a gateway to peace and prosperity, felicity and success and above all sound life through commitment, sympathy and co-operation. Whoever embarks on this new life should be committed to maintaining that marriage does not mean momentary pleasure only and it is not a child's plaything that is vulnerable to personal whims, nor a commercial enterprise that is contingent upon monetary gains; over and above it is a track of patience, prudence and sacrifice for mutual understanding. But in our society modern couples, driven by their impulsive decisions, never care about the bedrock of marriage and take it for something worthless. That is they are very often seen embroiling themselves in personal attacks against each other with reference to faithlessness, sense of superiority and inferiority, dowry, difference of opinions, maladjustment in ages and so on which lead them to hasten their separation. This is a typical picture of our society which indicates that we are trying to keep pace with the western traditions, hurling away the age old unity and sympathy without ever considering that a little bit of patience, prudence and sense of propriety can ward off the painful situation. But before that we have to participate in indirect action against the tendency.//////President Pervez Musharraf has tightened his control over Pakistan's nuclear weapons, anchoring in law a commission responsible for overseeing the nuclear arsenal and preventing further proliferation. //////Sri Lanka will meet with Indian and Russian delegations this week on possible arms purchases including air defence weaponry as clashes with Tamil Tiger rebels escalate, press reports here said Sunday. //////Millions in India's religiously divided Gujarat state voted yesterday in closely-guarded elections as exit polls predicted a Hindu hardliner accused of aiding deadly riots will be re-elected. //////Nepal's political parties and former rebels Saturday agreed to hold elections by mid-April next year, a top minister said. //////Four militants were killed in fighting with Afghan troops in the southern town of Musa Qala Sunday, the defence ministry said, in the first battle since the rebels were ousted from there last week. //////President Pervez Musharraf lifted a six-week-old state of emergency Saturday, telling a skeptical nation the crackdown was to save Pakistan from a conspiracy rather than ensure his own political survival. //////International health experts have been dispatched to Pakistan to help investigate the cause of South Asia's first outbreak of bird flu in people and determine if the virus could have been transmitted through human contact, officials said Sunday. //////Pakistan's government yesterday ordered a high-level investigation into the escape from police custody of a British terror suspect, officials said, as a hunt was launched to track him down. //////BJP on Sunday rejected Congress' claims of a division in the party over Leader of Opposition LK Advani being chosen to lead it. //////India has installed a pair of giant antennas to monitor a planned robotic mission to the moon next year, making it one of a few nations with deep space tracking ability, officials said. //////Turkish planes bombed northern Iraq on Sunday targeting Kurdish rebels, in at least the second such operation this month even as Ankara held back from launching a ground assault. //////A hard-fought deal fixing a 2009 deadline for a new treaty to tackle global warming ran straight into trouble yesterday with the United States voicing "serious concerns" over its provisions. //////Major powers and key donors meet in Paris today for a conference aimed at raising billions of dollars to help the emergence of a viable Palestinian state and give political impetus to the newly-relaunched peace process with Israel. //////A conference of South Africa's ruling ANC which could see President Thabo Mbeki toppled as party leader was formally opened in the northern city of Polokwane on Sunday. //////A senior Islamic militant, wanted by the US government, has been killed in a clash with the Philippine military in the nation's restive south, an official said Sunday. //////One in four of Israeli troops serving at the hundreds of checkpoints across the occupied West Bank have engaged in or witnessed abuse of Palestinians, an army-commissioned survey said yesterday. //////WE were optimistic about getting the permission from the authorities to bring out this years //////.

We, of the old generations who have had the rare privilege and honour of being witness to the great saga of our liberation war and the finest hour of our national history, and those of us of the new generations, who have only read and heard of that glorious past of ours, need to be reminded of the travails we have been through in our journey to freedom and of the potentials of our nationhood. //////ON November 15, several million people in our southern coastal areas, in at least seven districts, faced the Cyclone Sidr, which caused huge damage to human lives, livestock, poultry, trees, houses, and it destroyed the livelihood sources of people. We do not yet know how long it will take for the people to recover from such damage of the disaster. Although lots of relief and recovery efforts are taken up by government, non-government organisations, individuals, and different social organisations, all these are simply not enough to cover the losses. //////DELEGATES from nearly 190 countries are meeting for two weeks in Bali to discuss climate change. A principal objective is to agree a "Bali roadmap" -- a process leading to a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, whose targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions expire in 2012.//////Two freedom fighters with machineguns hanging on their back are ploughing land with two bulls.
