We congratulate the government, and especially Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for this initiative. //////It is puzzling to note that garments industry, a prime foreign exchange earner, has been left to its own devices to grow listlessly without sustainability built into the sector. As long as it minted money, the government and the industry owners were lulled into a complacent mode, thinking their position in the world market is invincible. But we have been rudely awakened by the Tazreen factory fire disaster. It has literally opened a Pandora's box as safety standards and environmental issues came under a closer scrutiny world wide.//////Arambagh KS opened their account in their third match of the Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League as they handed a 1-0 defeat to visitors Feni Soccer Club at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Two crucial fixtures of the Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League take place today at the Bangabandhu National Stadium with Sheikh Russel KC taking on last season's runners-up Muktijoddha Sangsad in the first match and Mohammedan SC playing against Team BJMC in the latter.//////A desperate India's push for a series-levelling win was met with dogged resistance from England who rode on Jonathan Trott's gritty half-century to overcome a nervous phase as the fourth and final Test seemed headed for a draw on Sunday.//////Shaheed Mushtaque XI beat Shaheed Jewel XI by four wickets to win the Victory Day exhibition match, which took place at the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium, yesterday.

And I wonder how the 13-year-old boy could bear the pain of seeing the gruesome killing of a young man. The lives of common people have become unsafe, and in such cases the law enforcers just witness the incidents without intervening. It is pointless to ask the incumbent government to take any sort of action because they will obviously turn a blind eye to such activities done by their party cadres and will do nothing. Allah will never help the people of a country who do not help themselves to change their own fate.//////Ma, I am going to die. You will find me in a toilet...we can never imagine the pain and trauma Polash, one of the victims of the Tazreen fire, went through while he told this to his mother over phone, in the last minutes of his life. The criminals responsible for these deaths as well as the flyover tragedy in Chittagong, which also claimed several lives, should not go unpunished. Three girders of the 1.4 km long flyover collapsed over the local people and now the authorities are getting ready to give colossal amounts of compensations. Why? Couldn't they use that money to complete that already delayed flyover project? If they did so, so many lives could be saved. These current tragedies also show that the authorities concerned are not at all worried about anything, be it the government agencies or the owners of the firms. As a teenager, I firmly believe that observing a national mourning day or compensating these unfortunate people will not help, not at all. But, restricting our lax laws and supervising that the laws are implemented will surely help. I appreciate the government's move of countrywide inspection of ill-equipped factories by fire service teams but I also urge that it continues and not stop after a certain period. There is no point in playing the blame game. //////From the very beginning, former communications minister Syed Abul Hossain's name was coming up again and again in connection with corruption in the Padma bridge project. But the government was brushing it aside. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina even called him a 'patriot'. Finally when the World Bank refused to sign any deal if Abul Hossain is in his position, the government removed him from his post.//////A news item with interesting information, published in this daily recently, has drawn my attention. Stephen Hawking, the former Lucasian professor of mathematics holding Isaac Newton's chair at Cambridge University, has won the Special Fundamental Physics Prize.

Our policymakers are talking about digital Bangladesh. Is this a step for digital Bangladesh? A section of the government might have thought that the blocking of YouTube would go in its favour because no one would get any scope to post and re-post bitter TV talk shows on YouTube and so anti-government statements will not be disseminated. But we cannot suffer for a cheap movie made in the USA. In fact, many non-Muslims already rejected that movie. Unfortunately, our IT community failed to pressurise the government to open YouTube.//////Congratulations, Shohag Gaji. We are really proud of you. Before the match, we were afraid of Chris Gayle. You have provided the courage to all the cricketers and cricket fans to overcome that fear. Now you have become the symbol of fear to the Caribbeans. You sent Gayle to the pavilion before he could start playing. We are really hopeful about you. Now please try to perform consistently and take our country to the peak of honour.//////The 9/29 attack on the Buddhist monasteries, temples and houses in Ramu is a disgrace to the non-communal history of Bangladesh. Though it has been more than two months into the Ramu violence, the inquiry committee has not been able to provide any satisfactory answer. This Ramu event can be analyzed from different perspectives. For instance, it can be scrutinized if any individuals or political leaders were involved in the attack in order to gain some political and personal interests. //////That night I got down from a bus at Azimpur. The weather was cold. I had to wait there for a few minutes to get on a tempo to reach my home. Suddenly I saw a middle-aged woman sleeping with her two children on the footpath. The children were naked. One of the children was sleeping almost on the road. I wish our government would take effective steps for reducing poverty. We always hear from the government about eliminating poverty but in reality we do not see any change. The government should find effective ways to rehabilitate the poor.//////The people of Newtown, soon to be joined by President Barack Obama, poured into churches yesterday to pray for the 20 children and seven adults slaughtered in one of the worst ever US shooting massacres.//////The children gunned down at an elementary school along with six adults were six and seven years old, police said Saturday.//////Japan's conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) surged back to power in an election yesterday just three years after a devastating defeat, giving ex-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a chance to push his hawkish security agenda and radical economic recipe.//////Two senior US Democrats yesterday called for stricter gun control following the elementary school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.//////Immediately after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh lashed out at the critics of FDI in retail, saying their opposition was constrained by outdated ideologies, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee hit back, claiming that she belonged to the grass roots and was outdated.//////Iran's army chief of staff warned Nato on Saturday that stationing Patriot anti-missile batteries on Turkey's border with Syria was setting the stage for world war.//////Indian infrastructure firm GMR will seek a compensation of over $800 million from Maldives for the termination of its airport deal here but Male is insisting on a forensic audit as it feels the actual amount would be less than half.//////India will open a consulate at Sittwe, a sea port on the Myanmarese flank of the Bay of Bengal, becoming the first country to have three missions in the country. //////The death toll from a typhoon that devastated the southern Philippines earlier this month has topped 1,000 as hundreds more remain missing, the government said yesterday.//////Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik yesterday blamed Indian security agencies for their failure to prevent the Mumbai terror attack and alleged that Indian non-state actors were involved in the massacre.//////North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un led thousands of officials yesterday in a memorial ceremony for his late father and ex-ruler Kim Jong-Il, days after a successful long-range rocket launch.//////Six people were killed yesterday as police and troops battled militants armed with automatic weapons, grenades and mortars in northwest Pakistan's Peshawar, a day after a deadly Taliban raid on the city's airport.//////An avalanche on the high-altitude Siachen glacier that is disputed between India and Pakistan killed at least six Indian soldiers yesterday when their outpost was swept away before dawn.//////The body of an Indian-born nurse who was found hanged after taking a hoax call to the hospital treating Prince William's wife arrived in Mangalore yesterday following a memorial mass in London.//////Hosni Mubarak, the ousted Egyptian president who is serving a life sentence, has suffered a head injury and bruising after he fell in the bathroom.//////Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamid bin Khalifa al-Thani will visit Ramallah for his first ever trip to the West Bank later this month, Palestinian officials said yesterday.//////Voters in the Japanese capital Tokyo yesterday elected the political heir of nationalist politician Shintaro Ishihara, rejecting a candidate strongly endorsed by anti-nuclear activists, reports said.//////Fijian authorities scrambled to evacuate tourists and residents in low-lying areas yesterday as a monster cyclone threatened the Pacific nation with "catastrophic damage" after causing devastation in Samoa.//////Marking 41st Victory Day, different organisations and institutions chalked out elaborate programmes at various parts of the capital and across the country.

He is Bishwajit Das. On the previous day, he had celebrated the victory of Bangladesh cricket team. In a matter of few hours, he was lying on the ground, writhing in agony, botched up by the young men. In day light, in a street in the capital, and in front of the police and many bystanders, after being repeatedly attacked with meat-chopper and heavy blows and trodden under their feet and soaked in his own blood he finally yielded to death. Did Biswajit ever dream of such a fate in this journey from ecstasy to groan in a matter of a few hours?//////How well do India and Bangladesh know each other?//////To know him was a privilege and to be taught by him was a good fortune, and working with him as a colleague was simply an added advantage. //////
