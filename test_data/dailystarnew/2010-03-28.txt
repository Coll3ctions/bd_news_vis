Over the years, its encouragement of Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land has stalled any move toward a settlement. Add to that its erection of a wall designed to keep Arabs away from the settlers. Overall, the delaying tactics it has regularly adopted in the matter of arriving at a two-state solution have kept emotions alive, to a point where its own backers in the West now find themselves in a state annoyance. And matters are not helped at all by clear Israeli complicity in the murder of a Palestinian politician in Dubai recently. The recent expulsion of an Israeli diplomat in London by the British authorities over a forgery of British passports that would camouflage the killers is a broad hint of the levels to which Israel has stooped in defence of its questionable national interest.//////So telling have been the effects of mismanagement, corruption and malpractice on the service delivery of Dhaka Medical College Hospital that it has acquired a forbidding image, like it or not.

Recently, this has been labelled as one of the most unliveable cities in the world by 'The Economist'. The common problems of Dhaka city are traffic jam, load shedding, water & sanitation, air pollution, accommodation crisis of increasing population and many more. Most of them get media coverage from time to time. Regrettably, some get little attention when the problem is acute. Of them accommodation problem has been severe over the past years as house rent has been doubled & in some cases tripled causing immense sufferings to the low & limited income people. Since the income of maximum people is not increasing keeping pace with ever soaring price of essential commodities and house rent, it is getting so difficult to survive for the poor city dwellers in the increasingly expensive Dhaka city. Hence, the number of slum dwellers bears the testimony to soaring house rent. //////The geographic location and geomorphic conditions of Bangladesh have made the country highly vulnerable to sea level rise. It will increase salinity in the coastal areas. As a result, agricultural productivity will be decreased and coastal economy will break down. Not only this but also coastal people have to suffer due to lack of fresh water. World Bank (2000) showed 10 cm, 25cm and 1m rise in sea level by 2020, 2050 and 2100; affecting 2%, 4% and 17.5% of total land mass respectively. As a result, we will lose Sundarbans (the largest mangrove forest in the world) which is rich in biodiversity and five lakh people will lose the means of income. There will be 20 million climate refugees and the Bangladesh government has no capability to resettle them. //////It is known to us that the country's second highest foreign currency earner is the shrimp industry. Through this industry the government earns a huge amount of money each year. This sector not only earns money but also employs 12 lakh people in ten thousands shrimp farms. //////In Bangladesh hardly anything is in order. We are living in a highly disorderly situation. But there are areas where order can be restored by putting in small efforts. And the gain will be fabulous, as it will solve the problem of a larger section of people and that too for a considerable period of time. One such disorderly area is discriminatory "bus fare" charged by the bus operators in some routes. One such route is "AzimpurBanani /beyond route". On this route several bus companies operate under different names. The prominent ones are--"VIP 27/A (mini-bus/coaster)", "Anik","Suchana" and Suchana-A/C". //////As one who has been intimately associated with the Hill Tracts, especially Bandarban, for nearly 60 years, the recent tragic events are a sad reminder of the unabated exploitation, suppression, oppression, broken and unimplemented pledges and denial of justice, to which the tribes that inhabit the Hill Tracts, have been subjected to, by the uncontrolled injection of hordes of plains land people, the apathy of successive governments over 60 years and the progressive destruction of their distinct language and culture.//////A staff reporter's news item along with a photograph alongside it, gave a totally wrong location of the accident, in a local English daily of 16 March! The report stated the location as "near the Gulshan Shooting Club" while the photograph mentioned the location as "Kadamtuli" in Gulshan.//////BCL leaders' activities have tarnished the image of Eden College. //////DST did not become popular for a number of reasons. First of all, it did not solve the load shedding problem, it merely shifted it towards mid night which is more inconvenient. And secondly, time of prayer according to DST became highly irrational.//////US President Barack Obama has very rightly said -There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other; to learn from one another; and to seek common ground.//////Any discussion on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman gets weighted down with superlatives. His unrivalled contribution to the birth of Bangladesh has established Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the father of the Bengali Nation. The moment the grand figure of Bangabandhu rises before us, the question presents itself: What is his relevance today and for the future of Bangladesh? What inspiration can we draw from his life? What radiance can his thought and wisdom shed on our problems? How does his way of life affect our course of action in public affairs? That Bangabandhu is relevant today and for centuries to come is not in doubt at all. //////The other day I went walking at the parliament house area as I usually do. Normally I go walking between 6:00 and 7:00pm. But that day I was a bit late. It was around 9:00pm and that made me experience a weird situation.//////I refer to Mr. Nikhil Ranjan Das's letter dated 12 March 2010 and regret to differ with what he wrote about a fantastic cricketer of this country who has recently failed to perform . Like Mr. Das, I have played cricket alongside many of our older national cricketers and watched cricket in Dhaka for nearly six decades.//////It has been reported in a national daily that 4 private airline operators have eaten up the passengers' travel tax, which was supposed to be paid to the govt.//////It is a matter of grave concern as we read reports of harassment, killings of Bangladeshis and intrusion by BSF into our territory while the government remains tight lipped. Sovereignty and territorial integrity are matters of great importance. Rather than replying to a question from a MP on this matter, the home minister should have been proactive in briefing countrymen on the status of negotiations, protests and actions being taken in this matter. I can not help but notice that these incidents have increased in frequency recently - when we have high hopes and enthusiasm about our relations with the good neighbour India. Let us not prejudge or mistrust any incidents, but, we need to be vigilant as history is full of examples where good deeds have been followed by great acts of betrayal. I am not old enough to forget Munich 1938 and Nazi-Soviet Pact 1939. A treaty is only as good as the underlying intentions of parties behind it. Good neighbours do not need treaties between them. I request the government to explain when these actions from our neighbour are going to end. //////Our industrial sector is facing a critical period at this moment. This sector needs to be diversified. Export should not be dependent on a few products and services. We have ample opportunity to develop our agro-based industries as we have an agrarian economic structure. It will help absorb our large unskilled and semi-skilled workers. We have achieved great development in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, RMG, shrimp, leather etc. We have a very large workforce which is the most important ingredient for our economic development. The world is turning into a more knowledge based, technology oriented economic structure. All the outsourcing and manufacturing activities are shifting to the developing countries like India and China. As we are the neighbour of India and China and we have the same cultural framework like India, why will we not be able to grab those opportunities. So, the govt. should provide proper guidelines, required infrastructure, power and energy. Proper planning and management programmes should also be undertaken and implemented by the govt. so that more employment opportunities are created which will ensure productivity and economic development.//////Arab leaders opened their summit yesterday determined to send a clear warning that the Middle East peace process is doomed unless Israel freezes Jewish settlements in annexed east Jerusalem.//////Former premier Iyad Allawi yesterday began talks, which could last months to form a government after narrowly edging out incumbent Nuri al-Maliki in Iraq's parliamentary elections.//////Thai troops retreated from security posts in the capital yesterday, bowing to demands from 80,000 jubilant red-shirted protesters who mounted a rally to demand fresh elections.//////Imposing more sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme is not the best option, but it cannot be excluded, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday.//////Twin bombings in the Iraqi city of Khales, northeast of Baghdad, killed 52 people and wounded 73 others on Friday, security and medical officials said, updating an earlier casualty toll.//////Sydney's iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge went dark yesterday at the start of Earth Hour, followed by cities across Asia in a global switch-off aimed at revitalising efforts against climate change.//////Italy's postal service intercepted a threatening letter containing a bullet addressed to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, while letter bomb sent to a minister caught fire, police said Saturday.//////Almost 50 sailors were missing after a South Korean warship sank near the tense border with North Korea, the military said Saturday, but officials said there was no sign so far the North was to blame.//////The US First Lady Michelle Obama has topped the list of best celebrity mothers in a poll conducted by babble.com, says a report.//////Malaysia's influential former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said yesterday he was concerned that increasing racial friction could destabilise the multi-ethnic country.//////Senior BJP leader and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi yesterday appeared before a probe committee appointed by India's Supreme Court to look into his alleged role in communal riots in the state in 2002.//////Myanmar's junta chief warned political parties to behave while campaigning for historic elections later this year, noting yesterday that the armed forces can take part in politics "whenever the need arises."//////The government offices in Lalgarh have been closed yesterday following operation 'Green Hunt' by the state and central forces in West Bengal.//////India successfully tested two short-range nuclear-capable missiles from two sites off its eastern coast on Saturday, a defence ministry official said.//////Pakistani airstrikes killed 11 suspected insurgents yesterday in a tribal region near the Afghan border, an official said, bringing the total killed in a military offensive there to more than 100 this week.//////Pakistan on Friday rejected suggestions that it has quietly supported Taliban elements in Afghanistan and pledged to work to bring stability in its northwestern neighbour.//////India's legal and judicial system reflects 'great contradiction', Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Saturday urging that the justice delivery mechanism needed to be expedited to strengthen the country's democratic roots.//////Pakistani political leaders are still grappling with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif's last minute 'U-turn' over the constitutional reforms package and are trying to find out as to what exactly had prompted Sharif for his sudden move.//////Banglalink organised a mega concert on March 26, with artistes from Jagoroner Shangsthritikcharcha O Gobeshona Kendra(JSOGK) along with the leading bands of the country, to celebrate Jagoroner Gaan, as a tribute to the revolutionary heritage of Bangladesh through music.//////In a bid to promote and disseminate their album Chetonay Swadheen Bangla Betar Kendrer Shruto Aar Bishruto Kichhu Gaan amongst the post-Independence generation, Close-up and ntv jointly organised a live concert.

And yet a degree of caution must be in place as we go through them, indeed as we try to fashion them to our moral and intellectual expectations. All these expectations are wrapped around the tribunal that is now finally in place for a trial of the war criminals of 1971. The central idea here is one of a dispensation of justice. It is not and has never been one of vengeance. Those who today speak of a witchhunt in the name of war crimes are carefully trying to divert the course of justice and subvert the need for ethics in politics. //////MEDECINS San Frontiers (MSF), an international aid agency, has accused Bangladesh of launching a violent crackdown recently against the unregistered Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.//////PRESIDENT Barack Obama sent the following email to his supporters on the night of March 21, after the US House of Representative passed the same bill that the US Senate had passed in December 2009.//////INDIA and Pakistan are going further and further from each other. In any case, they have never been normal neighbours. But after the attack on Mumbai some 15 months ago, both are intentionally moving apart. Dtente is no more on their agenda. Recent talks between foreign secretaries of the two countries, more because of international pressure, have shown that they have no heart for normalising relations.//////
