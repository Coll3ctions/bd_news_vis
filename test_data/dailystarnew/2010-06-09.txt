We welcome the spirit in which she has made the move, given the fact that of late politics in Bangladesh has generally been caustic and stridently adversarial. The fact that the BNP has now come forth with suggestions that are positive and constructive will, we believe, serve the larger purpose of giving national politics a healthy aspect. While one may debate the points the BNP has made in its alternative budget, the truth remains that such a step happens to be the first of its kind in the history of Bangladesh's parliamentary opposition. That by itself is an indication that the kind of positive politics we have always looked forward to could indeed become a reality.//////A report based on minimum wage board sources appears quite revealing on important counts. First of all, a comparative analysis of pay structures for workers in ten industries clearly shows that the garment employees are among the lowest paid.

It also employs the highest number of women workers among all industries thereby adding on to women's empowerment.//////South Africa put the finishing touches to its World Cup preparations, rolling out the continent's first high-speed rail link on Tuesday, as organisers told critics it was time to put doubts aside.//////WORLD CUP 2006 PART III//////The host nation was by now rapt by a belief of ultimate victory with the chant "Berlin, Berlin, wir fahren nach Berlin (we're going to Berlin)" now sung in full voice.

The police have also found in their possession huge bomb making materials, jihadi booklets and sketches of grenades and rifles.

Are there not other urgent issues to worry about in Bangladesh? Can the new airports, bridges and structures not be named after one of them? When the Awami League is in power, all the projects and schemes are named only after the Bangabandhu family members. When the BNP is in power, all the projects and schemes are named only after the Zia family members. //////Kishoreganj is one of the most undeveloped and neglected areas of our country, although it has great contributions in the sectors like agriculture, politics and literature. Nobody can deny its great contributions to our economy. The district is surrounded by seven districts and the area has a huge population. In these circumstances, it is necessary to establish a public university in this district town. The government can turn the Gurudoyal College into a university. It has an excellent and big campus. The government may also select a new place near the town.//////It is a very good initiative of the government to open the Ahsanullah Master Flyover to reduce traffic Jam.//////Once the moral code or value got the highest priority in our society, but today it is on the verge of extinction! A family teaches morality, standard of decent life but the parents these days are doing nothing in this area. //////In today's world, many teenagers live in a virtual universe, in which face to face communication rarely occurs, and in which friends are made and kept via social networking websites and via mobile phones. This is definitely not good news on any level - emotional, social or psychological. A very frequent use of mobile phones can cause stress and sleep problems in teens, as well as what is called a 'careless' lifestyle including disrupted sleep, insomnia and frequent energy drink consumption. Teenagers normally have to get a minimum of nine hours of sleep per night, something that doesn't occur when mobile phone usage becomes abusive. In fact, frequently speaking on the phone makes adolescents even more susceptible to things such as stress and fatigue.//////In the devastating fire at Nimtoli in Old Dhaka, at least 117 people have died and hundreds are injured, many of them are in critical condition.

I am among those people who are striving for peace, happiness and security of women. Our Prophet (Pbuh) asked his companions in his farewell sermon to behave kindly and mercifully with women. Giving them honour and security is a top priority of Islam. After reading his article, I get the impression that he believes that women should not be allowed to wear veil.//////Not only does eve teasing shatters the victim psychologically leading to mental disorders or depression, this humiliation often compels the girl to even commit suicide. Society and the administration also try to cast aspersions on the character of the victim, instead of condemning or nabbing the eve teasers. In this sorry state of affairs, it is hardly surprising that scores of victims do not lodge any complaint.//////A scholarly and rather abstract, short essay on the subject was published on May 29, in a local daily, but it did not suggest any solution. However, an alternative solution does exist. I believe that an NGO has already installed such a plant in a village, as published in a daily, a few days back. The speedy implementation of this alternative solution rather needs to be discussed in parliament; and not our gas shortage today, which is another issue altogether!//////Just now I have finished reading a touchy article written by the celebrated singer Runa Laila wherein she made a fervent appeal to all to help cure a four and a half years old little girl Tanha, who has been suffering from blood cancer.
