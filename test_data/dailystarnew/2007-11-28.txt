I was coming back from my university on a bus which was quite crowded as usual. We were waiting in a traffic signal as well as several vehicles including a big old pick-up carrying a big load of books just beside our bus. Two men where sitting on top of the books. Suddenly, when the green light appeared the pickup turned to the right side and the part which was carrying the book fell down resulting in all the books being allover the street. The fist guy was able to jump out of the mess but the second guy couldn't make that much. So he was under the burden of thousands of books. As we were right beside them, I thought we were going to run over on the second guy. I closed my eyes, but our driver was quite witty and managed to pull over. Our bus stopped there and all the people from our bus were struggling with each other to have a better look of the accident from the bus. I saw the traffic police and few local people rushed down to help the guy but as it were thousands of books they were not able to help the guy at all.
