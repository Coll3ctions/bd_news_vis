Such a reaction not only reveals a lack of information but also reflects a lack of basic understanding of what went on in the climate conference; indeed, what was the climactic inter-play of international diplomatic currents and cross-currents that shaped the final outcome as it emerged. //////IN a fairly representative dialogue held on Wednesday, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) engaged with the agriculture minister and the deputy minister, the senior joint secretary of BNP and a sprinkling of parliamentarians, agriculturists, economists, members of farmer organisations and bureaucrats to put across some recommendations on food security in a particular context.//////WITH the country racked by political infighting, prices of food items shooting up, and inflation mounting, the news item that some 30,000 Bangladeshi workers from Kuwait and thousands others from Oman are being repatriated is most disquieting. During the last 11 months, some 68,000 Bangladeshis working in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia returned to Bangladesh and about 2121 working in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia died. //////THE outcome of the Copenhagen Summit is just a few loose pillars on which we have to build our safe home. We will have to make sure that these pillars get tightened as quickly as possible, by making a legally binding agreement. The 193-nation conference ended with delegates simply "taking note" of a US led climate deal that included limiting temperature rises to less than 20C. The vast majority countries wanted a legally binding treaty to protect the planet. //////Ten-man Mohammedan handed a 3-0 defeat to visiting Chittagong Abahani to maintain their winning streak in the

It featured a former Magistrate who gained enormous respect for his dedicated effort aimed at combating this pernicious practice. Participants discussed about the use of different toxic materials and chemical agents that were contaminating food items. This included the use of deadly formalin for the preservation of fruit, fresh fish and sometimes even milk. Mention was also made of the use of the insecticide DDT by some producers of dried fish. Towards the end of the programme some footage was also shown about how some people in the Sadarghat and Chowk Bazar areas in Dhaka had been caught while filling water directly from the tap into plastic containers with forged labels. Apparently they were subsequently sealing these bottles with unsafe water and marketing them as safe drinking water to unwary customers.//////IT'S like a haunted region where people's lives are consigned to fate and mass people's deaths are consigned to oblivion.

She caught a glance of Nathan. Still in his pajamas, he was helping himself to a cup of coffee. He looked so innocent yet mischievous with his evil grin. //////As the mercury steadily dropped, the chill in the air felt starkly different from the fiery situation prevailing everywhere across the country. This was early February, the year 1971. The mass upsurge of 1969 followed by the non-cooperation movement in 1971 against the Pakistani regime had pushed the country to a point of no return. //////This past October, the short documentary Woman Rebel by 25-year old director, producer and photographer Kiran Deol was short-listed for the Oscars (otherwise known as the Academy Awards here in the United States). This is an outstanding achievement for a young South-Asian American woman, who only graduated from Harvard University in 2005. (There will be a second round of voting in February to decide the final nominations; out of eight short-listed documentaries, five will get the nomination.) The day after her graduation in 2005, Deol left Cambridge, Massachusetts, and got on a plane to Nepal to film her documentary. Deol wrote her creative honours thesis about a female Nepalese soldier, as a novel on the advice of Jamaica Kincaid, the acclaimed Antiguan novelist who teaches fiction writing at Harvard. This creative writing project formed the basis of inspiration for her endeavour: from extensive fund-raising and with help and support from her friends and family, Deol began her next, more difficult journey, alone, to Nepal to fulfill her dream. Deol's story, as much as her film, is extraordinary. She says her South Asian roots, along with her passion to tell the truth, kept her connected with issues of women in this distant, remote area of the world. She has always been interested in exploring the plight of Third World women and their position in oppressed societies. Upon arrival in Nepal, Deol wrote the screenplay and started filming.//////You are the artist//////You are more than a poet,//////More than a sculptor, painter or whatever!//////You are all in one.//////Fever is bodys defense against intruders. In maximum cases, it usually lasts for three to five days. However, the causes of fever in certain cases are hard to pin down and the duration may be prolonged enough to cause unbearable suffering. Knowing the general approach to identify the cause may help your doctor to reach early diagnosis and can lessen the intractable infliction.//////Autism is a severe developmental disorder that begins at birth or within the first two-and-a-half years of life. Most autistic children are perfectly normal in appearance, but spend their time engaged in puzzling and disturbing behaviours which are markedly different from those of typical children.//////After nearly sixteen years, I recently travelled Bangladesh and stayed more than three weeks-travelling, meeting people and examining the immense changes in Bangladesh. I had the opportunity to view not through the eyes of a tourist, but through the eyes of an experienced healthcare scientist who felt and saw the tremendous accomplishments that Bangladesh has been made despite all negative movement. I was amazed seeing all signs of a robust and thriving economy.//////Cinnamon has a long history both as a masala (spice) and as a medicine.

Despite across the board acknowledgement by all the 193 attending nations that global warming is a common and impending threat to mankind, the Conference failed to adopt a binding agreement. Instead, the outcome of two weeks of intense negotiation has been a non-binding document named Copenhagen Accord, ironically put together by five of the biggest polluters, namely the United States, China, India, Brazil and South Africa and brokered by the US President Barak Obama. It has been more frustrating for majority of the developing nations because they went to Copenhagen following two years of hard work since the Bali Conference in 2007, confident that they had been able to place before the big polluters enough scientific evidence to encourage them to adopt a binding document on global warming.//////PAKISTAN'S judiciary was generally perceived as subservient to the executive, whether it was under political or military leadership. Political leaders such as the late Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto, .Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif were as arbitrary and as ruthless in imposing their will on the judiciary as Gen.Zia-ul-Haq and Gen. Musharraf were. It goes to the credit of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry that he broke from this past habit of subservience. //////Indian and Israeli defense officials and top planners met here Dec. 22 to discuss ways to increase defense ties, boost counter-terror efforts and share intelligence.//////Russia has agreed to prospective new sanctions, which China will also adopt eventually, to punish Iran's failure to accept foreign scrutiny of its nuclear program, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said December 21.//////Abdul Matin's interest in history and in Bangladesh has never wavered. As an expatriate, he has found little reason not to reflect on what has been happening in the home country he left long ago to make a home in the West. From the distance of London he has, with something of determination and with a huge deal of principle, focused on the need to set the history of Bangladesh in the proper perspective. That Matin was on his way to being a commentator on Bangladesh came through as far back as the early 1970s, when he ventured into a work that was to emerge as Geneva-e Bangabandhu. He has come a long way since then. And in all the works he has come forth with thus far, Matin has deemed it refreshingly necessary to play by the rules. And that has consisted in adding to the substance of his works through bringing documentary evidence into it.//////Kit McMahon lived in the quiet Irish country of Lough Glass. Here everyone knew each other. Childhood sweethearts grew up amidst laughter and tears and married. Kit was at the end of her high school. Her life wound around her family, her best friend Clio and the other friendly neighbours. Sister Madeleine, the hermit living in a rundown cottage, was fond of Kit and always welcomed her. Philip O'Brien, her childhood pal, had loved her from very early childhood. To an outsider Kit's life may have seemed charming. But in the midst of all these seemingly good things Kit was deeply troubled by her mother Helen McMahon. //////No, the woman wasn't made of stone but the stone showed fading traces of a woman who probably was a pagan goddess.
