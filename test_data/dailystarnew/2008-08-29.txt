We had earlier commented on this, bringing out its positive aspects and suggesting exactly where it could still be perfected. //////THE pavements along the city streets are in a most chaotic state, unkempt, craggy, and worst of all, occupied by squatting vendors, shop-fronts, ticket counters, welding gears, bits and pieces of construction materials, fallen rubbish from house-tops, and sometimes, sewer spillage from manholes. Add to this, the diminishing ledges or shoulders of thoroughfares, the pedestrians have nowhere to go. Thousands of walking people are an integral part of city traffic but that being congested all around, the pedestrians look for elbow room on the pavements. But the pavements meant exclusively as walk-ways have lost their character, so the pedestrians get thrown back on to the streets.//////THE drive from the airport to the Santika Hotel takes about 45 minutes, and, as with all other drives to the heart of a capital city, is a decent introduction to a new country. Jakarta, I could not help but note, certainly seems closer to Dhaka in terms of development and third world chaos than, say, a city like Bangkok.//////WHAT has happened to the dissenting voices, people who disagree to agree and speak their minds in the face of mortal challenge? The whole world believed that the sun revolved around the earth until one Nicolaus Copernicus proposed his contrary hypothesis. People of ancient Arabia indulged in idolatry and the Prophet of Islam proclaimed that Allah was the one and only God. When one Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses on the church door, the Catholic Church proved critically flawed. //////FIRST Principles" (August 18) touches on scores of issues but I'll focus on curriculum and what Prof. Anwarul Huque describes as" adherence to universal child-friendly pedagogic treatments" and "real school working days."

Its teachers, fearing violence, lock the doors of their campus homes. //////I bought some fish from Karwan Bazar wholesale market and found that formalin had been applied to it. I bought fish several times in the past and the same thing happened every time. Who is responsible for this? I think traders are taking the chance as there is nobody to check the matter.//////Lionel Messi, Argentina's modern Maradona, once again has showed his sublime skills in the Beijing Olympic. But his appearance in the greatest show on earth was in uncertainty, and the fans could have missed the chance to enjoy the performance of this brilliant playmaker.//////When I heard that Cox's Bazar and Sundarbans were nominated to be among the new seven natural wonders of the world, I felt great! I have already voted for the two spots. Last year many people, including Bangladeshi celebrities, walked more than 100 kilometers along the seashore from Teknaf to Cox's Bazar. If I had been there at the time, I would have liked to join them. Travel is my number one hobby. On many occasions I had the chance to travel to many countries, which I did in Asia, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. Tourism is a huge industry, many countries earn billions of dollars though this business and thousands of jobs are created. First of all, we have to understand the key ingredients of this business. Nowadays nobody travels like Ibne Botuta, everybody is busy working. Here in Toronto, I have been working for a corporation for quite a few years. In my office every 7 or 8 weeks, people take a week off to reenergize and break free from their daily routine that they are tired of. Although we work for 40 hours Monday to Friday and it's not hard manual work but I still get bored. Sometimes I take my annual leave for the whole year, 6 weeks all together and go to Bangladesh, they never think about doing it that way. In the summertime they go north to their cottage, down to a resort in the Caribbean, or on a cruise for a week. They always make plans for their next vacation a month ahead. This is the western lifestyle, in Europe, America, Australia and Japan, the lifestyle is very similar. Travel agents provide us with brochures, so people will know which country costs how much and can choose their own affordable vacation.//////I wish to share my thoughts with you on the problems of traffic jam in Dhaka city. To be honest, the road network in Dhaka is not scientifically designed. Most of the junctions are responsible for heavy traffic jam. It will take a long time and a lot of money to take care of that problem. Meanwhile, we have to make the best use of the roads we have by bringing some small changes and enforcing discipline on the road.//////Tarique Rahman got hurt in police custody, and some BNP-linked students on DU campus demonstrated for his immediate release. They put taxicabs on fire, and an innocent man was killed at Nilkhet. The same type of violence was seen near Dhaka College also. What will happen to the families of the person who was 'killed'? And what about those who lost their earning capability by losing their taxicabs?//////An economist recently observed that Bangladesh was galloping forward on the economic front. Iraq is galloping away at 7% GDP growth rate (faster than Bangladesh ever did).//////We, the students of SUST, are facing serious shortage of seats in the halls. Will the university authorities look into the matter?//////I read with a great deal of interest Dr. Ahmad Islam's article entitled "Hoodlums reign", published in The Daily Star on Friday, August 22, 2008. This article has spoken the minds of millions of concerned citizens residing in Dhaka as most of them have directly ort indirectly experienced horrific situations in the hands of criminals, similar to those narrated by Dr. Islam. This is a subject of great national concern for all peace-loving people. We hope that, as Dr. Islam urged, the government will address this situation on a priority basis. The development and progress of a nation cannot be measured just by the economic index or the technological advancement - - there has to be a certain level of peace, security and social stability for a nation to be considered progressive and to earn the trust and respect of the world community, especially the foreign governments and investors whom we need so badly as our development partners.//////The group of companies and the business houses controlling the prices in the country should come forward and declare voluntarily prior to the month of Ramadan that they would do business in this special month with minimum profit. //////This is in reference to the letter published in The Daily Star on August 10, 2008 from an apartment owner who described his predicament after buying an apartment from one of the very well known builders. As another sufferer, I would like to express my bitter experience on my way to becoming an apartment owner that is being built by a low-profile builder. //////Much debate has recently been going on regarding the recently promulgated RPO (Amended) 1972 Ordinance. Some provisions in the RPO may face legal challenges and some are difficult to be implemented by the political parties due to time constraint. For instance, the new electoral rules had given an opportunity for the loan defaulting contestants to participate in the upcoming polls through rescheduling of their loans six months prior to the submission of application for candidacy. //////Niketon residential area has been developed fast with many high-rise buildings near Gulshan. Its population is more than 150 thousand. A well-known real state company has developed the area near Gulshan residential area with an aspiration that the inhabitants will get the opportunity of sharing the facilities of its neighbourhood. They, however, did not provide facilities like playground, roads and drainage system etc. After a little rain, the entire area is inundated and the condition has worsened during the rainy season.//////It is quite clear that the Russian authorities were displaying their capacity to commit brutal acts against humanity through their invasion of Georgia. Their aggression not only questions diplomatic norms, but such behaviour is in essence against world peace and it reminds us of the German occupation of Poland which resulted in World War II. As a member of the global community,we must denounce such military aggression and as a human being I send my helpless condolences to the families of those who have lost their loved ones. We hope Russia will withdraw its troops from the occupied Georgian territory and respect the recent diplomatic negotiations. Moreover, the world community must act so that such military aggression is prevented in future. If they fail to do so, then the sovereignty of many small democratic nations will be at stake and this will undermine the values nurturing freedom, democracy and humanity.//////Joe Biden was announced as the running mate of presidential candidate Barack Obama on August 23, 2008.

Accountability of the PPs is to the people, and on the basis of the said purpose. Ownership of the PPs has to lie with the masses to ensure that. //////I am writing today to pay respect to Senator Edward Kennedy, popularly known as Ted Kennedy, not because he fired up Democrats at the opening session of the National convention of the Democratic Party on August 25 in Denver, but because for his dedication to just causes and justice to the people of the United States in particular and the world at large. //////BEFORE the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, I wrote about economic models that aimed to pre-empt thousands of hours of television coverage, sappy features, and tape-delayed tension. John Hawksworth of PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Andrew Bernard of Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business both aimed to predict national medal hauls based on factors like home-field advantage, the size and growth of national economies, and past political affiliations. //////TAP water is not only better than bottled water -- but it's healthier than filtered water, too.

The question is, how do we go about starting our search for that dream job? Today, with all the numerous job sites available in Bangladesh, you no longer need to depend on references from relatives, or hunt through several newspapers. All you need is the qualification and the determination to go get it.//////The Nokia N96 was launched in Bangladesh in a unique event heralding a new dawn in convergence. //////When I first heard about cuil.com (pronounced 'cool-dot-com'), I did two things.
