people who trade or hoard international aid as the cyclone's death toll soared above 43,000.//////THE Local Government and Rural Development (LGRD) ministry has taken an appreciable step towards providing citizens access to information in various local bodies operating under it. Such a move is in consonance with democratic principles and practices everywhere and we believe the LGRD has only done what we in a democratic dispensation should have had much earlier. The draft provisions in question relate to the city corporations and municipalities, providing for citizens to ask for and be given information on issues of public interest. We would like to think that it is the first, positive step in what will be an expanding field of rights citizens will eventually come to enjoy. What matters now, in these early stages, is for the government to ensure that the measure is implemented in full without any bureaucratic or political impediments coming in the way.//////CLOSELY on the heels of railway accidents taking a toll of lives at railway crossings, we now have the Upoban Express headed for Sylhet hitting the stationary Noakhali Express at Ashuganj from behind.

Three days after the eruption on Dhaka University campus last August, 42,000 people were charged with disturbance of peace and vandalism across the country. Recently, the remains of a security guard have been recovered from the wreckage of Rangs Bhaban, five months after the building collapsed. Since mass indictment is the order of the day, I have been thinking about it for some time. Why not sue the 150 million people of this country and then indict this government?//////GLOBAL growth is also responsible for some of the biggest problems in the world right now. It has produced tons of money -- what businesspeople call liquidity -- that moves around the world. The combination of low inflation and lots of cash has meant low interest rates, which in turn have made people act greedily and/or stupidly. So we have witnessed over the last two decades a series of bubbles -- in East Asian countries, technology stocks, housing, subprime mortgages, and emerging market equities. //////Abahani easily made it three wins in a row against their traditional rivals this season as Mohammedan's batting dipped from bad to worse in the crucial Premier Cricket Super League match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////Bangladesh Biman remained firm at the top of the Premier League with a clinical 69-run victory over BKSP while Surjo Torun posted their first win in the Super League yesterday.//////The professional league clubs finally accepted the proposal of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) for relegation in this year's B.

He was expected to bring further luck to a team that had strung together a hattrick of wins after enduring four straight losses and his partnership with Sanath Jayasuriya at the top of the Mumbai Indians' batting line-up was a much awaited spectacle.

It's an interesting reminiscence and deserves appreciation. Many of those who attended cadet colleges would agree that most of the points in the article reflect their own views. But those who didn't may argue that the success of various professionals and the country as a whole should not be judged by the excellence of a few cadet colleges attended mostly by the affluent and bright students (the name 'Cadet College' may be a misnomer, since a college is known to offer degrees; even in neighbouring India similar institutions are known as Sainik Schools). It is the uplifting of the educational levels of general mass students - a challenging task indeed - that largely determines the image of Bangladesh.//////The cultivation of predatory fish is increasing day by day. Almost all of the predatory fishes are exotic and carnivore in nature. They survive well in adverse conditions and the growth rate of these fish is higher than that of other fishes. So, fish farmers are cultivating predatory fish species. But some of the predatory fishes, especially Piranha (Serrasalmus Niger), is very dangerous for living beings and also the aquatic environment and the ecosystem of the water body.//////Shiekh Hasina has rightly said that she must contest in the upcoming election. Hold a minute and remember when an ominous uncertainty was looming on the horizon right before 1/11 last year, people under the bold leadership of Sheikh Hasina thwarted the evil design.//////A pathetic news report with a picture published in your daily on 29April drew my attention. The picture carried the news that a Palestinian 15-month old boy, Mussab, was killed along with his mother and three siblings by Israeli tank fire outside their house in Beit Hanun, as they prepared to sit down for breakfast. //////The 21st century is playing games with civilisation. Crisis governance is the style of the decade. Start with the superpower US. The theme for the coming presidential election is change; plus two new formats: a woman contesting; and a minority leader. Add a big deciding factor: the no confidence in the USD, world's only global currency.//////I would like to refer to the above tender which is very vital and crucial for Bangladesh economy. The decision on exploring 28 blocks at a time is risky.//////The CA instructed the DCs to start groundwork for the next general election. I believe that the DCs and the civil administration have little scope to do any "groundwork" for the election. The voter registration process is almost complete, we are told. The EC is lecturing us every day on election. Their appearance on TV is very regular indeed. Common people, politicians and private citizens have no role at present. //////Some young BAF pilots died in plane crashes.

I think as a citizen I have the right to know what (if any) action the authorities concerned have taken against these killers. They are putting at stake the lives of thousands of citizens across the country for making profit. //////Recently, Sheikh Hasina was trying to prove Dr. Kamal Hossain as black money holder simply because Dr. Hossain did not try to save the corrupt politicians. In fact, Dr. Kamal Hossain is the greatest threat to the black money owners and if anybody calls him a black money holder, he/she is not serving the truth. Do not forget that Hasina's AL and Khaleda's BNP made Bangladesh the number one corrupt country in the world. The corrupt prime ministers appointed corrupt ministers and high officials. Politicians and a vested quarter are openly trying to free Hasina and Khaleda and their corrupt collaborators without any trial. //////Can you presume how long this caretaker government will go on? I can! No specific duration of this government is mentioned in any law. Though the constitution has given the direction, but this government does not care for any constitutional order or provision. //////Technical Education holds the key to the tangible development of a country. Some 45 polytechnic and a few mono-technique institutes have been established for imparting technical education in Diploma Engineering level.
