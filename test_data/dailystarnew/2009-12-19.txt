The quality is in the timeliness of, and easy accessibility to, farm credits. To top it off, real farmers are being the beneficiaries with an outreach to the rural doorsteps. These features have had a multiplier effect with the marked increase in the volume of credit.//////E-parliaments provide better service delivery of parliaments to citizens of their respective country. For the Bangladesh Parliament, ICT can be used as a tool for greater transparency and accountability, and a platform for public consultation and interaction with citizens. A survey conducted by an international organisation, about e-parliaments and use of technology, finds that parliaments are increasingly using new technologies to reach people mostly in a passive way -- making more information available in different formats. Of the 90 countries surveyed, 77 stated they use ICT in some way to improve their work. They found disparity between the work done in the developing world and the developed world, but the hunger and desire for using new technologies is very strong in most of the developing countries.//////AWARE of my interest about Afghanistan, one of my friends recently presented me with a copy of ////// by Khaled Hosseini, an author of Afghan origin currently living in the United States. A bestseller (has sold more than two million copies), the book vividly portrays the social background of that war-torn country and the societal effects that has taken place over the last thirty years in Kabul and the adjoining regions, as a result of insurgency and terrorism. I hope President Obama has read it. It provides a rare insight into what is happening in Afghanistan and why.//////THE word "Nuclear" disallows people to not think deeply about its benefits. However, radioactive and stable isotopes are used peacefully throughout the world in many sectors, including agriculture, medicine, industry, and research. Isotopes are different types of atoms (nuclides) of the same chemical element, each having a different number of neutrons. In many applications, isotopes have no substitute and in most others, they are more effective and cheaper than alternative techniques or processes. About 50 countries have significant isotope production capacities, and many others have smaller capacities. //////It is all set for a humdinger of a final round in this season's Premier Cricket League as traditional rivals Abahani and Mohammedan will face off in the final round for the title.

In the slums of Dhaka city, tens of thousands of people shelter in huts made of cardboard with polythene roofs. There is no running water and no sanitation. The stench is overpowering: garbage and human waste heap up in piles. With 13 million residents -- up from 320,000 only 30 years ago -- Dhaka is considered the most populous urban centre on earth.//////I was Information Officer of the then India's Home Minister, Govind Ballabah Pant, when the Fazl Ali Commission submitted the report on Reorganization of States in 1954. While working on the proposals, Pant would often say why they had taken up the controversial task of redrawing the map of India first when there were so many urgent problems facing the country. Fifty five years later, the nation can rightly pose the same question to the rulers. In fact, the problems have increased: insurgency, terrorism, price rise or unemployment.//////CLOTHING items are certainly the most wanted and most sold ones during festivals like Eid and Puja. And those involved from manufacturing to trading of these are believed to make a hey day of the occasion. Promila Devi and her husband Nani Gopal Singha of Lala Dighir Par, Sylhet were also supposed to get a share of the bonanza, because they are very much in the process.//////Climate change resulting in sea level rise would cause severe environmental impact on the living resources including people and biodiversity in the affected areas. There are so many coast line associated islets and islands in the Bay of Bengal in the southern part of Bangladesh, e.g. Shandip of Chittagong, Shahpari and St. Martin of Teknaf, Kutubdia, Moheshkhali and Sonadia of Cox's Bazar and islets like Nijhumdip, Char Kukrimukri, Char Dale, Char Fashon, etc of Patuakhali, Barguna and Bhola districts. Lakhs of poor and homeless people live in these areas. Sea level rising 0.5-1m there will be catastrophic for these affected areas and people. They might need immediate shifting to nearby high lands. //////The Prime Minister of Denmark Mr. Lars Lkke Rasmussen said on Decemeber 07, at the beginning of the climate change conference (COP 15),  Copenhagen will be 'a city of hope' for the next two weeks (December 07-18) because of climate change conference. Dr. R.K. Pachauri, IPCC Chairman, urged the world to stand by Bangladesh. He has been able to show the world that Bangladesh is going to be a most-suffered victim of climate change. The British Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the Guardian: Copenhagen must be a turning point. Our children won't forgive us if we fail. We need to build a low carbon economy across the world, with a deal that helps developing nations and ensures trust. //////The west pacific islands [such as the Territory of Guam, Republic of Palau, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and American Samoa (Fig. 1), and other neighbouring islands are among the world's most vulnerable communities to climate variability and change, especially sea level rise, as many parts of these islands are regularly affected by erosion and inundation. The small size, lower elevations and extensive coastal areas of the islands, their remoteness and limited financial resources, and in some cases, poor economic and social decisions contribute to great ecosystem and human vulnerability to disasters.//////Surrealism has been a widely-used and often misused element in art and literature of the modern era. The misuse can solely be attributed to half-literacy of the users about what it is and how to apply it. Although the misconception is widespread on a global scale, a single example may confirm the low level of understanding about surrealism among our writers. In 2000, a national institution like Bangla Academy published an English version of the ////// with a noisy title 'Dictionary of Writers' (to mean directory of writers) in which the Bangla term ////// [meaning surrealism] was ridiculously translated as 'supernatural' in delineating the rhetorical features in the works of a poet. However, the Academy stopped circulation of the book immediately after its publication, this being a 'dictionary of errors'!//////We arrived at our son Salman's one bedroom apartment in Irvine last Tuesday. It was bright and sunny but quite cold for us just come to LA from Bangladesh. Temperatures of 16 max. and 6 min. Celsius. Irvine is in Orange County, reputedly the richest or one of the richest counties in the U.S. It's one of 90 cities that form the conurbation of what is known as Los Angeles. For us neophytes it is a bit difficult to comprehend that LA is not really a city in itself but a vast area comprised of so many satellite cities. Yes and why not? To put it in perspective Salman's home in Irvine is 80 miles distant from our daughter Tina's home up north, in Santa Clarita. That's the distance from Dhaka to Comilla!//////The butterfly used to fly in our garden //////With her strong wings of leadership;//////She beautifies the lives of neglected flowers//////But has gone too far recently leaving us!//////Under-nutrition and malnutrition in pregnancy period are the major problems in Bangladesh that threaten the health of both mother and their babies. Maintaining proper nutrition during pregnancy is specially considered to be of importance for the high prevalence of low birth weight, fetal growth retardation and perinatal death (death around birth period). Experts identified limited access to high quality foods, traditional food habits, food taboos and limited knowledge as the factors contribute to under-nutrition.//////A 30 year old woman Rupa Akhter (not a real name) is married for 10 years living in a village. She planned to complete the family with her existing 4 children. But all on a sudden, she became pregnant unintentionally and mistakenly that made her very upset. Like many women, it was a matter of embarrassment for her talking intervention in a hospital after consulting a physician. Six months latter, she went to a traditional birth attendant (locally known as Dai) who induced her abortion through inappropriate way. The result was very dreadful. She delivered a dead baby with retained placenta (which covers and protect the baby in womb). She died after few hours of reaching a Subdistrict (Thana) Health Complex due to server bleeding and many others complications.//////Will a gene bring healthful blessings or the curse of disease? It may depend on whether it is inherited from mom or dad, researchers reported recently.//////Straight-as-a-board upright posture that you may have been striving for in the interest of ergonomic correctness is not what it is cracked up to be, according to a research. The research was conducted at Woodend Hospital in Aberdeen, Scotland. The Scottish and Canadian team presented its findings to the Radiological Society of North America.//////ON 6th December, the Indian Prime Minister paid a three-day visit to Russia for the Annual Summit Meeting with the Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev.//////YEAR 2009 is not 1971. If India should not take Bangladesh for granted just because it helped the nation attain independence some forty years ago, Dhaka also cannot afford to ignore the facts of history and say today that New Delhi has done precious little for it. We cannot do away with either history or geography in so far as India and Bangladesh are concerned, and, therefore, the best way to move forward is to take pragmatic steps, taking into account the geo-politics and market forces. The question to ask at this juncture is whether the two prime ministers, Manmohan Singh and Sheikh Hasina, can manage to remove the trust deficit between the two South Asian neighbours and take Indo-Bangladesh relations to a real high. This question is more than valid because trust deficit between New Delhi and Dhaka is the main reason for the blow-hot-blow-cold relationship between these two most populous neighbours.//////Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama on December 13 held talks by phone to discuss a new accord on cutting nuclear arsenals, the Kremlin said in a statement.//////Local government can be termed as the linchpin of good governance for any modern state, specifically to attain political, economic and social welfare of the marginal groups of people within the state. It is vastly acknowledged in today's development paradigms that decentralization can be conducive to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) because local governments are presumed to have better information and higher rewards on the basis of which the central government can afford to plan and implement policies, thus responding to local needs and preemptions. It appears that the reasonable gaps between the political community and the civil society propagation of democratic decentralization are getting widened. They need to be bridged through sincere and stringent academic efforts. Mohammad Rafiqul Islam Talukdar, a young researcher, has brought forth a work relating to this particular arena in a modest way. In Rural Local Government in Bangladesh, Talukder has tried to touch upon a number of pertinent issues, such as democratic decentralization, gender mainstreaming in the local government and the regeneration of the upazila system. //////Shamsuddin Abul Kalam died lonely and forlorn in Rome on a January day eleven years ago. As this very appreciable compilation of his letters demonstrates amply, there was in him, ever since he left what once was East Pakistan and took up residence in the West, a defining degree of nostalgia that often comes to men who think. And Kalam was a thinking man, steeped as he was in literature and the making of it. The problem, as he saw it and not without reason, was the big hurdle that was always there when it came to an appreciation of his literary talents back home in Bangladesh. And the hurdle was geography. As the war for Bangladesh's liberation went on in 1971, Kalam was enthused by the prospect of freedom for a country he did not quite plan on going back to. He kept in touch with Justice Abu Sayeed Chowdhury and with others he knew were directly involved in the cause. Once Bangladesh became a de jure state, Kalam travelled to the new country, met its important men, including Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and came away with the belief that the future appeared bright despite the travails that yet dotted the path.//////Mukhtar Mai, also known as Mukhtaran Bibi, was subjected to gang rape in the village of Meerwala in Pakistan's Punjab province on the recommendations of a village council in 2002. It was an incident as horrible in its perpetration as it was powerful in its ramifications. Mukhtar Bibi, like so many others before her in Pakistan and elsewhere, could have opted for the traditional suicide after the shame that was heaped on her even as a whole village watched, tongue-tied, what was being done to her by men on the higher perches of feudalism in her country. No one lifted a finger, no one said a word, there was none to protest the scandalous behaviour of the Mastoi tribe. Mukhtar was only a Gujar, a member of a community that had for ages been poor and therefore resigned to its fate, which again was what people like the Mastois made of it.//////Having just finished reading an enjoyable book on parent-offspring attachments and detachments, coming across another novel dealing with the same subject, but with a very different story, was a welcome coincidence. //////
