At a time when Bangladesh has been exploring various avenues, especially through its manpower sector, to solidify its economic base, the move by Kuala Lumpur can only pour cold water on our collective aspirations. We of course realise that the Malaysian authorities have their own economic compulsions in view of the on-going global recession. At the same time, we fail to accept the argument that those already granted visas to travel to Malaysia and work there can be dealt with in such cavalier fashion. The difficulty for us, though, is that it is a decision made by a country in its national interest, which means that Bangladesh does not have much of a say here. //////IT seems that the people living in the capital are destined to suffer from the lack of some essential basic facilities forever. Coupled with the severe shortage of electricity, life has become even more unbearable with lack of adequate water supply. Some specific areas of the city, particularly the old Dhaka area, are suffering more than others. And the members of parliament of the affected areas rightly fear that there might be, as a manifestation of the people's resentment, a general display of public anger against the government for its failure to ameliorate their sufferings.//////It has been a full two weeks since the Pilkhana massacre, but the intervening time has done little to defuse tensions or bring about any kind of resolution to the issue.//////HOW are you? Yes sir, I am talking to you. Sorry, if I gave you a start, but I am not a finicky foreigner, or a wonky World Banker. Neither am I an elf from the IMF.

They seem to be very much enthusiastic about killing the innocent Palestinians, even on a lame plea. The Israeli armed forces call themselves a moral force. The type of morality they have shown through their brutal actions against the Lebanese and the Palestinian people is far too evident. In an aggression on Lebanon in 1982, they killed more than seventeen thousand people most of whom where innocent people. In the same year in a genocide, almost one thousand and seven hundred people were killed in 'Slabrashatila ' refugee camp in Lebanon. In Kana mass killing in 1996, 106 people were killed more than half of them were children. It is worth mentioning that all those killed in the camp were under the shelter of the UN. In 1997, an Israeli helicopter killed some innocent Palestinians in an attack on an ambulance. The Israelis claimed there were Hamas members in that ambulance which was a complete distortion of truth. During the latest offensive on Gaza, Israeli soldiers carried out an attack on the refugees taking shelter in a UN school killing at least 40, not to mention the total number killed and the trail of destruction left.//////We, the city dwellers, are highly conscious of the necessity of providing the required education to the children of our country and appreciate the establishment of big, medium and small schools, colleges and universities all over our cities.

They are our future. The idea is to catch them young when they can form opinions.//////This is unacceptable! As if our country does not already have enough problems. And who has created these problems? The very people who are supposed to protect us and our country. How are we to trust them with guns again? If they had issues, then there are ways to handle this. Killing people, looting valuables are the work of professional criminals, not border guards I always thought no matter how poor we are as a nation, we were still better off than those living in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia etc, but now I am beginning to wonder.//////It is a matter of great concern that thousands of civilian in the northern part of Sri Lanka especially in the Tamil inhabited areas have been suffering in the wake of a civil war between the Lankan govt. forces and the LTTE. Every day we are hearing the news of people's sufferings in terms of death, loss of houses and properties and in lot many ways. Whenever there is a war, there will be immeasurable sufferings for the peace loving general civilians who are innocent and always like peace and abhor violence. They are the victims of any kind of war whether it is domestic or international. The situation in Sri Lanka is so severe that different aid agencies operations as well as medical services have become impossible to run. People are leaving their homes and valuables to escape death . //////It is really sad that violence against women is taking place on a regular basis.//////Prime minister in her question hour informed the House that the government in implementing one of her election pledges will rehabilitate the illegally forced retired officers. This is a most welcome move. The PM specified that dues would be given to the deprived officers. But is that enough? As we know most of such officers winning the court cases are already eligible for such benefits. Perhaps now the payments and post facto promotions will expedite. To rehabilitate and also to derive benefit from this move the government may utilize their services; they may be re-posted to sensitive positions where the government needs honest, sincere and committed officers. As we know the present bureaucracy was highly politicised by the past BNP-Jamaat alliance government for which they resorted to ethnic cleansing forcing exit of brilliant non partisan officers.//////Human body needs salt but that is a very little amount less than a tea spoon or 5gm every day. Salt is used mostly in the processed foods. Fast foods and Chinese foods also contain excessive salt. Excessive intake of salt increases the risk of high blood pressure. //////The 306 non-government rural secondary schools in 64 districts across the country will be model schools under a project. It is undoubtedly a good and timely initiative when the standard of education in the rural secondary schools has deteriorated.

Most of us might not have given a serious thought to wildlife conservation. This should be a serious issue, the touchable and intangible profits we receive from wildlife conservation directly concerns over 70 percent of our country's population who depend upon the traditional occupationrain-fed agriculture. //////The use and production of polybags do a great deal of harm to our environment and drainage system and to air, water and soil. In our country, thousands of pieces of polythene are being used everyday. This huge amount of polythene is neither being re-used nor being decomposed in a natural way. Most of the bags are just thrown out after its first use. They find their way into the drains. Then the polybags block our drainage system, barricade regular flow of water, obstruct the rainwater flowing into the drains etc. As a result low-lying areas in the cities frequently go under water. Flood occurs every now and then. Whenever, these polybags go inside the cultivable land, it loses fertility and crops do not grow in such lands. Polybags remain unchanged like a curtain through which nothing can pass.//////The fresh protest of Jagannath University students to recover the illegally occupied halls exhibits the awareness of getting their rights established. //////Bangladesh has great tourism potential. The only thing we have to do is make the best use of our resources through proper planning.//////A few days ago, there was a news report published in almost every major daily of the country regarding the machine readable passport programme (MRP) taken up by the Bangladesh government. With vision of the modern days it is a must for countries like Bangladesh which are LDCs to have MRP as it was learnt that from April 2010 most of the developed countries will not allow the present manual passport which is issued by the government for visa/travel and immigration clearance purpose. From the past experience of our different Bangladeshi governments, we have seen that whatever they do, they do it at the pace of a snail and they fail to meet the target on 95% of the time and many excuses are given by the concerned authorities and departments. Compared to the total population of the country, the users of Bangladesh international passports are probably 8-10% at the most (It's a guess as we do not have any data available of the passport holders of Bangladesh). By number this may sound small but it is very important that the present government prioritise this issue and keep our different foreign offices up to date so that Bangladeshi wage earners who are living aboard and those who are planning to go before or during this transitional time do not face any difficulty with the foreign immigration departments. The project is also very crucial for our businessmen who are frequent flyers for meeting different buyers for export of readymade garments and other items.//////Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani held out the prospect of concessions to political opponents Wednesday, saying he wanted to end an unpopular governor's rule in Punjab province.//////A motley group of Left parties and regional outfits launched a third political front at a rally in a small town of the southern state of Karnataka yesterday seeking to provide an alternative to India's two main players --Congress and BJP-- in coming parliamentary elections. //////Thailand's opposition yesterday filed a censure motion against Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and five government ministers, accusing them of corruption.//////With General Elections around the corner, it is not just politicians but Netizens, too, who are busy launching campaigns in cyberspace. //////A US-based human rights watchdog Thursday criticised Pakistan for arresting hundreds of opposition activists and charged that the crackdown imperilled the country's transition to democracy.//////A mysterious rise in carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere at the end of the Ice Age could hold clues to the climate change processes underway today, a new study suggests.//////Over a week after the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket players, the Punjab government has admitted that it has failed to nab any of the culprits who had carried out the attack.//////The US Congress nearly unanimously urged China to end "repression" in Tibet, ignoring Beijing's warnings just as its foreign minister prepared to meet President Barack Obama.//////The unmarried teen daughter of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, whose pregnancy became a US presidential campaign issue in 2008, has reportedly split with her young fiance.//////North Korea has scheduled a satellite launch for early next month, South Korean officials said Thursday, as Washington and Seoul told Pyongyang to scrap what they see as a disguised missile test.//////The India Election Commission (EC) yesterday slapped a notice on Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav for alleged distribution of cash by his party workers at a Holi function. //////Grishmo Mondolio Swargo" (Tropical Paradise), a 'jatra' produced by the Drama Club of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), made its stage debut at university's Bashundhara campus on March 9.//////Grand finale of the beauty pageant "Style Icon" will be aired live on ATN Bangla tonight at 7:45 pm.
