At the moment we are passing through a crucial period of institutionalisation of democracy in our country. The present government is working to give us a genuine voter list, bringing reforms in the political parties, identifying the corrupt people and musclemen, to keep the electoral process away from their unholy influence. We are very much hopeful about the success of the CTG. The foreign powers are also pressing the government to lift emergency and hold an election as soon as possible because our development partners want to see a democratic Bangladesh as their partner.//////Many communities like Chakma, Marma and Rakhaines are living in different places in Bangladesh. But they are on the verge of losing their linguistic identity. //////We are watching with keen interest the election campaign of the United States. We are excited and engrossed by the unfolding drama and holding our breath to see the outcome of the election.//////There seems to be a huge applause in Pakistan on Musharraf's imminent ouster. We as Bangladeshis welcome the end to a military regime. But we should also not forget that the General is the only Pakistani leader who expressed regrets for the genocide in 1971. During his time, Pakistan enjoyed the best relations with India and had a long economic upturn. It is the same politicians who were ousted for corruption that came back to defeat him. Let it be a reminder for all Bangladeshis that we have to finish the anti-corruption drive and make sure that the rule of law is established.//////Thanks to the Bangladesh Bank for the belated step in directing the commercial banks of the country to find ways to reduce the wide gap between lending and deposit rates . But it is not always the deposit rate which affects the cost of funds in a bank. Although it has a direct link, but free money (about 20% app.) in the banking channel plays a great part in arriving at the funding cost of any bank which means actual effective funding cost of any bank is much less than the real deposit rate. Therefore, it would have been better if the equation could be made between their cost of fund and the lending rates. The spread in such circumstances would be more yawning. A spread of seven percent and above at the sweet will of the banks is too high for the entrepreneurs to do business profitably by taking bank loan, and if allowed to continue this trend will undoubtedly impede industrial development in the country. //////The word "Pitha" gives us the smell of delicious cakes. And to make pithas more popular, pitha festivals are the best occasions. That's why to inspire the young generation not to forget our traditional foodstuff, some people organised a pitha festival in Rajshahi. //////This editorial of 6 February is quite timely. The problem has arisen because of the clever attitude of some Bangladeshis ( mostly abroad) who have managed to identify the language of Bangla with Matri Bhasha or Mother tongue. Of course a proper language must have its alphabet, its vocabulary and grammar and a standard pronunciation over a large area of population for mutual understanding, and thus Bangla Bhasha has evolved over centuries from many dialects of various mother tongues or brojo-bulee, matri-bulee etc. When a bulee becomes a bhasha with all necessary elements, it is the bhasha which must be given prominence by the educated citizens and matri bulees or dialects must only remain in the background of culture or literature, but never occupy the centre stage.//////After reading a few correspondences in the newspapers on the above issue, I felt an urge within myself to clarify it further. Following is the existing law in brief as per the gazette notification vide the ordinance no. LVII of 1976 relating to the Public Servants ( Marriage With Foreign Nationals ) Ordinance,1976, issued under the signature of the late President A.M. Sayem dated 7th July 1976.//////This morning (19 Feb) sometimes after 9:am, I was coming up the Gulshan Avenue (south to north) towards the first circle intersection, when a police pick-up with horn blaring was leading a Bangladesh flagged car.//////In Bangladesh, we (non Muslims) are the minority. The majority people are better placed. It is natural. But it is also natural to have our right to observe religious festivals established fully. Sadly, the reality does not reflect that. On 11 February, we observed our Saraswati Puja. Almost all of the educational institutions remain closed on this day. But the English medium schools are not caring about our religious values. They were running classes. Saraswati is our Goddess of knowledge, art, music and others. But our English medium students are not getting any chance of praying to our Holy Goddess. This is quite unfair. We must learn English but of course not at the cost of our own religious values. //////Warriors and despots are generally bad economists - Richard Cobden, the19th century 'apostle of free trade'.//////The students of DU should think first whether there is any quota system in their university for 'dependents of DU staffs'. And is it for the fourth class poor employees or for all including teachers and officers? They should abolish it first, if there is any. //////The energy policy needs to be publicly accessible and this is a standard practice of any democratic nation. If it is open to general people it will remove the doubts on our leadership. Once the policies are rock solid, sensible and pro-national interest, it will be very easy for the people as well for the investors on energy or other areas to participate in international bidding. If the policies lack clarity, national interest will be harmed.//////The recent setback experienced by Sen.

At least it sounds that way.//////DESCENDING in a helicopter, through rain and mist, onto a crowded but remote ////// island, the enormous and immediate dangers of climate change suddenly, ominously, seemed very, very real. The island, in the middle of the massive Jamuna River, is a hostage to erosion, threatened by rising sea levels, and no stranger to severe flooding. On these shifting sands live some two million of Bangladesh's poorest and most vulnerable people; people for whom climate change is not a theory but a fact of daily life. //////DR. Mahatir Mohamad, the former PM of Malaysia, had a vision. He converted his vision into reality in his lifetime.
