The world body has just presented Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and through her the people of Bangladesh, an award to this effect in New York. This recognition of Bangladesh's sincere efforts in trying to reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015, while clearly encouraging for us, is also a reminder for us of what we must yet do in order to tackle the remaining seven of the eight MDGs. Given that as a nation we are resource-strapped and given too that a certain sluggishness has characterised the developed world where a flow of funds from it to the developing world is concerned, the road ahead will be a difficult, if not an insurmountable one. As the prime minister has pointed out in New York, Bangladesh will need $22.1 billion if it has to attain all the MDGs.//////This is a glaring example of triple folly making news yesterday of how vulnerable even routine governance has become to demonstrative arrogance of some ruling party elements.

In the last few days, the disease has spread in Narayanganj, Dhamrai and the outskirts of the city.

He started telling lies on multifarious subjects right after getting the power of PM, albeit he is an ex now, still he is continuing it. Thus some people call him 'Mr . Lair' cutting 'B' from 'Blair'.//////The front-page report published on 3rd September in a local English daily, quoting AL's acting general secretary, revives the saga of the epic South Arabian journey of Khaleda Zia, four years back in 2006. It has remained an intriguing mystery since then, which may be only time will reveal!//////A priest of Florida, USA, announced his plan to burn copies of the Holy Qur'an in protest of the 9/11 massacre, after long nine years of the unfortunate incident. It may ignite a new wave of hatred among the believers. If some of the Muslims are responsible for attacking the World Trade Centre, all the Muslims cannot be made liable for that. When Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq or attacks on Afghanistan, no Muslim ever burnt any copy of the Holy Bible.//////This refers to the government's move of engaging experts from multilateral institutions in the consultative groups of government and NGO development efforts. It is unfortunate that even after 40 years of independence we look to foreigners for guidance. I echo the question, Are we intellectually bankrupt? //////Travelling in Dhaka city has virtually become a nightmare. All the roads are clogged. The cars are stuck bumper to bumper, the engines release a tremendous amount of heat, drivers honk their horns incessantly, some of the old vehicles let go black smoke, vehicles break lanes and try and enter the ones that are moving faster. At rush hour, a distance of three to four kilometres can take about an hour to reach. Destinations like Gulistan, Motijheel, Old Dhaka, Maghbazar, Malibagh, Gulshan, Banani and Dhanmondi are nightmares for commuters from any point in the city. Especially frustrating are the points likeHotel Sonargaon crossing, the road in front of the Prime Minister's office, Maghbazar, Mouchak, Malibagh, Khilghaon, Rampura, Elephant Road, Science Laboratory, Green Road, Jatrabari, Sayedabad, Mohakhali and old parts of the city mainly at Dholaikhal, Postagola, Bangshal, Chowkbazar and Imamganj. //////We, the people of our country, are in a dream to live in a digital Bangladesh in future. But the present condition of our country really disappoints us. What do we mean by digital Bangladesh? We mean a country which is free from traffic jams, theft, robbery, hijacking, load shedding, free from pollution and so on. The government has taken necessary steps to solve these problems. But alas! Still crimes are being committed on a regular basis. And there is also unbearable traffic jam in the city roads and load shedding occurs frequently, even on holidays. //////Pastor Terry Jones, of the Dove World Outreach centre (a non denominational church in Florida), announced his plan to mourn the death of September 11 victims through the burning of the Holy Koran. He claimed that he intends to send a message to the perpetrators of the September 11 incident by doing this and also express his grievances against Islam and Shariah law. His act however holds all Muslims (for whom The Koran is sacred) around the world liable for the heinous act of September 11. However, his rejection of Islam as a religion has already been made clear while he wrote his controversial book Islam is of the devil and made it available on the internet for sale at some of his websites. Other merchandise with the title of the book is also available. It seems to the ordinary that he has already achieved what he has desired: publicity and profitability of his enterprise. However, what Pastor Terry Jones has failed to realize is that by his deeds he not only expressed his rejection and hatred towards the religion but has also alienated himself from Muslim population. In an interview with ABC news, President Mr. Barrack Obama has clearly expressed his distaste towards such an act. However, mere distaste towards this clear outrage is not enough to absorb the shockwaves which such an insane act will send through out the globe. In these times when social harmony is being restored. //////There are some educational institutions in the country where some people have been given the power of running them. Regrettably, most of the members of the managing committees seem to be just showing their monetary power, instead of looking after the institutions properly. Recently, an ugly incident occurring in an institute disappointed me. One of the committee members behaved very rudely with a female staff presently serving an orphanage. //////The other day, the electronic media reported that there is no dearth of any goods and services in the capital, rather there is a surplus of everything i.e. gas, water, electricity etc.//////Reckless driving or dangerous driving is a major traffic rule violation and this can be seen often in Dhanmondi area where the youths are always in competition with each other putting the pedestrians' life at stake.//////This week Saad al-Hariri, the Lebanese PM, retracted his former claim that Syria was behind the assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri, the Prime Minister of Lebanon in 2005.

Finally, on September 12, on the 30th anniversary of the 1980 military coup, the Turkish people adopted a democratic constitution after a referendum. //////Democracy has been defined across the globe as the best medium for running the state machinery. The scope of human freedom and action allowed in a democratic system speaks volumes for its suitability to the political environment of the nations of the world. The ethos of a democratic administration personifies the sentiment of the common masses, and this always makes space for them to protest against the wrongdoings of the government. //////People once laughed at me because I thought a "nutritionist" was a person who lived on nuts. But then I met one and found I was right.//////
