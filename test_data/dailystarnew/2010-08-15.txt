No doubt, that is a big threat for our garment industry. From the very beginning of this industry, we have been experiencing the virulent crisis that is getting worse with the passage of time. Though the government with the help of the employers tries to get to a proper solution to this so called labour unrest, it still remains a long way to go.//////Thanks to our government, especially our education minister Mr. Nurul Islam Nahid for taking the initiative to cut down VAT from private university students. This is indeed a great relief for their parents who find it quite difficult to defray their educational fees in most of the cases. I would now request our government to monitor the fees in English medium schools as they are charging fees at high rate with additional VAT. There is no policy amongst those English Medium Schools and as a result everybody is charging fees as per their wishes. Adding to this headache another additional cost is bus fare. Many schools have moved to Uttara, Ashulia and other distant places which have allowed the school authorities to charge a handsome amount as bus fares. Schools are charging full bus fare even when the school is open for 5/6 days in some months. I, as a parent, am finding it quite amazing to see that nobody is monitoring this increased fees and fares. Education should not be a business. I hope somebody will pay heed to this problem.//////From the beginning, the activities of ninth parliament have been paralysed on one ground or the other. Initially, the opposition stalled the proceedings over the issue of controversial attitude of the ruling party or the speaker. The hallmark of an effective parliamentarian now seems to be the ability to shout and disrupt proceedings. The practice is to completely paralyse any discussion in parliament if the opposition is agitated about any particular subject. The practice of repeatedly obstructing the proceedings in parliament is most regrettable and defeats the very purpose for which the legislature exists. //////It has been a tradition of leaking question papers, delay in response from govt. employers, errors in questions papers, taking more than a year to set question papers and hold recruitment exams, publishing results etc. But the concerned ministries and the ministers pay very little heed in this regard so far. The recently postponed Secondary School Teacher recruitment is an example. How long does it take the experts to set a question paper? I think the more time they take the more chance of leaking and corruption increases. Some public banks advertised in 2009 i.e. Sonali Bank, Ansar VDP Unnayan Bank and we applied as usual still we see no sign of taking exams. It has been more than two months that Rupali Bank exams were held for Officer and Senior Officer Recruitment. Though their process was much easier than other public banks but the result is yet to be published.//////The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has finally decided to reduce the charge for the SMS services of the mobile service companies (Star Business: 6.8.10). We would like to thank the BTRC and the government for this step in the interest of the 58 millions users of the cell phones. The cell users generally prefer to use SMS mainly for privacy and facilities of sending the same message to myriad receivers. I know some people who use SMS for documentation for future references. The decision of reducing the cost to as little as Tk. 50 is a timely step, indeed.//////This is in regard to a letter on the issue written by Mr. Md. Mahabubur Rahman. He reasoned his article with a simple solution that dwellers of Dhaka city should opt for private cars instead of travelling like a chimpanzee on the bus and risk their precious lives. I do agree with the writer but I would also like to remind him that he may have forgotten the per capita income of the people of this country and also the living pattern, financial ability and spaces that are needed to keep these private cars. I would therefore request our road transport authorities to introduce more private buses on the roads in order to alleviate the sufferings of the general public and improve the traffic problems of the city. It is also important to mention that the government must adopt a policy such as "one car one family" instead of having 3/4 car per family and if this policy is properly maintained the influx of private cars will minimize substantially on the roads, or, otherwise, very soon the country will be running out of the much needed gas. //////Everyone knows very well what this word means. None of us like this, we all detest it. Yet, we are no exceptions. We say we love animals and then we take away their home and build a big mansion where we probably will never live. When we do we may be branded as hypocrites. The word doesn't sound very nice, but it's true.//////To consolidate democracy, it's very much necessary to exercise it from the grassroots level like Union Parishad and in this regard the government should strengthen the local government through democratic activities like election which should be guided and governed in the name of the political parties. So, in all walks of life people can participate in the political process in order to practise democracy. //////Re-launching of three-lane traffic system by Dhaka Metropolitan Police has again bogged down with more traffic jams.//////In general, the responsibility of a doctor is to identify the exact cause of disease and prescribing drug to treat the disease. After that, the responsibility of clinical pharmacist is to check drug interaction, any prior hypersensitivity to prescribed multiple drugs, giving instructions on when & how to use drugs and advising on safe & rational use of drug. Although, in our country doctors do their task properly but the patient cannot get proper instructions of above mentioned from a graduate (registered) clinical pharmacist. So, inappropriate use of drug causes the treatment failure in our country while the same prescription of drugs in other countries results in cure of disease. In my practical experience, a physician prescribed flucloxacillin 500mg tablet (Generic name) 4 times a day without mentioning the time of taking drug (because he is busy identifying disease). As usual, patient took this drug after meal & there was no benefit from this drug because the absorption of flucloxacillin is almost zero if taken after meal (it must be taken at least 30 minutes before meal).These types of situations including drug interactions & hypersensitivity occur in silence due to no job facilities of graduate pharmacist in hospital or clinic.//////Video piracy has become a common issue that frequently affect the film as well as music industries. While we walk along the road we see some people busy selling a large number of CDs, DVDs to the passers-by. Naturally the question arises in our mind whether products are pirated. Historically, we the Bangladeshis are fond of film and music since the inception of 1971 when these contributed to a lot of to inspire the people to lay down their lives to snatch away the red sun of freedom. But today it is a matter of great regret that piracy has grabbed the whole film and music industries to such a extent that these industries are passing through a critical time to survive. There are many film producers who are making outstanding works with their talents and skills. But when piracy obstructs the way to commercialising the films, they lose all hopes and aspirations. Similarly music industries are being victimized by some unethical groups who are running their business countrywide destroying the growing future of music industry. It is acknowledged that some people freely download the audio or video file on the Internet. Afterwards, they produce many copies without authorization. As a result, genuine consumers don't feel encouraged to go for the genuine products. Meanwhile the ministry of information and technology has taken up some steps to stop this practice. But there is no fruitful result that has yet come. I want to draw the attention of the respective authorities to take stern action against the culprits.//////A young woman-- captured during protest against tuition fee hike-- hemmed in by some police, being roughed up by truncheon mercilessly, while some other policemen are watching and grinning from afar!

They are instrumental in the birth of their nations by way of liberating them from colonial or other occupation. George Washington is the father of the United States, Peter I of Russia, Sun Yat-sen of China, Sir Henry Parkes of Australia, Miguel Hidalgo of Mexico, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, William the Silent of the Netherlands, Einar Gerhardsm of Norway, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Carlos Mannel of Cuba, Mustafa Kemal of Turkey, Sukarno of Indonesia, Tunku Abdul Rahman of Malaysia, Mahatma Gandhi of India, Don Stephen Senanayake of Sri Lanka and Mohammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan. So is Bangabandhu, the Father of the Bangladesh nation.//////On 15 August 1975 Bangabandhu told the traitors, The people put me here and the only way I will leave this country will be as a dead person. //////The murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has had grave ramifications for Bangladesh. It was, in the immediate sense, an overthrow of constitutional government in the country, which was again a reinforcement of the idea that the long struggle Mujib and the Awami League had waged against military rule in Pakistan had in a way come to nought. The coup d' etat of August 1975 was to be a precursor to other, newer means of removing governments in Bangladesh. The majors and colonels who had organised the large-scale slaughter of the president's family quickly made it clear that they intended to run the show. They ensconced themselves at Bangabhavan, the presidential palace, and served as Khondokar Moshtaq's advisors. That was quite in the fitness of things, for he clearly owed his job to them. The biggest irony arising out of the coup was the continuation of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's ministers, save a few, in office. Syed Nazrul Islam, Mansoor Ali and A.H.M. Quamruzzaman were under arrest, along with Tajuddin Ahmed. Foreign Minister Kamal Hossain, abroad at the time of the coup, refused to return and be part of the new administration. But Moshtaq could and did take satisfaction from the fact that all others among his ministerial colleagues were now serving in his regime as his ministers. The first cabinet meeting Moshtaq presided over was on the day after the coup, even as Mujib's body and the bodies of his family remained to be buried. One of the first bits of information Moshtaq handed out to the ministers, many of whom were plainly terrified, with some others not knowing what position to adopt given the murders that had already taken place, was that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman would be buried in his village. There was no regret in his voice, no tribute and not many ministers were willing to raise any questions. //////Friday, 15 August, 1975, is one of the saddest days of our history. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, our greatest patriot, was killed on that day. His dear wife, three sons and only brother were also killed along with him. It reminded us of the dark night of March 25, 1971. The Father of the Nation, loved and respected in Bangladesh and the world over as a great hero, a great leader of independence, lay dead on the stairs of his famous residence at Road Number 32, Dhanmandi Residential Area. He was only fifty five. //////Like all of you present here I love roses a lot //////While crossing the Race Course field yesterday //////One of the roses blooming there //////Said to me: Make your verse sing of Sheikh Mujib //////I'm here to sing of him. //////Bangabandhu's assassination on 15 August 1975 prematurely deprived Bangladesh of its founding father at a time when the process of nation building was still incomplete. This event both destabilized and created a fissure within the nation which has not yet been bridged. This division and destabilization of the polity deflected Bangladesh from the course set by its liberation struggle which had provided the basis for the foundational principles of the Bangladesh constitution: democracy, nationalism, secularism and socialism. Since that fateful day in August, each of these foundational principles has been exposed to contestation or even outright repudiation. This assault on the very principles of our nationhood has destabilised the nation, compromised the working of our democratic institutions and thereby weakened the process of governance. It could, thus, be argued that the bullets which killed Bangabandhu were also intended to destroy the very idea of Bangladesh for which the liberation war was waged. Let us briefly explore these long-term consequences which emanated from the events of 15 August 1975.//////When Bangabandhu was gunned down in the early hours on 15 August 1975, the Bengali nation to which he gave independence began a process of atonement for having committed patricide that continues even now. What can be crueler than killing the nation's father that gave identity to a people who remained colonized for twenty-five years after the British had pulled out of the subcontinent in 1947?//////Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was born on March 17, 1920 at Tungipara in the then Faridpur district. Despite the fact that he was an extraordinary political leader who had spent more than twelve years in jail for articulating the legitimate grievances of his people against the then Pakistani ruling elite, he became a victim of a brutal massacre on August 15, 1975. The bullet-ridden dead body of the Father of the Nation was most dishonourably buried by the murderers at Tungipara. //////Darkness settled in seemingly with a promise to facilitate a peaceful slumber for the city dwellers after a hot day's tiring work. There was nothing uncanny in the bearing of the night, except that it was completely oblivious of what Cassius and a few villains were conspiring to execute under cover of the night's darkness. These villains committed the gravest ever crime that people will always remember with hatred and acute ache in their hearts. An indelible smear desecrated the otherwise laudable history of Bangladesh.//////
