But the irony is that about fifty percent of the doctors serving in government and non government organisations are not registered.

It has one unique element to strengthen the referral system and also manpower development. //////Since I have expressed my feeling about the "Parade of failure" by our national cricket team under the leadership of Ashraful, a lot of events have occurred in our failed cricket.

He seems to have forgotten that he had the responsibility to inform the board and the countryman immediately after he had received a very lucrative offer from the ICL which he turned down in the national interest.
