It was clearly the most upsetting for us in recent times. The jilted lover of a young woman (and this lover incidentally has a wife already), in company with his accomplices, set the woman on fire through pouring petrol on her. As we write this editorial, the young woman Aleya struggles for survival in hospital. She just might live or she might see her life come to a painful end.

It is really commendable!//////Current FC Barcelona player and once a living legend of Arsenal is thinking about his future in the Major League Soccer (MLS) in the USA after the 2010 World Cup. He was a god to Arsenal fans where he started to make his fortune. It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer. Despite initially struggling in the Premier League, he emerged as Arsenal's top goal-scorer for almost every season of his tenure there. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsne Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 226 goals in all competitions. The Frenchman won two league titles and three FA Cups with the Gunners; he was twice nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year, was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year three times. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the UEFA Champions League final in 2006. In June 2007, after eight years with Arsenal, he transferred to Barcelona for a fee of 24 million. In Barcelona he did manage to win trophies but his striking skills began to lose its sharpness and in 2010 he spent most of his time sitting in the reserved players bench. It is speculated that now he is planning to join one of the lower rated leagues of the world (MLS) where he will probably spend rest of his career and leave football. Had he not opted for money, he would have been still one of the greatest players of Barclays Premier League, But Alas! His endless urge for money and fame is finally pulling the curtain down on his successful career. Arsenal will never forget Henry, though. //////The other day, I saw in your daily that Wal-Mart has opened a store in India and a few more are on the pipeline. Bangladesh is just next door to India. It has 150 million people or so. Though most of them live below poverty line, yet I believe Wal-Mart would be overwhelmed to see the sale proceeds. Besides Wal-Mart would be able to cater to the needs of the overseas Americans stationed in Bangladesh. //////The much vaunted rally at historic Paltan Maidan was held on May 19.

The charges she brought against the government are not new and people knew what she had in store to say about.//////Student politics is not bad as such if the aim of the politics is to learn how to develop the country and how to do good for the people. But it seems it is getting convoluted nowadays. Students should concentrate on the study first because the knowledge they gather can be utilised when they will be at the helm of the country. But, unfortunately, the present student political activists, except a few microscopic exceptions, are now engaged in possessing illegal lethal arms, extortion, tender snatching, sometimes kidnapping and killing, as if they have been there to learn how they will continue those bad practices in their greater lives. //////In the early years of our lives, we learnt in school that barking dogs do not bite. Probably it was an adage. I was confused about its appropriateness, though. The confusion is still ingrained in my mind.//////The main opposition party namely the BNP is resorting to destructive political programmes like HARTAL, but we know that politicians engage in politics for the welfare of general people. But we do not know how HARTAL can help the general people. So, we hope the BNP will withdraw its HARTAL call. //////Just prior to the "Greatest Show on Earth", FIFA World Cup 2010, people have started hoisting national flag of the team that they support. From previous experience we know that flag is hoisted in each and every house, residential areas, university halls, roads, shopping complexes, clubs and even in public transports.

The state minister for law has got us in a fix since he said last Friday that late president Ziaur Rahman had spied for Pakistan during the Liberation War in 1971. We don't know if he said of something which has happened, or happened to say of something, which is wild imagination.//////HOW far is it a benefit to be classified as a least developed country (LDC)? After nearly four decades of existence of the LDC category, and after three decade-long Programs of Action adopted by the United Nations since the 1980s to support the development and eventual graduation of the LDCs, there is no clear answer to the above question. The Fourth United Nations Conference on the LDCs planned for mid 2011 is expected to approve a fourth Plan of Action.//////THOUSANDS of isms and doctrines have been evolved over the centuries. The belief system has been different from country to country, and it has changed and altered pretty much regularly. A system of thought that was appreciated and respected once received severe excoriation for banality later on, and lost its charm to a new one that embraced trends and outlooks of the existing time. That is how societies have shaped up over the centuries. Change has always been there, and will be too, probably! //////I flick through newspaper after newspaper in deep shock.
