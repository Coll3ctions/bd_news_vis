That is the truth which comes out in the media. Over the past few months, Saudi policemen have been hunting down Bangladeshis and sending them off to deportation centres despite many of them possessing perfectly valid papers. As a number of anguished Bangladeshis now in the kingdom have made it clear, the Saudi police pay no heed to the fact that those they go after are legally permitted to work in the country. In many cases, when our workers show their absolutely genuine papers to the police, the latter commit the sheer outrage of tearing them up and hauling these hapless people off to the deportation centres as a step towards sending them back to Bangladesh. Amidst such grossly unacceptable behaviour, the workers are unable to collect their belongings or call their employers.//////Let's get one thing straight: the diarrhoeal situation is not frightening, but its incidence at this time of the year is certainly higher than recorded previously. Diarrhoea usually breaks out at the beginning and towards the end of the rainy season. But somehow there is a departure from the pattern as the affliction is noticeable much ahead of the rainy season, at least six weeks too early. Why so? The experts are yet to find an explanation for the early appearance of the water-borne disease; but we think, the precipitation of the malady can be put down to deteriorating sanitary conditions together with acute scarcity of potable water in the city.//////THE political leadership all over the world realise that it is important that the international community takes measures to not only ensure lower prices of food products but also food security.

The significance of the deteriorating situation has also been underlined by the WFP when they launched an appeal for additional emergency donations to meet this 'silent tsunami of starvation'.//////IF I had anything to do with the formulation of a policy on Pakistan, I would have sent a goodwill mission to Islamabad soon after elections. For the first time, after many years, the democratic forces had emerged victorious despite a large-scale rigging, as the report of a European Union team has revealed. That a beleaguered nation, awakened by the lawyers' agitation, asserted itself to choose its own representatives is a great achievement in a country which was tightly controlled by the military.

This was a sign of change, the photographer observed. A change from within.//////Shahjahan Hafiz was a familiar name in the cultural arena of Dhaka in the '50s.

It is the AALA (Western Australian Premier's Australia-Asia Literary Award), and winners will receive a cash payment of A$110,000 (US$103,000). It makes the AALA far larger than the American Pulitzer for fiction ($10,000) and in roughly the same league as UK's Man Booker (US$100,000). The chair of the judging panel is Nury Vittachi, the Hong Kong-based Sri Lankese writer whose column is currently being syndicated in The Daily Star. The other judge is Kamila Shamsie, the Pakistani writer, while a third judge has yet to be named.//////The first thing you will notice about 8-year-old Abir is the dark circles under his eyes. They stand in stark contrast to the rest of his pale face; at a glance, he might look a pretty boy with his blue eyes, elfin frame and beautiful smile.

Today, around 1,300-1,400 ships per day cross the Straits, while 600 dock at Singapore daily. Less than two miles wide at its narrowest, the straits can easily be locked during a conflict, thus interrupting the flow of trade and, more importantly, of vital resources such as oil. In addition, piracy and terrorism are a constant threat in the Straits. Therefore, in order to secure sea-lanes and facilitate east-west movement between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, concretizing alternatives to the Straits of Malacca - some of which had been thought of as early as the 18th century - has now become an imperative. //////U.S. Marines in Fallujah, Iraq, looked at the digital displays of the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) and noticed that the maps were lit up almost entirely red to depict the sources of enemy fire.//////Britain's BAE Systems and Indian automobile major Mahindra and Mahindra may form the first joint venture in India's private defense sector with an overseas partner holding 49 percent.//////The Indian Navy's top commanders will review maritime security needs at the Naval Commanders Conference being held May 7-9 in Mumbai.//////Nobel Peace laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, a pioneer of collateral free small credit to poor women, is in quest of harnessing free market power to solve the problems of poverty, hunger and inequality across the world.

But he remains far from satisfied as poverty, hunger and inequality continue to trouble the world as well as his native Bangladesh. If the dynamics of capitalism could be applied properly, he believes, poverty, the greatest challenge, facing mankind, could be tackled to a great extent.//////The story about two Igbo sisters, the beautiful Olanna and the smart Kainene, in Half of a Yellow Sun stretches through the tough sixties in Nigeria. //////Lovers of Nicholas Sparks' novels are for the big treat of their life as they read //////. The characters created in the story are so vivid and the period details are so contemporary that the reader has a hard time believing that he or she is reading a work of fiction. It is a true work of literature, for the life sketched in it is vibrant and catches the reader's attention right from the first page. Literature, after all, is supposed to have its ends strung to real life. Readers are also in for a surprise, for unlike other books of Nicholas Sparks this book balances a love story with a mystery. Sparks is mostly widely read for his romantic tragedies. The mystery and the love story run on parallel plot lines all through this book.//////What is a little magazine and why is it there? What is its history and who first brought it out? Before getting into the answers let us first see the definition of little magazines. It goes like this ? a periodical, usually not published for profit, prints reviews, essays, fiction, or poetry or more usually some combination of them, supposedly devoted to high literary standards. Little magazines often run innovative or experimental works. A few little magazines pay for contributions, many do not. Some are widely influential, but others are virtually unknown except to the editors and contributors. Little magazines may be very helpful to a new writer who is selective in sending submissions. //////
