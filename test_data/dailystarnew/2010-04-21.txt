But they are to be regarded as a significant step considering the political legacy Pakistanis have, to their great discomfiture, regularly been heir to. With as many as four military rulers upsetting the chances for democracy since its creation in 1947, Pakistan has been caught in a vicious cycle of political despair brought on by the depredations of its non-elected leaders. Now that President Asif Ali Zardari has signed away his vast powers, powers he has had no hand in the making of, and has thus reassured Pakistanis that parliamentary democracy may be finally back on track, there is reason to feel somewhat confident about Pakistan's future.//////All eyes will be eager to see how young Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan tackles shrewd tactician Khaled Mashud when the Kings of Khulna meet Rajshahi Rangers in the final of the Destiny Group National Cricket League T20s at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. //////Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal achieved his first international award when the left-hander became Wisden Cricketer Magazine's International Cricketer of the Month in its May 2010 edition.//////Former Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar will launch a different innings from tomorrow when the Grameenphone-BCB Academy Cup 2010 gets underway with a four-day match against the touring South Africa National Cricket Academy at Chittagong.//////Ten-man Rahmatganj MFS came from behind to hold Sheikh Russel KC to a 1-1 draw in their home match of the Bangladesh League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////The Bangladesh Hockey Federation added more fuel to their own fire with poor internal coordination ensuring that there was a pitiful turnout of the national players for the Asian Games Qualifiers camp at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////Indian opener Virender Sehwag has suffered a shoulder injury which will rule him out of the ICC World Twenty20 beginning in the West Indies on April 30.

Thousands of hazards are associated with such type of investment decisions. So, people consider 'investment in stock market' as a better option.

It is an old and special cultivation system practiced by the indigenous people of Chittagang Hill Tracts. It is the primary source of food, shelter and clothing of local people. In this practice, mixed seeds of cotton, chilli, cowpea, cucumber, gourd, rice, melon, pumpkin, maize, yams, sweet potatoes are sown in each pocket in the hilly areas. In three hill districts of Chittagong the indigenous people traditionally grow cotton following this indigenous technology. In Jhum cultivation cotton seeds are sown along with other crop seeds like- rice, chilli, maize, peanuts in the same pit/hill horizontally on the hill slope. The hill people harvest different crops in different times sequentially. But the practice of Jhum firming is not environment friendly. It is harmful for the biodiversity of the hilly areas of CHT. //////Water logging has emerged as the major environmental problem in the metropolitan cities of Dhaka and Chittagong due to unplanned urbanization and filling up of low lying land, lakes, river banks. Closure of Dholai khal, Begun Bari khal in Dhaka and Chaktai Khal in Chittagong which used to serve as major outlets for rainwater and drainage system have created major logging problems in these cities. It is a basic tenet of city planning to preserve open spaces, and protect lakes, wetland areas and canal encroachment in order to maintain natural and environmental characteristics of the city. But the powerful land grabbers and real estate developers taking advantage of the housing boom illegally filled up natural wetland, retention ponds, lakes and main canals for construction of buildings and housing estates. RAJUK or CDA or Department of Environment have failed to preserve the topographical features and protect the cities from the uncontrolled rainwater flooding. Rain is inevitable in monsoon- fed Bangladesh but now an hour of heavy rain creates temporary flooding and long periods of water logging in the low lying suburban areas. Expansion of metropolitan cities are a part of inevitable process of economic growth but urban expansion is occurring without any control, supervision or future plan due to the incompetence, corruption and indifference of the city development authorities and the city corporation. The government must take up a comprehensive plan to improve the drainage system, reclaim and recover the flow of blocked and close major 'khals' and protect the wetlands and retention ponds to save our citizens from water logging.//////I concur with Mr. Shahnoor Wahid's article that proactive measures must be taken to prevent big disasters in Dhaka city. The growth of population in Dhaka city is alarming and we must do something about it. I cannot imagine what Dhaka city would look like in 2030 when the population will be more than two crores. Our government must think of taking big steps to shift major sectors to the outskirts of Dhaka city.//////I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating you and the Dhaka Metropolitan Police for your help in ensuring that the area in front of our homes was not overwhelmed by eateries and music on Pahela Baishakh.

Almost all the children are abused this way or that way. In most cases children are sexually fondled and in extreme cases the fondling crosses the limit and cause a permanent mental and physical damage to the child. The sexually abused children carry with them the hang-ups of the bitter experience which sometimes mentally retard them. And as the abusers are usually the near relatives, it causes a debilitating damage to the normal relationship. The abuser and the abused can never behave normally throughout life. //////Thanks to DS for publishing the press briefing of Pakistani ambassador on the trial of war criminals.

The DS on 04th, 2010 published the news of a schoolgirl, Elora, who embraced death because of unremitting teasing by local youths. Not only she, but also a number of young school girls are voluntarily embracing death in order to escape teasing, Because of socio- cultural frailties women are not treated gently. //////I am shocked and dismayed to hear people calling it the government's money. Are people living in a fool's paradise? Or are they ignorant? It is not government's money, it is taxpayers' money. What is government? It is a body of elected representatives of the people. Like any other person the elected representatives who constitute the government also require to fulfil their needs. For fulfilling their requirements they cash on the taxpayers' money, which is wrongly termed as government money since colonial times. This has to change in order to make the government accountable for their deeds to the people. //////Following a pictorial report published in the Prothom Alo, the leading Bangla newspaper, on April 12 last, police arrested a fake 'pir' named Amzad Hossain Bepari on charge of torturing several children and women in the name of treatment in Khasnagar village under Sirajdikhan upazila of Munshiganj.//////There is no water supply from the beginning of the month in our locality.

The world has observed Obama's negotiation on Iran's sanctions with the world powers in the name of Security Council, ever largest after the World War II. People of the world appreciate non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but do not expect another nuclear catastrophe, the one which still instils fear in everyone. America, pushed by Israel, has become impatient to start another war, bloodshed. President Obama mentioned the nuclear weapons as a threat to the world, being the largest holder of nuclear weapons and active materials for making these. He was more concerned about Iran than nuclear proliferation during the two day Security Council sessions. Iran is pursuing to develop a nuclear weapon for a long time claims the west and their allies like they claimed Iraq as the storage of WMDs!! //////Eve teasing has become a social disease in our country.
