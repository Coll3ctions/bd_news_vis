And the lack of coordination among the different sections of the missions is also not the only shortcoming they suffer from, although clearly it is a major one. //////EVERY year we hear tales of famine like situation in a number of districts in the northern part of the country around this time of the year when source of work and food supply begin to dwindle dangerously.

The Awami League won the polls with a thumping majority. The verdict at the hustings was loud and clear. There is, therefore, a surge of expectations amongst the electorate from a government that comes as a result of such clear mandate. However, the premonition that is lurking in many hearts is whether those in charge of managing the affairs of the State are faltering or getting stalled on account of the malevolence of not-too-visible elements.//////JURISTS from around the world recently observed the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention (on August 12, 2009).

Srinagar has changed beyond recognition these past four years since I was last there. From the new swanky airport to the hotel, about 10 kilometres, there is modern construction. It looks as if another Noida, near Delhi, is coming up. Trees, however, have been cut mercilessly and familiar pavements dug out to accommodate fancy thoroughfares. Walls running along the road have been demolished and the rubble is still there for all to see. Probably something new and modern will replace what once aroused feelings of nostalgia. As I covered the journey to my hotel, I missed the old Kashmiri houses from where women with long trinkets would peer to see the incoming tourists.//////It has been almost 19 years that our country has been under a democracy, and I would like to point out a few rights which must be protected under this system. It is essential for every democratic country to maintain its democracy and to protect fundamental rights such as freedom of association and freedom of expression, which includes freedom of thought and speech for every individual. //////Bangladesh is recognized to be one of the most susceptible countries in the world, highly vulnerable to climatic manifestations (short-term and long-term impacts of climate change) due to its unique geographic location, hydro-geological characters like dominance of floodplains, low elevation from the sea and lastly the socio-economical characters like high population density, high levels of poverty, and overwhelming dependence on nature. Unfortunately, the country's future is now trapped between the melting Himalayas in the north and the encroaching Bay of Bengal to the south. //////Your Planet Needs You! Unite to Combat Climate Change' has been the slogan of this year's World Environment Day; 'Kick the Habit! Towards a Low Carbon Economy' was last year's. With these for three successive times the United Nation Environment Programme (UNEP) has declared 'climate change' related themes for observing World Environment Day. This phenomenon helps us understand how much emphasis is given by UNEP on global warming and climate change issue. Climate change due to global warming is an all encapsulating global disaster. But it is impossible to mitigate it unless economic production system of this planet is made carbon neutral. //////I met her at a party. She was only eighteen, and had just started her first year at the university. I was a senior, a communications/journalism major, working two jobs to help pay the bills. I was staying with my parents in Uttora and while they paid for my tuition and books, all other expenses, including transportation, meals, and other incidentals, came out of my pocket. I did not have time to party much, but when my classmate Sharmila invited me to her birthday party, I accepted. It was there that I met Nora.//////Shazia Omar was all cheerful, all fired up, at the launch of ////// last week. Young, bright and articulate, not to say beautiful, she brought in a good dose of humour as she responded to questions on her work, on the plot, theme and characterization in the tale. For a young woman who has just come forth with her first experiment in fiction, the launch ceremony at Red Shift in Gulshan was a quite a resplendent affair. A whole crowd of young people, obviously more at home in matters English and therefore rather modern and secular in outlook, was there. //////There is a fine line between lunacy and genius. The Romantic poet William Blake walked that fine line. As a child Blake reportedly saw God's head at his window; he and his wife were so fascinated by Milton's Paradise Lost that they used to roam naked in their house at Lambeth Palace in London; he said 'damn your king' to a police constable that led to an indictment with sedition charges'; and he considered Milton (like him) as a member of the Devil's Party. This is the same man who created a body of work that includes Jerusalem, Four Zoas, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and the ostensibly simple Songs of Innocence and of Experience. While Blake's lunacy is considered a matter of dispute, his genius is recognized beyond any doubt. //////Again you came last night,//////Making your presence felt//////Like my very own breath,//////Though I was suffocating,//////As I couldn't see you.//////An unseen wall as a bar//////Was between us formidable.//////Respiratory infections like colds, sore throat, tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis and influenza-like illness (ILI) or seasonal flu are common in winter. These infections are often caused by viruses that start flourishing with the dropping of temperature. Most of the respiratory infections that occur in winter are self limiting and disappear within a few days without any medical intervention.//////The World Health Organisation (WHO) has pledged to ensure vaccine for all to prevent H1N1 influenza A virus (commonly known as Swine Flu virus). Initial doses of 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine has already been introduced recently in some countries.//////Cancer is a growing problem around the world. The number of cancer patients are increasing day by day. Lack of awareness, diagnosis in the late stage, resource constraints to provide treatment facilities to the major population are contributing to make the situation more miserable in countries like Bangladesh.//////Postmenopausal women may lessen their chances of fracturing a hip by adding soy-based foods to their diet, a study from Singapore hints.//////Global Handwashing Day was observed on October 15.

They will communicate with the target poor and extreme poor people in the urban area of Dhaka city to provide them eye care services through disseminating necessary information, proper referral and other supports.//////THIS article is primarily in response to Mr. Billy Ahmed's article on 10 October 2009 entitled Afghanistan War: Can the US win? The writer, like so many others, painted a gloomy picture of war where US was portrayed as the aggressor and ordinary Afghans as the victims. According to him, the Talibans were engaged in a war of resistance and further US reinforcement into Afghanistan would only cause more US and Afghan casualties. The end result, according to him, would be a Vietnam-like debacle for the US and the West. He quotes a number of anti-war critics, as well as a Leading Islamic Scholar in USA named Imam Zaid Shakir, whose prescription for President Obama to end the war in Afghanistan was to blame it on Bush and get out. I would argue that despite the bad news coming out of Afghanistan, all is not lost. //////The things that are currently happening in Pakistan are unbelievable. Suicide and ordinary bombings causing deaths and destruction that are breaking news elsewhere are ordinary news in Pakistan. But the attack by the militants on the army headquarter in Rawalpindi early this month is absurd even by Pakistani standards. The militants followed the Rawalpindi attack with three attacks simultaneously carried out in Lahore on top security installations that have underscored the tightening of alliance between the Taliban, Al Qaeda and militant groups in Punjab. //////AFTER the Second World War, G-2 (US & Britain) was replaced by G-7, then by G-8 and now by G-20. Decisions often made in distant European and American capitals have a direct effect on livelihoods for working people across the world; Bangladesh is no exception.//////Raana Haider is a spirited storyteller. And the stories she relates have all been part of her life, for she has been a pivotal figure in them all. She has seen it all. Her writing is fast paced and her diction vibrant and substantive. As you turn the pages of this work (it would not do to simply call it a travelogue, for there is much more to it than that), you understand the human understanding and the depth of appreciation she brings to her tales. For Fragrance of the Past is about the good times lost in history. If you have cared about Marco Polo and Hiuen Tsang and Vasco da Gama, enough to recall the world they saw opening up before them, you will read Haider. She subtitles her work A Middle Eastern Itinerary. In a broad sense, though, it transcends geography and reaches out to the ages of glory that simply do not happen to be there any more.////// is a disturbing book, written by a deeply aggrieved man. As things stand, Bangladesh is a deeply divided nation over a few serious, and some maddeningly asinine, issues (or, rather, non-issues), and the chasm seems to be getting wider and deeper. For the country's sake, one can only hope that sanity will return, and the ominous fissure will shrink before the possibility of a bloody internecine strife becomes a reality. And, lest one forgets, that very rift was a key factor in facilitating the kind of regime that prompted Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir to spill his guts out in print over the treatment he received at its hands. Notes from a Prison Bangladesh is a litany of complaints, often vitriolic, written in a no-holds-barred style, of an outraged person, that is true, but it is also a book that compels one to think about political legitimacy, constitutionality, and undesirable aberrations in the practice of liberal democracy.//////The blurb on the cover says that Elizabeth Gilbert's latest bestseller is One Woman's Search for Everything; this woman is Elizabeth herself.//////
