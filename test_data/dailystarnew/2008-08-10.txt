They are doing so in spite of the fact that their top leaders still remain opposed to polls of any kind before the national election. Media reports further reveal that sections of supporters of BNP at grassroots are also awaiting go ahead signal from the party bosses for taking part in the upcoming polls. //////PAKISTAN'S President Pervez Musharraf is certainly feeling the heat. With the partners in the ruling coalition finally agreeing put him through impeachment, Pakistan's politics is now in a new critical stage. When a new, elected government took over earlier this year, it was expected that a fresh new dawn had arrived for the country. Regrettably, though, the present crisis appears to be belying that hope. However, there can be no denying that much of the responsibility for how conditions have been turning out in the country must be borne by General Musharraf himself. His seizure of power in a coup nine years ago was a blow against Pakistan's fragile democracy. But what has made matters worse for his country are the steps he has taken in recent times to consolidate his hold on authority. His long reluctance to give up his position as army chief of staff and the brazen manner in which he went about dismissing the chief justice of the Supreme Court as well as nearly sixty other judges were moves that added to Pakistan's political instability.//////THERE is a significant saying in economics that the answer to high prices is high prices. It means, only higher prices could contain demand and augment supply. In consequence, the prices could go down. //////IDENTITY wars are raging both on and just below the surface of India. A few acres of land for pilgrims to Amarnath is not the real issue. The hyperventilation of Kashmir's valley politicians is even less so. These politicians, whose concern for Jammu is, to put it politely, less than emotional, are merely seeking to fertilise the shrunk seeds of a now arid insurrection. What we are seeing is street wars over rights and possession in a multi-ethnic, multi-polar state that has gone flabby with complacency at the top and corruption from top to bottom. Competing identities, released from any discipline by a democracy where appeasement has become the key to electoral success, are constantly trying to encroach across political and psychological boundaries.//////THE recently held elections to the posts of mayors and councilors have been peaceful, shorn of the irregularities that have been the hallmark of the many elections held in the past. The interim caretaker administration and the Election Commission feel that as the elections were held under the state of emergency, the mischief mongers aided by money and muscle could not interfere with the fair and impartial manner of the elections. The political parties and the Western powers, however, continue to insist on the withdrawal of the state of emergency for the next polls being held leading to the final transition to participatory democracy. //////Spanish climber Samuel Sanchez claimed his biggest ever career win when he claimed gold in the men's gruelling Olympic road race, held over 245km here on Saturday.//////BKSP pulled off the season's first upset when they handed a 1-0 defeat to big-spending Sheikh Russel in the Citycell Federation Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Kumar Sangakkara cracked a solid 107 not out to help Sri Lanka gain a slender advantage over injury-hit India in the crucial third and final Test here on Saturday.//////Hashim Amla stroked his ninth Test fifty as England were made to work hard on the third morning at The Oval.

The participating countries have sent their trained-up teams to the venue with a firm conviction to excel in different disciplines of sports. The big names are: The USA, Russia, Germany and the host China.//////At first I would like to oppose the term "Foreign Aid". I think it's not aid at all, rather a way of oppression. Moreover, before giving money (i.e. so-called aid) they impose a lot of conditions which are nothing but a kind of conspiracy against the poor nations. If we observe the condition of the poor countries like African Sub-Saharan nations as well as South Asian nations, we can get a clear picture of the situation.//////There is a stalemate prevailing in public universities. During the BNP-Jamaat alliance rule these universities were made subservient to the parties. In almost all the universities, party activists were made VCs. So, there were irregularities and corruption. But no measures have been taken to address those anomalies. //////Woods are vanishing from the country at a great pace. The recent reports on the mindless felling of trees in the CHT highlight the fact that the forests of the said region now only exist in the textbooks. No longer is the region dotted with tall trees that once drew the lovers of nature to that area. No more do the birds sing that used to build their nests in those trees. No more do the wild animals roam around.//////Unplanned urbanisation is the main reason for the loss of lives. The fire of Sunday midnight at Aga Sadek Road should help the authorities concerned to wake up before the city growth gets out of control. //////Your business report (August:01) highlighted the QED of Tata's on and off and on again heavy industries investment proposal. Simply stated, Tata possibly did not budge from its "no cheap gas; no investment" stand. //////In Dhaka city, uncovered dustbins are creating a big problem for the residents. Uncovered dustbins are found near the bus stands.//////It is a common scene that during the holy Ramadan some dishonest businessmen and middlemen try to raise the prices of the necessary food items as well as other products. Though the holy Ramadan is the month of abstinence and self-evaluation, but forgetting the moral or ethical ideals price is increased and an artificial crisis is created. //////I had bought a small apartment in Gulshan and have been residing here for over ten years now. The builders who are very well known were supposed to form an apartment owners' cooperative society after handing over the apartments to the owners of my apartment complex. It is now over ten years that the builders have done nothing about it and have been collecting service charges to maintain our apartment complex. The builder gives a damn to any complaint you make to them. As proof of ownership of my flat the builder has given me a share certificate of the limited company in whose name the apartment complex is registered. The builder is enjoying a hefty income as service charges from the 27 apartments of our complex. The builder has also leased out a part of the roof to a mobile telecom operator. Now I feel my ownership of the apartment is at risk and wonder whom should I complain to. I am a retired person and I do not have so much money to go to the court.//////Corruption must be criticised vehemently, and there should be no compromise on it. Otherwise, we will not be able to wipe out corruption from society. //////I have gone through the article written by Mr. Nurul Huda-- Quota System in Civil Service published in The Daily Star on 22 July. He tried to depict the features of the quota system in civil service under the PSC. He explained the pros and cons of the quota system, especially the effect of this system on recruitment. //////The series of extra-judicial killing in Bangladesh in recent times by law enforcers has again raised serious concern about the state of human rights. Even though the process, which was started by the BNP-Jamaat alliance government, was believed to be stalled when the present government took over, the reality however is that the process has not only continued, but has also been intensified in some cases. This is quite disturbing to people who love to see their motherland advancing towards the rule of law. We do not want to see that like its predecessor, the present government also wants to abuse power and show no respect for the rule of law. We do not want to see that the present government is merely a mirror image of its predecessors, like the popular saying Old wine in new bottle.//////Dhaka is the most densely populated mega-city in the world, no doubt about that and at present it is one of the dirtiest cities as well. Rate of pollution has also got a significant dimension. But no remedial measure has been taken so far. //////If you go through the Rikabibazar road from Subidbazar in Sylhet city, certainly you will watch something. About one thousand rickshaws are locked up on the field of Sylhet Police Lines. I noticed it first about four years ago. And the number is increasing gradually. Perhaps those are apprehended as illegal rickshaws and the owners can't get them back owing to legal complexities. The parts of those vehicles are getting rusted and losing their worth. //////It's a pity to see that the our countrymen are being deported from not only Kuwait but also a few other Middle Eastern countries and it is not the employers who should be condemned for this. We must remember that in business the customer is always right if we are to sell. It is very much our own men who must be condemned. In a country like ours, we ourselves are the real enemies. For the little extra benefit of ourselves, we sacrifice our national interests. When the neighbouring countries have their minimum wage scale, we could not provide our workers the same. It is only due to the corrupt practices of the agencies involved in the business and it is surprising that our government has never taken steps against these corrupt agencies, neither has it provided any security to the workers. //////While reading Shahnoor Wahid's column today (Aug.05), one thing popped up in my mind. That these "VIP jail returnees" would never ever feel slightest of shame for the reasons they were sent to jail. I asked myself "Why?" Why don't they feel ashamed ? Are they better humans than we are? Have they reached the stage of "Nirban" like other Mohamanobs? What sort of characteristics make them so shameless? If I were sent to jail( God forbid !) for even an hour, my family would never let me enter my house again. Not any one in my neighbourhood would garland me for spending a night in jail. But as Shahnoor Wahid has pointed out the "amjanata" will stand by the side of the road to garland these thieves. People will dance at their return, even knowing very well that these thieves and crooks have drained out the very lifeblood of the "amjanata". I do not think I would be wrong if I say that the problem lies with us. We should have been throwing stones and showering garbage and old shoes on the "returnees". But what do we do? //////The British Minister Mrs. Blears told the press in Sylhet that "election under emergency is difficult but not impossible". //////Nepal's former Maoist rebels and mainstream parties failed to meet a deadline to form a new government, leaving the Himalayan nation in political limbo, an official said yesterday.//////About 20 Taliban fighters were killed in a battle with Afghan and US-led forces near a key military supply route in western Afghanistan, a provincial official said yesterday. //////The United States and European Union are leading a diplomatic push to prevent all-out war between Georgia and Russia, calling for a ceasefire as Russian tanks rolled into a rebel Georgian province.//////The South Ossetians and Georgians have been sniping at each other, both with words and guns, for several weeks now, and patience on both sides has finally snapped. South Ossetia and Georgia's other breakaway region, Abkhazia, have had de facto independence since the early 1990s, but Tbilisi has never recognised the loss of its territory. The dispute between Georgia and the two regions was called "the frozen conflict" because the issues remained unresolved but there was no fighting. The ice began to melt, and the heat to rise, earlier this year when the west recognised Kosovo, against Russia's advice. The South Ossetians and Abkhazians argued that if Kosovo could be independent, then so could they, and renewed their struggle for freedom. //////South Ossetia, about 60 miles (100 km) north of the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, broke away from Georgia in a 1991-92 war that left several thousand people dead.

Written by Mahfuzur Rahman, the serial is directed by Chhonda Mahjabeen.//////Actor Brad Pitt has joined the cast of Quentin Tarantino's next film //////, reports say.//////ONE of the most commendable acts of the current CTG is the reformation of the ACC with its new leadership. Since its reconstitution, people had a lot of expectations that it would work independently and impartially with its reinvigorated mandate to bring to justice those who have betrayed the people's trust by plundering state money and have abused the state authority for their personal gain. After eighteen months or so, it is high time to evaluate how far the ACC has succeeded in meeting people's expectation.//////NORTH Korea's nuclear-development efforts have bedeviled US policymakers for more than two decades, resulting in international crises during both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. With the end of the second Bush administration, it's now possible to grade the handling of the current crisis in light of past efforts and understand the scope of the challenge confronting the next administration. //////AS a well-traveled field organizer for Senator Barack Obama, Jason Berry lives on Facebook. But it wasn't of much use when the campaign sent him to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. An agricultural region that lies just beyond the gravitational pull of Washington, DC, the valley is populated by rural Southerners who network the old-fashioned way -- face to face. So Berry's first move was to dispatch volunteers with sign-up sheets to the July Fourth fireworks celebration in Winchester, the largest town in the valley. Now he's concentrating on bake sales, barbecues, ag fairs and other get-togethers that remain central to country life. Berry's -- and Obama's -- goals are two-fold: to register and turn out supportive voters, of course, but also to create a web of locals who will testify to their personal belief in the candidate. "They're character witnesses," says Berry.//////HIS zesty attacks on corporate greed and inspiring plans national service are no more.//////In the midst of the hustle and bustle of Gulistan, one of the busiest intersections of the city, a small, beautifully decorated shrine known as 'Golap Shah Mazar' catches the eyes of pedestrians and commuters passing the area.//////For lack of proper planning and monitoring, the holiday markets and hawkers' markets in the city have become ineffective and failed to ease public sufferings.//////On a soggy, pouring Monday morning, around 40 commuters were sitting breathless on the cramped interior of a city bus.//////
