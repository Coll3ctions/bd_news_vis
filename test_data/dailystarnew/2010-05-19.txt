It was a time when the earliest indications of an emerging Bengali nationalism were to be detected. Sangbad, however, was not quite disposed to such causes in its initial stages, which again was quite understandable given the prevailing nature of politics at the time. And yet a moment came when Sangbad made that crucial choice of going for a defence of the cause of the Bengali people, a cause that not only focused on the need for a greater say in the politics of Pakistan for them but also on the necessity of a preservation of the heritage that underscored the Bengali social psyche. By the 1960s, it was Sangbad that was informing people insistently that the rights of the people of East Bengal could only be ignored at risk to the very state itself.//////Striker Zahid Hasan Emily struck twice as Mohammedan Sporting Club thrashed Sylhet's Beanibazar 4-1 in a Bangladesh League match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////The hosts' brittle batting gave visiting West Indies A a commanding position on the second day of the first four-day match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////Bangladesh will be looking to get over their shocking five-wicket defeat in the second warm-up game when they meet England Lions in a four-day match that starts at the County Ground in Derby today.//////"We have been doing everything to boost the players and bring about a resurgence in national hockey.

But, many of us still do not understand the significance of motherhood. If we could understand it, then why is a female child still unwanted ? Why a mother is tortured to death for the guilt of giving birth to a female child? It is also shocking that while killing the wife for dowry, a person forgets that his wife is also the mother of a child. I also do not understand why does a son become eager to send his mother to an old home? Throughout the whole life, a mother runs after her children. Why can't we look after them in their old age? There are many people living abroad who cannot manage time to come back to their motherland to visit their mothers. There are also men who do not hesitate to shift his mother from bedroom to storeroom or corridor. //////Dr. Abdul Matin, a former Chief Engineer of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, wrote an article in The Daily Star on May 5, 2010 on the government's policy of going for rental power for an interim solution of the present power crisis.

Meanwhile, proven and possible resources of methane, remain unexplored even today! Coal is there, but we do not extract it, except from one mine-- for so many reasons (or excuses)! In the case of extraction of coal, we ideally define the saying: "Poverty in the land of plenty"! We are shying away from it, be it by shaft or surface mining, while the debate on the subject has continued on and on!//////Your staff correspondent's front-page report of May 11th. stated about the "whitening of white money" by Khaleda Zia!

But in order of precedence at the national level, the professors have not been given their just status and accreditation. Often they get into embarrassing situations.//////The recent decision taken by the cabinet regarding the acceptance of MPO list is really controversial as the education minister has already finalised the draft, after a long analysis and consideration. It again proves that political partisanship is prevailing in the country and that is one of the hindrances to walking on the way to progress. In a least developed country like Bangladesh, education plays the pivotal role for the continuous development of the nation. So, our prime minister has to handle this issues overcoming all political considerations to take the right decision for enlisting the institutions. Education is a basic need and the present govt has to give right priority to the education sector. //////Along with two other friends of mine, I decided to travel to Sylhet for some specific business purpose and considering the hassles in road journey, I bought the Upaban Express first class ticket for 3 May, 2010. The train was scheduled to depart at 9:45pm. When we arrived at the station we saw a first class waiting room without any air-conditioning. There was a ceiling fan at one side of the room. The furniture were dirty, poorly maintained and occupied by the passengers or some other people who were not passengers of the first class. The washroom was equally dirty. For reasons not known, there was none to take care or check the tickets of the passengers or even clean the room. Having the entitlement yet we had to stroll out all the time instead.//////Recently, the European medical journal published that people working 10 or 11 hours a day are more likely to have serious heart problems, including heart attacks, than those clocking off after seven hours. The finding, from an 11-year study of 6,000 British civil servants, does not provide definitive proof that long hours cause coronary heart disease but it does show a clear link, which experts said may be due to stress. //////After suggesting that the powers of the ACC be curbed, I wonder whether the government is trying to promote a culture of being polite instead of pursuing justice. What other reason could they possibly have to justify such an unbelievably ludicrous protocol of asking for the government's permission before pressing corruption charges against bureaucrats? By attempting to strip away the powers of the country's leading anti-corruption authority against severe public displeasure, our leaders have once again made us realize that we, the people, are simply the means to an end; the pawns they need in support of their demagoguery so that they can get elected to public office. After all, does it really matter that Bangladesh is continually labelled as one of the most corrupt countries in the world today? Why not maintain that title and ask for permission from our leaders before possibly suggesting that they, too, are bound by the same laws as the rest of the people in the country?//////Manipulation and syndication are the major obstacles for the government to maintain price level of any item, be they industrial raw materials, daily essentials, food items, life-saving drugs etc. Stock market manipulation is a daily affair, for instance. We know the government is unable to apprehend pre-emptively on market reaction on any item, so it should have regular and constant watchdogs to monitor those sectors.//////We are the students of Jagannath University. About 23,000 students are studying here. The students of Jagannath University bear the identity of public university. Instead of giving the facilities of a public university, such as, students' dormitory, exam halls, required classrooms etc, the authorities of Jagannath University are taking the initiative to make it private. The so called  Black Section 27(4) demands that a university will run with its own income which is impossible and it is nothing but a lame excuse. //////A suicide car bomb that targeted a Nato convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, has killed at least 19 people, including six foreign soldiers.//////India's government is reviewing its strategy for fighting Maoist rebels after a landmine attack in Chhattisgarh state killed more than 30 people.//////Qaeda's second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahiri is planning to carry out a terror strike at the eagerly awaited Fifa World Cup 2010, a recently arrested al-Qaeda operative has disclosed.//////Contemporary world situation calls for close cooperation between India and Iran, Iranian President Mahmdoud Ahmadinejad said yesterday, adding both countries 'should not neglect the present opportunities to replace the dying big powers'.//////Torrential rains and lightning in Sri Lanka have caused the deaths of at least eight people and driven more than 200,000 from their homes, officials said yesterday as the weather worsened.//////US President Barack Obama has dispatched two of his most senior national security aides to Pakistan in the wake of the failed Times Square car bombing, a White House official said yesterday.//////At least 12 people have been killed in a bomb blast near a police vehicle in the north-western Pakistani town of Dera Ismail Khan.//////A Bihar court yesterday granted bail to former chief minister Rabri Devi for allegedly abusing Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at a public rally.//////The Palestinians yesterday stepped up their fight against goods produced in Israeli settlements with a door-to-door campaign to raise awareness of a territory-wide ban.//////The Palestinians yesterday stepped up their fight against goods produced in Israeli settlements with a door-to-door campaign to raise awareness of a territory-wide ban.//////Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari yesterday pardoned a key cabinet minister sentenced over corruption to block his possible arrest, threatening to plunge his rule into fresh controversy.//////Afghan and Nato rescuers yesterday located the area where an Afghan passenger plane crashed with 43 people on board, including three Britons and an American, an official said.//////The alleged leader of an al-Qaeda plot to bomb targets in north-west England has won his appeal against deportation.//////The BBC apologised "unreservedly" yesterday after a radio presenter jokingly announced that Queen Elizabeth II had died.//////British lawmakers met for the first time since knife-edge polls brought a new coalition government to power, but calls for the House of Commons speaker to be sacked threatened to cloud the ceremony yesterday.//////There has been a cool international response to Iran's announcement that it will send uranium abroad for enrichment after talks with Turkey and Brazil.//////There has been a cool international response to Iran's announcement that it will send uranium abroad for enrichment after talks with Turkey and Brazil.//////Japan won't be ready to resolve a row over a controversial US airbase when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Japan later this week, Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada said yesterday.//////US President Barack Obama's wealth in 2009 totalled between $2.3 million and $7.7 million, financial disclosure forms showed on Monday.//////US Middle East envoy George Mitchell returns to the region yesterday for the first time since indirect peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians were launched on May 9, officials said.//////Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott had the country's political establishment in uproar yesterday after an astonishing admission that voters often cannot trust what he says.//////Men are more likely to tell lies than women and feel less guilty about it, says a survey.//////Japan, like many countries across the globe, is facing huge challenges in caring for its aging population.//////A group art exhibition, featuring the works of 10 painters, titled Rooted Creativity-2 is now on at Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, Dhanmondi.
