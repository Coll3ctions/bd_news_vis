Of course, to much amazement and public outrage, the non-Bengali Bihari community in Mirpur and Mohammadpur refused to observe the general strike that was going on all over the province and even went around intimidating Bengali residents of the areas if they so much as expressed support for the Awami League programme. //////Two renowned Bangladeshis have been included in a list of 'Top 100 Individuals' who have committed themselves to improve the lives of girls and women around the world. //////Sajeeb Wajed Joy, son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has riddled Grameen Bank with allegations of tax evasion, fraud and illegal activities under its founder Muhammad Yunus, prompting the microlender to issue a firm rebuttal. //////Repatriation of the remaining 19,000 Bangladeshis who fled trouble-torn Libya and are now stranded in Egyptian and Tunisian borders, is expected to be completed within a week through joint operations by IOM chartered flights and Biman Bangladesh Airlines.//////The government on Wednesday shelved a so-called "fast-track gas field development scheme" that aimed to increase the country's gas supply on an urgent basis as Petrobangla failed to have any contractor carry out the task since September 2009.//////Nine alleged rapists of Serafina Mardi, an ethnic minority girl who committed suicide failing to stand humiliation, were sued yesterday with the first court of Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal here.//////A parliamentary body has recommended enactment of a bill with provisions of harsh punishment for torture and inhuman or degrading treatment by law enforcers or government officials.//////The Supreme Court seeks Islamic scholars' opinion on the status and application of fatwa in the country.//////Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad had lunch with the ruling Awami League-led grand alliance leaders at the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's official residence Gano Bhaban yesterday, the day after he lamented joining the alliance.//////A Dhaka court yesterday sentenced former officer-in-charge (OC) of Shyampur Police Station to five years' imprisonment for his negligence in rescuing a 10-year-old boy from abductors in 2003.//////The UN yesterday expressed alarm at a huge decline in bee colonies under a multiple onslaught of pests and pollution, urging an international effort to save the pollinators that are vital for food crops.//////Ten accused in Boraigram upazila chairman Sanaullah Noor Babu murder case were freed on bail from Natore jail yesterday. //////Once again, ////// is going to honour the Highest Achievers in the O & A Level examinations, to be held on Friday, 18th March, 2011, at 9.00am at the Shaheed Suhrawardy National Indoor Stadium, Mirpur, Dhaka.//////Foreign Minister Dipu Moni states that as many as forty three Bangladesh missions abroad are faced with a shortage of manpower.

Obviously, in today's circumstances there needs to be a change in the structure, as Dr. Moni appears to be suggesting. We do not disagree with her where revising the structure is concerned.//////Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has again warned of tough action against unscrupulous traders' syndicates and hoarders behind artificially hiking up essentials prices and creating food grain crisis in the market.

To all appearances, the prime minister's tough words have been lost on the coteries responsible for hoarding and various kinds of market distortion. Because so far the prices of daily essentials have hardlyshown any sign of coming down. //////In a war, a general can never look back. All his movements have to be precise and forward or else he could be victim of a fateful ending. Shakib Al Hasan's predicament, though not as life-threatening, is similar, when he will lead out Bangladesh in today's game against England, which is as crucial for the team as it is for himself. //////England captain Andrew Strauss has had enough of tight encounters in this World Cup and is aiming to nail down a place in the quarterfinals in today's Group B game against Bangladesh at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong.//////How difficult it would be for Shakib Al Hasan today is quite clear to everyone who has been following the developments over the last week or so.

It is said there is also a woman behind every successful man. Smart alecks often joke there is more than one woman behind every miserable man.
