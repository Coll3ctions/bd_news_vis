Absconding? Do these drivers not have a drivers license? Do they not have a voter ID? What explanation does the Home Minister have for such random acts of recklessness on our roads by these murderers in the guise of "truck drivers"? Our children are being killed every day on the roads, our citizens are being crushed on the roads on a daily basis by these "truck drivers" but we do not yet see a concerted effort by the elected representatives to bring these drivers to book. Where are the owners of these trucks? Take them into custody until they turn in the absconder; where is the police? Busy taking bribes? Now, we hang our heads in shame and apologize to the family of the Thai DCM killed in the most tragic manner on our road. The foreign embassies should put out an advisory to their citizens, asking them to refrain from driving on these roads, held hostage by the whim of the "absconding truck drivers".

While I said, 'Bangladesh'; most of them could not recognise my country. Some ended up guessing it was within India. I now feel happy that even the Princes of Thailand knows the country and loved to live a few days in a remote part of it.//////The dishevelled condition of BNP once again shows what happens to those who do not take lessons from history. The BNP thought power was their perpetual right and they did what they shouldn't have done. They misused both political and administrative power to gain anything and everything they wanted without caring a bit what people who voted them to power would mind. Now they are paying in full and many doubt if they will ever regain the position they used to hold even during their first tenure.//////Though we believe that proper education and a good result will enlighten a student's career, but when a result causes the doom of a student's life, then it is pathetic. The students of English Department under National University have to leave no stone unturned to get 45%marks in the literature subjects while they get around or more than 70/80% marks in Language and Compulsory English. So, why are they not given good marks in the literature subjects? //////It has become apparent from the deliberations of the Honourable Prime Minister that the name game is in retaliation to opposition's changing of over 200 names.

As the prices of these stuff are moderate, people have their share of these products of winter.//////We are astounded to see that even the law enforcers have been grabbing others' land using their official capacity. The Police Superintendent (SP) of Bagerhat along with two of his colleagues have reportedly taken possession of 700 bighas of land in Gopalganj. They claim that they bought the land in 1996. It is mentionable that they claimed to buy it in 1996 during the previous Awami League tenure and never tried to possess it.
