As a result, these sounded like a public relations exercise, for even though the intent might have been positive, it is the growing lack of coordination between the market players that keep hindering price stabilisation efforts . //////OVER the past many years, it has become something of a bad rule for many university teachers to go abroad for higher studies and then choose to stay back rather than return to their academic institutions. What emerges here is the spectacle of academics committing not only an act that is less than moral but also plainly beyond the bounds of rules and regulations. When these teachers go abroad, they do so on behalf of the universities with which they are affiliated full time. In a number of instances, the public universities expend a lot of resources, in terms of finance and time, in sending teachers for higher studies at foreign universities. The normal expectation is that once their stay at those universities is over under the terms of their residence and study, they will return home. Unfortunately, not many of them do. A few years ago, under pressure from such authorities as Dhaka University to return home or compensate the universities for their unauthorized stay abroad, some teachers sent in their resignations.//////TWO former generals, both linked to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, are afraid that the withdrawal of some army camps from the Chittagong Hill Tracts might lead to bloodshed in the region.

Both the groups used lethal weapons during the clash that lasted for about one and a half hours. Being informed, police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control. //////This is a matter of shame that the government is again planning to evict slum dwellers of Dhaka city. I admit that they do not own the land in which they live. At the same time I must ask who made them homeless? On many occasions rural Godfathers and developers made them homeless either by force or by cheating them. Moreover, the government acquired many lands in rural areas through acquisition as part of the decision to provide opportunity to the people of Dhaka city for housing that resulted in rendering many land owners homeless and they were forced to take shelter in the vacant lands of the government. On the other hand, due to river erosion, floods and other natural calamities in Bangladesh, the unfortunate people who became homeless and having no profession, and no provisions for food and shelter, migrated to urban areas and started living in the government vacant lands. //////Hundreds of thousands of people of Japan became the victims of nuclear bombing in the month of August. But we the most civilised species did not take any lesson from this incident. We are now busy equipping ourselves with nuclear weapons. We all now want to be world winner. We have not come to this world to be happy but to be big!//////Those who are opposing the government move to operationalise the CHT accord are simply showing their disrespect for fundamental rights of the ethnic minorities. //////A report published in a national daily by World Bank depicts that Bangladeshi expatriates will be able to remit US$ 10.47 billion in the current fiscal. The forecast has been justified with some favourable and unfavourable analysis and arguments. The figure as predicted by World Bank seems to be inconsistent with the present increase rate per year. The nation earned about 9.86 billion in the last fiscal. Our experience says that per year increase for the last three fiscals is US$ 2.00 billion or more and the country is expecting about US$ 12.00 billion during the current fiscal. //////Internet is the most essential thing in our day-to-day life today. Internet is the storehouse of knowledge. It is a great source of information. All the students need to use Internet every day because the course related various materials & topics are available here. But it is a matter of great regret that students of our country do not get enough opportunity to use Internet. At the university level Internet is needed for the students as well as the teachers. //////According to Abdur Razzaq , a member of our parliamentary delegation, India would not launch any projects that would harm Bangladesh. Really? How is it then almost every week some Bangladeshi citizens are murdered by India's BSF? India has been reassuring Bangladesh that such things will not happen yet they have been happening for years. Any other country would call these acts of war.//////When the manufacturers of medicines use such toxic elements which ultimately take away the lives of innocent children, we cannot take the matter so easily. Reports disclose that a pharmaceutical company has used Diethylene in their paracetamol syrup. We have been taken aback and horrified to know the news as this very element is used in tannery and battery industries. As a result, a good many babies have died. Some children also died in 1992. As the owners of the medicine companies are well- off people they cannot be given exemplary punishment. //////A write-up on above caption on the 24th July by Prof Habibul is absolutely disappointing. It shows neither academic depth nor it contains facts and essence. The concluding sentence is sarcastic. As a result, a serious matter became too simplistic in presentation.//////The RMG sector is being unintentionally weakened by the successive political regimes; as the labour unions are being politicised -- for vote banks and illegal tolls.//////Asia is a land of extreme natural disasters like earthquake, cyclone, flood drought, tsunami etc.). South Asia (Indian subcontinent) is more disaster prone. And Bangladesh is at a higher risk of natural disaster.//////There is no filling station for petrol, octane or diesel in Gulshan or Baridhara. The residents of these areas are required to send their vehicles to far-away Tejgaon, Mohakhali or Kuril for re-fuelling. From 5 to 10 litres of fuel is consumed for this purpose. The erstwhile DIT had allotted 2 plots in Gulshan for establishment of filling stations. How come these allottees built multi-storeyed buildings on these plots? If Rajuk can demolish 100 crore taka Rangs Bhaban, the multi-storeyed buildings built on plots earmarked for filling stations can also be demolished. //////The Arabic word Islam is derived from the word 'Salam' which means 'peace'. As a religion it stands for complete submission and obedience to Allah. It is a universal religion and its objective is to create and cultivate in man the quality and attitude of 'Silm' i.e. submission to Divine Will. 'Islam' is, indeed, an attributive title. Whoever possesses this attribute, may s/he belong to any race, community, country or clan, is a Muslim. Islam is a state of mind, a way of thinking and a mode of life. It is a complete code of life. Human beings are hungry for peace and happiness. But they cannot enjoy peace and happiness unless their physical needs, psychological needs and intellectual needs are satisfied. The world is full of material resources. At the same time, we find lots of people are immersed in a miserable plight. They get only a scanty portion of the vast material resources spread all over the world. It proves that mere abundant availability of resources does not alleviate human sufferings. Unless resources are justly distributed among people at large, poverty continues to pinch the people and they are bound to be deprived of peace and happiness.//////At least 105 unnatural deaths have been recorded in Gopalganj district hospital in the last 7 months.

Many students say that they hardly get chance to have seats in the library due to shortage of space.//////Some of our politicians proved themselves not trustworthy, so we opted for new political ideas of the un-elected caretaker government. Though rumours were there about some advisers, consecutive three caretaker governments passed honourably, thanks to the integrity of the chief advisers. But the last one headed by the most controversial President Prof. Iajuddin Ahmed could not keep the tradition of their predecessors.
