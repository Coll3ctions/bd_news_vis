Three decades after he rose to power in the island nation, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom has conceded defeat to a young politician who has just beaten him at the country's first openly contested presidential election. Mohammad Nasheed, the 41 year-old former dissident who has just defeated Gayoom, has promised that there will be no witch hunt once he forms his government in Male. That is certainly most commendable. And equally commendable is the grace with which the fallen Gayoom has accepted the verdict of the electorate following the second round of the voting.

All polls show Senator Barack Obama leading against Senator John McCain. Mr. Obama has a comfortable lead in Electoral Votes that determine the winner. Winning 270 Electoral Votes is enough, as there are a total of 538 Electoral Votes. If Senator Obama and McCain win in all the states that were won by Senator Kerry and President Bush respectively in 2004 presidential election, Senator Obama will win 252 Electoral Votes and Senator McCain will win 286 Electoral Votes. In that scenario, Senator McCain will win. But this time, Senator Obama is running very strong in some states that were won by President Bush 4 years ago. For example, considering a very conservative estimate, Senator Obama is leading by a comfortable margin over Senator McCain in Iowa (7 Electoral Votes), New Mexico (5 Electoral Votes), Colorado (9 electoral Votes), Virginia (13 Electoral Votes) and if Obama wins in these 4 states, he will have 286 Electoral Votes compared with John McCain's 252 Electoral Votes. //////Last week, we saw two unusual things, which are rather very disappointing. First, the pulling down of the sculptures of Bauls and the other is the cutting down of trees on Rokeya Sarani. These two incidents are interlinked with one another. The parties that protested the removal of the sculptures seems to have a very rigid understanding of the Holy Quran and Sunnah. //////It is truly vexing to know that there were so many negative reactions to the protests of the mullahs regarding the Baul statues. Not many days ago, the action of the mullahs sparked protests led by the country's luminaries and literary figures. //////"Survival of the fittest" is the order of the day.//////Bangladesh is a country with immense promise for corruption, and prejudice for patricians. //////General (Retd) H.M. Ershad was a dictator, no doubt. His nine-year autocratic rule and corrupt politics are still in the memories of people. But the reality is he is now a factor in Bangladesh politics. His is the third force after the two major parties and the polarization of politics in Bangladesh increases his demand particularly to the two major parties. And I think the Awami League is doing the right thing to accommodate General Ershad into their alliance. //////We would like to appreciate the concern expressed by you regarding making all out efforts for the immediate release of two abducted BRAC officials in Afghanistan through your editorial entitled, Kidnapped BRAC staff in Afghanistan: Make all out efforts for their immediate release. which was published on October 28. //////The derailed train is back on "Election Moha Sarak"-Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman.

US Ambassador and US Aid officials have raised serious issues about mismanagement in our agriculture ministry, as reported in a local English daily on October 23rd. The matter needs to be clarified by the government, and the public needs to be informed on these serious issue. //////Refer to the DS editorial on institutional corruption in BTTB. You have expressed surprise on the scale of corruption in public offices and cited example of using 122 labourers to fix a toilet pan and lack of accountability. This is not the only one of such amazing examples. All public utility departments like gas, water, electricity, municipality etc. are dens of open-air corruption and there is no accountability anywhere in those offices. There is a saying that the table, chairs and files of Titas Gas office take bribes. Nothing comes out without greasing of the hands of officials of those offices. //////I think Bangladesh Bank's recent move to circulate the Tk 1,000 note is not a good decision. How many people will be benefited from this decision is a matter of doubt. Only a few people, I guess. //////Many doctors fail to detect the initial stage of GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) that effects an estimated one of 3 in every 100,000 persons annually in the USA. It can strike any race, any age, but its incidence rate increases with age. GBS may occur within days or weeks after a viral infection such as influenza (flu) diarrhoea. It may be triggered by pregnancy or a medical procedure, such as a vaccination or minor surgery. Since the cause of GBS is unknown, there's no way to prevent the disease from coming in its most severe form. GBS is a medical emergency and may require hospitalisation.
