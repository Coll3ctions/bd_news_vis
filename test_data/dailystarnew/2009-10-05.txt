It is this second aspect of the BBC-sponsored dialogue which causes concern.

Apart from aforesaid rationale other causes of non-compliance are lack of awareness, officials' harassments, complicated law, reluctance to disclose income and assets, venal tax officials, nepotism, high compliance cost and political pressure and so forth. Tax accounts for 80% of the revenue receipts while remaining 20% is derived from other sources. There are very few citizens who pay their income tax to the government while most of us are evading it due to mainly complicated and inconvenient process, lack of awareness and lack of stringent actions against tax evaders. Let us come to the main point: our prime minister has pledged to digitalize Bangladesh by 2021 which needs not only the governments' honest all out efforts but also the assistance of its citizens to make the dream come true. There is no doubt that economic strength is the number one requirement to see Bangladesh as a digital nation.
