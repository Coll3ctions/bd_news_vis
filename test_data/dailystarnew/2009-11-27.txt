The December 1 issue of Star Lifestyle will be dropped due to the holiday.//////AS we prepare to celebrate Eid-ul-Azha, we are reminded once again of the purity which comes of an observance of religious duties. For on Eid-ul-Azha we do not simply sacrifice animals as a matter of routine; we bring into that sacrifice a careful recalling of the spirit which must go into it. This observance of religious tradition brings with it the cardinal lesson of faith being a constant remembrance of the munificence which comes our way from the Creator of the universe. And because of that munificence, the responsibility devolves on us to put ourselves in relation to our neighbours, our families, indeed to everyone in order for us to understand the sufferings and the various compulsions that people less fortunate than we are often victim to. Our priorities on Eid-ul-Azha are, therefore, clear: on this noble occasion, it is for us to bear in mind the welfare, or the need for it, of others. And within that category of people come the poor, the destitute and the desperate. Eid-ul-Azha loses meaning when these men and women are forgotten or ignored.//////THE government's decision to arrange an additional package of TK 10 billion for the export sector is a commendable one to help out the recession-hit foreign exchange earning business.

Its low-lying coastal area is the most vulnerable to sea level rise, cyclone, tidal surges and salinity intrusion. Coastal infrastructures including embankments, polders, power generation centre etc. are severely affected by climate induced natural disasters. IPCC Fourth Assessment Report shows that the frequency and intensity of these disasters will be increased due to the changes in climatic system. This means these infrastructure would be affected more severely.//////We have numerous problems. Shall I name some? Well, the much talked about traffic jam, terrorism (not by international terrorists but by our own fellows), water logging due to blockage of sewerage lines, shortage of drinking water all over the country, shortage of electricity, unemployment, 10 feet solid silt due to polythene on the river bed of the river Buriganga and so on.

Interestingly, the statement did not explain anything about the person, whether he was pronounced guilty or not, the extent of punishment he was handed down by the court etc. We believe, the Hon'ble President even if he has powers to waive in some cases, he hardly exercises such powers except some extreme cases where the state interest is bigger than that of an individual.//////The World Summit on Food Security was held in Rome, Italy, from 16 to 18 November 2009. The FAO says the worldwide food security situation has worsened and continues to pose a severe threat.

In many cases this special setting can be made at home for the disabled. Special means that type of education, which meets all necessary things with special equipment, environment, management, techniques, aids and also methods for dealing with the special child. A child learns by seven senses that are tactile, visual, auditory, vestibule, gustatory, taste and proprioception when these senses are properly integrated. All sensations are properly integrated when they get proper stimulation and environment. An Occupational Therapist works with hypo or hyper responsive child who cannot learn in the normal environment. So an Occupational Therapist helps to make a special environment and a special education programme.//////Although I don't agree with our Prime Minister and her party on many issues (as a matter of fact with most of the politicians in our country), however my hats off to her for the way she and her government dealt with the Bangabandhu Murder trial. She has been in power for the second time and could have easily taken the path of revenge through military tribunal and hastened the trial. But instead of that she believed in the legal process and let things happen accordingly. At the end of the day this was a moral victory for our society and a sign that still the rule of law exists. It is true that corruption, nepotism and lawlessness are the permanent warts on our social fabric and it is questionable how much justice she could have gained had she been an ordinary citizen, but this is still a breath of fresh air. //////Since there are no immediate plans in the government's mind to start construction of new roads in the next 06-12 months to combat traffic congestion, what they can do is put barricades in different residential areas to control the entry and exit of traffic to the main roads. Like they have in some areas (though not used). Two of the gates/entry points will be used only for entrance and two can be used for exit purpose only. This can be implemented in all the so-called residential areas we have, including Dhanmondi and Gulshan with one way traffic in-between the demarcated area. For example if someone wants to enter Dhanmondi, he can use road # 27 and take the 1st left turn (HSBC Bank) or 2nd left turn (Nandos point) from the eastern side (Rapa Plaza) to enter Dhanmondi and go to different directions and leave Dhanmondi from the southern side which is road # 2 going towards the Mirpur Road.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////China announced its first targets for limiting carbon emissions on Thursday, joining the United States in revealing the stance it will take at next month's high-stakes climate summit.//////UN atomic watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei said yesterday he was "disappointed" by Iran's lack of response to a compromise nuclear fuel deal.//////Israel's foreign minister said yesterday it is up to the Palestinians to decide whether to resume Middle East peace talks now that Israel has announced a settlement freeze.//////UN chief Ban Ki-moon is to lead a charge in a Commonwealth summit starting today toward a global climate deal that will be discussed in Copenhagen in two weeks' time.//////Flooding caused by heavy downpours in western Saudi Arabia have killed 48 people while another 900 were rescued from swirling waters, the civil defence authority said yesterday.//////Nasa is proposing to build a robotic rocket-plane to explore Mars from the air, and has advertised for help building it.//////Leading Iranian reformist, Behzad Nabavi, has been sentenced to six years in prison for his part in June demonstrations but was granted bail pending a possible appeal, his lawyer told AFP on Thursday.//////Pakistan stepped up warnings yesterday that an expected US decision to send tens of thousands more soldiers to Afghanistan could destabilise its insurgency-ridden southwest.//////People drawn from all walks of life lit candles and attended memorial services and National Security Commandos and the police paraded the streets as India observed the first anniversary of terror attacks on Mumbai on this day leaving 166 people dead. //////Rounding up his four-day visit of Washington before heading for Trinidad to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh on Wednesday said that he had received a reassurance from US President Barack Obama that the reference to South Asia (India and Pakistan) in last week's US-China joint statement did not mean that Washington or Beijing would interfere in the affairs of these nations.//////Sri Lanka's main opposition party said yesterday it would back former military chief Sarath Fonseka in his bid to unseat President Mahinda Rajapakse in upcoming elections.//////Former British prime minister Tony Blair's government knew ten days in advance before declaring war on Iraq that Saddam Hussein did not have access to weapons of mass destruction, according to the inquiry into the war.//////India said Wednesday that it expected the United States to lift "significant" restrictions on American technology transfer to the Asian giant following talks between leaders of the two nations.//////Mullah Mohammad Omar, leader of Afghanistan's Taliban militia, on Wednesday rejected a call from President Hamid Karzai for peace talks, in a statement issued ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid-ul-Azha.//////In a new research, a team of scientists has determined that eating less meat may help save planet Earth, as well as reduce the risk of heart attacks in humans.//////The United Nations inquiry commission probing the assassination of former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto has sought a three-month extension from the Pakistan government.//////Military-ruled Myanmar's rebel ethnic groups are increasingly cashing in on their illegal drugs hordes on expectations of a junta crackdown, a UN representative said yesterday.//////Lok Sabha was adjourned Thursday following an uproar in the house by Trinamool Congress and Left parties over violent clashes in West Bengal's Hooghly district that left one man dead and five injured.//////Carefree, exuberant and thrilled by all she saw, Minu Haque was a complete extrovert as a child.
