//////It would not be an exaggeration to say that Rabindranath Tagore was one of the greatest Bengali playwrights. Apart from his poems, songs, novels and short stories, Tagore's mastery as a playwright is equally admired. Nearly 40 short and full-length plays by Tagore initiated a new era of Indian theatre.//////Tagore's Gitanjali celebrates its centenary this year. There is confusion here, however.

It is now a major weed in many regions of the Palaeotropics where it invades natural and agricultural ecosystems. The plants can grow individually in clumps or as dense thickets, crowding out more desirable species. It may grow up to 6 ft high and may spread to 8 ft as a climber with the help of a support. Leaves and stems are rough, hairy and secrete an unpleasant odour like cat pee when crushed. In the tropics lantana is a non-stop bloomer. Flower colour ranges from white to yellow, orange to red, pink to rose in unlimited combinations. In addition, the flower colour usually changes with the change of age. //////IN the recently concluded SAARC (the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) Summit in Thimphu, the SAARC leaders called for focus to be laid upon water management and conservation and development of cooperative projects at regional level in terms of exchange of best practices and knowledge, capacity building and transfer of eco-friendly technologies. Also the Convention on Cooperation on Environment aims at promoting regional cooperation in preserving the environment and mitigating the impacts of the climate change (The Daily Star, April 30). This is a promising start and I am focusing my attention on how SAARC can play an important role in reducing vulnerability to water-related disasters. //////Standing at the foot of the snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas, Rabi felt an overpowering sense of freedom. This was the first time in his young life that he had ventured outside the protected confines of his princely home and was amidst the natural surroundings he loved. He was only eleven then. Strangely enough, this would also be one of those treasured periods of time he would get to spend with his father Maharshi Devendranath. Rabi, in his later life, would call his childhood a period of 'servocracy' since he had grown up more under the tutelage of family servants than his parents. This trip to Shantiniketan and the Himalayas with his father was, therefore, all the more special to him.//////A daylong conference on children's literature in March this year came in combination with a creative writing workshop.

An estimated 300 million people are currently living with asthma and another 100 million will be added by 2025. Majority of these numbers are attributed to children as asthma likely to develop in childhood. Knowing information and simple procedures can make a big difference to such childrens life. As a parent, caregiver, brother, sister, relative, we should help these children to lead a healthy life by controlling asthma.//////Thalassaemia is a common genetic disorder in Bangladesh which requires lifelong regular blood transfusion at 2-4 weeks interval. Repeated blood transfusion results in toxic iron accumulation in the body, which in turn damages vital organs like heart, liver and pancreas. Therefore these patients require regular treatment with expensive iron chelating drugs. The overall treatment is burdensome, painful and destroys the economic prospect of an affected family.//////U.N. Health bodies called for more research and clinical trials to close gaps in the market for children's medicines that cost millions lives in developing countries each year.//////Climate change is the latest threat to the world's growing HIV/AIDS epidemic, according to a group of Australian experts.

It brought together at present estimate 1.6 billion impoverished people with the promise of a better future through regional cooperation. //////HISTORY taught us that through the passage of time hard earned sovereignty of a nation, state, empire, colony, union or even a republic could eventually crumble. We are not a union like the former USSR or a republic like the USA. We are a sovereign state with maximum homogeneity in terms of ethnicity and culture. However, it still remains vulnerable like all others, barely surviving or crawling towards maturity. To retain its sovereignty, a nation must possess a strong, tangible and intangible ideological platform. This is the area where feeble states perform poorly and eventually succumb. Enlightened leadership with sound civil and military bureaucracy and a professional and patriotic intelligence apparatus can strengthen the foundation and help keep a nation go forward. //////The United States revealed for the first time May 3 that it has a total of 5,113 nuclear warheads in its stockpile, saying the move would bolster arms control efforts.//////The Indian Army wants to equip its troops with missiles that can loiter over a target for 30 minutes, and it sent a global request for information (RfI) in March, Defence Minister A.K. Antony told the parliament here in a written response.//////France wants Syria to guarantee security on its border with Lebanon, Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Sunday after Israel accused Damascus of supplying missiles to Hezbollah.//////THE growth of Bengali nationalism in pre-1971 Pakistan had a whole lot to do with the various struggles put up by students and teachers of Dhaka University. And that was clearly a reason why during the War of Liberation the university would be made the target of the Pakistan army's particular wrath. That, of course, is an obvious truth. But what Rangalal Sen, Dulal Bhowmik and Tuhin Roy have come forth with in this work is a comprehensive study of the role Dhaka University has played in the shaping of Bengali nationalistic aspirations, beginning especially with the Language Movement of 1952. That is quite a departure from the title of the work. At the same time, for all the stress on the role played by Dhaka University and Calcutta University during Bangladesh's war for liberty in 1971, information on the contributions of the latter does not much go beyond an enumeration of the efforts its academics and students made towards assisting the Bengali movement. But, to be sure, it is invaluable information, a necessary reminder to Bengalis inhabiting the people's republic of the powerful wave of support that had come their way in clearly the darkest moment of their collective life.////// is a book about Karachi, the spider plant city where you might find, according to the narrator, fossilized footprints of Alexander the Great. It is a heartbreaking love story, depicts the ethnic conflict which pervades Pakistani society and yet at the same time the resilience of its people. The story revolves around four friends and their lives in Karachi during 1971, which they call the 'Civil War'. The couples Zafar and Maheen, Yasmin and Ali swap their partners. While they handle the situation somehow, it is their children who can't accept the fact that one of their parents had betrayed the other. //////
