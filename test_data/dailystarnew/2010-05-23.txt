The five-year deal comes at a time when Bangladesh happens to be going through a severe crisis in the power sector. Obviously, this deal will go a considerable way in reducing our critical dependence on gas-fuelled electricity. Considering the difficulties Bangladesh has been passing through in the power sector for years together, the deal is a bold and feasible step that promises dividends in our energy sector. Given that nuclear cooperation with Moscow is not a new phenomenon in our part of the world (one recalls the deal reached by the former Soviet Union and the then Pakistan in 1960), the Dhaka-Moscow agreement surely introduces a new dimension to bilateral cooperation in our part of the world. For Dhaka, it signifies a new direction in energy policy prioritization and diversification.//////THIS is a long overdue piece of admonishment that had to be sounded to the government-controlled electronic media the BTV which is financed by public money to serve public interest. And that it has come from none other than chief of the parliamentary standing committee on information ministry Obaidul Quader makes the censure authentic and appropriate on the interpretation of the information ministry's role as well as that of BTV authorities which have been rightly put under the legislative microscope. BTV newscasts are for the most part made up of longwinded speeches of government party leaders in a monotonous and predictable refrain. //////Bangladesh were desperately hoping captain Shakib Al Hasan makes a speedy recovery from chickenpox after his side lost by seven wickets to England Lions on Friday.//////Rarely can a team have arrived at a World Cup with more baggage than France, whose qualification for the showpiece tournament was overshadowed by an outrageous handball at the expense of Ireland.//////Organisers of French Open, season's second Grand Slam event that starts here today, revealed on Saturday they are considering two options to increase the tournament's capacity: expanding Roland Garros or moving to one of three potential new sites.//////Brothers Union shared the spoils in a 0-0 with Shuktara Juba Sangsad in their clash of the Bangladesh League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Bangladesh A team will get their last chance to impress when they meet visiting West Indies A in the second and final four-dayer at BKSP in Savar from today.//////Sunrise Sporting Club drew 1-1 with Wari Club in their Metropolis Senior Division Football League at Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////BL College became Khulna divisional champions when they defeated Doulatpur Day Night College in tie-breaker in the inter-college Clear Men Confidence Cup football tournament yesterday.//////For the first time in 16 years, the tournament returned to South America, and not without a little controversy. Argentina was governed by a military junta that had come to power in bloody fashion and was known to deal with its critics through torture and imprisonment.

The euro fell in volatile trade on Thursday, staying vulnerable on concerns other European countries may announce regulations similar to Germany's ban on naked short selling of some assets. Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar were under heavy selling pressure as concern over policymakers' response to the euro zone debt crisis fueled risk aversion, leading to liquidation of long positions. The dollar got a safe haven bid against most currencies but extended losses against the yen after data showed the number of US workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance unexpectedly rose last week for the first time since early April. The euro stayed above a four-year low hit on Wednesday in response to the German ban, but traders remained nervous similar moves may follow, while broader concerns about euro zone debt problems further weighed on sentiment. Traders also said fears other European countries may follow Germany's lead and implement short selling bans pushed European shares into negative territory and exacerbated the falls in the euro and perceived riskier currencies. The euro recovered from four-year lows on Wednesday as traders covered short positions on speculation European monetary officials might act to check its rapid fall, though for now market players see intervention unlikely. Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday he did not see a need to take immediate action to halt the euro's decline. This was echoed by European Union Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia who said there was no need to intervene. //////Abu Nasser Muhammad Abduz Zaher has been re-elected as chairman of Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd, the bank said in a statement yesterday.//////National Bank Ltd elected Zainul Haque Sikder as its chairman at the bank's 313th board meeting yesterday.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured the World Expo in Shanghai on Saturday ahead of talks likely to focus on the sinking of a South Korean warship, blamed on North Korea.//////China is considering its first immigration law following a surge in the number of foreigners seeking to take advantage of the booming economy in the world's most populous nation, state press said Saturday.//////Wall Street's largest banks are readying themselves for vast changes in how they do business after a Senate vote this week moved sweeping reforms one step closer.//////Britain faces an "age of austerity" as the new coalition government readies aggressive cuts in public spending to slash the deficit, Treasury minister David Laws told the Financial Times on Saturday.//////Speakers at a meeting yesterday urged the government to implement court directives barring law enforcers from detaining any person on suspicion and torturing in the name of remand. //////The Appellate Division is likely to hold hearing today on an appeal filed by the Anti- Corruption Commission (ACC) against the High Court (HC) verdict that scrapped the 13-year jail sentence against Awami League lawmaker Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir in a corruption case//////Machinery and papers worth around Tk 5 lakh were gutted in a fire at a printing press at Sirajuddowla Road in the port city of Chittagong on Friday night. //////Detectives on Friday arrested a woman and recovered over 116 more tolas of gold out of 782 stolen from a jewellery shop in the city. //////The government should formulate an effective policy to ensure rights of the domestic workers and put an end to all forms of discrimination against them, speakers said at a view exchange meeting yesterday.//////Speakers at a seminar yesterday demanded steps to ban smoking at working places to protect women from passive smoking.//////At least seven people were killed and 25 others injured in separate road accidents in Madaripur, Magura, Satkhira and Brahmanbaria in last two days.//////University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman Prof Nazrul Islam yesterday said up to Tk 75 crore might be allocated for research activities in universities under the Higher Education Quality Enhancement Project (HEQEP).//////Dr Abu Raihan, country director of Orbis International in Bangladesh, has recently been appointed as the senior adviser to the Orbis Asia programme, says a press release. //////About 12 workers of a garment factory were injured in an attack by miscreants during a protest and workers of another factory observed work stoppage to press for their demands in Ashulia yesterday.//////Inspector General of Police Nur Mohammad will hold a meeting with Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) and Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) officials today in the wake of controversy over the accused arrested in connection with Sub-Inspector Gautam Roy killing case.//////Agriculture and rural workers yesterday placed an eight-point demand including allocation of 40 percent of the upcoming budget for creating employment opportunity for the labourers. //////Leader of the Opposition in Parliament and BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia yesterday cautioned that the country's sovereignty would be at stake if the government allows Indian soldiers to guard its High Commission (HC) in Dhaka.//////Erosion by the rivers flowing through Kurigram and Netrakona districts has taken a serious turn as water levels of the rivers marked a sharp rise due to torrential rain in the last two days and onrush of water from hills across the borders.//////Police raided five dormitories of Government BL University College at Daulatpur in Khulna city and recovered lethal weapons on Friday night. //////A woman who received severe burn injuries at the house of her in-laws in the city on Friday night died at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) yesterday morning. //////Bangladesh National Federation of the Deaf formed a human chain in front of Patuakhali press club yesterday protesting alleged attempt to grab land of a hearing impaired expatriate. //////Robbers looted at least six houses while villagers and law enforcers caught five in separate incidents on Friday.//////Members of the Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) launched a special drive at Pangasha launch ghat in Bhola early yesterday and seized about one lakh litres of stolen diesel and 12 oil tankers and arrested eight members of an oil pilferage gang.//////The environment of Bangladesh includes flora and fauna and their natural habitats. The greater part of the human inhabitants lives in or around big cities and this has helped to limit deforestation slightly. Nevertheless, the growth rate continues to amplify at an alarming rate and this has created huge demands on the environment and leads to destruction of several natural habitats. Despite the fact that quite a lot of areas are sheltered under law, a great segment of Bangladeshi wildlife is in jeopardy by this expansion.//////With the mounting global warming and climate change, intensity of natural calamities in Bangladesh as well as other parts of the world is increasing. A number of strikes, in dissimilar form of cataclysm, are swiftly escalating each year. Earlier, after ten to fifteen years, we would face a large-scale flood or cyclone. But in recent years, both in quality and quantity, it has increased in our region. The preparation to cope with such calamities, right this year, should start with allocating a reasonable amount of money in the proposed national budget. //////Education is always important for every nation in this world for development and peace; education enables a human-being to be a worthy citizen. Also, education makes a person more 'aware'. //////I moved to Bangkok a couple of weeks ago when the pro-Thaksin Red Shirts and the current Thai government seemed to be on the brink of reaching accord. In fact, I walked around amongst the protesters in their make-shift campsite in the centre of Bangkok's financial and shopping districts near the national stadium. The scene was tame; some of the tents had children playing computer games, women lounging around and men folk chatting amongst themselves. They had their own medical check-up stations, water supplies and a myriad of food stalls. The whole place had loudspeakers blaring live speakers from the centre stage only a few blocks away. The exit and entry points were barricaded with stack of tires, bamboo sticks, barbed wires and red cloths.//////Politicians in our country expect everyone to act as per the law and ethics but think these do not apply to them. How can the nation tolerate MPs when they waste precious working hours by raising petty issues? There is urgent need to uphold the dignity and ethics of public life. Just as we have provisions for punishing erring employees, necessary rules should be framed to enable presiding officers to summarily dismiss members who misbehave and disturb the House. People should also have the right to recall their representative if they feel that he disturbs the functioning of the House unnecessarily. When workers strike work, the principle of "no work, no pay" is enforced. Will the Jatiya Sangsad embrace that policy and cut off the perks and other benefits extended to the MPs for their walkouts and abstention from the House? //////The date was 19 May 2009. A traffic sergeant named Abdul Baset Talukder sacrificed his life while rendering his valuable service. //////I congratulate Rooshnara Ali for winning the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency seat for Labour. Her Muslim and Bengali background are irrelevant in this context as all the rival major contestants that she beat in this election were all Bengali Muslims. She won by 21784 votes against Mr Masroor of Liberal Democrat who got 10210 votes. The other major contestants were Mr A Miah of Respect who got 8532 votes and Mr Z Khan of Conservative who got 7071 votes.//////Inflation refers to a rise in prices that causes the purchasing power of a nation to fall. It has, no doubt, become a great concern in our country. It has affected our economy to a great extent as well. Our economy is no longer so dynamic as it was in the past. Due to inflation, our economy is now going through a transitional period.//////Eve teasing is a crime and it has attacked us like an octopus. In the last couple of months, a number of girls have sacrificed their lives due to intolerable teasing and they made us understand how helpless we are. Don't we feel that the situation is getting worse? Really, we have nothing to do about it. But I think, we have something to do. I do believe if we stand together, we can stop this.//////The Awami League is immersed in conspiracy theory, whenever anything goes wrong they smell conspiracy in it. When in educational institutions untoward incidents happen, the Awami League declares that activists of the BNP have infiltrated the BCL and they are responsible for it. We have become tired of this sort of irresponsible remarks from the government.//////The whole exercise of issuing 'Liquor Permit', by the Excise Department, is structured on lies, fraud and deceit! It seems that we officially issue the licences to prospective social and 'addicted' drinkers; largely Muslims, usually of the so-called 'high society' who indulge in this illegal vice to drink intoxicating liquor which is disallowed and prohibited in Islam! In a lighter vein, these licences can be compared to the fictitious James Bond the 007's, "licence to kill" issued by the MI5, of course it was un-written!//////Thanks to the Rtv for showing the video footage of a meeting attended by a cross section of people who strongly believe in the early trial of the war criminals. It is perhaps necessary to immediately form a small follow-up committee to keep watch on the progress of the trial that began on March 26 2010, and to keep the people informed of the progress. This committee should also identify the barriers including the role of the individuals and the political party publicly opposing the trial, on one pretext or the other.//////There is no denying that mobile has become an indispensable tool in this age of technology. Mobile has reached a major portion of the populace. But what is a matter of concern is that it has reached some people who should not have access to it. It is a self-destroying tool for the teen-agers who can't rein in its misuse. //////Serenity is lost in this world of urbanisation. This planet is heading toward a severe catastrophe, as the climate is changing rapidly. Where are the friends of humans in this planet of machines and vehicles? Aren't we losing them gradually? Where are the trees? They're being cut down, as if the earth never needed them anyway. //////Once upon a time I was very proud of being a member of the Chhatra League. I can still recall the day when I became a member of the CL in 1964. I was a student of class 5 in Dacca Collegiate School. I passed the golden days of my life at Dacca College as the cultural secretary of CL during the post liberation period. We had a motto and a vision, instead of tender manipulation and making money. //////A strong move is on against the ship breaking industry to remove this market from Bangladesh to other countries. Some NGOs are trying to protect the rights of workers and save the environment from bad effects of ship breaking. We support them. But we can not lose the huge prospect in the name of serving workers and the environment. We have to be more flexible for this industry. More than 250,000 people are engaged in this sector directly or indirectly. Every year the government earns a good income from it. It saves a huge amount of foreign currency by reducing import of steel and raw material. It provides 80% of the iron used by the steel factories. //////The BCL is the oldest student organisation in this sub-continent. It has a long and glorious history that gives this organisation an exclusivity. The BCL emerged in 1948 before the emergence of Bangladesh Awami League. In fact, most of the prominent politicians in the AL had a long involvement with the BCL. Their political school was BCL. It is so painful to hear that they feel shy with the present activities of the BCL. Some of them even said that the government was not responsible for its offensive activities. After the AL's coming to power, the BCL is becoming desperate. //////The present govt got a huge mandate in the last general election on the theme of "Digitalisation". They have been working hard for the last one year. But they failed in the power sector, that is the prerequisite of digitalisation. //////The increase in stalking and sexual harassment in our society is a threat to education and empowerment of women. The school-going girls in the rural areas are the worst victims of these heinous activities in our male-dominated society which can hardly be tolerated. Thousands of brilliant girls, being compelled, leave schools and colleges in the fear of stalking criminals who are used to teasing them on their way to school and college. Needless to mention, these types of news reports remain unpublished in the mass media except a few. These make poor parents anxious about their daughters. Sometimes they lose mental balance and even commit suicide. Who are responsible for their demise? Can we ignore our duty and responsibility? I strongly believe that lack of moral lesson and impact of satellite channels are mainly responsible for this. Moreover, teenage boys guided by animalism, the darkest side of human being, ignore the norms and other social values of society. //////Some of the survivors who crawled or were carried from the burning remains of a plane that crashed in India yesterday told of their escape amid scenes of horror and death.//////A 13-year-old American boy became the youngest climber to reach the top of Mount Everest yesterday, surpassing the previous record set by a 16-year-old Nepalese.//////Thailand's government said yesterday that two foreigners were involved in arson attacks on major buildings, unleashed after a crackdown on "Red Shirts" protests in Bangkok.//////Senior cabinet ministers, led by new Foreign Secretary William Hague, arrived in Afghanistan yesterday with a warning that Britain wants to withdraw its troops as soon as possible.//////At least 13 people have died in a clash between Somalis and Ethiopian forces who had crossed the border, village elders told the BBC.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton passed out teddy bears to Chinese children as she toured the Shanghai World Expo yesterday and carefully skirted the United States' many policy disputes with China.//////Iraqi security forces were sharply criticised yesterday a day after a car bomb in a market in central Iraq killed 30 people, in the worst attack to hit the country since May 10.//////Pakistani authorities were yesterday caught on the wrong foot as an anti-terror court hearing the 26/11 case was told that Interpol was yet to be approached for a Red Corner notice for Ajmal Kasab, weeks after they claimed the matter had been taken up with the Paris-based agency.//////Thailand's government said yesterday that two foreigners were involved in arson attacks on major buildings, unleashed after a crackdown on "Red Shirts" protests in Bangkok.//////The United Nations Command (UNC) has launched an investigation into whether North Korea violated the Korean War armistice by sinking one of the South's naval ships, the UN body said yesterday.//////The weeklong 3rd International French Drama Festival ended on May 21 through staging of the play Drums on the Dam.

Titled Guerrilla, the upcoming movie will be based on noted writer Syed Shamsul Haque's novel Nishidhdha Loban. //////Ebong Kanna and Firey Esho Behula represent two early initiatives at a time when digital filmmaking has been introduced in Bangladesh, says a press release. Overcoming several steep hurdles, the two movies are now getting final touches before screening. Introducing film songs to the audience before the film's release is a common practice these days. However, at every step of the way, both films have been so closely interlinked that the songs and a few sound tracks of the cinematic works are accommodated in a single CD. //////This month DS Caf will have actress Aupee Karim take your calls at The Daily Star office. Readers will have the opportunity to ask Aupee whatever they want to know. Call 8126155 on next Saturday, May 29, between 12 and 1 pm to speak to Aupee!!!//////NO doubt we Bangalees sacrificed many lives, and even the honour of our womenfolk, for attaining a free, democratic and secular country. We must not, however, hesitate to admit that, though the vast majority of our people participated in the struggle, the majority of us were ignorant about the concept of democracy because of our low level of literacy, high level of poverty, and lack of religious teachings and dictates. //////IT'S no coincidence that the first anniversary of the United Progressive Alliance's return to power should witness nationwide protests against its industrialisation policies, which are massively dispossessing vulnerable people. //////Asia Energy proposed to extract about 10-15 million tons of coal from Phulbari Coal Field adopting open-pit mining method from a depth ranging from 250 to 300 metres by removing 4,400 million tons of overburden (rock, sand, mud, soil) covering an area of about 5.2 sq.km. //////India is at war against formidable non-state actors.

Christmas commemorates the incarnation, Good Friday about Christ's death, Resurrection his coming back to life with a spiritual body, Ascension his going back to heaven and Pentecost of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the earliest disciples of Christ on the 50th day from the Resurrection. //////
