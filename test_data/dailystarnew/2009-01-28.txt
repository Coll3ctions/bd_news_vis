In those nineteen days, he was kept confined to his prison hospital bed, in handcuffs and in clear contravention of all norms of law and civility. The question here is why it took so long for the indigenous activist to be released. For an answer, one has to go to the police authorities. They explain away the whole sordid episode by informing people that the HC order was sent to Bandarban judicial magistrate's court, from where it took such a long time to reach Dhaka, by post! Of course the police are not responsible for the delay, but we wonder why a court order must take so long to reach the appropriate authorities even assuming that the order was first sent to Bandarban before being forwarded to Dhaka. In this day and age, with all the advances in communication, to suggest that delays are normal is unacceptable.//////THIS country should now be ready to demonstrate some assertive diplomacy.

Israeli is doing crime against humanity. //////Once again A R Rahman can easily be called the 'Mozart of Asia.' He has proved his calibre by winning the coveted Golden Globe for his refreshing music in much-hyped Danny Boyle's "Slumdog Millionaire". Rahman's journey from the ad jingles to Jai Ho for which he received the award, has been terrific, as he has given us revolutionary music throughout his career. Since the day when this musician was approached by Mani Ratnam to compose music for Roja he has not looked back and performed in a fantastic way. The Chennai born music composer is the first to draw international attention. //////The death of the leopard at a village in Kurigram marks the saddest day for the wildlife lovers in the country. This proves that the absence of a separate wildlife department has created a vacuum in the minds of the public. They have developed a negative attitude towards the wildlife.

Although there were incidences of sporadic violence here and there in some places, the overall situation was good and election was held quite fairly all over the country "except a few centres". //////When I read about the oath taking ceremony of the opposition and how the BTV ignored it by not telecasting it live, I felt a strong sense of anger and chagrin. Why should callous and malicious actions be allowed after we have gone through so much and presumably learned our lesson? Or is it that the politicians have not learned enough from the recent events and the election? It is absolutely absurd and unacceptable to resort to such behaviour; this exposes the authorities and reveals the depth of intolerance and immaturity on their part. I hope the government will take stock of it and ensure that such stances are not repeated. Such actions only taint the image and invite condemnation by the public. We hope that the new inspiring mandate will help the politicians understand that the electorate wants results and not mudslinging and blame-game. This election should wake the people up in charge of running a democratic government and make them realize that the country cannot afford to once again slide into corruption, incompetence and moral turpitude. So, to make sure that partisanship and bias don't become obstacles the government must stay awake with eyes wide open and remain alert at all time to what's happening around it.//////The ransacking in railway offices occurred simultaneously in Dhaka and Chittagong but in such a short time the link between the two events may not be established. The matter definitely needs in depth investigation; however within a reasonable time.//////Please note that the newly elected US President Barack Hossein Obama is taking oath putting his hand on the Holy Bible and Congressman Mr. Keith Allison is doing so putting his hand on the Holy Quran. I think this is the right commitment for each and every person sworn in public positions to serve people of their respective countries, as religious faith can refrain one from committing any kinds of crimes. Confessing or denying any crimes touching the Holy Quran is a common practice among the Muslims everywhere in our country and it is followed as a last resort when no other alternatives work. Many Hindus and Christians also follow the same practice as and when required. //////Congratulations on being appointed as our country's first woman foreign minister. It is a honourable and a respectable position. Now, you have been appointed as our foreign minister at a time when the entire world is in a chaotic situation. Conflicts between nations are taking place in several places around the globe. We expect you to play a constructive role in all such matters as our foreign minister. //////The High Court's ruling on melamine leaves much to be desired. What the court should have done is: //////I am a poor Bangladeshi national full of dreams in mind. After the general election held in 2008 I am starting to see more and more of such dreams. But now I am frustrated knowing that the newly elected MPs and Upazila Chairmen are going to get new cars for their use. I strictly believe this will be a very bad example for Bangladesh's economy and culture. //////Upazila Parishad Election has been observed all over the country last Thursday. The newly reformed election commission (EC) had shown great interest for conducting this poll from the very beginning. Interestingly, most of the political parties were reluctant regarding this election; on the other hand, EC has tried its best to prove that the mass people want this poll strongly. After rescheduling it has finally been conducted. But we have been astonished that one of the commissioners, by 11am on the day of election, has shown his great dissatisfaction towards the performance. In the afternoon CEC himself had showed the similar reaction. What does it mean?//////This is in response to the letter by Ms. Nurjahan from Chittagong on January the 11th. She attributed the epic defeat of BNP to three reasons (1) Corruption (2) The issue of war criminals (3) Price hike of Commodities.//////The recent maritime border disputes between nations have caught large-scale attention. Appearance of ships from Myanmar and India in the territorial waters of Bangladesh has also instilled a deeper fear in the minds of the people of Bangladesh. Moreover, the treaty of Myanmar with the exploring companies of South Korea, India and China to export gas from the Rakhine coastal region, near the border of Bangladesh, could yet again bring up the issue in the spotlight. It is high time for the newly elected government to go for a tripartite discussion with India and Burma instantaneously so that the concerned countries maintain and stay within the picture-frame of their country. Since we have not much dealt with the issues of maritime borders including strategic sea resources, government should immediately create a team of experts to settle all sorts of maritime and territorial matters particularly with India and Myanmar. Delay may lead the government to get stranded with the blame for being soft on India and the so-called India factor might unnecessarily hit the headlines again. Only political will and leadership of the concerned countries can solve the issues. //////The US has deducted $55 million out of the $156 million bill set by Pakistan for rendering its military services to fight against Taliban and al-Qaeda in volatile bordering tribal areas adjacent to war-torn Afghanistan.//////President Barack Obama on Tuesday chose an Arabic satellite TV network for his first formal television interview as president, delivering a message to the Muslim world that "Americans are not your enemy."//////Sri Lankan soldiers yesterday sipped sweet tea, smoked and chatted after digging foxholes in the town of Mullaittivu, the rebel stronghold that they overran after months of fighting.//////Thousands of US troops originally destined for Iraq have deployed south of Afghanistan's capital in the first illustration of a new military focus on the increasingly difficult fight in the South Asian nation, Nato said yesterday.//////A Palestinian was shot dead and an Israeli soldier reportedly killed in a blast yesterday as the deadliest flare-up since the end of the Gaza conflict cast a dark shadow over the new US peace envoy's maiden mission to the region.//////Two soldiers in the Nato-led force helping the Afghan government fight an insurgency were killed Tuesday, while five Taliban militants and two policemen died elsewhere, security officials said.//////Climate change is "largely irreversible" for the next 1,000 years even if carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions could be abruptly halted, according to a new study led by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).//////President Barack Obama's administration will engage in "direct diplomacy" with Iran, the newly installed US ambassador to the United Nations said Monday.//////A woman gave birth Monday to eight babies, only the second time in history octuplets have survived more than a few hours, doctors said.//////Art enriches and broadens our soul.
