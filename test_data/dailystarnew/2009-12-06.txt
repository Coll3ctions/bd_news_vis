Targeting unarmed civilians, especially devotees belonging to another community in their places of worship, only proves that the perpetrators have no respect for human life and religion in general.//////LAWMAKERS are people's elected representatives and their primary job, as their designation implies, is to frame laws in parliament. Since the people of different parliamentary constituencies elect the members of parliament (MPs) through ballot, it's a small wonder that constituents expect service from them. However, there are different departments of the administration, the local government bodies and the service-providing agencies to look after the various needs of the people. The local MPs, on their part, play their roles by bringing to the government's notice where these official service agencies are failing or proving to be inadequate. A particular MP may raise the issue in the House so that the minister concerned may address it. In this way, the MP also pinpoints the areas under her/his constituency that merit special attention from the government from the perspective of development. The issues may also cover areas where the residents are faced with a problem that warrants urgent addressing. In fact, the constituents are wont to think that their MP will solve all their problems as s/he represents them either in the government or in the opposition. //////WE are living in an increasingly unequal and unjust world with the highest amount of wealth and highest number of people living in extreme poverty, who suffer from food insecurity, malnutrition, ill health, joblessness and social insecurity.

We are also facing the biggest environmental and developmental problem ever -- global climate change, which poses a serious threat to human security and civilisation. Rapid climate change is a man-made catastrophe.//////Fresh from a moral boosting 4-1 win over Bhutan, Bangladesh will be looking to confirming their semifinals berth in the SAFF Championship with a win against Pakistan in a crucial Group B encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////A spirited Nepal held holders Maldives to a 1-all draw in Group A opener of the Bangabandhu SAFF Championship at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Mohammad Sharif's splendid all-round show ousted star-studded Gazi Tank from the race as Victoria Sporting Club booked a super league place in the Ispahani Tea Premier Division Cricket League with an 11-run victory at BKSP yesterday.//////Bangladesh's Abdullah Al Saif earned 4.5 points after the end of the fifth round and shared second position along with ten other players in the 21st Telegraph School Chess Championship in Kolkata.//////The First Division Chess League starts tomorrow from 3:00 pm at the Bangladesh Chess Federation hall-room.

The recent strength of the yen had attracted the attention of the Japanese government and recent statements indicated that they were open to intervening in the market. The big newsmaker was the news coming out was the troubles of Dubai World, which had to reschedule its debt. This had a massive impact on risk aversion which had boosted the dollar in midweek, and the commodity market had taken a large correction on that day. However further positive news coming out of the US again boosted risk taking, which contributed to dollar weakness and commodities again gaining steam. The yen was on the defensive on Thursday on growing investor speculation Japan may take more quantitative easing steps to get the economy out of deflation and as prospects of currency intervention loomed large. Talk of intervention got a boost after Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said the yen's recent rise could not be left alone. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano later downplayed Hatoyama's remarks, but that did not deter investors from selling the yen. The yen extended its fall against the dollar; with stop-loss sell orders getting triggered It lost 0.9 percent in the previous session -- its largest daily loss versus the greenback in six weeks.

The population of developed countries is decreasing day by day for various reasons and for that they are recruiting people from developing or less developed countries around the world. Canada, Australia, New Zealand are well known in this regard for a long time. They are recruiting people in different categories like skill category, entrepreneur category and investment category. Among all these. they handle the most number of applications in skill category. There is an age bar to apply in this category. For example, 49 years for Canada, 45 years for Australia and 40 years for Denmark. Beside this there are some other criteria like education and work experience. If you want to apply in skill category, you should have at least bachelor's degree and minimum one year work experience. Most of the counselling or migration firms counsel the prospective clients keeping all these in mind. But above all these criteria there is another important point to make an immigration application which is the profession list. Profession list is always changing. Denmark has named the profession list as Positive List and Australia has named it Skill Occupation List. In most cases it is seen that applicants who are submitting applications on their own are not fully aware of the Profession list. There are some firms who are alluring all types of professionals to submit applications without considering the profession or occupation list. For that, candidates are being cheated. //////Titas Gas Transmission & Distribution Company Ltd is going to introduce prepaid gas meters for its residential consumers in the city's Dhanmondi area.

Revert to Bangladesh Standard Time, please.//////While the Amnesty International is deeply concerned to hear that Fatima Hussein al-Badi is facing execution in Yemen for killing her husband a crime that the Supreme Court found she did not take part in. So that international organization has called on us to commute the death sentence against Fatima Hussein al-Badi, who was convicted after an unfair trial and an unfair process. It also appealed that all the people facing the death penalty in Yemen must be tried in accordance with international standards for fair trial, including ensuring that they all have access to legal representation and adequate time and facilities to prepare their case and people facing the death penalty, like Fatima, must be granted the opportunity to appeal the verdict and sentence and the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence.//////I commend The Daily Star: Internet Edition for the front page coverage on the 38th Bangladesh Armed Forces Day observed on November 21, 2009, although one would have appreciated an editorial on that big occasion. //////November 19, 2009 is a memorable day for all of us. The reason is not unknown to us at all. We have won the battle of justice after 34 years. From today people will remember this day with full satisfaction and pride as well. Satisfaction is for the justice to the late president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members and pride for being able to erase the disgrace of the massacre of 15 August 1975. This day has also raised the hope of ordinary people for justice being meted out to the four national leaders killed in jail on 3 November 1975 and also the trial of war criminals. Similarly, it has made us more confident that our law has its own power to control crime and punish the criminals and it has regained the almost lost faith of ordinary people. Moreover it has changed the proverb that, IF IT IS DELAYED, IT IS DENIED because this litigation has been delayed but not denied. It's true that after a long time, we have got our desired verdict. //////Their role is appreciated whenever they come forward to strengthen the democratic culture in the country. The way they played their role in 1991,1996 and 2007 will be remembered with due honour. The introduction of voter ID is the most unique example of their commitment and sincerity in protecting the rights of the common men of our country. But I feel sorry when I notice how a section of the armed forces has been desperately trying to distort the history of their motherland. It was not their business to show who is our number one leader in the Liberation War. It is clear like daylight who led our war and under whose name the Liberation War was fought. But it was a willing suspension of a truth on which the country was founded. These ambivalent characters are always boneless and they are the beneficiaries of every regime. Now it is time to identify those characters to bring a change in different sectors, including Armed Forces. //////Terrorism is an integral part of South Asian landscape. It is now termed as the number one problem in the present world. Lots of people are the victims of its gruesome proliferation. //////The diplomats of our country are our representatives abroad. They are the most educated and are supposed to be sober and, of course, intelligent. They look after the interests and well-being of our country. But unfortunately some of our diplomats misrepresent our country. On an official tour to one of the South-Asian countries last year, I had to encounter an ambassador who even denied meeting me in his office. Because he was busy! Since I went to his office on a courtesy call, I came back dejected. We hear lot of allegations of our labour force from the Middle-East where they fail to reach the high ups of the embassy who remain 'very busy' there.//////A huge debate is going on in this page on the rickshaws, but no one thinks about the rickshaw pullers. Most rickshaw pullers are people migrating from rural areas. At present there is acute unemployment and hence an increase in crimes like mugging. No doubt there will be a massive problem if the rickshaws are removed because the roads in many places are so narrow.

Unlike the international war on terror, these are Bangladeshi citizens, on Bangladeshi soil, answerable to Bangladeshi law.
