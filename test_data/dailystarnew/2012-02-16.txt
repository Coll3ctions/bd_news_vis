It is limited and expensive, making it necessary to make the land we have sustainable. On the one hand, overpopulation, unplanned housing and industrialisation are creating immense pressures on the land, draining agricultural terrain of its fertility and productivity. On the other, the increasing effects of climate change such as rising water levels and salinity are posing a threat to loss of habitable land as well. It is thus imperative that we make the best use of the land we have. This requires careful planning, and designing and implementation of a comprehensive policy outlining how the land can be best used without damaging it further. When forming this policy, the abovementioned factors, not least of all the rising threat of climate change, must be taken into consideration. //////Chittagong Kings gave Sylhet Royals every chance to pick up their maiden Bangladesh Premier League win but yesterday remained the day for Mahmudullah Riyad & Co as they won by seven wickets.//////The biggest disappointment in the first week of the Bangladesh Premier League has undoubtedly been the empty seats at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.//////Duronto Rajshahi's six-wicket win over Khulna Royal Bengals yesterday have kick-started their Bangladesh Premier League campaign.//////A brace from Zahid Hasan Emily powered title aspirants Muktijoddha Sangsad to an emphatic 3-0 win over Rahmatganj MFS in their Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Alastair Cook hit a second successive hundred to propel England to another challenging score of 250 for 4 against Pakistan in the second day-night international at Abu Dhabi Stadium here on Wednesday.//////The most contentious aspect of the Decision Review System -- the ball-tracker -- is being put to test by the International Cricket Council (ICC) at the Cambridge University to establish the accuracy of the two rival tracker systems accredited by the ICC for the DRS.//////India's cancer-stricken World Cup star Yuvraj Singh said Wednesday he was inspired after getting a message from US cycling legend Lance Armstrong wishing him a speedy recovery.//////The dashing Chris Gayle will play his last match today for Barisal Burners against Chittagong Kings in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) T20 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. //////Mohammedan SC emerged unbeaten champions in the Cute 1st Division Women's Handball League with a 16-12 goal win over Dhaka Mariner Youngs Club in the final at the Shaheed M Mansur Ali National Handball Stadium yesterday.//////Riazuddin Ahmed Siddiqui Riaz, popular actor of the silver screen, is going to be the goodwill ambassador of Bangladesh hockey, it was revealed at a press conference at the Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF) yesterday. //////Shaheed Smriti Hockey Tournament gets underway at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium tomorrow sans the defending champions Sadharan Bima.//////The fate of Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club coach Saiful Bari Titu hangs in the balance after the AFC A-licensed coach failed to turn up at a team meeting called by president Manzur Kader on Tuesday following their 1-1 draw against Feni Soccer Club in the ongoing Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League.//////Two goals from Chile forward Alexis Sanchez helped Barcelona to a 3-1 first-leg win at Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday that put the holders firmly in the driving seat in their Champions League round of 16 tie.//////Superstar Lionel Messi admitted he was relieved to leave here with the 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen which puts Barcelona on the verge of the Champions League quarterfinals after the Round of 16, first-leg clash.//////Brazil could field Ronaldinho, Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso, a key trio in their 2014 World Cup ambitions, when they meet Bosnia in a friendly in Switzerland on February 28.//////Lyon secured a slender advantage in their Champions League last 16 tie with APOEL FC by beating the Cypriot underdogs 1-0 in the first leg at Stade Gerland on Tuesday.//////Carlos Tevez returned to Manchester on Tuesday insisting he wanted to end his long-running feud with Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini and play again for the Premier League leaders.//////AS Roma teenager Erik Lamela and 31-year-old Napoli defender Hugo Campagnaro have earned their first Argentina call-ups for a friendly against Switzerland in Berne on February 29.//////Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker has become the fourth Germany star forced out of the pre-Euro 2012 friendly against France because of injury, but coach Joachim Loew insists he is staying calm.//////Euro Famous Club drew 1-1 with City Club in their match of the Destiny Group Dhaka Metropolis 2nd Division Football League at the Birshreshtha Shahid Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////12-year-old Giada Scalise suffered a brain haemorrhage while watching a Juventus match on television last month.
