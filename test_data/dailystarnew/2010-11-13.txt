Reports in newspapers about kidnapping, assault and murder by addicts have captured the attention of the citizenry. The various types of drugs available in the market spell disaster for the country.

It's basically World War III with Barbie accessories. //////Climate change is changing most of our traditional agricultural practices as the seasonal cycle and rainfall pattern have changed, droughts have become more frequent, violent stresses of cyclones, earthquakes, prolonged floods, salt water intrusion are increasing day by day. The average temperature has increased in the summer while winter season has shortened. There are some projections about climate change that are matter of concern for Bangladesh such as: temperature would rise 1.30 C by 2030 and 2.60 C by 2070, the sea level rise would be up to three feet and a greater part of the costal area would be inundated. As a consequence 17 percent of total cultivable land would be affected. Three core people would lose their farms and homestead. Threatening the richest and most productive region of the country, sea level rise could have dramatic consequences for the economy of the country. Increased flooding from glacial melt, more intense monsoons, or more intense cyclones could also adversely affect agriculture in near term by periodically inundating much of farm land. Sea level rise under climate change would also result in saline intrusion into the river system. Several hundred thousand tons of grain production could be lost as a result of increased salinization from sea level rise. The Global Climate Risk Index 2009 showed Bangladesh as the most vulnerable to extreme weather events as a result of climate change. World Resources Institute (WRI) said, impacts of climate variability and change cause an additional risk for agriculture. Moreover, agricultural production is already under pressure from increasing demands for food. In this regard, the present writeup tries to find out possible alternatives of agricultural inputs to ensure expected yield of agricultural crops. //////Climate is ever-changing. The past million years or so have shown a pattern of glacial advances and retreats, changes in sea levels, changes in rainfall pattern and so forth; all having tremendous impact on the living beings at the time. Nevertheless, it's different now-a-days; when climate changes, so must agriculture and, as has been observed, man, as he is conservative in his agriculture behaviour. Consequently, any rapid change of climate, in whatever direction is bound to decrease food supply. But South Asia is a region of significant importance for its rich phytoplankton, marine and coastal resources, fisheries, and bio-diversity etc. Therefore, it is high time to save phytoplankton and bio-diversity in this region including Bangladesh. //////The 'Billion Tree Campaign', the combined campaign for tree plantation by Art of Living Foundation and United Nation's Environment Programme (UNEP) has been launched in Bangladesh.

Only a couple of hours back, he was in the midst of a roaring party. He was invited to a boubhat (post wedding lunch or dinner given in honour of the bride). The host happened to be a rich friend celebrating his nuptials at his plush, well-appointed Dhanmandi residence. As usual, Anwar enjoyed the occasion, feasting his eyes on a good number of glitzy maids. Also, he had managed to make the acquaintance of a few of those rare starry-eyed starlets. The sweetly fragrant memories of the party should be soothing Anwar's otherwise vulnerable existence for at least a week now. //////She sings, she becomes the song, she wafts in melody//////. . . and she rises, in sure degrees, to tell me she is//////Melody.//////She is my song, she is the melody I play on the strings//////Of my soul.//////She is my soul, the keeper of its rhythms, the arbour//////Of its wildest dreams and its purest songs.//////Diabetes imposes life-long demands on people with diabetes and their families, who have to make a multitude of decisions related to managing diabetes.

Likewise though outwardly today's Russia seems to be a tower of strength but in reality the political scenario is little bit different. The existence of some political realities can slow down the future development of Russia from becoming a super power. Though the realities are not so apparent but the impact of those realities can be very sturdy. The following points can draw a brief outline of the political tensions in today's Russia. //////Dannenberg, Germany: Protests against a train carrying nuclear waste from France to Germany erupted in violence Sunday as police wielding batons charged activists trying to halt the cargo's progress.////// from Bangladesh, edited by Niaz Zaman, presents twenty five short stories by veteran and young writers felicitously translated into English by both writers and academics, which gives a glimpse into the rich array of contemporary Bangladeshi writing to the readers without access or familiarity to Bangla. What first sparks the interest of the reader is the cover sketch of Tokai by M. Rafiqun Nabi that speaks volumes about the content of the edition. The simple sketch of a little village boy in traditional clothing flying a kite in the sky while modern day skyscrapers loom large amply describes the atmosphere of most of the short stories in this collection. The stories depict an amalgam of both the rural and urban life of contemporary Bangladesh. The stories are set in both rural and urban Bangladesh. In many of the stories, the characters move between town and village or live in semi urban localities.//////The novel Snake Dance in Berlin, written by Ronny Noor, was co-published by Orient Black Swan of India and Parama Publishers and Distributors of Bangladesh in 2009 with an attractive cover page. It is a kaleidoscopic view of Bangladeshis who lived in Berlin during the second half of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. The author was a student in Berlin during that period and so gathered practical experience on the activities of the Bangladeshis there. //////. That is one book you will want to read. It is about Thomas Young --- scholar, mathematician, philosopher, philologist, polymath and what have you. Andrew Robinson does a good job of it. Something stirs in the heart when you come across new books. And then something cracks in it when you remember you simply cannot afford to buy all those books because of the prohibitive prices that come with them. With all this twenty two per cent tax imposed on the import of books, you cannot argue with the bookseller and ask him why he cannot give you the tomes you need at prices you can afford. He too has a life and a career to plod through. Now, the queer bit here is that he is in no position to give you the book the way you want it; and you are not quite ready to spend all that money you happen to have at a given moment on that book you have been eyeing for a while.//////
