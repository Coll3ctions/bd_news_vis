Consequently, the HC taking cognizance of the gravity of the public interest issue has issued a couple of directives to the government for getting water supplied in certain specified areas of the city tested by appropriate authorities. Of course, it is for DWASA to supply potable water to the city dwellers but there are certain testing authorities that are supposed to periodically check on the quality of piped water. //////THE tragedy resulting from the collapse of a billboard in Gulshan on Monday raises a number of serious and pertinent questions. The incident has left two individuals dead and quite a few others injured. There have been similar incidents in the past as well and what happened after those incidents is that business went on as usual, with no one in authority worried about the need for corrective measures to be taken. Now, where the matter is strictly one of a putting up of billboards, it is clear that no specific rules are being followed and in fact the city corporation has adopted a policy that obviously does not take matters of public safety into account. Billboards are often put up at the most unlikely of places and in such a manner that they can collapse any time. Moreover, the corporation and the firms putting them up simply ignore the dangers that arise from such a cavalier attitude. No technical assessments regarding billboards and hoardings are made. What does become glaring to the eye is that crass commercialization is at work, with DCC only too happy to permit any business firm to publicise itself in any way it likes.//////When Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan turned up for the post-match presentation, the small crowd at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium welcomed him by clapping. The performance of the all-rounder in the first Test was nowhere near expectation. Rather his poor decision to field first on a placid track had added some extra burden on the young Bangladesh skipper. The surprise 'retirement' of Rokibul Hasan on the eve of the match didn't help Shakib's cause either. So, it was his team's fighting spirit that went someway in quelling the pressure on Shakib despite the fact that they went down by 181 runs. Also, some decent batting performance from Tamim Iqbal, Mahmudullah Riyad, ton-maker Junaed Siddiqui and none other than Mushfiqur Rahim re-established the claim that 'this young side is improving.'//////It was yet another comprehensive Test victory for England against the Tigers when they posted a 181-run win in the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium yesterday. But without any doubt the success didn't come easy. If someone is still apprehensive about Bangladesh's ability to push their opponents in the five-day game then he or she would be better advised to listen to Alastair Cook's summing up the Tigers performance.//////Junaed Siddiqui slammed his maiden hundred and most importantly played an ideal longer-version innings but it was wicketkeeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim who hogged the spotlight after his back-to-back half-centuries in the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.//////England's famed supporter group of Barmy Army were a constant presence over five days at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong and the group professed themselves satisfied with the result of the first Test as well as the environment in the games. //////Bangalore Royal Challengers defeated Kings XI Punjab by eight wickets in an Indian Premier League match on Tuesday.//////From the creator of the 'Dil-scoop', here comes his latest creative offering.

Tribunal Court yesterday sentenced two militants of Jama'atul Mujahideen of Bangladesh (JMB) each to life term imprisonment and 10 years' jail in a bomb blast and arms case of 2003 in the district. //////Democracy is a system of government in which people choose their rulers by voting them to power. Although we have passed thirty-nine years after our independence, still we don't see real democracy. According to Abraham Lincoln, Democracy is a government, of the people, by the people, for the people. We believe this statement is true.//////In the last two decades, there has been an alarming deterioration in the cultures within medicine. Prescription of unnecessary and expensive drugs, insistence on irrelevant tests and unnecessary hospitalisation have become common. Costly scanning procedures are used more for extracting money than for diagnostic purposes. It is time doctors restored the glory and nobility of their profession.//////I was trying to find the right English translation for the Bengali word marak, which pretty much describes sudden and rapid spread of deadly disease in crops or poultry. Anyway according to the Online Bangla Obhidhan the English translation of marak is Plague. Therefore I have chosen this word to describe a recurring phenomenon in the Bangladesh cricket team in recent past. I will call it the Plague Syndrome. Whoever is following Bangladesh cricket for the last few years is not supposed to be unfamiliar with what I am trying to say here. As per this Plague Syndrome we have been watching a wave of wicket-fall (basically one after another within a very short time) right after the fall of an important and early wicket. Most of the times it can be attributed to carelessness and apparent lack of commitment of the top order batsmen. There is no doubt that the Bangladesh team is full of talents and it will also be pretty harsh to say that the players don't have commitment to their country. However, when it becomes a routine in match after match there must be a problem. Cricket is a game of uncertainty but that doesn't mean that players won't assess the situation and chalk out a strategy and play responsibly. I think the Cricket Board and the players should take this seriously and try hard to find a way to avert this phenomenon again and again. I am not an expert on cricket but I love my country (like millions of other fans) and want my team to get out of this humiliating situation. //////It gives me immense pleasure to go every morning through the financial pages of The Daily Star where the trading of shares are printed in detail. Almost every day some write-ups concerning the various issues on share are coming up. Lately, a lot has been written about Grameen Phone shares. Both SEC and DSE are airing their news and views about the share of Grameen Phone and numerous mechanisms are being tried to contain the upward trend of the issue. //////Charity is a noble human quality. It makes a man or woman to think for others. It makes a person generous as well.//////With utmost dismay we observe once again that the same service extension has been given to a secretary to the government. We fail to understand the reasons behind the preferential decision while a lot of other competent officers are not getting any posting at all. Any extraordinary achievement, any great performance, any distinct contribution, what? Endowment for political tilt? //////In July, 2008 a renowned English medium school suddenly changed their curriculum from EDEXCEL system to Cambridge System without discussing their decision with the parents/guardians of the concerned students. The school administration first signed the contract with the University of Cambridge for the GCE O Level then informed the parents/guardians. A few of the renowned English medium schools in Dhaka city have also switched to the Cambridge system but they had trained their teachers through a series of training programmes organised by the CIE prior to switching to the new system. They also discussed the pros and cons of the Cambridge system with the parents/guardians a number of times before taking the final decision. Unfortunately, the school mentioned above did neither. They never sought the opinions of the concerned parents/guardians treating their students as guinea pigs while they threw the innocent students into a new system of which the school authority had no clue. The school administration warned their first batch of students (appearing the CIE GCE O Level in May 2010) that their Mock Test questions and answer scripts would be sent to the UK to be examined by the Cambridge authorities and only the successful candidates would be allowed to appear in the GCE O Level examinations to be held in May 2010. To our utter surprise, we discovered that the questions of every subject of the Mock Test, which commenced in mid February 2010, were exactly the same as those of the GCE O Level Examination held in November 2009. In fact, the school authorities merely "photocopied" the questions downloaded from the Internet. The school authorities didn't even bother to remove the date printed on the footnote of the original examination. Now the students are just memorising the answers of the questions of November, 2009 overnight and spewing them out on the very next day. This has become an absolute mockery. //////Name sometime matters, if not always. Especially, while naming important state organisations, no government is expected to go for controversial names, let alone those of the erstwhile military dictators. Again, when the apex court of the country declares the regime of a particular military dictator as illegal, it becomes incumbent upon the government to follow the verdict in letter and spirit.//////The BDR mutiny is a dark episode in our history. We mourn the deaths and feel extremely sorry for the bereaved families. The children of the army officers witnessed the gruesome killing of their beloved parents and other dear ones. //////Over the last one decade the sufferings of the people of our country are going from bad to worse due to erratic electricity supply and load shedding.//////It appears that Turkey is passing through a silent revolution; after the great Kemal Ataturk set the country on the course of development. Centuries earlier the Ottoman Empire contributed to the development of Europe; and now Turkey finds it necessary to turn East, as the EU has now turned into the slow lane.//////The exam schedule which has been published by the Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education is not suitable for the candidates. For instance, the routine of the science group can be cited. There is no gap before Biology 2nd Paper (Zoology) exam. The students will come under tremendous pressure.//////The government is always busy lambasting the role of the previous government. They are always beating about the bush, instead of accomplishing important tasks. We are about to finish our gas resources.//////In Bangladeshi political arena cheap propaganda, cheap controversy and exchange of cheap diatribes are very much common. People here not only enjoy such debates, they create tempest in the tea pot. The on-going debates could be heard and feuds could be seen between the two groups everywhere, at least for some time, as and when such interesting issues run in the field. The new interesting subject is Tarique vs. Joy. Everyone knows who are they. Both of them are our future leaders and they are being groomed to be our loving and people friendly leaders in future. //////One of our respectable senior graduates, Krishibid Rafiqul Islam Chowdhury, Chief Instructor, ATI, Dhaka recently put forward a proposal to name the road linking College Gate on Mirpur road to Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU) as Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University Avenue. //////The Parliamentary Standing Committee on the LGRD ministry expressed great dissatisfaction regarding service to consumers of water. As a consumer, I am sorry to point out that Wasa compels the consumers to practice unfair means relating to Wasa bill payment. The revenue inspector is the sole authority to dictate Wasa bill tariff since domestic consumers are to pay Tk. 141 for one cubic meter of water against Tk 461 for the same one cubic meter of water for commercial consumers. Wasa supplies water through one water meter to a building whatever may be the number of consumers of different categories. The consumers are unaware of their individual consumption while the rates are too high comparatively for commercial consumers. When the government is determined to curb corruption, the LGRD ministry may devise some means so that consumers are not victimised in any manner. Further, self billing like Titas gas may be practised.//////Very recently, yet another innocent life was taken away by road accident in Dhaka city. The incident is even more tragic as it occurred right in front of the deceased Hamim Sheikh's School. But we are stunned to see the indifference of the guardians of the students of the same school to the risks posed by violation of traffic rules. //////Even in the late seventies, houses in many places of capital Dhaka were mostly made of CI sheet, wood and thatches, seldom brick constructed buildings were viewed other than office buildings. //////We are really worried with the current political developments.

He was larger than life, in every sense of the meaning. //////IT is astonishing how Israel takes America for granted! Last week, as Vice-President Joe Biden was visiting Israel to jump-start the so-called "peace process," which in reality is a code phrase for all process and no peace, the Israeli interior minister blindsided him by announcing the construction of 1,600 new houses on Palestinian lands in East Jerusalem. //////I'M happy about what's been happening in the Bangladesh Parliament over the last two weeks.

The article discussed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's decision to enroll her only son Joy as a primary member of the ruling Awami League in Rangpur. The second line of the article posed the question: "But was this in any way a surprise to anyone?" Be that as it may, my question is: Why not? This young man comes from a legacy of political leaders and his grandfather Bangabandhu is the founder of our nation.
