We expect that all the students who have succeeded at the SSC this year will live up to their reputation as they move into higher education.//////Why such an innovation as blending plastic waste with bitumen to lay roads hasn't been brought up to the public so far? It is a question that naturally pops up given the multifaceted benefits derivable from it vis-a-vis the bitumen topped layers of soft brick fragments and brick slabs -- the conventional road construction technology. We felicitate Bangladesh Transport Foundation(BTF)and Practical Action, an international NGO, for their efforts in bringing to light the findings of the BUET laboratory tests and a study conducted by a team of planners, engineers and development administrators of BTF.

They are hundreds of miles apart, but I saw something common between the two. Kerala in the south is left of the centre and Gujarat in western India is right of the centre.

Gujarat is headed by Narendra Modi, a fundamentalist in Hindutva drawing inspiration from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).//////THE process of developing students' proficiency positively prevails in the communicative approach.

In six seasons -- ////// (summer), ////// (monsoon), ////// (autumn), ////// (late autumn), ////// (winter) and ////// (spring) -- the nature of Bangladesh takes on new hues, new appearances.

But fire threatens life.//////-Dr. M. F. Haque//////I woke up feeling wired. It had been a rough session the night before. Moti and some of his friends came over and they brought a shitload of pills with them. We stayed up most of the night chasing and watching the Matrix movies. It was a lot of fun but after they had all left to go back to their homes it was a real messed-up morning for me. //////Working in London, connected with Bangladesh via the Internet and dodgy Polish phone cards, one sifts in the evenings through a deluge of e-mails, spam and digital invites to sometimes find the odd interesting message. Thus came Rodney's e-message saying that he was arriving next week, would stay for two days and would like to meet me for lunch or dinner. The fact that he had more than passing acquaintanceship with two family members back in Dhaka, as well as the fact that our meeting place would the annual London Book Fair (14th to 16th April) inspired me to board London's rattling underground train on a weekday. Notwithstanding that the District Line's average speed from Richmond to Earls Court imitates the slow drool with which OAPs (Old Age Pensioners) work through their soup stock at Age Concern. //////AH: How important is it for you to know your 'audience'?//////KS: Not at all. By that, I mean I don't know my audience. My novels are not only published in several countries, they're also published in several languages, so in some cases I have no way of even knowing what version of my book is coming across to readers (because all translations are, of course, different 'versions' of the original text.) I suppose my attitude towards 'audience' is shaped by the fact that I grew up reading books for which I couldn't have been the 'intended audience.' I mean, I don't suppose any of the writers I read and loved thought of an Anglophone Pakistani as their 'audience.' And yet, I was still able to appreciate and love books which showed no sign of having a Pakistani readership in mind - even though I would often run into cultural references I didn't understand. I learnt to read around those moments of confusion, or to understand them via context - and as a writer, I always assume that my readers will be able to do the same.//////It seemed like the school of Amir Khan in the Hindi movie Taare Zameen Par where a child with dyslexia got appropriate care for learning when I visited the learning and education centre of the Society for the Welfare of Autistic Children (SWAC) last week at Lalmatia in the city.

Otherwise he will find himself in the unusual position of having being prescient about the war in 2002 and yet being overtaken by events in 2008. The most important reason to do this is not political. Iraq is fading in importance for the public and, to the extent that it matters as an electoral issue, most people agree with Obama's judgment that the war was not worth fighting.//////ON 19 June, Israel, and Hamas that controls the Gaza Strip, agreed to a ceasefire through an indirect negotiation by Egyptian mediators. It took three months for the Egyptian mediators to organize this truce between the two sides. However, it is uncertain how long this recently agreed truce will last.//////Time is the unmistakable knock in the middle of the night that must be answered. Abul Hussain is no exception to this truism. In his twilight years he has come forth with his memoirs, ////// reminiscing on the liberation war. Hussain, our doyen of poets, still throws off sparks in his poem: 'Surely there is no escape to aging'. In such moments of his age, the obviousness of such thought is inarguable by any measure. What is amazing is that even after decades, the minutiae that enrich the memoirs so worthily are drawn from his memory alone and are surprisingly flawless. It is intriguing that the author, who is so well-organised in his personal life should have done without keeping a diary and relying only on memory for information. His long writing career blossomed as far back as the 1940s with Naba Basanta, which he dedicated to Rabindranath Tagore. The author came by appreciation for his book from literary stalwarts of the time --- Binoy Kumar Sarkar, Nihar Ranjan Roy and Subodh Sengupta. //////In my last book review I tried to describe the brilliance of Shaheedul Zahir's fiction, especially ////// and called him one of our best story-tellers. I was happy to pay my tribute to the quietly writing and abruptly dying author. After a lot of thought I decided to write on the stories of Abid Anwar this time. He is slightly older than Zahir and equally brilliant as a literary figure. They have another similarity. The Bangla Academy and our Ekushey Padak department have blissfully ignored them all these years. Much lesser men have been recognised in the past. This makes me all the more affectionate to these highly gifted writers, who are only a few years older than me. //////This book exposes many luminaries/philosophers/cultural theorists' abuse of scientific terms in their writings. Particularly, intellectuals belonging to the genre 'postmodernism' are caught by this endemic. The writers of this book are professional physicists who have examined the various treatises written by these intellectuals and shown that oftentimes they used scientific terms without any honest regard to their true meanings. It is as if to show-off the rigour of their work. The story of this book starts with a hoax. Disturbed by the 'abuse of science' or more explicitly an intellectual current characterised by the more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment, by theoretical discourses disconnected from any empirical test, and by a cognitive and cultural ////// that regards science as nothing more than a narration, a myth or a social construction among many others, one of the authors, Alan Sokal, wrote a parody of the type of work that was fashionable in the mainstream American cultural-studies journals. This was titled Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity and got published in a special edition of the journal ////// in 1996. When Sokal revealed this hoax, it was a big embarrassment for the postmoderns. This particular parody was constructed around quotations from eminent French and American intellectuals about the alleged philosophical and social implications of mathematics and the natural sciences. //////The media are doing wonders in today's world of a continuous flow of breaking news, views and photographs. People these days do not even think of spending a day without being in touch with the media. Frankly, people globally have become very much dependent on the media for the daily developments around them. Politics, economy, lifestyle, human rights, crime and even traffic jams all these matter so much in people's lives that they have to be in touch with the media all the time.//////
