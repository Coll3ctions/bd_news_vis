As reports indicate, quoting a number of our fishermen in such areas as St. Martin's island, the Myanmar men left at least eleven Bangladeshi fishermen injured, with one of them in critical condition owing to bullet wound in the head. We condemn such unacceptable and morally untenable action on the part of the Myanmar authorities. It is not just high-handedness or a demonstration of an aggressive posture on the part of Nasaka but in effect a wanton act of piracy. //////IT is an appalling instance of how a body established by law and designated to provide vital input for legal and judicial reform has been deliberately sidelined for the most part since its inception in 1996. The fact that only four of the 200 laws and amendments recommended by the commission had been adopted by the previous AL government and none by the subsequent BNP government, bears testimony to the history of neglect suffered by it. The BNP government's pathological indifference to the body is etched on its framing 184 laws without any recourse to the commission.//////THE nation has been observing with growing concern that the parliament and the Anti-corruption Commission (ACC), the two august bodies of the country, have entangled themselves in a row, erroneously interpreting their jurisdictions, which is indecent indeed.//////WATCHING Barack Obama deliver his much-anticipated address to the Muslim world in Cairo, I am witnessing, I realise, an epochal moment in history. //////THERE are, in the annals of history, certain defining moments in the evolution of nations. In Bangladesh's case, such a moment came on February 5, 1966, when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, general secretary of the East Pakistan Awami League, revealed in Lahore a broad-ranging formula for regional autonomy. That formula was of course the Six Point Plan, which in time would lead to a wider movement and eventually an armed struggle for East Pakistan's emergence as the independent People's Republic of Bangladesh. The plan put Mujib and a large section of Bengali Awami Leaguers on a confrontational course with the All-Pakistan Awami League led by Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan. It also drew the fury of President Mohammad Ayub Khan, who openly threatened to use what he called the language of weapons against the proponents of the Six Points. The plan, as Ayub and his regime saw it, was aimed at causing Pakistan's break-up and the exit of its eastern province from the rest of the country.//////Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha grabbed 4-21 as

earmarked in the 2009-2010 fiscal year budget. From Bangladesh's economic development perspective this is no doubt a new concept aimed at involving participation of the private sector in the capital-intensive infrastructure development projects. The idea, among others, is purported to make best use of the undeclared income of local entrepreneurs and business houses for which necessary provisions are also expected in the budget allowing use of such funds in the sectors to be earmarked. This is a wise move by the government to bring in undeclared money for utilisation in the national development programmes.//////Stocks passed a bullish week riding on expectations of market-friendly announcements in the national budget to be placed on Thursday.//////Oil prices retreated Friday after a brief spike that pushed New York crude above 70 dollars per barrel for the first time in seven months, before the market settled back on a US dollar rebound.//////Singapore expressed concern Friday over a controversial "Buy American" plan in US efforts to stimulate recovery, saying some nations were exploiting gray areas in global trade rules.//////Canada shed 42,000 mostly manufacturing jobs in May, pushing its unemployment rate up 0.4 percentage points to 8.4 percent -- its highest rate in 11 years, Statistics Canada said Friday.//////German Chancellor Angela Merkel may have sought to score political points by slamming central banks last week, but she also echoed fears over growing public debt and waning bank independence.//////Russia has still not passed the worst of the economic slowdown and faces a second crisis wave, a minister warned Friday, clouding the mood at the country's premier economic conference.//////The international markets experienced another rollercoaster ride this week.

"Work is on to resolve the problem but it might take some time," Barua said.//////Every year we hear the news of water logging in the major cities. The rainy season is just a few days away and rain will start to pour again, but what is our preparation regarding water logging? //////Every year, more than 4 millions lives are saved worldwide, thanks to voluntary blood donation by people. In our country as well, there are many generous people who donate blood regularly. Despite that, many of us do not actually know the importance of donating blood and some even fear that blood donation might be harmful for health. In fact every physically fit 18+ adult can donate blood at least twice a year. At the time of donation, only 350ml of blood is taken. An average person has 5-6 litres of blood in the body. In terms of volume the loss is corrected in 24-48 hours by the body. The red cell count is corrected in about 56 days. So the health of the donor will not suffer because of the blood donation. A few days ago, my friend's sister died because of non-availability of blood. Her blood group was AB- but we were unable to collect enough blood for her despite our sincere efforts. Moreover, the blood which we got from the blood bank was date expired in most cases. I think the government needs to monitor these unauthorised and authorised blood banks because they do not help people when it is needed most. There is a disease called thalassemia and in some cases this disorder is treated with blood transfusion. //////The Maldives, an archipelago, faces the bleak prospect of gradual inundation. As the world's climate is getting warmer the sea levels are on the rise. Since most of the islets of this cluster of islands are about 3 feet above the ocean, an increase of the sea level will inundate those areas. As a result the inhabitants of this archipelago may be forced to leave their ancestral land and take refuge in other countries. It is estimated that the sea level will rise two feet this century.//////Theoretically, we all want democratic general elections. But the reality is different (in Dhaka). The incoming, elected regime is attracted towards some sectors; and neglect many sectors which need BMR of BMRE. This pattern is not changing. The motivation is not public service.//////The AL government has passed over 100 days in power with some successes and failures. Though 100 days is not enough to evaluate any government's success or failure, it is considered very crucial, as good beginning is half the battle. With a view to bringing about a positive trend in the governance, PM Sheikh Hasina formed a new government with the leaders having a clean image. However, some of them have failed to hold up their image. But the thing that pinches the common people of our country most is the godfather issue. During the last rule of the AL govt, the people experienced large-scale extortion, snatching and robbery, which finally accelerated the defeat of the AL in 2001 election. This time also the AL cadres have appeared before the countrymen. The people have already started feeling the presence of the men like Hazari and Shamim Osman as they have already attracted media coverage through their activities. Besides, all sorts of notorious activities of the local cadres, patronised by the influential leaders of the AL, are getting momentum day by day. As a result, the people are getting panicked.//////The office of the Registrar of Joint Stock is an important place. But here people have to remain standing in a queue for submitting their papers and documents for hours together. If a person has to deposit money, he has to go to a certain branch of a bank which is located in another building. But sometimes the counter official disappears, although there is always a big queue of people before the counter. //////Nowadays mishaps in the roads and highways are taking place on a regular basis. //////There are many meanings attached to this phrase by various people trying to further there own motives and ideas. As a disinterested person, I feel that this phrase has only one core meaning and that is to provide cheap, reliable and the fastest available (according to international standards) wireless broadband service throughout the land along with the assurance of 24 hours non-failing supply of electricity. If these two simple steps are guaranteed, many businesses and well-to-do people will relocate from the crowded city areas and move to the countryside enriching the land as a whole. The government can also then carry out de-centralisation of most of its work.//////We express our grave concern over the killing of two students of polytechnic in a so-called Rab encounter. As reported, they were picked up by Rab personnel from their college hostel and held incommunicado somewhere. It has made headline once again, and a wave of fresh criticism of the latest killing in crossfire is coming from all sections of society. //////According to Oxford dictionary the term "secularism" means the belief that religion should not be involved in the organisation of society, education, etc. //////With the democratic process starting from the 1990's, have we really achieved what we dreamt of? Probably those involved in politics have. The general people's lifestyle has not changed, apart from the rich and the upper middle class people who have learned to spend money on luxury. The common people, especially the ones living in the rural areas and the poor living in the cities, can hardly say they are better off now. //////Most of the Middle Eastern countries are authoritarian societies where the rights of their own citizens are not adequately protected. The absence of democracy in those countries leaves their citizens vulnerable to abuse by the authorities. //////It seems the massive awareness creating campaign launched jointly by The Daily Star and the Channel i to save the rivers around Dhaka and adjoining areas has started yielding a positive result. The government agencies have started drives to clean the rivers and riverbanks.//////I am a resident of Niketon area and my residence is near the Gulshan-Niketon-Banani Lake. The lake gradually became polluted because of the negligence of the authorities concerned. During the dry season, it has become almost impossible to live here, as the odour coming from the lake water is unbearable. Not only the residents of these areas but also the users of the walkways are affected by it. One of the main causes of the pollution is sewers from the houses dumped into the lake. In addition, a lot of hanging latrines have been built around the banks of the lake, especially near the newly built Gulshan-Banani Bridge.//////Militants ambushed a military convoy carrying prisoners in Pakistan's volatile northwest yesterday, killing two detained aides of a senior Islamist cleric from the Swat Valley, the army said.//////Gordon Brown vowed to soldier on as Britain's prime minister yesterday, admitting that he faced an unprecedented period of turbulence he awaited another electoral bloodbath.//////On the 65th anniversary of the Allies' D-Day landings, President Barack Obama yesterday paid tribute to the invasion that turned the tide of World War II and cemented the trans-Atlantic alliance.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday rejected Israeli assertions that the Bush administration had reached a binding agreement with Israel on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.//////Climate change figured prominently in UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's recent talks with senior officials from the United States and Japan, his spokesperson announced yesterday.//////The Philippines' military said yesterday its troops had killed 30 Muslim separatist guerrillas in three days of fighting on the southern island of Mindanao.//////Indians protesting government moves to develop oil, gas and other resources on their lands battled police in Peru's Amazon on Friday, with authorities and Indian leaders separately reporting 11 police and 25 protesters deaths.//////At least 36 people were killed Friday in central Somalia when fighting erupted between pro-government militiamen and hardline Islamist insurgents, local elders and medical sources said.//////US First Lady Michelle Obama took her two daughters up the Eiffel Tower for a birds-eye view of Paris at sunset Friday after flying in to France to join President Barack Obama, who arrived from Germany.//////Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has reiterated that the United States should provide drone technology to Pakistan, so that it can carry out missile hits on extremists on its own.//////The UN chief lent credence Friday to the possibility of war crimes in Sri Lanka, saying an international investigation is needed to examine the military actions of the government and defeated Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war.//////A deadly terror plot by suspected white supremacists was busted when the police recovered dangerous ricin meant to poison ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom.//////Myanmar authorities have summoned members of Aung San Suu Kyi's pro-democracy party to rebuke them for provoking "unrest" over a statement critical of her trial, state media reported yesterday.//////Former Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif has said the resolution of the Kashmir issue is the key to peace in the region and for India and Pakistan to have cordial ties.//////A suicide bomb rocked an Afghan town bordering Pakistan Saturday killing four people as clashes claimed the lives of another 12 in a fresh wave of insurgent violence, authorities said.//////The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Jharkhand has accused the Election Commission of India of trying to help the United Progressive Alliance by holding the election of two Rajya Sabha seats separately in the state.//////Air France Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages-- including one saying the aircraft's autopilot had disengaged--before it vanished with 228 people on board, aviation investigators said yesterday.//////The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has launched a massive manhunt for a man named Daniel James Murray, who has claimed that he is 'on a mission to kill' President Barack Obama.//////In a fence-mending move, Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry has finally met Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, the man who had bitterly opposed his reinstatement to the post he had been sacked from two years ago.//////'Esraj,' sibling of 'dilruba' (literally meaning "robber of the heart") and 'sarangi' (evocative of a "hundred colours"), is an instrument that possesses the ability to pull at the strings of the coldest of hearts. In the hands of a seasoned musician, Esraj can be like an effusive lover -- providing moments of tranquillity and conjuring a storm of emotions. There has to be a reason why Tagore is believed to have been an ardent admirer of this instrument (it is often the accompanying instrument of choice for Rabindra Sangeet singing). Esraj requires the most serious of connoisseurs; only absolute silence will do. Justifiably, the audience at Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts on June 4 evening were getting annoyed at the otherwise tolerable camera shutter sounds. //////Bangladesh Rabindra Sangeet Shilpi Sangstha (BRSSS), an organisation of Tagore singers, arranged a musical programme at the auditorium of National Music and Dance Centre, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on June 5.

I am a Muslim, and I live in this world. Now the uncertainties begin. On June 4 you gave what was heavily advertised as a major speech to the "Muslim world." Does that mean that while every Christian believes in the divinity of Jesus, he can be legitimately and widely varied in his political interests, but Muslims must have both Allah and politics in common?//////PROVIDING farmers with due prices for what they produce has never been an easy thing to do though it may often sound so. There are so many market players with their diverse and, often, conflicting interests that offering the farmers best prices, which they deserve, for all their toils become even more challenging. //////IN Bangladesh, the negative effects of the global financial crisis are not yet that severe. In the financial year 2007-08, Bangladesh's export earning came to $14.1 billion.
