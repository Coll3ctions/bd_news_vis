The simultaneous running of friendship trains between Dhaka and Kolkata on Bangla new year's day marks a both historic and festive occasion. //////The Bangladesh Bank governor has said recently that the government is considering providing incentives for small and medium enterprises (SME) and food processing industries. The sector deserves massive support and assistance from the government since these have the potential to generate investment, attempt innovation and diversification and employ a large work force, both skilled and semi-skilled. The other advantage is, SMEs do not require heavy machinery or huge start-up capital and therefore they can go into production and earn dividends after a short gestation period. //////POLITICS and potatoes have been getting into a rather interesting mix of late. With the caretaker government letting us in on the thought that one way of handling all those problems relating to rice would be for us to go for a consumption of potatoes, it is quite evident why potatoes should now take centre stage in our thoughts. //////IT appears that India's robust foreign policy is now directing its attention to Africa. On April l8, India hosted a two-day summit in New Delhi with more than a dozen African leaders including the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki. //////Policy makers and politicians everywhere in the world are faced with almost the same kind of problem: being fair to the farmers without being unfair to consumers, and vice versa. That means, farmers should get a fair price for their produce, say for paddy, without raising the price of rice too much to make it unaffordable for poor consumers. In Bangladesh, the problem has become more acute now because the amon crop was almost totally destroyed by two consecutive floods.//////Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons urged captain Mohammad Ashraful to start firing and help the tourists achieve a consolation win in the fourth day-night international here on Wednesday.//////Imrul Kayes continued his rich vein of form with a blazing hundred as GP-BCB National Cricket Academy (NCA) secured a clinical 75-run victory over South Africa Academy to get off to a flying start in the tri-nation Grameenphone Academy Cup one-day series at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium yesterday. //////The Bangladesh Under-15 cricket team took off for the West Indies last evening to participate in the Clico International Under-15 Cricket World Championships to begin from April 19.//////The AFC has confirmed that the Group A matches of the AFC President's Cup will not be held in Dhaka. //////Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis (CCDM) have cleared Surjo Torun and Sonargaon from match-fixing charges on Sunday.//////Pakistan named paceman Mohammad Asif in a 16-man squad for the fourth one-day international against Bangladesh after a five-month lay-off due to injury.//////The Pakistan senate committee on sports has decided the process for Shoaib Akhtar's appeal regarding his five-year ban should continue and that the appellate tribunal should be allowed to take its decision independently.

Their batting, though improving, has been fitful and when they have scored runs, they have given away the fruits of their effort. Their bowling has broadly been ineffective, save the admirable Mashrafe Mortaza.

undertaken a project to bring about some changes in the lifestyle of hijras (eunuchs) residing in Khulna city and elsewhere in the district. //////We have a very rich culture. If we just think about 'Pahela Baishakh' we will understand that we do not have to borrow anything from the western world. But it seems that we are ignoring our own culture. Our dress is getting westernised and we have lost faith in family values which were once the foundation of society. However, the worst thing is what we are doing in the name of so-called individualism. Culture is very important for a nation. But it cannot be retained by observing only some events on some days. We have to treat it as having a lot to do with our identity. //////It is very sad that some people in our country do not know how to think outside the box. If women get equal rights in every aspect, everyone in our society benefits because these women are either our sisters or mothers. When my mother gets equal share in her parent's property, I benefit from that. My sisters and I are born of the same parents; sharing parental property with my sisters only makes me happy because it helps my nieces and nephews. //////The Buriganga river is dying. Do we care? I do not think so. While the dwellers of Dhaka city are neglecting this issue, the river is slowly losing its life day by day. We ourselves are to be blamed for this. It was because of us that Buriganga river is drying up. The government is not doing anything to stop the industrial units surrounding the river from spewing out dangerous chemicals into the river. The government must take appropriate steps to stop further pollution of Buriganga water so that the aquatic lives are saved.//////Brigadier Hafiz's concerns for the Chinese sound hollow from this side of the Atlantic!//////Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) was formed on 4 April 1949 in the midst of cold war and it is a massive military alliance.

I also do not believe that our 'think tank' has dried out of ideas that would soothe the immensity of the dry season power-cuts and water shortage. Foreigners often complain that Bangladeshis are not being sensitive enough to their problems. Water shortage and power cuts are tolerated and accepted with great patience. //////To be frank, as a vigilant and regular student of a university, I watch too many irregularities and anomalies at my university. It is clear to all that the institutional objective of this university is to gain profit by fleecing students, rather than imparting education. They (management) want more money ignoring the students' financial condition. They never listen to what the students may have to say. //////The wise remarks of the former chief adviser Justice Habibur Rahman at the National Citizen's Dialogue as reported in most papers on 7th. April are a very timely and relevant advice to the present CTG and its mentors. We could have on a short-term basis involved the men behind the scene in an anti corruption operation, and cleaning up of the police establishment with no strings attached. But influencing governance from behind the scene is not the proper method to adopt. Authority without responsibility is the harbinger of instability and other serious issues that destabilise democracy in the long term; though appearing very rosy in the short term! This is unfortunately happening in Bangladesh. It is a fundamental political and governance issue that the nation must resolve, if we want democracy to survive and flourish in the long-term.//////Our treatment of animals should be kind. Animals are often mistreated or killed unnecessarily. A few days ago I was stuck and unable to move at Uttara at around 10:am and I witnessed the cruel act of a man. I had dropped my daughter to school and was waiting for the traffic to clear up. I noticed two goats tied tightly to the roof grill of a bus. It was sunny, hot and crowded and the goats' owner ensured that the goats did not fall down. The two ropes were pressed round the necks of the two fragile animals pressing against the arteries. I reckoned it would have been better had the goats' waist or legs (say "wrists") were tightened.//////It is more than a year, the caretaker government arrested the politicians on charges of corruption and misuse of power. But till today the jailed leaders have not been tried. //////Recently, the daily Jugantor published an article Will the people survive? The news didn't escape the eyes of voracious newspaper readers like me. Nowadays, such articles flood the front pages of the dailies with awkward but colourful and lively photos where we see a long queue of hungry people standing in front of any BDR outlet. Who doesn't know that a huge number of people are now passing their days amid great uncertainty? How long can they fight to survive? //////At the crossing of Gulshan Road No. 50 and Kamal Ata Turk Avenue, traffic coming from Kamal Ata Turk Avenue is allowed to turn right. Also traffic coming from Road 50 is allowed to turn right. For some unknown reason, traffic coming from Gulshan 2 is not allowed to enter Road 50. Instead, that traffic is required to make a u -turn at Banani . The crossing at Banani serves in-coming and out-going traffic of Road No.11 and also the traffic of Road No. 27 of Banani. //////It is timely & praiseworthy that the govt will consider increasing the salary of govt officers & employees. Along with this, the govt should think about the needy people who are in serious trouble now. //////Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is now imprisoned. We know that she is suffering from ear problem as well as other ailments. All Awami League leaders, including Sheikh Hasina herself, want her treatment abroad. According to them, proper treatment of her diseases is not possible in this country. //////I would like to draw the attention of the authorities concerned to the dustbin lying on the east/Sukarabad side of the Mirpur Road near the BRAC Bank (Dhanmondi Branch) and Daffodil International University. Beside the dustbin there is a narrow pavement which is fenced by a wall on its eastern side. Over the pavement, there are hanging electrical wires. A flock of crows always remains sitting on the wires in the hope of collecting foods from the dustbin. Hundreds of people including school going boys & girls, office going people and others have to walk along this pavement every day, but often they face an odd situation when the crows.//////We have to remember that if agriculture fails, we will be doomed. It is time we took some initiatives to help our farmers. The following needs to be done in the interest of the agriculture sector. //////It appears from one of the news items of today's (12 April 2008) DS: Prof. Anwar Hossain of the history department of Dhaka University noted, It is not history, rather information on the liberation war was distorted. The professor was speaking at a book publication ceremony at Liberation War Museum in the capital. Eminent jurist Dr. Kamal Hossain also reportedly spoke on the occasion. //////Nowadays GM(Genetically Modified) crops are a much talked about subject. Of course it is more productive than local crops. But we should also not forget that quality is often more important than quantity. Still we don't know we are consuming some GM crops. This may expose us to certain physical disorders. //////Near the newly built posh BIAM Center at New Eskaton, on 5th of March, 08, I was wondering about the unusual gathering of a large number of Hatirpool slum dwellers. While still getting deeper to BIAM, I found a contingent of police, some of them were right inside the slum to ensure safe eviction and some others outside were probably waiting for a provocation. I soon then realised the very purpose of the helpless congregation. The sight of the poor driven out slum dwellers was very sad and pathetic. Some little children were seen playing around the gathered shabby belongings of theirs. The bigger kids were seen really upset and sharing thoughts with their elders "Where shall we go?" The moments of tension made it appear more pathetic and unveiled the cruel reality. Their half starved physical appearance and popped up eyes looked helpless. The eviction of this old slum was either to construct a road for easy movement to posh BIAM Center-Cum School where mostly wards of quick rich governments officials make the most out of it, or make a way for posh apartments for quick rich people. We condemn this inhuman act of bulldozing the slum. //////I would have found Mr. Mohammed Rahat's letter on the subject in DS of 10 Apr 08 and earlier, his and that of Mr Farzand Ahmed of Bangkok, hilarious, if they had not dealt with the very serious problem of Dhaka's traffic jams so flippantly. These two gentlemen seem to be living in an illusory Utopia, with their heads in the sand like ostriches. Mr. Rahat brushes aside the existence of rickshaws and those connected with them with such demeaning expressions as cancer, nuisance, inhuman, epidemic and calls for their 'elimination' shades of Auschwitz! //////Last week, I visited some BDR shops and saw the situation of our country. The queues of people in front of BDR rice selling centres in capital Dhaka and other major townships across the country turned longer this week with increasing number of people joining them. While visiting some BDR outlets, it could be noticed that the majority of the people in the line for rice were women, some cradling their babies in their arms in the unbearable summer heat. //////Pakistan's ruling coalition yesterday renewed its pledge to reinstate dozens of judges who were sacked by embattled President Pervez Musharraf, a minister said after a key high-level meeting.//////Sri Lankan war planes bombed a communications centre inside rebel-held territory Tuesday after heavy ground battles left seven Tamil Tigers dead, the defence ministry said.//////Two years after coming out of the bush, Nepal's Maoists are marching across the Himalayan kingdom just not in the way many thought they would. //////Iran would "eliminate Israel from the global arena" if it was attacked by the Jewish state, the deputy commander of the army warned yesterday, amid an intensifying war of words between the two foes.//////Even though parliamentary election in India is due early next year, the demand for projecting Rahul Gandhi, the scion of Nehru-Gandhi family, as prime minister candidate grew louder from within the ruling Congress on Monday and it was welcomed by a key component of the ruling alliance.//////Conservative billionaire Silvio Berlusconi won Italy's general elections by an unexpectedly wide margin on Monday, securing a third term as prime minister but warning of tough times ahead for the country in the grip of an economic downturn.//////Zimbabwe's opposition political party called a nationwide strike Tuesday after the country's High Court rejected an appeal for the immediate release of delayed presidential election results. //////A rapidly escalating global food crisis has reached emergency proportions and threatens to wipe out seven years of progress in the fight against poverty, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned Monday. //////The daughter of assassinated Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi on Tuesday confirmed she had met one of the people behind her father's murder.//////Malaysia's opposition held a massive rally here last night to mark the end of its leader Anwar Ibrahim's five-year ban from holding political office, with him announcing to a cheering crowd his intention to "take over the government".//////Pakistan People's Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari may be included in TIME magazine's 2008 list of the top 100 influential people in the world. //////Myanmar's military junta detained more than 20 activists as they walked through the northwestern city of Sittwe in a peaceful rally against the country's proposed constitution, an opposition party spokesman said Tuesday. //////Heading into talks with Palestinian leaders, former US president Jimmy Carter offered to ferry messages from the militant Islamic Hamas group to the United States and even to Israel. //////President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday agreed to head Russia's ruling party in a significant shift of the political landscape three weeks before he hands power to successor Dmitry Medvedev.//////Hillary Clinton has checked Democratic foe Barack Obama's Pennsylvania surge, in a new poll Tuesday, partly conducted amid a furore over his comments on "bitter" working class voters.//////An overnight fire a primary school dormitory in Uganda killed 19 school children and two adults, police said yesterday. //////Pakistan police say land mine blasts have killed three men and injured five others in insurgency-plagued Baluchistan province. //////Sweltering heat has taken over and mango trees are in blossom; and with a forceful nor'wester on the last night of the Bengali year 1414, ////// heralded itself.//////To bid farewell to the Bengali year 1414 and usher in the New Year, Surer Dhara -- a music institution headed by renowned Tagore artiste Rezwana Chowdhury Bannya -- arranged their annual cultural programme on April 13 at the Lalmatia Girls High School.
