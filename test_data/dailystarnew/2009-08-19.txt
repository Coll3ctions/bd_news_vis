Last Sunday's violence in the readymade garment (RMG) units at Ashulia and Jamgarah areas on the outskirts of the capital city has again caused panic among the owners of the factories so much so that, according to reports, production has been suspended in 25 factories. This is certainly bad news for the entire garment sector at a time when it is already reeling from the supply-order shortage from the recession-hit international market. The international factors apart, gas supply constraint is another factor that has forced many garment units in Chittagong to shut down. //////THE concept of a police force in relation to tourist spots in the country should have originated earlier. However, now that a tourist police force has been introduced in such areas as Cox's Bazar as a step toward providing security to tourists, we cannot but welcome it. And that is because of all the hurdles we have observed over the years where popularizing tourism and broadening its base are concerned. Despite the ubiquitous assertions about developing the tourism sector, there has hardly been any change that one can notice. As a matter of fact, when compared with other countries in the region, the number of tourists Bangladesh receives annually is pitifully low and for various reasons.//////WE have been informed that the Bangladesh government will take action against Khairuzzaman, the soldier turned diplomat till recently the country's high commissioner in Malaysia.

Bangladesh Tigers have shown that they are now able to face any team in the world with determination & on their day they are dangerous & can beat any team. I must congratulate all the team members, manager, coach & officials for their back to back series win in the West Indies & Zimbabwe. It seems that day by day this team is gaining more & more confidence. They are really playing as a team. Each & every player is contributing for the team. They are a bunch of Tigers who can respond when the occasion demands. Right from the West Indies tour we have seen their determination as to how to play as a team and in the absence of Mashrafee, Shakib shouldered the great responsibility. It was not easy for our players to play on some totally different pitches in the West Indies. But they have done so well.//////It was in the year 1969 when Bangabandhu was released from the so called //////The BSS report published by many dailies on 8th July on the matter relating to reduction of renewal fee by BERC for captive power plants is a positive step in the right direction, and a welcome move. Since most captive power plants are sized to the individual power needs of the user, setting a flat rate is rather unfair. A possible solution could be a minimum fee of say Tk. 2500 calculated say at Tk100 per KW of generator rating. This will be different for each unit, based on its own generation capacity required.//////Dhaka University is the biggest educational institution of Bangladesh. As a student, the budget of Dhaka University is very important to me. //////The 21st century, within nine years of its inception, has presented the modern civilization with formidable challenges -- Nature takes its own tolls!//////Law and order situation has been worsening day by day. Unexpectedly, even after passing seven months since assuming power, ending an interregnum of two years, the government has failed to control law and order. Extortionists, robbers, muggers, as well as some political opportunists are reigning supreme.//////This issue is one of the two most critical national issues, Tipaimukh dam and CHT, being discussed every day in the media. //////The coaching centre is a place where students come to learn through remaining under special guidance.

The coaching centres are attracting students with colourful banners and festoons. They are giving 100% assurance of university admission or getting the highest grade or GPA-5 in every exam.//////Human resource development and organization development are critical issues for competitive advantages. The basic purpose of organization development is to increase an organization's effectiveness through planned interventions related to the organization's processes, resulting in improvements in productivity', return on investment and employee satisfaction. To remain competitive in today's global marketplace, organizations need change and one of the most effective tools to promote successful change is organization development (OD). //////The days August 20-25 in 2007 are still afresh in our minds. The DU unrest arose from a trifling matter of watching a football match. Later on, it turned into campus violence following the beatings of DU students on the campus by the army personnel. As a result, thousands of DU students took to the street to protest it. They also demanded the withdrawal of the troops from the campus. This continued for a couple of days.//////Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud and his second wife were reportedly killed in South Waziristan by a US drone attack after receiving an intelligence report about his hideout provided by (Mehsud's mentor) ISI.

The educated and well-groomed politicians are cautious in making comments on national issues. Ours is a new democracy and our politicians are also new in politics, naturally all of them are not well groomed. Their background and entry into politics are mostly a picked-up process except those who entered through some political process and long struggles. Modification is underway and hopefully in the next decade there will be much qualitative changes in the behaviours of our politicians. Secondly, our politicians are tight-leaped because they are regulated by their party policies and have no freedom to express their opinions. In spite of all the restrictions and regulatory systems, we can see some dynamic politicians who speak wisely and cautiously saving their own dignity and acceptability. Especially, the top leaders of all political parties have some sense of individuality and that is why we expect changes in future political culture in Bangladesh.//////There is no denying that the origin of all recessions was in the USA with the collapse of businesses like Layman Brothers and Real Estate in Germany. The economy which hitherto overheated is showing signs of cooling down causing reverberations across the world. How long will it continue is a matter of debate. Pessimists say that it may take more than two years; optimists say that it may take only a year and the realists assert that it may take two years to come out this threat. //////We keep reading in the papers over and over again about men beating up and murdering their wives, pouring acid down the throats of their own children. We read about how women and children working as servants get tortured by their employers. Just the other day there was an article about how a man tied up his wife and locked her up in a medieval manner. It's really sad to see that in this day and age Bangladesh is still not yet a civilised nation. I am really surprised that our Honourable Prime Minister, being a woman herself, does not seem to be sensitive enough towards all such issues. I believe that stern action should be taken against the culprits. Acid should not be available so easily in the market. I would also like to urge the women of Bangladesh to stand up for their rights and not give in to their husbands so easily. Men who hit women are cowards and thrive on the fear they create. //////Opening evening MA course in the Department of English of DU is a timely initiative which would widen the scope of higher education. The country has dearth of quality higher education.

The event will be aired live on ntv, starting from 8:20 pm.//////TV serial Bindu Theke Britto will be aired tonight on Channel i at 9:30 pm.//////THE death anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman should be a time for reflection on the part of the nation. This reflection should be one that transcends all political barriers because Bangabandhu was, in the light of the role he played in steering the country towards liberation in the heady days of 1971, our window to the outside world. It is that historical role of the country's liberator we remember today. //////THE road that stretches westward from Mymensing/VIP road to Paribag mosque keeping Prio-Prangon, a high rise building, on one side and a CNG filling station on other side is known as Paribag road.
