Of course, the BDR, under its new management, has given it out that the men died of heart attacks or have committed suicide. At a time when intense investigations are going on to unearth the conspiracy behind the carnage that left 55 army officers dead at Pilkhana in February, it is worrying that reports have kept coming in of BDR men in detention dying. We are dismayed by such happenings; and we would like to make it clear that explaining these deaths away being a result of cardiac arrests or suicide is becoming untenable. All of us remember the frequency with which people died in 'crossfires' during the period of the BNP-led alliance government. Those reports of 'crossfires' did not hold water. In much the same manner, the nine BDR deaths are beginning to raise some uncomfortable questions.//////The Prime Minister has dreams and vision for a prosperous Bangladesh. She is also under pressure of a massive popular mandate to deliver goods to people in terms of stable law and order, good governance and catering to basic needs of the majority who are poor. Little wonder, therefore, that rather early in the day, a couple of weeks ago, she had addressed a letter to the secretaries exhorting them to quicken their pace of work in implementing the directives of the government, so that people can receive the intended services sooner rather than later. //////March 9: Naik Subedar Mozammel Haq reportedly commits suicide by hanging himself from a ventilator fan of a toilet on the third floor of the orchestra bhaban at the BDR headquarters in Pilkhana.//////YESTERDAY, this nation turned thirty-eight years old, a time of life when an individual stands at the threshold of middle age. But a nation is expected to live hundreds of years, and thirty-eight for it is still formative days. It doesn't have to worry about dwindling eyesight, hurting knees, fluctuating blood pressure, not even receding hairline or diabetes. A nation is still young and fresh, hope and freedom roaring in veins. //////THE tragedy at Pilkhana was no mutiny; it was premeditated mass murder. We could have called it a mutiny if the BDR jawans had held the army officers captive until their demands were met, but by the time the negotiations had started all the army officers had already been executed. The intention was to destabilise the country, and these cold- blooded murderers had no intention of ventilating their grievances and returning to their barracks. //////Welcome to this year's super heavyweight championship bout. //////All eyes will be on Abahani and Mohammedan in today's Super Cup final that is worth Tk 1.20 crore but Brothers Union and Chittagong Mohammedan will try to entertain the crowd during the third-place playoff, which starts at 3 pm.//////About 10,000 tickets were sold in advance for today's final of the Citycell Super Cup. //////GP-BCB National Cricket Academy defeated the Bangladesh Under 19 team by 49 runs in an Independence Day in a low-scoring limited overs exhibition match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////A record-breaking partnership brought centuries for Ross Taylor and Jesse Ryder to steady New Zealand after a shaky start on Day One of the second Test against India here Thursday.//////Mohammad Yousuf and a few other Pakistan players may be heading towards a tricky legal wrangle with the Indian Cricket League (ICL) after reports have emerged that they are planning to end their association with the unauthorised Twenty20 league and return to international cricket.//////Sourav Ganguly has made it clear that he is not completely convinced about John Buchanan's multiple-captain theory for Kolkata Knight Riders, the Indian Premier League (IPL) team he led last year. //////Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who missed the Napier Test because of a back spasm he sustained on the eve of the match, is likely to return for the next game in Wellington.

wrought about by some crafty wrong doers. Z category shares transaction in percentage of our total turnover may not be that high. But the damage caused by it goes much deeper down the spine of our capital market system. It has produced such satire in our capital market that sounds as it were: Invest in bad shares and be rewarded. Invest in good shares and be punished. This hints at decaying of intrinsic value in our capital market system.//////No doubt Bangladesh has immense potential in tourism. But still it is not developed due to the lack of interest and proper policy of the government. The recent announcement on establishing a national tourism board is a ray of hope for the development of tourism industry in Bangladesh. But it is not enough, because tourism industry is an amalgam of other industries like transportation, accommodation, international technology etc.//////In order to protect the vegetables from pests, chemical pesticides are used. But the producers as well as consumers are not aware of the ill effects of the pesticides. Nowadays, we observe some efforts by the law enforcers to ensure formalin-free fish and stop adulteration of restaurants foods. But they overlook the pesticides used while growing vegetables and other agricultural products. //////National security is matter of topmost priority. That BDR Headquarters and other military establishments exist without adequate video surveillance and digital identification is just unthinkable to me. Even before Bangladesh goes digital, our armed forces need to do so immediately. It is sad to read how the investigators have to rely on amateur cell phone videos to look for suspects. Many rosters had been burnt which make it impossible to determine the whereabouts of the personnel. This could easily have been avoided if each personnel were assigned a digital identification card. This would make their whereabouts easier to find and also the information could not be burnt as it would immediately (at the speed of light to be precise) make its way to a central digital information storage hub (say a facility in the cantonment). //////The fundamental principle of all religions is to try to be a good human being, though there are different ways to achieve the goal. Our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (Pbuh) is the truest human being the world has ever seen. But some people, who claim to be the followers of Islam, engage in activities that violate the basic tenets of the religion. //////US President Barack Obama on March 20, 2009 made a historic appeal to the Iranian people, urging an end to decades of animosity and offering a honest engagement with the Islamic Republic. It proves that he is a person of great wisdom who wants to have a peaceful relationship with every country.//////A few days ago I purchased a hot water bottle from a drug store. I wanted to buy a local product but was told that the quality of the local product is not good. Hence I had to buy an imported product at a higher cost.//////I would very much welcome the cancellation of Pakistan cricket team's tour of Bangladesh. I think this is a very good decision by the government. There is no denying that terrorists have got no sympathy even for sportsmen who are considered goodwill ambassadors of their country. The recent attack by the terrorists on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan is an example that even the sportsman are not sparred by them. Thank God, the Sri Lankan team members narrowly escaped. //////The rulers of Myanmar are oppressing the Rohingya Muslims. Though they are the legal citizens of Myanmar, but their social and political rights have never been recognised. They can't perform their religious duties, they can't marry without the permission of the govt. They can't move from one town to another without permission. The dictators are trying their best to finish the Rohingya Muslims. The Rohingyas are now foreigners in their own country. There were 3.5 million Rohingyas, and 1.5 million have escaped from Myanmar and they are passing through great uncertainty. //////Recently, Paramita's story in DS drew my attention. I was astonished to see her patriotism and love for the mother tongue. I can visualise my own childhood in the eyes of this little girl. She spent her money which she got as prize for poetry recitation, for building a Shaheed Minar. She did this spontaneously to show her love for the martyrs of the language movement. It was a spontaneous expression of her love for her mother tongue too. Nowadays what our countrymen lack is patriotism. But when I read the story of a school girl's love for the country and our mother tongue, I got back my lost faith. //////Thanks to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for directing the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs to arrange special programmes for rehabilitating the hapless street children and ensuring social and economic security of women.//////The ACCA students, particularly in Chittagong, are facing many problems. Since the course is not so established and familiar in the context of Bangladesh, students cannot determine what is happening during taking tuition. The main problem is created by tuition providers, especially the new ones. They lack experienced and skilled personnel in administration. In fact, their management is too weak to run such a professional course. Furthermore, it is widely complained that, they take the ACCA fees from the students but do not pay to the ACCA in time.//////AIG and the other failing banks in the USA have set new and absurd standards for executive privileges. They give guaranteed bonuses; while the organisation reels under astounding losses! Funnily, individual amounts of this bonus are more than the gross income of many US taxpayers! Indeed the USA is the land of milk and honey! These fat salaried executives get the honey of bonuses in these hard days of economic downturn, regardless of losses suffered, conveniently milked from poor taxpayers! This is the refined way of robbing the bank without guns and masks!//////I am really sympathetic towards Md. Lutfar Rahman (Letter to DS on March 20, 2009), as I too am feeling the pain and suffering each and every day caused by the careless behaviour of the rickshaw-pullers on Dhaka streets. //////In the human body, all the systems simultaneously work in a co-ordinated way and in full harmony for a definite purpose, namely, to keep the body alive. Even the smallest movements we do everyday, such as breathing or smiling, are outcomes of perfect co-ordination in the human body. //////I am very sceptical about the selection of the AL cabinet. Most of them do not have any technical knowledge or experience in their respective fields. It takes knowledge, vision and administrative skill to run a ministry. As a supporter of the AL, I wish the situation will be rectified very soon, before further damage is done to the economy. //////Washington is planning new drone attacks on militant targets in Pakistan as part of its overall review of military strategy there and in Afghanistan, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday.//////Despite India's decision to move the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament to South Africa out of security fears, another major terror attack in the country is "inevitable," according to a leading US think tank.//////Tamil Tiger rebels have lost more of their territory in northern Sri Lanka and their total defeat is now "imminent," a government minister said yesterday.//////Operatives in Pakistan's military intelligence agency provide cash, supplies and strategic advice to militants in Afghanistan where the United States is fighting a resurgent Taliban, the New York Times said Thursday.//////A Pakistan-based Islamist militant group warned Wednesday of fresh attacks against Indian troops, as the army said a "large number" of guerrillas were poised to infiltrate Kashmir.//////The PMK, a constituent of the ruling UPA at the Centre, is all set to join the AIADMK-led front in Tamil Nadu as the party's top policy making body, the General Council, decided at its crucial meeting.//////A brilliant green tree frog with huge black eyes, jumping spiders and a striped gecko are among more than 50 new animal species scientists have discovered in a remote, mountainous region of Papua New Guinea.//////Problems for former Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf seem to be increasing day by day following the filing of a petition in the Supreme Court seeking his trial on sedition charges.//////The US has offered a $5 million reward for information on Baitullah Mehsud, a senior leader of the Tehrik-e-Taliban who is linked to the assassination of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto.//////Our small screen is a kaleidoscope that presents various colours of life. Today, the television has become a powerful and effective medium that consists of a galaxy of dazzling stars.

"Slumdog Millionaire," filmed in the Dharavi slums of Mumbai, has swept the Oscars this year, winning awards for Best Adapted Screen-play, Cinematography, Sound Mixing, Film Editing, Original Score, Original Song, Direction and Film. Thus 'history' of some sort has been made, since Indian participation in this mother of all film awards so far had been confined to minor achievements such as costume designing and, of course, the Lifetime Achievement Award conferred to legendary helmer Satyajit Ray.//////Single-episode play "Bar Bar Phirey Ashey" will be aired today on Channel 1 at 9:20pm. Written by Rokeya Islam and directed by Sadek Siddiqui, the play has Arman Parvez Murad, Shohel Khan, Shahriar Nazim Joy and Tazin Ahmed in the lead roles.//////In the write up "The art of recreating the past," published in yesterday's issue of the Arts & Entertainment, Tahmima Anam's first novel "A Golden Age" is mentioned as the winner of "2008 regional Commonwealth Best First Book prize." The book went on to win the Commonwealth Overall Best First Book Award in 2008. We regret the error.//////IT seems that the debate over what would have been a better option to contain the Pilkhana mayhem is far from dying down. The government reckoned that political negotiation was the way to deal with the mutineers. As the gruesome events unfolded after the fateful morning of February 25, it was discovered that mutineers had killed scores of our valiant army officers in what appeared to be a systematic carnage.//////IN the manpower industry our policy makers seem happy with the ever-increasing remittances, though frequently irritated by media exposures of the unsavoury activities of unscrupulous manpower agents. This juxtaposition of visible remittance by temporary migrants and unethical activities of some recruiting agents, has suddenly attracted most of the think-tanks' attention to this hitherto uncared for sector. Dialogues, round-tables, seminars are focusing on how to nurture and revamp the golden egg laying goose and curb the exploitation of workers.//////IT'S the weirdest thing.
