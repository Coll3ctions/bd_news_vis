The fact that only 17 midlevel officials have been suspended, where initial reports by the anti-graft body ACC puts it much higher, sends a chill down our collective spines as to where we are headed on the issue. Given the enormity of the scam, we demand a high powered enquiry committee be setup must include relevant experts familiar with banking procedures so that they can identify the loopholes in the system utilised to avail unworthy loans. The enquiry committee will identify the perpetrators, find the systemic flaws that exist in the bank's operations and offer long-term solutions. All this must be done within a specified timeframe and findings published for public scrutiny. //////If the present government can be credited with any new undertaking to alleviate poverty, then the safety net programme constitutes the centrepiece of it.

Many would term it as an indefensible demonstration of highhandedness. For law enforcement officials, who really want to change the colonial style of policing, this event is hugely image-shattering.//////Assam on brink is the headline one day. Mumbai on brink is on another day. And dominating all the news is the non-functioning of parliament that the people note helplessly -- Rs.1 crore is the daily expenditure on parliament. What the scenario indicates is that the political consensus, important for a parliamentary democracy, is beyond repair. The law and order machinery has broken down and faith in peaceful methods has drastically lessened. One may as well say that the Indian polity is coming apart from the seams.//////Most commentators readily accept the fact that democracy in Bangladesh is weak, even fragile. And they often hasten to add that democracy is a practice and we will get better with practice. I contend that there is no guarantee that Bangladesh will be more democratic; nor is it a forgone conclusion that Bangladesh will be less democratic. //////Possible start of first Byzantine indiction cycle.//////Noor Jehan, born as Noor Jehan Beg in Taranagar, Murshidabad, on 22 May 1925, rose to become a political figure committed to the empowerment of women. She was an educationist, a social reformer, a media personality and deeply liberal and secular in her world view. This owes to the influence of the liberal tradition of the Bengal Renaissance reflected in her home environment, her schooling and a consequent confidence that she had a social and a political role to play in the years to come.//////Ever since the fall of mankind, there has been constant discrimination amongst the two sexes, male and female. Universally men have dominated and have created a society they could rein in, which is commonly referred to as the male patriarchal society. The patriarchal society has established its rights on women and has long repressed them. It has exposed women to mental torture which eventually has led to physical oppression and death. Deepa Mehta, in her film Water, portrays this concept of a male dominated patriarchal society and the repression of women from a south Asian perspective. In her film, she scrutinises the lives of Indian widows and their tragic ending.//////Few days ago at around 1 a.m., one worried and anxious mother called me on my cell phone seeking emergency medical advice for her four year old son.

Nonalignment the doctrine that calls upon India to refuse staunchly any strategic alliances with other actors has re-entered the broader foreign policy discourse, with the center-left championing such policies in the guise of promoting strategic autonomy. The credo was touted in an independent report titled Nonalignment 2.0, which offers the vision of allying with none as a grand strategy for India in the coming years.//////In Hugh White's latest book, "The China Choice: Why America Should Share Power", the Australian professor argues that, for the sake of regional peace, the United States and China should carve up Asia between them. In particular, the US should consider ceding Indochina to China, the former defence official added.//////The dispute between Japan and China over the barren rocky islands known as Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea owes its origins to the unfinished business of the Second World War. At the end of the war, the United States dispossessed Japan of most of its overseas island territories such as Taiwan, but curiously left untouched the territorial issue of some of the smaller islands. A reading of US intentions at that time would indicate that Japanese sovereignty would continue only over the four main Japanese islands, with the others being assigned to erstwhile owners. But US intentions were never given practical shape. At the end of the war, the Soviet Union marched in and captured the four northern islands in the Kuriles chain north of Hokkaido, the northern most main Japanese island. Left unclear and untouched were the Senkaku/Diaoyu group of islets that often submerge at high tide.//////The mesmerizing, poignant cover picture of Sakhawat Hussain's Jamuna-Gumtir Teerey Bhromon Kotha in so many ways captures the essence of the book: the story of India's War of Independence of 1857, which, for understandable reasons, the British prefer to call The Great Indian Mutiny. So much can be read into the picture, particularly when combined with the hindsight of history. The octogenarian last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, supported by an attendant and walking staff, is surrendering to Captain (later Major) Hodson of the British East India Company. As a symbol of the surrender, another British officer is holding on to the Emperor's waistband and the sword bequeathed to him down the line of a succession of ancestors going back to the glory days of the Great Mughals. And what splendid and glorious personalities they were: Babar, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shahjahan and Aurangzeb. After all these years, I still recall my professor at Boston University, Walter Clemens, telling the class that the height of human civilization was reached during the reign of the Great Mughals. Everything associated with the splendour of civilization had perforce had to go on a downslide, not in the sense of having become moribund, but of having become rather humdrum. //////Khadim Hussain Raja's book on the 1971 Bangladesh war, published posthumously in Pakistan, has predictably created a stir in his country. And here in Bangladesh, a very negligible part of the book, that which deals with Tikka Khan's stated desire to have Sheikh Mujibur Rahman tried in public and hanged, was carried by the media. The impression, at that point, may well have been that Raja's book was sympathetic to the Bangladesh cause. It was anything but. Raja, a senior officer in the Pakistan army and at that point a leading figure in the military hierarchy in East Pakistan (he served in Dhaka from 1969 to early 1971), was fully in on plans for a crackdown on the Bengalis then being shaped by the Yahya Khan junta. Indeed, even as the talks between Yahya Khan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto went on at President's House, Raja and Major General Rao Farman Ali met in the former's office to work out the details of what would later come to be known as Operation Searchlight. If anything, the work makes it clear that the civil-military bureaucracy based in West Pakistan had definitely reached the conclusion that power could not be transferred to the electorally triumphant Awami League. //////
