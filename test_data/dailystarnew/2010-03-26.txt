Thirty nine years after the formal declaration of Bangladesh's independence, it is for us to recapitulate an era that was to push us into unmitigated tragedy caused by Pakistan's initiation of genocide and eventually on to a sun-dappled dawn of freedom nine months later.

However, as more and more information is passed, the need for better telecommunication infrastructure to keep up with the increasing demand becomes an urgent necessity.

Installations in Bangladesh have already begun and its appropriateness to Bangladeshs needs is being widely talked about. Inspite of so much talk about fibre optics, many may have questions about the very basics of fibre optics. Many of us must have already seen a fibre optic wire in our homes, but not identified it. Sometime around the 90s, a particular type of showpiece had started becoming increasingly popular in homes of Bangladesh. These showpieces had a mass of hair-like white plastic wires coming out of a golden coloured sphere and only the ends of these wires would light up when the showpiece was plugged in and switched on. Why am I reminiscing about a showpiece in the Star Tech section? My point here is that each of these wires were actually a single strand of optical fibre.//////The nomination submission deadline for e-Content and ICT for Development Award 2010 has been extended to April 5.
