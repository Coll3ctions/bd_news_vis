This removes the last hurdle to the government's plans to formulate legislation on ship breaking.//////Two very different styles of batting were on display on the second day of the first Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday. At one end patient and risk-free batting from Shivnarine Chanderpaul not only took him to a second double hundred but also helped the West Indies to tighten their grip on the home team, while at the other extreme flamboyant batting from Tamim Iqbal only put the Tigers in danger.//////A lifter from pacer Ravi Rampaul took the edge and flew over the slip cordon and thus Tamim Iqbal got his first boundary; a fortuitous one.

Shivnarine Chanderpaul's double hundred (203 not out), the second in his 18-year long career, wasn't necessarily eye-catching. It didn't contain any sixes and neither was it filled with a string of flamboyant strokes.//////The flat wicket at the Sher-e-Bangla contains a bit of moisture in the morning session, making it the most probable time for the bowling side to pick up wickets. While the Bangladeshi bowlers couldn't make the most of it, they did however, squander a couple. The first one in fact came at the second ball of the day when a flighted delivery by debutant Shohag Gazi beat both Denesh Ramdin and keeper Mushfiqur Rahim as it went through the gap between the bat and the pad. The second opportunity came through an edge of Shivnarine Chanderpaul off Gazi, which fell inches short of the slip fielder.//////Title contenders Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club and Mohammedan SC got off to winning starts in the Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////The Bangladesh national football team leave here for Thailand today to play two FIFA friendly matches against Thailand and Malaysia with a hope of verifying the standard they belong to.//////India and England will be without the services of fast bowlers Ishant Sharma and Steven Finn when they open a four-Test series in Ahmedabad on Thursday.//////Nikhil Chandra Dhar, Badminton World Federation's level-1 certified coach, brought allegation of non-cooperation against the Bangladesh Badminton Federation, which is dillydallying with the process of handing the BWF invitation of level-2 coaches course to him.//////FM Debaraj Chatterjee took solo lead in the Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Limited 38th National 'A' Chess Championship with 6 points after beating FM Mehdi Hasan Parag in the seventh round at the media centre of Bangladesh Olympic Association yesterday.//////International news agencies, including AFP, warned Tuesday they may be forced to suspend coverage of the Test cricket series between India and England to protest restrictions imposed by authorities.//////Mohakhali Ekadash played out a 1-1 draw against T& T Club in the Popular Insurance Senior Division Football League at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Mostafa Kamal Stadium yesterday.
