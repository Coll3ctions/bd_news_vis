But this was not to be -- after a spell of uneasy lull induced through adhocism, back again on a suicidal track! //////THE increasing frequency with which terrorists are targeting Pakistan's security and defence establishment demonstrates the ever-escalating levels of danger posed to the country. This past week alone there have been two suicide attacks, the second one taking Lahore in its vicious grip on Friday. This latest attack has left no fewer than 45 people dead and scores of others severely injured. The worry is that this new attack was targeted at the army, which included the cantonment, homes of military officials and institutions such as hospitals and schools run by the army. The bigger worry is that where the aim earlier was to spread fear among soldiers, it now appears that these suicide bombers have widened the net to include anyone and everyone related to the military. Of the greatest significance is the fact that the terrorists are these days finding it rather easy to penetrate the perimeters of the security establishment in the country. They have killed policemen, soldiers and others before and now they feel they can keep doing it with ease.//////After the first day's play it was inevitable for Bangladesh that they would be put under a pile of runs on the second day of the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. And England had no problems executing their plan on the placid track as they declared the innings on a mammoth 599 for six just forty-five minutes ahead of the tea break leaving a challenge for the Bangladesh batsmen to survive after a hard day's work under scorching heat.//////England all-rounder Paul Collingwood joined the party by saying that he too was surprised by Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan's decision to put them into bat in the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.//////Power-packed Australia proved third time lucky as they won the men's field hockey World Cup after a 24-year hiatus with a 2-1 win over defending champions Germany on Saturday.//////The second-fastest T20 hundred, a 37-ball assault from Yusuf Pathan, as delicate as it was brutal, wasn't enough on a day in which precious little was contributed by the other Rajasthan Royals players. Despite Mumbai Indians piling on their biggest score in the IPL, it required special death bowling from Zaheer Khan and Lasith Malinga to deny Rajasthan 19 runs in the last two overs.//////Just three days after announcing his retirement, there's some speculation that Rokibul Hasan may have a change of heart pretty soon.//////It was a real treat for the Chittagong fans when the two local heroes batted together on the second day of the first Test against England here yesterday, but it lasted only 29 balls.//////Kasba High School of Rajshahi stormed into the final of the Ecstasy Sixth National Hockey Championship with an emphatic 5-0 win over Jessore Municipal Preparatory High School in the second semifinal at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////In his first match as IPL captain, Gautam Gambhir followed up inspired moves in the field with an old-fashioned innings full of sensible strokeplay to save a glittering batting line-up the blushes in a straightforward chase of 143 on a flat pitch. It was thanks to disconcerting bowling from Dirk Nannes and timely big wickets for Farveez Maharoof that Delhi were chasing a paltry total, but Gambhir had to counter the regularly falling wickets and rising required rate to take his team home.//////West Indies defeated Zimbabwe by four wickets on Friday to wrap-up the one-day series after the visiting side suffered another batting meltdown.//////Tim Southee and Shane Bond ensured New Zealand's series finished on a high but with the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy already conceded, it was only a consolation victory for the hosts over Australia.

Chinese inflation rose to a 16-month high and other economic data showed broad-based strength, boosting safe-haven flows into the yen and dollar against the euro and perceived riskier assets. The yen's rally later fizzled out; however, as the market took the view that the economic recovery in China remained broadly on track to drive global growth. The euro was steady against the Swiss franc at 1.4608 francs after earlier falling to a one-month low around 1.4597 as markets awaited a Swiss National Bank policy decision. The SNB is expected to keep interest rates very low and maintain its policy of foreign exchange intervention to curb any excessive appreciation in the Swiss currency and aid Switzerland's nascent economic recovery. Analysts said many in the market expect the SNB to tone down its rhetoric on intervention, but traders were also wary that the central bank may be ready to step in if the franc appreciates too much as a result. This kept the euro steady against the franc, with traders reporting good demand for euro/Swiss options ahead of the SNB's policy assessment. The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent against the US dollar, cutting earlier losses made after the strong Chinese data and on data showing a smaller-than-expected rise in Australian employment. The New Zealand dollar fell 0.2 percent against the US dollar after the Central Bank said there was no urgency to lift interest rates. //////Foreign Minister Dipu Moni yesterday called on the opposition parties to help the government strengthen cooperation with the regional countries, particularly with India, for the greater interests of the country.//////Commerce Minister Faruk Khan yesterday said the government will start the process of trying war criminals soon and it will be conducted in line with international standards.//////The leaders of BNP and its student body Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) yesterday threatened to oust the government by launching tough movements if "torture" on the opposition leaders and activists continued.//////United States (US) has supported strongly Bangladesh's regional counterterrorism approach and assured necessary assistance for making this effort more effective in the coming days.//////Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad yesterday proposed that provincial government system be introduced dividing the country into eight provinces to reduce pressure on Dhaka, decentralisation of power and balanced development across the country.//////Four leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League unit of Eden Girls' College in the capital were expelled from the organisation yesterday in connection with a conflict between two groups of the unit. //////An elderly man was killed in a road accident on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway at Jamtala in the district yesterday. //////A female domestic help doped all the three members of a family and made off with Tk 20000 in cash and two cellphone sets from a residence in the city's Segunbagicha area yesterday.//////A moderate tremor jolted the capital city and different parts of the country early yesterday with no reports of casualties or damage.//////Bangladesh Chhatra Union (BCU) and different left-leaning student organisations observed 'Raju Day Against Violence' on the Dhaka University campus yesterday with a vow to make the campuses violence-free.//////Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) has initiated a programme of selling bottled water by using all of its four idle water treatment plants even though the city's one-third population, mostly poor, is out of the corporation's water supply network.//////Members of Sampradayikata -

The body also bore several injury marks in the throat and face.//////It is a piece of good news that the government has taken the initiative to modernise the madrasa education system. The purpose is to produce Islamic scholars imbued with the knowledge of science and technology. In the Holy Quran, there are at least 800 verses which are directly related to science and technology revealing the basic tenets of Cosmology, Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Genetics, Geology and Marine Science. The glorious past of Muslim rule claims that there were 17 universities in Muslim Spain whereas Europe was far behind in establishing such qualified institutions at that time. This proves how advanced the Muslims were in spreading education and civilization. So, the present degradation and distress of the Muslim world is due to their isolation from the scientific and technological research of the Holy Quran. //////In our country we see different types of education system. But at the university level we see the pretty much same education system. But there is another problem at the university level. Usually, the better students get admitted in the public universities. But public university students are not getting the proper logistical support and proper environment for study which should be a matter of concern for the government right now. And it is going to be worse day by day. When the students complete their graduation and post graduation from universities, they face the grade problem. The school and college students who have completed their school level recently are getting much higher marks than their seniors got in the past.//////At least seven Royal Bengal Tigers were killed in the adjoining areas of the Sundarbans in the last 11 years when the wild animal entered localities in search of food. Villagers beat six tigers to death and shot dead another during the period. //////In 1996, during the rule of the Awami League, Chittagong TV centre started their terrestrial broadcasting with their daily programmes all over the country, so we could watch it from every corner of the country. But while the BNP came to power, they stopped it. And the closing practice is still there. The present government, committed to making a digital Bangladesh, is expected to take steps so that Chittagong TV Centre can re-launch their national terrestrial broadcasting with more extended time, wider and colourful arrangement. //////The British East India Company left the sub-continent in 1947. Their goal was to loot and plunder the resources of the country. From the activities of the politicians, it can very well be said that the Frankenstein of the British East India Company still lives on among them.//////I am feeling so sorry for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Almighty Allah gave her the opportunity, by availing it she could have become a saint-like person, people would have looked upon her with awe and admiration. She would have been treated as an icon, people would have remembered her as an idol.//////The practice of honouring the dead at the state level surprises me. Some four to five solders/policemen salute the coffin wearing shoes. They also play flute. It can not be an honour for a Muslim after his/her death. Some ayats of the Holy Quran should be recited after making ablution and Sura Fatiha must be recited. Otherwise, the state honour is pointless and the departed souls do not get any peace from it.//////As the expenses of medical care have mounted in a lot of countries, much concentration is focused on incompetence, the occurrence of unproven interventions and the strange practice variations from one geographic area to another.//////Running the Prime Minister's Office on solar power has set a national example for the country to go for all measures in adopting alternative energy options. This should create the awareness on the urgent national need for mobilising alternative energy sources, given our fast receding natural gas reserves and the lack of other local energy resources. The Hon. PM should instruct the Ministry of Information so that this awareness is well projected in all our audio-visual and print media, both official and private, to generate public interest and awareness.//////Language Martyrs are our national pride, as there is only one nation in the world that has the history of sacrificing life for language. For honouring them on 21st February we come to Shaheed Minar barefooted. Foreigners also come without shoes, as they evaluate properly the heroes of the Language Movement.//////The AL is hell-bent on sorting out pro-Jamaat officers for giving them forced retirement, or at least putting them on OSD status. Now our unabashedly partisan government has started to point finger to Jamaat-BNP for every trouble and humiliate, intimidate and torture them to smother their voice.//////This refers to your captioned commentary, published in the 18th February issue of The Daily Star. This write-up inspires me to write something more about the 'name-game' of the government.//////After browsing through the first Supplement of The Daily Star's 19th anniversary issue, I sighed with relief. The learned contributors have pointed out issues which are not broached by our politicians and by the MPs in national parliament. The well-off political leaders handle national issues through the party angles and give lower priority to mass issues which are not in party interest. This sham display of political rhetoric in depicting democracy continues even after four decades after the learning process started since 1972. This Supplement spotlighted views from the non-political society leaders.//////To my sheer ecstasy, I chanced to read some long-missing blissful words titled 'prayer for peace' written by Tapan Kumar Shil published in The Daily Star on January 23. With our beloved planet long-starved of peace, security and hope, being perpetually bedevilled with man-manufactured miseries, these words echo the yearnings of all peace-loving people. Inconsolably enough, our afflictions are not effected by the aliens. Thus the planet named 'Earth' will remain strife-stricken in perpetuity, eventually forcing hopeless 'Humanity' to sob away into evanescence? And undeniably, we owe a debt of gratitude to the poet for producing and to my beloved DS for disseminating those soothing words.//////A government's performance in our times is dependent on the presence of an administrative system not hostage to politicisation or subject to excessive centralisation. In this context, the prime minister and her administration must move swiftly toward initiating and implementing administrative reforms. A mere expression of intent is not enough. Over the past three decades, a raft of recommendation has been made about reforming the bureaucracy. It is time to go back to them and update them and indeed, get things moving again. Only that will see a fulfilment of Promises.//////Yet another Bangladeshi was killed on 4 March by the BSF (DS, 5 March,2010). I really fail to understand how we talk about a blooming friendship while they keep killing our countrymen almost every alternate day, if not daily. //////Shame on our doctors and the medical system. Our doctors are not qualified enough even to perform a routine medical check up! Is this the reason that the President has to go to Singapore for a medical check up or is it because it does not cost him anything? Or is it our politician's utter disrespect for anything Bangladeshi? If the President thinks that our doctors and medical system is not good enough for him, why can't he do something to improve it? Perhaps what is good enough for millions of ordinary people is not good enough for him. What else can be expected from our politicians?//////In 1974 India signed the Simla pact with Pakistan because of which 90,000 PoWs with 195 war criminals went back to Pakistan. //////President Obama did not dramatically change at all the surveillance policies of his predecessor. This strategy has made it simpler for the US government to spy on every American and millions of others around the world, You would think that eight or nine years now after the 9/11 attacks, the government would have done a better job just getting management over the information it already had.//////A suicide attacker set off a bomb at a security checkpoint in northwest Pakistan yesterday, killing at least 13 people and injuring 52, officials and a doctor said, underscoring the relentless security threat to this Islamic nation.//////Tens of thousands of supporters of deposed premier Thaksin Shinawatra streamed through military checkpoints into the capital yesterday as they headed to a rally aimed at toppling the government.//////India and Russia inked a slew of major defence deals and upgraded their civil nuclear sector under which Russia will build up to 16 atomic reactors for power stations as Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin wrapped up his daylong visit here on a high note on Friday. //////Notwithstanding the reconciliatory policies of President Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif has said he still considers the President as the biggest threat to democracy.//////Reprimanding the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) over its dilly-dallying attitude, the Pakistan Supreme Court has asked the bureau to "stop playing hide and seek" over the immunity status granted to President Asif Ali Zardari and seek the custody of the documents relating to the 60 million dollar money laundering case which the government had withdrawn from Swiss courts.//////US General Stanley McChrystal briefed President Barack Obama and his war cabinet on Friday on "progress" in the first big offensive of the US Afghan surge strategy, the White House said.//////Asia and Pacific nations vowed Saturday to fight emerging terror threats to commercial aircraft by boosting international security standards and measures, including screening technology.//////Separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani has called for a boycott of village and urban local body polls in Jammu and Kashmir due to be held next month.//////Astronomers have confirmed that two extremely dense stars in an intimate dance are spinning around each other in just 5.4 minutes at about 500 kilometres a second, making them the fastest known stellar partners in the galaxy.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai has agreed to let two non-Afghans join the country's elections watchdog ahead of September polls, a spokesman said yesterday after pressure from Western backers.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has rebuked Israel for plans to build new settler homes, saying it sent a "deeply negative signal" about Israel's ties to its top ally.//////Sri Lanka's main ethnic Tamil party said yesterday it is ready to accept regional self-rule instead of total independence, which it had previously demanded.//////Iraqi premier Nuri al-Maliki's bid to retain his job gained steam yesterday, as early results crucially put him ahead in Baghdad, while rival blocs began jostling over the formation of a government.//////A new study by scientists has shown that many birds in the world, particularly in North America, are shrinking, in response to warmer temperatures.//////An American seized in Yemen in a sweep of suspected al-Qaeda members had been a labourer at six US nuclear power plants, and authorities are investigating whether he had access to sensitive information or materials that would be useful to terrorists.//////The luxury furniture Michael Jackson commissioned before his death will go under the hammer in June in Las Vegas along with other personal items from the King of Pop, Julien's Auctions announced Friday.//////Nepal Army chief General Chhatraman Singh Gurung has refused to hire fighters from the opposition Maoist party's guerrilla army en masse on Friday.//////Rabindranath Tagore wrote Valmiki Pratibha when he was twenty. Though it's often labelled as an opera, the play is more of a musical (combining music and dance). It was first staged in 1881 and Tagore played the protagonist. The play narrates the metamorphosis of Ratnakar, a formidable bandit king to Valmiki, legendary poet-sage who wrote the Indian epic "Ramayan". //////Bangladesh Gram Theatre arranged a colourful programme to celebrate its president Nasiruddin Yousuff's receiving Ekushey Padak this year. The programme was held at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy premises on March 12. Highlights of the programme were performances of indigenous art forms as well as theatre, classical music, dance, recitation and more.//////Classical music has lost none of its appeal. This was proved in ample measure at a cultural event styled 'Celebrating Life' held at Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin auditorium of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) on March 10.//////Rabindranath belongs in our tradition. The new generation will not be enlightened by distancing itself from Rabindranath. Tagore's teachings will help us become enlightened human beings.

In the same vein, after the first meeting held in August 2009, Khademul Islam Chowdhury, chairman of the CHT Land Commission on Settlement of Land Disputes, also underscored the importance of land survey as the first step to resolution of land disputes. He declared that land survey would start very soon. //////TAMAR is a small advasi tribal village in the deep jungles of Chhattisgarh.
