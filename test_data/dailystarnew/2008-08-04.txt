A successful election would bear out the fact that we might just have managed to get out of the corner that we were in, with both democracy and politics in the limbo, and on our way to full democratic governance with people's representatives in control. //////WE fail to understand why the Bangladesh Police Ordinance 2007, an instrument of immense importance, should at all need advocacy for its implementation. With the spectre of crime and criminality not showing any sign of going away soon, we feel the sooner the ordinance is promulgated, the faster the force will become effective in maintaining law and order in the country. It is true that making the instrument effective would also help bridge the gap between the people and the members of the police force, which we believe is vital for removing certain misgivings in the minds of the common people. There is no denying the fact that common people are often subjected to harassment both inside and outside police stations, which at times crosses the boundaries of civility and the concept of human rights. //////VIEWED purely from a political angle Madam Khaleda Zia's release from detention is a logical sequel to the freeing of Sheikh Hasina a month ago in the name of treatment abroad. After all, the compulsion for doing so, if any, on the part of the ruling dispensation is the same. The prospect that the madam also will be released soon in a similar manner has already been on the cards. The release of Coco, one of her indicted sons, seems to have put the process in motion.//////IN the general elections of 2004, the irrepressible and sometimes irresponsible Lalu Prasad Yadav used to tow around a maulvi when in campaign mode.

It was in the third game that Federer made a comeback shot, which ultimately though, did turn towards Nadal. //////It's a story. Once, there was a building in Jagannath Hall of Dhaka University. It was almost broken. Students found their lives at risk. But, as students are not human beings, so, they didn't have any choice and got themselves used to living in such a building. Some students, out of fear, made a mistake: they demanded security of their lives, and wanted the DU administration to repair the worn out building. But, the DU administration didn't pay heed to the misguided students; they didn't repair it.//////This is the usual mechanism by which modern democracy fills offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government.//////Through your newspaper I would like to draw attention of the city's traffic authorities to the loud noise making car mufflers.

Just to inform our readers, I am also educating myself on democratic values watching the full coverage of the US Presidential election process and campaign on major television networks, although I know that one would be more frustrated if one ever tries to compare the two situations. Nevertheless, it is raising our expectation to see more civil-democratic order in our country. Unfortunately, the impact of our deliberately mismanaged state affairs is just opposite. That is why I see all efforts of the EC and the government have made the general election look very ugly. The reasons why I say ugly are://////On July 27, 2008, Mr. Suranjeet Debnath wrote a very good article on the poor salary of community school teachers in Bangladesh. Sometimes I wonder if I write any article whether that would have any impact. Though I am not optimistic about it, I still write and try to convey the message. I am surprised to see that the teachers are getting salary of Tk 1,200 per month, after months of agitation and hunger strike. This monthly salary can only buy 30Kg rice at the current market price. If this is the case, how could these teachers and their families survive? What are the top level government officials doing? Does anyone understand the impact in the long run? Does anyone care about this situation? It seems to me that government decision makers do not care about educating our children in the rural areas of Bangladesh, because most of the top decision makers live in the capital city or district headquarters. They work in air conditioned rooms, live in government houses, use government cars, get good retirement benefits and educate their children in good urban schools. It is very unfortunate that these government officials are completely out of touch of common villagers and perceive themselves as the Masters. I think our government officials must be retrained to change their attitude to become servants, not masters of the people. Like Dr. Barakat, I strongly feel that the salary of the primary school teachers in rural areas should be increased for the sake of ensuring standard education.//////The leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed yesterday to "re-engage" in the fight against Islamic extremism, a joint statement said, after ties had soured following an attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul.//////At least 21 Tamil Tiger rebels and a Sri Lankan government soldier have been killed in the latest clashes in the island's north, the defence ministry said yesterday.//////PPP chairman Asif Ali Zardari will hold a crucial meeting this week with his ally PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif that could decide the future of Pakistan's ruling coalition, which is under strain over its failure to reinstate judges deposed by President Pervez Musharraf.//////Iran will not give up "a single iota of its nuclear rights," the country's president said Saturday, rebuffing an informal deadline to stop expanding uranium enrichment or face more sanctions. //////A roadside bomb caused carnage in Somalia yesterday with a group of women sweeping a Mogadishu street "torn to pieces" amid a body count of at least 20 civilians, according to witnesses and medics.//////al-Qaeda has posted a statement on the Internet saying four of its Afghanistan commanders have been killed, including an explosives expert wanted by the US. //////Israel began returning Fatah members who had fled deadly clashes in the Gaza Strip to the territory yesterday following a request by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, Israeli security officials said.//////Arab media reported yesterday that a brigadier general thought to be the Syrian regime's liaison with Hezbollah in Lebanon has been assassinated.//////A truck bomb exploded during rush hour yesterday on a busy commercial street in northern Baghdad, killing at least 12 people and wounding about two dozen, Iraqi police and health officials said. //////Keen to put the Indo-US nuclear deal on fast track, the US is poised for a diplomatic overdrive to ensure there are no hurdles at the Nuclear Suppliers Group after the atomic safeguards pact faced some reservations at the IAEA before being cleared.//////At least 40 farm labourers were killed and dozens more wounded after the overcrowded truck they were travelling in plunged into a river in northern India, police said yesterday. //////Former British prime minister Tony Blair sharply criticised his successor Gordon Brown in a memo, accusing him of having "disused our own record", according to the Mail on Sunday.//////Republican candidate John McCain's presidential campaign is cynical, not racist, in its efforts to distract voters from real issues, Democratic rival Barack Obama said Saturday. //////The UN's new human rights envoy for Myanmar arrived yesterday for his first mission to the military-run nation, where his predecessor made little headway in pushing the junta to reform.//////The growing number of forest fires in Indonesia's Sumatra island has triggered warning bells that hazy skies could return to neighbouring Malaysia, environmental officials said yesterday.//////Abdullah Al Mamun is a name intertwined with the media and theatre world of our country.

Almost all of them, from the UN to the World Bank, are the flora of a different political landscape, planted in the period after the Second World War when Europe was still being reconstructed under the auspices of the Marshall Plan, and the Americans and Soviets were locked in an ideological battle with no real end in sight.
