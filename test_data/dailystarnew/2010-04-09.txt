With all the time that has gone by and with the monsoon season approaching, it is only natural to ask, on the part of the head of government as indeed of any citizen, why a matter that ought to have been handled on a priority basis should have been tackled in such laid-back fashion. The officials entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the repair of the flood protection embankments in the Aila-affected regions would have everyone know that the delay was caused by their 'scrupulous' compliance with the provisions of the Public Procurement Regulations (PPR). That logic holds little water, for the reality is that the PPR was relaxed for the very reason of facilitating the rebuilding and repair of the embankments.

become miserable due to frequent power outage. This menace is increasing day by day. The authorities seem to have turned a deaf ear to public sufferings. Instead of mitigating the sufferings of city dwellers they boastfully announce more power cuts in near future. Earlier, power was cut for one hour at a time at a certain place, but now that timing has been extended to two hours at a time-- to the great sufferings of all in this hot humid summer. Earlier, the government took a suicidal step to increase power generation by suspending gas supply to the fertilizer factories and diverting the gas to the gas based power-generating plants. For sometime the government adopted the policy of daylight saving. This step did not last long as it brought more sufferings, especially to the tiny tots who were asleep in the transports while going to school one hour earlier in the morning. //////Nowadays, one of the most luxury vehicles is CNG three wheeler.

If you happen to be around the College Gate, please do not forget to pay a courtesy call to Mr. Dustbin and be entertained with a nasty odour and dirty scene!//////In the editorial piece The Rohingya dilemma published on 28 March, the author recognises that Rohingyas are in Bangladesh due to religious and political persecution, who are deliberately deprived of their citizenship rights and who have escape[d] from forced labour, rape, and religious persecution at the hands of the Myanmar military. And yet it is seen as acceptable to demand their repatriation into such a situation on the basis of a single, local newspaper report that demonstrates nothing more than mishandling of the issue by the Bangladeshi Embassy in Saudi Arabia. The allegation that there they are causing a law and order problem remains precisely that: an allegation. The author fails to provide a single source or piece of evidence to back up any claims of illegal activity, although his inventions do at least afford the Rohingyas some common sense, for who would ever bother to traffic non-addictive drugs? It is wrong to align the situation of the Rohingyas as sympathy cause (that of a Bangladeshi or foreigner otherwise). It is a situation that appeals directly to the basic principles of one's humanity. The article you printed demonstrates short-sightedness and introspection that aims through disingenuous claims to demonise and blame others for the challenges that Bangladesh is currently facing. //////It is very confusing to understand and express the political developments in Bangladesh.

The news reporter wrote, From roadside tea-stall owners to members of parliament, successful entrepreneurs, and home and land owners --- none are spared by the killer gangs. //////Teachers are the torchbearers, mentors and leaders of a nation. Frankly & honestly speaking, teachers are not well-treated in our country. The condition of private school, college teachers is really inexpressible. They have no stable remuneration system, although our present govt. ensures a fixed or standard package for the private school and college teachers. //////According to an American Cancer Society article, marijuana impairs the immune system.

"Digital Bangladesh" by 2021. It is a philosophy for a modern poverty free country with equal opportunity for all. Based on this the struggle to free Bangladesh from economic and political domination of West Pakistan began. Here, for 'Digital Bangladesh," special emphasis is given on applying modern technology based on IT sector development and its accessibility to broader population.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////Voting ended yesterday in Sri Lanka's parliamentary elections after nine hours of polling with observers reporting a low turnout.//////An opposition coalition proclaimed a new interim government yesterday in Kyrgyzstan after clashes left dozens dead and said it would rule until elections are held in six months.
