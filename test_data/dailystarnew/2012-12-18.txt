Earth is the only dynamic planet with an atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen, has liquid water and a temperature range conducive to life. But seldom do we pause to ponder that our planet, filled with exquisite beauty, a cornucopia of boisterous wildlife slithering, scampering, soaring, and swimming, could one day become a barren wasteland unable to support life in any form whatsoever.

It traps infrared radiation by slowing its return to space and keeps Earth as a temperate and a habitable planet, as opposed to unforgiving tundra. //////University of Colorado Boulder Assistant Professor Nikolaus Correll likes to think in multiples.
