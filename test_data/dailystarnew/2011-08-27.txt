Many writers and intellectuals, who started with commendable patriotic zeal and revolutionary ideals, often got burned out along the way, either becoming reactionary fanatics or living on the paychecks handed out by governments and financial institutions. But as an individual and also as a public figure, Nazrul remained acutely sensitive to suffering of the masses. He gave public speeches and addressed multitudes, edited newspapers, was a performing artiste, and went to jail for the relentlessness with which he protested dictatorships and colonialism. All these make it hard to give an overview of the great poet in a few words. //////Kazi Nazrul Islam enriched almost all the genres of Bangla songs. His compositions are based on the solid foundation of Indian classical music. //////To mark the 35th death anniversary of Kazi Nazrul Islam, television channels will air special programme throughout the day. Highlights://////Nazrul, The National Poet of Bangladesh, was a harbinger of secularism, liberalism, and interfaith harmony at a time when the sub-continent was mired in religious discord. But that's not all, there was more to Nazrul. His spirituality generated what's considered some of the most magnificent musical and lyrical odes to Divinity -- both in Islamic and Hindu traditions.//////The time may not be favourable to speak of anything organisationally pertinent to positive police performance.

In fact, BNP-Jamaat alliances' five years had been one of the worst periods of corruption and misrule in the country. Politics became a way of making money. //////Rabindranath Tagore's spiritual outlook and humanism were derived from man, nature and Brahma or God. He held the view that the route to spiritual development was from 'body to society, from society to totality and from totality to the spiritual domain'. In this way, the melody of the soul was intertwined with the universal power. But what was required for this inter-mingling was connecting the world of nature with that of human beings. To Tagore, the whole human body appeared to be reverberating with the touch of light, air, affection, love, bliss, joy and electricity, as if embedded in a supernatural flute. Although he might have been influenced by the romantic movements of the time, the Brahma Samaj, the Bauls, Sufism or the Vedanta philosophy of Upanishads, those views were in some respects Tagore's very own. We can very well comprehend how his spirit was liberated by connecting with the universe, the nature and the environment which surrounded him, by looking at the following lines: //////Sugata Bose, author of the recently published His ////// is a professor of history at Harvard University. He is also the grand-nephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. //////I am not a meteorologist by profession, but I pay much attention to what they have to say, be it on radio, television, newspaper, or, now, the Internet. However, anyone who has lived in the New England area of the USA (consisting of six states, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire) will understand my frustrations with meteorologists because it is hard to understand in relation to weather. They speak in their own language, their forecasts are often wrong, and they frequently land us in trouble! However, I can never be mad at themrather I am fascinated by their craft. //////Memories don't leave, like people do//////They stay like waves//////Beating on the shore, again and again//////Yogilates integrates the ancient yoga techniques and the modern pilates moves and modifies them into one balanced system of exercise.//////Pharmacovigilance is the science and activities related to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects- particularly concerned with long term and short term side effects of medicines.

Muammar el-Qaddafi's stranglehold on Libya appears to have ended after 42 years, even if his whereabouts remain elusive. But through countless erratic decrees and iron-handed purges, he carved deep scars into every facet of Libyan life. The mystery and speculation swirling about him marked a fitting close to a quixotic reign.//////The year 2011 marks 60 years of diplomatic relationship between China and Pakistan. This all-weather relationship has largely withstood 'the test of time'. Both states recognize the relevance of their cooperation in areas like security, trade and culture. All these years China has mostly followed the 'friend of Pakistan policy'. From the Indian perspective the focus of their cooperation, which has mostly revolved around security issues, has been a source of anxiety. Apart from the question of direct military aid, India must also take note of China's assistance to Pakistan in the field of science and technology as well since it has long-term strategic implications. China launched Pakistan's first communications satellite (PAKSAT-1R) on August 12, 2011 on a Long March-3B carrier rocket. This event demonstrates the deepening in technological cooperation between these two states. For China this was also an event to display the capabilities of its rapidly growing commercial satellite industry.//////Iran has begun transferring centrifuges, machines which churn out purified uranium, to the secretive Fordo plant, the state television website reported Monday quoting Tehran's nuclear chief. "The Fordo facility is being prepared and a batch of centrifuge machines have been transferred there," Fereydoun Abbasi Davani told reporters after a cabinet session on Sunday evening.//////Subhas Chandra Bose died of grievous injuries, a consequence of the crash of the small plane he was travelling in, in Taipei on 18 August 1945. That was a full two years before the India he loved almost to distraction would achieve freedom from British rule, albeit in bloodied fashion. To this day the question remains: would Bose, had his life not been cut short and had he succeeded in returning to India at the head of a triumphant Indian National Army, have made a difference? Would India remain a single entity and would the Congress and the Muslim League agree to a federal structure guaranteeing equality for all its religious communities? The briefest of responses to these queries would be to suggest that history does not deal with 'ifs' and 'buts'. And yet there is cause for reflection here. Judging by the record, by the tumultuous nature of his politics, all encapsulated in his brief life (he died aged forty-eight), Bose was without question a secular being absolutely driven by a zeal to bring all Indians into a single struggle against colonial domination. As this biography, one as full of substance as it is of pathos, shows, Bose was till the end a follower and admirer of Deshbandhu Chitta Ranjan Das. When Das died at the rather young age of fifty-one in 1925, Bose mourned in the loneliness of prison. In an essay written in gaol, Bose honoured Deshbandhu thus: //////
