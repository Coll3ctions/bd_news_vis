A band of acid throwers who had come looking for Mozammel Haque with whom they had an inimical relationship hurled the lethal liquid on the parents and their infant burning them severely. So blinded by rancour, vicious with intent and hell-bent on harming people were they that who fell victims to their heinous act hardly mattered to them. Such has become the manifestly dehumanised dimension of acid throwing.//////THIS is the story of a poor-turned rich household from Shibchar village under Laksmipur district.

These wastes range from household garbage, sewage, old papers, packaging materials, wood, plastic products, glass, metals to various industrial effluents such as: toxic inorganic heavy metals, organic solvents, reagents, dyes, thermal discharges, tannery disposal etc.//////In a resounding post editorial 'Rebel Warriors' on 19 September, Mr. Zafar Sobhan uttered the voice of all sensible Bangladeshis which should be read word by word several times by our cricket governors and their wailing sycophants. Mr. Sobhan categorically explains some solid points: firstly, our cricketers did not do any crime comparable a wee bit to any egregious practice like match-fixing; secondly, ICLunlike the IPLhas truly honoured our cricketers by creating a wide opportunity for them to compete as a 'Bangladeshi' team with international teams; and finally, playing or not-playing for the board has nothing to do with the issue of patriotism. Remember, ICL is at best 'unrecognised', not 'banned', by ICC. The reason is also known: ICC survives on BCCI's wealth. Come on, money talks! Whatever our BCB has done out of BCCI appeasement is laughablegiven that BCCI hasn't allowed a single Test series against Bangladesh in their soil in the last three years. //////Before settling the issue of harassment of girl students, the JU authorities have decided to violate the green environment of the JU. They have decided to cut more than 400 rare and environment-friendly trees. The reason, as reported in the media, is simply unacceptable to anybody with sound mind and heart. These beautiful trees are going to be the victim of the total mismanagement of the JU authorities.//////This is good news that with great enthusiasm a special day is being observed for the indigenous people in our country. Over forty minor ethnic groups are living in Bangladesh for a long time. They are fighting for establishing their human rights, own culture and language related to their individual ethnic identity. //////So, finally all the promises for political and electoral regulatory reforms, corruption free society, freeing politics from musclemen and black money holders etcetera have now ended in fiasco like bursting of bubbles in the ocean. All the alleged corrupt politicians, money launderers, political musclemen, are now back in the arena due to wielding of magic wand and are now vying with renewed vigour to stage a comeback. It appears the country is now set to be taken over by the same people again who through their misdeeds during the last thirty years brought the nation to a virtual collapse. Autocracy and anarchy under the guise of democracy will prevail again. Imagine, how the news of a fall in bathroom of an under trial prisoner could lead to premeditated street vandalism by the political cadres, resulting in loss of life and property ! Vandalism by the frontline organisations of the parties in various campuses, especially in DU, has already led to clashes amongst various factions and the academic atmosphere is disrupted. The ominous sign is everywhere. All hopes and aspirations of the peace loving general public are now shattered who, in the absence of the proposed electoral reforms, now have no role to play except watching and praying for the better days ahead keeping their fingers crossed. No doubt the nation has lost the golden chance for restoration of an orderly and proper democratic administration led by the educated and honest patriotic political leadership. Now who is to be blamed for the debacle? Undoubtedly the two major political parties. Their controversial intransigent leaders put each and every kind of impediment in arriving at any sensible solution through the reform process the present administration was aiming at. While they are looking at the long term national interest, the major parties stuck to their guns of self interest only. National interest is an issue unknown to the politicians of our country. The present administration, having the overwhelming initial support in the wake of the national catastrophe created by the disgraced politicians, perhaps could take a stronger position against any unreasonable demands of the dishonest politicians. Perhaps their greatest folly was their initial misunderstanding and soft handling of the controversial politicians who tried to defy any kind of improvement in the political order of the country. Fishing in troubled water was the politicians' prime intention for survival. //////Cox's Bazar was the number one wonder of nature for many days, but recently it was dropped from the list because of alleged fake voting. It's still not clear to us why it was left out. //////In the present era of communication, Internet is the most used medium. As the cable broadband connection is expensive, most of the subscribers prefer wireless internet services provided by the mobile operators. But it is a matter of great regret that the cost of this service is beyond the means of many subscribers, especially students. Operators are charging Tk0.02 per KB. Apparently, it seems cheap, but if we download a tiny/small file of 3MB, it costs around Tk 65. India's mobile operators are offering unlimited monthly Internet package for rupees 250 with 2mbps speed, whereas Bangladeshi operators are providing this service for Tk 800-1150 with maximum 128 kbps speed. Why should there be such a huge difference between two neighbouring countries? Why is the government reluctant to do anything in this respect? //////I do agree with the points highlighted by Mr. Sikander Ahmed on the rickshaw issue ( DS 08.09.08) and express all my sympathy for the senior citizen of the country. I personally feel his agony as I was also living at Niketon a few years back.//////This refers to the editorial of Sept. 12, with the above title.//////Four thousand tonnes of high yielding 'Diamond' variety potato seeds will be imported from Holland by November. Growers are in a worry of price hike of seeds. Last year they had to pay very high prices which resulted in high production cost and eventually it led to price hike of potatoes. This artificial crisis was created by hoarders. //////I read a news report in a Bangla daily dated September 12, 2008 (online version). //////The National University website is one of the problematic, troublesome websites in our country, especially when the results are published. Those cyber-cafe owners get the maximum benefit from it. They charge Tk 20 to 30 from students for each result seen. There is hardly a chance to see the result without the roll number, though there is an opportunity to see it college wise and department wise. National University has a huge number of students but it is not aware of the needs of the students. //////The caretaker govt. has failed to punish the top ranking political leaders for their corruption. The minus two formula has now turned into managed two. We don't want corrupt leaders in the political arena of Bangladesh. We need a statesman like Mahathir Muhammad.//////Ramadan or fasting is meant to teach the devotees patience, sacrifice, humility and encourage them to extend a helping hand to the less fortunate. Ramadan is the time to fast for the sake of Allah, pray for guidance to the right path, ask for help in refraining from everyday evils and purify ourselves through self-restraint and good deeds.//////I was in a foreign capital when 9/11 occurred. I got many encouraging phones and emails from relatives and friends, that the situation has changed, the country is back to the right track and the atmosphere is congenial for normal life. Like all homesick Bengalees, I shortened my stay and returned. The army backed government of eleven educated people was running in full steam. Law and order was normal, no hartal , no agitation even the road discipline improved. The only problem the government faced was slowing down of economic activities. We took it as the teething period and hoped for improvement in no time. The government reformed some public institutions like ACC, PSC and EC. Many corrupt businessmen and politicians were detained and harrowing stories of corruption were unearthed. Even a state minister in charge of the home ministry was reported to have hushed up a murder case in lieu of crores of taka. Stacked up money was recovered from most unlikely places like mattresses/pillows. //////Our secondary education system is poor compared to the developed countries and our students do not get enough care from our so-called school teachers. When I was studying in high school, I saw that our school teachers were not serious enough while teaching. They had no responsibility for our academic results. They did not teach well in school. But they were so much responsible and attentive to their own students who attended coaching classes at the teachers' homes . Because it was a source of their extra income. The students who could not attend such classes were deprived of good teaching. //////Tomakei kujchhe Bangladesh is one of the popular talent hunt programmes which is telecast by ntv. Getting inspiration from ntv, some other channels are going to launch this type of programmes. My question is, is it an appropriate title?

They are now planning to have the two ladies, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, sit face to face and sort out the things. I wish them all success.//////We have seen over the last many years a mad rush of people making beelines to rail or bus stations or to river ports for their journey home to celebrate Eid with their near and dear ones. The number of transports available was far short of the requirement. This forced the people to find entry to the transports even through windows, as the doors were too crowded to find a passage to their designated places -- sometimes only to find an unauthorised occupant. //////Thailand has a new prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat -- the brother-in-law of the ousted premier, Thaksin Shinawatra, who is currently in exile in England.
