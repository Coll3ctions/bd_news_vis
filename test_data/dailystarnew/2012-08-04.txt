According to what has been reported in the press, the new powers of the Chairman become absolute in sidelining the real owners of the bank those who own 97 per cent of the share. Presently, the Board has 12 members where only 3 members including the Chairman represent the government. The other 9 women members are elected from the grassroots by the 8million plus women shareholders. Hence, the latest effort shows the government's intention to change the very nature of one of the most unique bank in the world which has successfully empowered destitute women and has become a model for emulation throughout the world. The Nobel Prize was jointly awarded to both the institution and the founder and the government's deliberate move to change the way it is run is in effect, a camouflaged attempt to turn it into a government institution and we all fear and share the concerns of the Foundation.//////In spite of widespread media reports, the Myanmar government continued to categorically deny allegations of state-sponsored violence against the Rohingyas that erupted following the rape of a Buddhist woman in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.

This sensor collects and fixes this light, turning it into an image. The difference between digital and film-cameras is the difference in sensors.

Police officers have always provided a service to society, and indeed, have prided themselves on so doing.//////India's northeast is the most combustible region. Some 250 ethnic groups are arrayed against one another and New Delhi to fight for their identity, some seeking even an outside-India status. Religion-wise, the proportion of Hindus, Muslims and Christians is more or less the same. Infiltration, mostly from Bangladesh or what was East Pakistan, has only aggravated the problem. Even the Assamese who were given a separate state in 1955 when India was reorganised on the basis of language have become a minority in Assam itself.//////Adulteration is rampant in the country.

It is the largest power blackout in the history of electric power supply system in the world.

This was the first time in his young life that he had ventured outside the protected confines of his princely home and was amidst the natural surroundings he loved. He was only eleven then. Strangely enough, this would also be one of those treasured periods of time he would get to spend with his father Maharshi Devendranath. Rabi, in his later life, would call his childhood a period of 'servocracy' since he had grown up more under the tutelage of family servants than his parents. This trip to Shantiniketan and the Himalayas with his father was, therefore, all the more special to him. //////The history of human breastfeeding practice is certainly as old as the existence of human being on the earth.

There has been debate among the intelligentsia, academics and politicians on the emerging paradigm of democracy in this oil-rich country. The apparent electoral victory of National Forces Alliance (NFA) led by Mahmud Jibril, who is projected as a secular, has made some people believe that the country is moving to secular democracy. There may be some truths to this claim. However, this secular democracy hypothesis seems to fade away in view of emerging cultural blend growing out of the fusion of different cultural extremes. This constitutes a second strand of thinking about the post election political paradigm. //////Nearly four years after violent clashes between the indigenous Bodo community and the immigrant minority Muslim land settlers rocked Assam's Darrang and Udalguri districts in 2008, violence has once again flared up on similar lines in Assam. In October 2008, violence over issues of land took 55 lives and injured 111 while forcing 200, 000 people to take shelter in 82 relief camps. The proximate cause of the 2008 violence was the incident of alleged violence meted out to a Bodo youth, Rakesh Swargiary, by Muslim minority youth. The news of this attack spread like wildfire amongst the Bodo community resulting in widespread violence between the two communities. The Bodo community was already on the edge after two Bodo youths were killed in Rowta, Udalguri in August 2008 after they had refused to take part in a bandh called by the All Assam Minority Students' Union (AAMSU). //////I have always had wanderlust in my blood, the urge to just pack up and go, to any place that catches my fancy for whatever reason. My great satisfaction has been that I have been able to indulge that urge quite a bit. I am also a history buff. These days, for a variety of reasons, pointedly not including a diminished desire, I am unable to just get up and go, but I still delve into history at every opportunity that comes my way. I was recently presented a book that satiated both of my great interests, one vicariously, the other as supplementing what I already know. Sakhawat Hussain's ////// is a pleasant travelogue heavily laced with historical anecdotes, interspersed with astute comments, and some imaginative reconstructions. Some myths and coincidental occurrences, which the author almost persuades the reader as having been real, causal, or consequential, spice up the narrative. The book recounts two journeys undertaken within a few months of each other by Hussain and friends to Poshchimbongo and Bihar in 2010 and 2011. The author's own proclivity for travel and history come through clearly in his writing, and, although he alludes to historical facts of ancient, medieval and modern India, he spends a substantial portion on the Battle of Plassey, its antecedents, and its enormous ramifications for the history of South Asia in general, Bengal and Bihar in particular. //////The turn of the nineteenth century appears to have been a busy time for literary pursuits. On both sides of the Atlantic, in the English speaking world, authors like Henry James with The Turn of the Screw, Stephen Crane with The Red Badge of Courage, Thomas Hardy with Jude the Obscure, Rudyard Kipling with The Second Jungle Book, Leo Tolstoy with Master and Man, in science fiction Jules Verne with Propeller Island, in drama Oscar Wilde with The Importance of Being Earnest were gaining in popularity and critical acclaim for their work.//////Junaidul Haque mainly writes short stories and essays on literature and culture.
