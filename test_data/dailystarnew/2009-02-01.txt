There can be no denying that the manner in which twelve dormitories of the university have been under illegal occupancy for the last so many years has brought conditions to a pass where both teachers and students of the university now feel that urgent action is necessary to correct conditions. The outburst that was noticed in old Dhaka a few days ago was, given the realities of the situation, a reaction to old grievances that successive governments have either ignored studiously or have not had time to pay attention to.

Abahani will now meet Gazi Tank while Biman, who had national speedster Shahadat Hossain's batting skills to thank for a thrilling win, will face Mohammedan in the semifinals on February 3 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.

The crammed itinerary says that two days after finishing a five-game series against South Africa they must start another against New Zealand. Daniel Vettori's team could not find a more opportune moment to arrive at their neighbour's but they are also the only ones Australia have been able to beat comfortably since going to India, so there should be some relief on the way for the Aussies. //////Prosper Utseya played an outstanding captain's innings to lead Zimbabwe to a series-clinching four-wicket win in the third one-day international in Nairobi on Saturday when the home side had looked on course to keep the contest alive.
