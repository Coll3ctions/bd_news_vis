It's a matter of hope that he has been caught by the detectives already. //////Adulteration in all spheres of our country at present has attained a new height, perhaps the maximum. Can anyone identify a single sector in our country bereft of corruption or adulteration? Corruption has made its way in every nook and corner of our society. Adulteration is an inevitable by-product of the number one problem of our country, i.e., corruption. The appalling scenario in our fruit markets simply multiplies our anxiety, tension and panic. What we are eating are all adulterated mixed with perilous chemicals and other detrimental ingredients.//////We think BNP should not become enthusiastic just because people supported a few of its strikes, the eviction of Begum Khaleda Zia from her house made people so outraged and Awami League-led government's decision of scrapping caretaker government system made them so angry that they did not oppose the hartal. It does not mean that people like hartal, they have had enough when Awami League was in the opposition, from 12 hours to 72 hours non-stop hartals; we shudder to think about that period. So much public property was damaged, newly built railway station and the Biman office in Chittagong was vandalised and set on fire by the activists of Awami League. Office goers were stripped off their clothes if they dared to go to the office during hartal hours.//////The minimum taxable income limit has been proposed to be raised from Tk 165,000 to Tk 180,000 in the budget of FY 2011-12. Thanks to the government. The prices of essentials have shot up tremendously and the cost of living like house rent, educational and medical expenses have also gone beyond the control of the lower income group. We are the worst sufferers in the society. The minimum ceiling should reasonably be increased considering the purchasing power of the lower and middle income group. If somebody gets a salary of Tk 15,000 plus, it's very difficult and burdensome for him to pay tax with this little income. All the people of Bangladesh are paying taxes by paying VAT while buying essentials, paying telephone bills, electricity bills, and water bills and so on. Why should the lower income group pay Income Tax again? If the ceiling is raised from proposed Tk 180,000 to Tk 240,000, the lower and middle income group will get some space to breathe and it will be a great relief to them especially at this critical time when prices of essentials are beyond the capacity of the general people.//////No one can bypass the Constitution which provides the legislature and the judiciary their right to discuss and finalize any law of the land. Surely, the wise legal advisers of the civil society group are aware of the constitutional provisions. I am sure that with all the mounting pressure, this government will work on the Ombudsman Bill without further delay. //////The Tangail correspondent of a local English daily reported this matter, published on June 6th issue of the daily. It was indeed a commendable matter; where villagers voluntarily improved their local communication facilities! As a villager told the correspondent that: "It was a matter of great pride, and a different kind of joy, to build the road with our own money and labour"! This is indeed a worthwhile matter, and should set an example, for others to follow! It should be widely covered in our audio-visual and print media; that can motivate others to take up similar projects on voluntary basis.//////This disease is the most common form of dementia which is almost incurable and is diagnosed in people over 65 years of age.

The only approaching road to Kadamtala has been damaged in such a way that it is not at all suitable for traffic movement or even for pedestrians' use. Hundreds of small potholes have developed on the road and those are growing bigger day by day. As Kadamtala is basically a residential area, thousands of inhabitants as well as the school and college students are suffering immensely on their way back home. Re-carpeting of the main road and other lanes is very much necessary. But the Dhaka City Corporation is overlooking the problem. If the road and lanes are not re-carpeted immediately, those are to be re-constructed in near future. We urge the Dhaka City Corporation to re-carpet the road and lanes of Kadamtala, Bashabo.//////The other day I was waiting for some of my friends in front of a fast food shop at Shugondha Residential Area in Chittagong. Suddenly I became terrified to witness something unusual -- a man carried two buckets of water to fill up the empty "filtered water jar. At once I took a snap with my mobile phone. I did not understand how the shop owner allowed him to do so? I was thinking how we are being cheated by drinking so-called filtered water. When I was taking the snap the shop owner was laughing at me. He did not even bother about my photograph. The law enforcing agencies must take stern action against these fast food shops, hotels and restaurants which are providing unsafe drinking water and thus cheating the public. //////Hours after loud blasts shook Libya's capital Tripoli, Muammar Gaddafi vowed to defeat Nato as his forces launched a deadly rocket assault on rebel-held Misrata.//////Barack Obama overruled the advice of administration lawyers in deciding the US could continue participating in the Libya conflict without congressional approval, The New York Times reported yesterday.//////Tokyo Electric Power said yesterday it stopped treating highly radioactive waste water at a crippled Japanese nuclear plant just hours after the system came online because parts needed to be replaced.//////Nine people were killed yesterday when three attackers armed with suicide vests and machine-guns stormed a police station in the heart of the Afghan capital Kabul, officials said.//////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas urged European Union nations on Friday to separately or collectively recognise the state of Palestine.//////The United States has formally dropped criminal charges against former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed in a US military raid in Pakistan last month.//////The United States is holding talks with the Taliban, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said yesterday, in what is thought to be the first official confirmation of such contacts.//////US President Barack Obama said Friday he's prepared for a potential crisis in the White House next month -- his oldest daughter becoming a teenager.//////Myanmar state media yesterday accused ethnic minority rebels of starting deadly fighting near the Chinese border as an official confirmed civilians were fleeing the clashes.//////The United States and Vietnam on Friday jointly called for freedom of navigation and rejected the use of force in the South China Sea, amid simmering tensions between Beijing and its neighbours.//////A top US lawmaker on Friday blasted France for agreeing to sell two warships to Russia saying Paris had ignored "the clear danger" the deal would pose to US and regional security.//////At least two members of the Venezuelan national guard and an inmate were dead Friday after security forces launched a massive operation to retake control of the El Rodeo prison, where 22 people have been killed in rioting.//////Australian leader Julia Gillard said she felt "very secure" and vowed to stay the course yesterday, after an unprecedented slump in the polls and a surge in support for axed prime minister Kevin Rudd.//////Authorities in China have arrested 19 people suspected of "provoking incidents" during three days of riots in the country's southern industrial heartland, state media said yesterday.//////India's coast guard yesterday launched an operation to trace about 400 fishermen who went missing during monsoon storms in West Bengal, officials said.//////South Korean troops fired yesterday at a passenger jet after mistaking it for a North Korean aircraft.//////Morocco's youth-based February 20 Movement called for nationwide protests yesterday against constitutional reforms proposed by King Mohammed VI.//////Tajikistan yesterday charged Urunbay Usmonov, 59, a correspondent for the BBC's Central Asia service, with membership of a banned Islamist group, after his arrest sparked global concern that he was being persecuted merely for opposing the regime.//////Former Zambia president Frederick Chiluba, 68, who ruled the country from 1991 to 2001, died at his home in the early hours of yesterday morning, his spokesman said.//////Chhayanaut's two-day long celebration, marking the birth centenary of pioneering poet Sufia Kamal (June 20, 1911-November 20, 1999), featured music, reading and documentary screening at the Chhayanaut Auditorium in Dhaka on June 17 and 18. //////The fortnight-long National Theatre Festival 2011 ended on June 17 at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.
