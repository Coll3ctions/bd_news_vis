Never before in the annals of human history perhaps has there been such a diabolical attempt to deny the political rights of the majority by the minority, and never before has the majority been forced to the fight to reclaim their rights. And that led to what we saw so proudly emerge as an independent country not only as the symbol but also an affirmation of the political rights of the people of Bangladesh. //////An entire year has passed since Limon, a young HSC student from Jhalakathi, was left crippled after being shot by Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) personnel for being a cohort of a criminal. So far no evidence has been provided to prove such an allegation. Instead, two false cases have been filed against him, one under the Arms Act and another for 'preventing law enforcers from discharging their duties'. Meanwhile Limon has had to bear the agony of losing a leg just two weeks before his HSC examinations and then appearing in court for these cases against him.

Our two major political parties are usually very adept in organising and carrying out disruptive activities. Doing things constructively is unfortunately beyond their ken.//////Though our team has failed to win the match, yet I salute them for what they have achieved in this tournament. It seems the Tigers have united and played their role properly. At least, I can say now that Bangladesh is not a team of 'one man army,' they are now a team of commandos! How Tamim Iqbal played was really exceptional. He has managed to score four 50s consecutively. Shakib Al Hasan is the 'heart' of Bangladesh cricket team. Undoubtedly, he has won our heart once again by his extraordinary performance throughout the tournament.//////Believe it or not, in the retail market of Dhaka, one egg is selling for Tk.10. It is unprecedented in the country. Only less than a dozen one-day chick breeders are mainly responsible for such sky-high price. The poultry farm owners, poultry feed producers and the government decision makers are partially responsible for this. The prices of poultry birds have become double. As the eggs and the poultry birds were relatively less costly, general people used to go for these options for meeting their protein need which are out of their reach now. //////We are happy to know that work is underway to rehabilitate 10,000 beggars of Dhaka. Primarily 2,000 beggars would be rehabilitated at their own hometowns, as Social Welfare Minister Enamul Hoque Mostofa Shaheed told parliament recently. It is really encouraging that Beggar Rehabilitation Cell of this ministry is planning to provide mobile shops, rickshaws, rickshaw-trolleys, sewing machines and money to start small business to the beggars capable of working. In addition, the Cell will arrange motivational orientation classes for the beggars to infuse into them the inspiration to be self-dependent. //////During the Bangladesh-India Asia Cup match, suddenly we experienced load shedding. As Bangladesh team was playing well and had a chance of winning, I listened to Bangladesh Betar to get the live commentary of the match. However, some patriotic songs were played at the same time with the commentary. It created a very chaotic situation. My point is, does Bangladesh Betar have to show so much patriotism denying its listeners the chance to hear the live commentary of a crucial cricket match? Isn't watching our country play and supporting them from the core of the heart patriotism as well?//////The footpath in front of Eden Mohila College is one of the busiest footpaths in the area. The footpath is used by all types of people. But now some hawkers have taken possession of the footpath creating trouble for the passers-by. They have already set up at least fifty small shops of cosmetics and clothes. At first there was only one shop but the number increased with the passage of time. Female students of nearby educational institutions and housewives from Azimpur colony gather there for shopping, as things are sold at a cheaper price here. It is very worrying to see that finding no other way the pedestrians walk on the main road (Mirpur road). If any accident happens, who will take the responsibility? All the shops from this footpath should be evicted and it should be made free for pedestrians' use only.//////A person's real worth depends on his health, education and morality. Similarly, a country's image depends on how strong its education, health and moral standards are. That day I took my mother to our local public hospital. Doctors at the emergency prescribed medicine among which only saline was given free from the hospital. What is most troubling was that my emaciated old mother had to be taken to a distant diagnostic centre for the several necessary or unnecessary tests that the doctors usually give these days with a view to earning extra money. //////We have had enough unrest over the issue of the caretaker government; we do not want to suffer anymore; the government and the opposition political parties must come to an understanding as soon as possible. We think it is the duty of the government to see that the issue is settled in a way which is acceptable to the opposition because the CTG was formed to fulfil the demand of the Awami League and was subsequently dissolved by them without any consultation with the opposition. //////Parents send their children to universities for higher education hoping that one day they would be able to lead the country. Most parents go through many difficulties to send money to their university-going children. Regrettably, a good number of the students seem to become oblivious of their parents' hopes and expectations the moment they walk into the campus. They get involved in various destructive and virulent activities, even over trivial matters. Clashes among students infuse tension not only in the parents but the nation as well.//////After two consecutive victories over India and Sri Lanka, I had firm belief that Bangladesh would do well in the final also. They played well undoubtedly, but came short by just 2 runs, disappointing millions. I feel that the person mainly responsible for this loss was Shahadat who gave19 runs in the last over. He always puts pressure on other bowlers to check the runs. He had taken a hat-trick in One Day International cricket previously, but his current form suggests that he has lost his control over his bowling. Our selectors are so generous to Shahadat but when it comes to Nazmul, they are not considerate, although he plays much better than Shahadat. I hope our selectors would be judicious in selecting the players in the future.//////US President Barack Obama yesterday warned North Korea that it would "achieve nothing by threats or by provocations".//////Israel should boycott the United Nations Human Rights Council after it voted to authorise a probe of Israeli settlements, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told public radio on Sunday.//////Well-known author Arundhati Roy said that the Indo-US relations were a theatrical drama enacted to induce India to support the US with a view to isolate Iran on one hand and help build a cold war situation in China.//////The US military is not planning to discipline any of its forces over a cross-border skirmish last year that left 24 Pakistani soldiers dead and plunged Washington-Islamabad ties to their lowest point in years, a US military official said on Saturday.//////Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called on regional powers yesterday to unite against aggression as he gathered for security talks with his counterparts from Afghanistan and Pakistan.//////Maoist rebels in India yesterday released one of two Italian men who were kidnapped 11 days ago in the eastern state of Orissa.//////Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday sought to mollify Sri Lanka's hurt over India's joining US and other nations to censure the island republic for human rights violations, by stressing that Indian diplomats had actually helped temper down the criticism at UN's Human Rights Council.//////Relatives of 17 people shot dead in a rampage by a US soldier in southern Afghanistan have been paid tens of thousands of dollars in compensation, a tribal chief and government officials said yesterday.//////Conservative Party co-treasurer Peter Cruddas yesterday resigned after secretly filmed footage showed him apparently offering access to the prime minister for a donation of 250,000 a year.//////Rick Santorum yesterday scored a convincing victory in the Republican presidential primary in Louisiana.//////Australia's ruling Labor Party has suffered a crushing defeat in an election in the state of Queensland, handing the conservative Liberal National coalition the biggest majority in the state's history.//////After a gap of six months, the Indian government will hold dialogue with Ulfa on April 9 as part of efforts to bring a lasting solution to the decades-old insurgency problem in the northeastern state of Assam. //////Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday suspended her campaign because of ill-health a week before she is due to stand for a seat in parliament.//////Former US Vice-President Dick Cheney has had a heart transplant and is now recovering in hospital, his office has said.//////Self-made millionaire property consultant Leung Chun-ying won Hong Kong's leadership election yesterday, after the most divisive vote since the city reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.//////Some 11.5 million foreigners are living in the United States without proper immigration documents, according to estimates released Friday by the US Department of Homeland Security.//////Senegalese voted yesterday in a run-off election in which the 85-year-old incumbent Abdoulaye Wade is fighting off a mass opposition effort to foil his controversial bid to stay in power for a third term.//////Saeeda Kamal speaks with passion about the most important event in her life-- the War of Liberation.

I along with a number of artistes helped raise the morale of Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters by taking part in different training camps and people's struggle during the Liberation War of 1971. //////On this 41st Independence Day, it is time we had a fresh stocktaking of the past. The very remoteness of those tumultuous days of March 1971 has placed us at this vantage point to consider those from a dispassionate outlook. //////The nation observes today the 41st Anniversary of independence with usual zeal and gaiety, in spite of the deep frustration because of unfulfilled expectations.

Destiny goaded me into a stormy orbit of the country's journalism. After Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from jail interned on the charge of the Agartala Conspiracy Case, One day he suddenly stated, "I need an English Language newspaper." Looking at me he said, "Abidur Rahman, you were a journalist in early life, now God has given you enough recourses. You have to start an English Language newspaper for me." //////
