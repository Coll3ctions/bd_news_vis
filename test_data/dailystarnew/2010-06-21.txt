Most of the industries of Dhaka are located near the rivers and 70% of them have no Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) to treat industrial wastewater. As a result, factories are disposing of effluents without any treatment to the nearby river. Since industrial wastewater possesses high amount of heavy metal (cadmium, aluminium, zinc), non-biodegradable compounds, high alkalinity, high suspended solid, high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), the river ecosystems are becoming critically endangered. Data from NGOs and other monitoring authorities show that Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Turag, Balu receive about 1.9 million cubic meters of untreated water on daily basis which is alarming for aquatic life and human health.//////This is the worst fire disaster the nation has witnessed.

Investment is an important factor. Investment is also interlinked with some factors like political atmosphere, infrastructure, power & energy. //////We are stunned by the belligerent attitude of Israel, after invading an aid carrying ship in the international water, killing nine people and injuring many, it has no regrets, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu clearly stated he won't apologize for the incident.//////The problem of CHT is not the problem of CHT people only; it's a national problem of Bangladesh. //////Supporters of different football teams are buying and displaying the national flags of the respective countries.

All of these activities demonstrate utter disrespect to the countries concerned.//////Biodiversity is the foundation of life on Earth.

Your photograph showing a vivid & ugly scene, just near the recently built bridge connecting Banani with Gulshan via Banani Road No.11 is well known to the residents of Banani -- particularly those having residence along the side of the lake.//////The World No Tobacco Day was observed on 31 May 2010. A U.S. State Department statement issued on the occasion of the World No Tobacco Day 2010 expressed concern over the greater exposure to cigarette marketing among young women. The statement said A new report issued on May 27th by the U.S. Center for Diseases Control (CDC) examines gender differences in tobacco use and awareness of tobacco marketing. Particularly troubling is new global data from Bangladesh, Thailand, Uruguay, indicating cigarette marketing among young women (ages 15 to 24) than older women (over 24 years).//////We have observed in last 2/3 weeks that people have been killed being electrocuted coming into contact with 11,000 volts primary distribution line which passes near their balconies in open conductor. The last one being a disaster of such a magnitude that the accident from the 11 kv line caused a great fire, bursting two transformers and thereby killing some 113 people is just one stroke lasting a few seconds. //////Imagine, a boy equally talented, has two eyes, one nose like you but there is only one difference--he is poor and you are rich and only for that reason he cannot study. Around me, there are many students who cannot go to school. So, I took a step. I have distributed most of my Bengali books to the unfortunate boys. I discovered that they also like to read and have a very good ability to understand a subject. The young boys who are about only five or six years old were very happy to see the colourful story books that I gave them. They need money but more importantly they need proper education. So, I urge the whole world, please donate books (especially colourful ones) to 46 Flora Pass Road (beside A.K. Khan Group Head Office) Ambagan, Chittagong, so that I can distribute those to the unfortunate children. //////I think your newspaper was covering Musa's Everest success story a bit too much. In one word News Blitzkrieg was going on now in both DS and the Prothom Alo. There is no denying the marvellous achievement of Musa, Kudos to him. I express my heartfelt congratulations to him. Every Bangladeshi should be proud of this achievement. It is an occasion for celebration too.//////A front-page article on the subject was published in a local daily on June 1. The writer expressed some critical views regarding the government's approach to energy solutions, which was somewhat ad-hoc in my opinion. It is rather a theoretical advice, and to an extent not very rational or pragmatic in real life!//////The whole world is now shivering with World Cup football fever. People are supporting different teams. //////In Sylhet city, at daytime, hundreds of trucks move recklessly through the main roads. Certainly, it's very risky for city dwellers, especially the school going children and their guardians. At least after the unanticipated death of a BUET student, the authorities should be more careful in this area. For example, From Kumargoan bus-stand to Amberkhana point (only in four kilometres) there are many educational institutions like Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Ragib-Rabeya Medical College and Hospital, BDR school, Sylhet Ideal School and College, Muslim Model School, West Point School and College, Pathantula Primary and High school, Blue Bird school and so on.//////While the whole world is aware of the harmful impact of tobacco and tobacco related products, here in our country cultivation of tobacco is increasing day by day. Initially, cultivation of tobacco was confined to greater Rangpur. But, now it has spread in most areas of our country that is very detrimental for our food security, health, environment and socio-economic stability. For cultivation of tobacco very fertile land is needed and tobacco plants take away a huge quantity of nutrients from top soil. As a result, the land becomes unsuitable for cultivation of any agricultural crop for next two years. //////If we look at the buildings of Dhaka city, it becomes evident that these were not constructed according to the building code. I have hardly seen 8 feet (4 feet from either side) distance between two houses which is a rule set by RAJUK. Hundreds of thousands of buildings have been constructed illegally but RAJUK did not take any action against the people who made them and claim that they do not have sufficient manpower. To me this is a lame excuse because it takes 2 to 5 years to construct a multi-storied building. If RAJUK has 20 engineers they should have sufficient time to inspect them (at least the distance between two buildings). Experts repeatedly warned that if there is insufficient space between the buildings, fire may spread from one house to another. See what happened at "Nimtoli" of Dhaka city. A building collapsed at "Begunbari" as it was not constructed following the code. //////At present anti-Islamic forces of the world are trying to offend Muslim Ummah in multiple ways. They have already adopted Internet as a medium to pour scorn on Islam and propagate false, baseless information about the religion. Even they are opening many a website in the name of Islam and trying to create confusion about Islam among those Muslims who have little knowledge of it.//////Violence in Afghanistan has continued to increase in recent months, as has the use of improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a new report.//////A visiting Japanese envoy said yesterday his country-backed efforts by the United Nations to investigate alleged war crimes committed in Sri Lanka during the final months of its ethnic conflict.//////Pakistan should be wary of committing to an Iran-Pakistan natural gas pipeline because anticipated US sanctions on Iran could hit Pakistani companies, the US special representative to the region said yesterday. //////Indian customs officers yesterday seized the third shipment of tiger bones and other animal parts, worth 230,000 dollars and destined for use in traditional medicine in China.//////Israel will allow all "civilian" goods into the Gaza Strip while still preventing weapons from entering the Hamas-run territory, a senior Israeli official said yesterday.//////Kyrgyzstan's interim government has extended a state of emergency in the southern city of Osh and nearby towns and villages following more than a week of deadly clashes between ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz.//////At least 26 people have been killed in a twin suicide car bombing close to a state-owned bank in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, officials have said.//////The death toll from torrential downpours battering China for the past week has risen to 147, the government said yesterday, as more heavy rain was forecast.//////BP said Saturday that it has paid $104 million to residents along the Gulf Coast who have filed claims related to the Gulf oil spill.//////The leader of a Sunni militant group has been executed in Iran for his involvement in "terrorist" attacks in the Islamic state, state media report.//////Afghan president Hamid Karzai earns just $525 a month, has less than $20,000 in the bank and owns no land or property, according to a declaration of his assets yesterday by an anti-graft body.//////Five civilians, including three children, were killed and 24 other people were wounded in three separate attacks by Taliban militants in southern and eastern Afghanistan, officials said yesterday.//////A top al-Qaeda commander Abu Ahmad is said to be amongst 15 militants who were killed in Saturday's US drone attack in Mirali town in Pakistan's volatile tribal region of North Waziristan.//////Indian police yesterday arrested a Maoist rebel leader accused for derailing a passenger train and causing a crash that killed 151 people in the eastern state of West Bengal last month.//////A 15-member team of Orao Shishu Kishor Theatre, consisting of indigenous youngsters, from Dinajpur recently left for Germany to take part in the World Festival for Children's Theatre.
