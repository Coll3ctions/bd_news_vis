We are part of history today. The collective joy of 160 million people has finally been given a rightful place as the Tigers, the beloved Bangladesh cricket team, reached the finals of a major cricket tournament for the first time in its cricket history last night.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said Leader of the Opposition in Parliamrnt Khaleda Zia and deputies from the opposition joined parliament session only to save their membership and continue to get financial benefits as lawmakers.//////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia has urged the government to settle the caretaker government issue through an understanding for the sake of the nation and the existence of democracy in the country. //////Leaders of journalists, press workers and employees associations yesterday strongly protested and condemned the statement of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) that urged the government to reconsider the formation of the eighth wage board.//////Islamic microfinance has grown by more than sixteen times in Bangladesh in the last two years mainly due to an aggressive campaign by Islamic banks.//////Some people's representatives are killing democracy with their reckless behaviour and indecent speeches in parliament, said Communications Minister Obaidul Quader yesterday.//////Modernising its armed forces along the borders with China and Pakistan, India has emerged as the world's largest importer of arms, a global think tank report said.//////Police arrested two fugitive sand traders, who are believed to be the main suspects of the killing of six students in Aminbazar on the outskirts of Dhaka last July, from the capital's Mirpur area on Monday.//////A team of Tejgaon police beat up a hawker in the capital's Farmgate last night for refusing to pay them money, the victim and witnesses alleged.//////The prosecution at the International Crimes Tribunal charged Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed with the murders of Rumi, son of writer Jahanara Imam, and journalist Shahid Sirajuddin Hossain, during the Liberation War.//////Dr Kamal Hossain is the only surviving member of the Awami League team which engaged in the fateful negotiations with the Yahya Khan regime in March 1971. As he tells it, on this day in 1971, he was summoned by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the morning. When he turned up at Bangabandhu's residence, he found the Awami League chief busy in conversation with Tajuddin Ahmed. Bangabandhu informed Hossain that he had been giving serious thought to the question of a transfer of power and from a strategic point of view he had come to the conclusion that a formation of governments in Pakistan's five provinces would be in order. Judging by the way the situation was developing, Bangabandhu believed that it would not be wise for the Awami League to take power at the centre at that point.//////The ruling Awami League is under the impression that the landmark verdict in the country's maritime row with Myanmar will help deflect public criticism over the government actions ahead of the BNP's March 12 grand rally. //////The High Court yesterday asked for a progress report on the investigation into the case of journalist couple Sagar Sarowar and Meherun Runi killing. //////Dhaka and other large cities of the country face high risks from climate change, warned a leading climate analyst of the country yesterday.//////An alleged outlaw was killed in a "shootout" with Rapid Action Battalion in Bagmara upazila of the district early yesterday. //////Barapukuria Coal Mine Company Ltd (BCMCL) yesterday started production from the 'second slice' of the coal seam setting a milestone in coal mining history of the country.//////A Dhaka court yesterday summoned the chairman and managing director of Ekushey Television (ETV) hours after the NBR filed a case against them for not submitting their income tax returns within a stipulated time.//////In the penultimate paragraph of the report headlined Past of Ctg holds hope for economy, published in the March 18 issue of The Daily Star, it was mentioned that Md Mahbubul Hoque, assistant professor of History Department at Chittagong University, was a presenter of a programme. He was actually not present in that session of the programme. We regret the inadvertent error.//////Every time chiefs of India and Bangladesh border guards sit for talks in an ambience of professed good neighbourliness, somewhat mismatched by untoward border incidents, a fresh resolve to come to grips with border killings has been in evidence. Efforts for an improved border management are there, yet one wonders why the issue of border killings still keeps figuring between the two governments. Given the level of friendly political will manifest at the highest levels between the two countries and repeated assurances of non-lethal approach at the border by India this issue should have been squarely left behind by now. //////It is good news that Jose Graziano da Silva, Director General Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), has expressed satisfaction with the growth in our food production in a press conference on Monday in the capital. He, however, noted that a large number of people still suffer from malnutrition. He stressed the necessity of diversification of people's diet.//////To see glory from such close quarters is a pleasure unto itself. Some of us are lucky to hear Stuart Law break into a broad smile while walking into the dressing-room to join the team song Aamra Korbo Joy.//////Mushfiqur Rahim's men introduced a new Bangladesh to world cricket by reaching the final of the Asia Cup after beating Sri Lanka in the must-win game at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////Days like yesterday, when Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka to reach the Asia Cup final for the first time in history, transcends the limitations of sport. To understand the importance of such an achievement, one not only needs to appreciate the travails of the Bangladesh cricket fan, but also the peculiarities of life in Bangladesh.//////It was the forty-third over, Bangladesh were bowling and there were six fielders inside the thirty-yard circle. That image alone summed up Bangladesh's fielding effort against Sri Lanka in their Asia Cup match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday.//////If you have looked for retaliation over the past two weeks, the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur has to be your destination. Playing the role of the underdogs to the tee, the Tigers have set an instance of how to get out of a deep rut.//////While Mahmudullah Riyad and Nasir Hossain were steering Bangladesh from a slightly precarious position to the cusp of victory, the eyes of the whole nation were fixated on the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.//////Before the tournament began, Sri Lanka were considered one of the favourites, if not the favourite, to win the Asia Cup, having returned from a strong showing in the CB series in Australia. But it was a completely different picture as the league stage ended yesterday at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium with a game against Bangladesh. The Sri Lankans were winless after three matches, with Bangladesh's second consecutive win taking them through to the final against Pakistan. //////The relationship between the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) and the BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) is likely to suffer if Bangladesh do not go ahead with the proposed tour to Pakistan in April because of security concerns, ESPNcricinfo has learnt.//////Disgraced Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Aamer said Monday that former captain Salman Butt had betrayed their friendship by involving him in the spot-fixing scandal that has seen him banned from cricket and serve time in a British prison.//////The father of Pakistan's jailed former cricket captain Salman Butt on Tuesday accused disgraced bowler Mohammed Aamer of falsely pinning all the blame on his son in order to revive his career.//////A former International Cricket Council (ICC) chief on Tuesday accused India of fostering corruption in the sport, saying illegal betting in the country was the root cause of the problem.//////Argentina's Lionel Messi is the world's highest-paid footballer, followed by David Beckham of England and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, according to France Football magazine.//////Swiss superstar Roger Federer is setting his sights on more Grand Slams, after winning his third-straight tournament Sunday in Indian Wells.//////Pop sensation Katy Perry is to perform at the opening of the Indian Premier League (IPL), organisers said Tuesday, in a return to the country where she sealed her ill-fated marriage to comic Russell Brand.//////Sudhir Gautam is the most noticeable man at any cricket venue where India is playing.

We are monitoring the condition and performance of the banking sector with sharpened risk focus, taking up new initiatives to improve our oversight, both on-site and off-site. As part of that initiative, we have been holding town hall meetings of BB supervision staff -- nationally and regionally -- to know from them the ground realities and then providing necessary guidelines to strengthen the quality of oversight. The core objective is to integrate all aspects of supervision and realise a new architecture where oversight focuses, especially on institutional and systemic risks in lending and other business activities taken up by banks, and on how well corporate governance and internal control processes in banks deal with these risks. Recently I inaugurated a regional town hall meeting in Chittagong following the national one held in Dhaka, where I provided some necessary guidelines to the field supervisors. Let me share with the readers some of those ideas.//////The 20th Chittagong International Trade Fair came to a close yesterday, four days ahead of schedule, depriving exhibitors of good sales and customers of shopping. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said Bangladesh and China could work together to make the 'Kunming Initiative', including Bangladesh-China-Myanmar road link, a success.//////Private universities and their programmes must be accorded recognition by proper authorities to ensure quality higher education at the private institutions, speakers said at a roundtable yesterday.//////A Dhaka court yesterday summoned eight officials of broadband internet service company QUBEE, asking them to appear before it on April 5, hours after two criminal cases were filed against them for allegedly providing false information to the Joint Stock Company. //////Foreign Minister Dipu Moni, who reached Saudi Arabia yesterday morning for a five-day visit, will hold official talks with her counterpart Prince Saud Al Faisal today.//////Ruling Awami League-led 14-party alliance will hold a grand rally today in Barisal to protest against what the alliance leaders say are BNP-Jamaat's conspiracies against the war crimes trial and violence in the name of anti-government movements.//////Acclaiming the recent victory of Bangladesh over Myanmar on maritime disputes, eminent jurist Dr Kamal Hossain has recognised the contribution and success of the international law. //////The National Film Award-2010 was announced yesterday.//////Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami claimed that the party's acting secretary general ATM Azharul Islam was rearrested by the Detective Branch (DB) of police shortly after he walked out of Dhaka Central Jail on High Court's bail yesterday.//////At least 40 passengers suffered injuries after two buses on Dhaka-Maowa highway collided head-on in South Keraniganj, outskirts of the city, yesterday morning.//////The government must enforce stringent control over land use across the country immediately for future urbanisation and durable development, eminent planners and top officials said at a city workshop yesterday. //////The High Court yesterday asked the authorities concerned of the government to allow the candidates with disability having educational qualifications to participate in the 33rd Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) examination.//////The National Executive Committee (NEC) of BNP will hold its long overdue meeting on April 8 in the city to discuss the latest political situation and the party's organisational affairs. //////The International Crimes Tribunal yesterday deferred until March 27 its ruling on whether to frame charges against BNP lawmaker Salauddin Quader Chowdhury for war crimes. //////State Minister for Law Qamrul Islam yesterday said judges for the second International Crimes Tribunal would be appointed within two to three days.//////A delegation of the World Islamic Economic Forum Foundation (WIEF), led by former deputy prime minister of Malaysia Musa Hitam, met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her office yesterday.//////Family members, neighbours and fellow students of Sumi Chowdhury, at a human chain programme yesterday, demanded exemplary punishment to her killer.//////Rival faction leaders of Chittagong city unit Awami League (AL) yesterday called upon its leaders and activists to forget the past differences and work unitedly for making the party's March 28 grand rally a success.//////The government will confer the Bangladesh Freedom Honour award on some 129 foreign nationals and organisations for their outstanding contributions to the 1971 War of Liberation.//////Six people were killed and nine others injured in separate road accidents in Gopalganj, Chittagong, Pabna and Dinajpur yesterday.//////A resident student at Rajshahi University, who was expelled from Rokeya Hall on very short notice Monday, was not allowed to spend the very night at another hall of the university.//////Pro-BNP-Jamaat teachers of Chittagong University (CU) yesterday demanded judicial probe of the clash between Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and Islami Chhatra Shibir erupted on February 8 on the campus.//////Rotary International District 3281 has elected Safina Rahman as its district governor for 2014-15.

However, I came across different ideas, when I went through a professional traffic related journal in USA, a few years back! Their view was that a traffic roundabout was suitable for intermittent and low density traffic. Also the view around and across the traffic circle had to be totally clear for any vehicle driver approaching it from any direction and the traffic lights faultless! Needless to say, it was taken for granted that all the vehicle drivers were disciplined, trained, licensed and fully aware of traffic rules! The visibility circle all round the roundabout was considered critical and traffic stoppage line at any road leading to the roundabout had to be minimum twenty five yards from the nearest circumference of the roundabout.//////This is in reference to the letter of R.D Qureshi from Dhaka titled 'Price of gas and its wastage' published in The Daily Star on March 14, 2012. He rightly pointed out that increasing gas price will not stop the wastage. He mentioned that the Adviser to the Prime Minister, Dr. Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury said that domestic users waste gas as they get it cheap, so the price is going up to stop the wastage, and for a double burner cooker, one will have to pay Tk 1000, in place of Tk 450 per month.//////Every technology has its positive as well as negative impact on the users and the environment. Same is the case with Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). HEVs are fuel efficient and apparently environment friendly. HEVs cover twice as many kilometers per gallon as conventional fuel vehicles. They produce less gas emissions than conventional cars.//////Every time we hear the word 'traffic police' or 'sergeant', a very negative picture comes to our mind. The hard-working and skilled sergeants are only paid tk. 6,400 as basic pay which may increase with promotions. It is true that they are benefited with other allowances, but is 700 taka medical allowance and 55% house rent enough for them to survive?//////I am the proud son of a humble geologist. That geologist has written his name in the history of Bangladesh forever for his work on the maritime boundary conflict with Myanmar. Of course, there were a number of lawyers and ministers who fought for our rights, but the irrefutable data was provided by my father, Dr. Sirajur Rahman Khan, who worked and crafted the data that made our dispute simply indisputable. Although none of the newspapers carried all the names of the people who worked on this, I just want to thank everyone involved in this project, a first of its kind in the world. The significance of our victory may be lost for most, but I am proud of his achievement, because it has made our country stronger. An intellectual victory!//////It is just a matter of time Israel starts attacking Iran. At least that's what the indications show. Recently, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said he told Chinese leaders that Iran poses the gravest danger to world peace and stability. Israel is afraid to see Iran with nuclear weapons. Lieberman said that Israel hopes negotiations and sanctions can resolve concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions. He blatantly said that Iran is the biggest threat not only to Israel, but to the entire world, including all of the Middle East. We really do not know how, all of a sudden, Iran became a threat to the world peace. It is Israel who is making all sorts of troubles with its neighbouring countries. Whatever it is, we think Israel is hell-bent on striking Iran any day soon.//////We, the Bangladeshis in USA, are happy to know that Bangladesh embassy/consulate generals have started accepting applications for Machine Readable Passport (MRP), but I am very upset reading the procedures of how one can obtain the new passport. I believe most Bangladeshis in USA will agree with me on this issue. It is stated in the regulations that to obtain MRP one has to apply in person to embassy/consulate generals and also collect the MRP in person after 15 or 30 days. Therefore, one has to visit the embassy/consulate generals twice. Anyone living in USA knows how many embassy/consulate generals we have (1 embassy + 2 consulate generals). Now think of the hassle one has to take. //////Syria's armed opposition is carrying out serious human rights abuses, including the kidnapping, torture and execution of security force members and government supporters, a rights group said yesterday.//////A wave of attacks in more than a dozen Iraqi cities yesterday killed at least 49 people on the anniversary of the US-led invasion of the country, just days before Baghdad hosts a landmark Arab summit.//////West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in an interview to CNN IBN on Monday said that her party will quit the United Progressive Alliance, if humiliated.//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday said India is "inclined" to vote in favour of a resolution against Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council.//////Fidel Castro had prior knowledge that US President John F Kennedy was about to be killed, according to a new book by a retired CIA analyst.//////A Pakistan parliamentary committee yesterday demanded an unconditional apology from the United States for a November air attack on its border post that killed 24 soldiers.//////Trinamool Congress leader Mukul Roy, a trusted aide of Mamata Banerjee, was sworn in as India's new railway minister yesterday, replacing Dinesh Trivedi who was forced to resign.//////Myanmar will allow about two dozen poll observers from its Southeast Asian neighbours to visit the country for next month's closely watched by-elections, the Asean regional bloc said yesterday.//////The United Nations expressed "serious concern" after a second judge quit Cambodia's war crimes court over a rift about whether to pursue more former members of the Khmer Rouge regime.//////North Korea has invited UN inspectors to monitor a nuclear freeze deal with the United States, insisting the pact remains in force despite its shock announcement of a planned satellite launch.//////Fifteen people were killed yesterday in a train accident in north India, an official said, amid a political row over a plan to raise fares to pay for a safety upgrade on the network.//////A website launched by a university in Israel has catalogued more than 80,000 of Albert Einstein's collected papers and notes and personal correspondence, including love letters. //////Abdur Razzaque is regarded as one of the greatest sculptors of our country. He was the first artist to take up sculpture in the independent country. His 'Jagroto Chowrongi' is considered one of the best sculptures in Bangladesh, considering both form and theme, by art critics. Located in Jaidebpur, and constructed in 1973, it is the first post-Liberation War sculpture in Bangladesh. It depicts a freedom fighter with a grenade in his right and a rifle in his left hand. The sculpture is an 18 feet high concrete piece on a 24 feet pedestal.//////Padatik Natya Sangsad (TSC) will hold a six-day theatre festival starting from April 4. The festival, Syed Badruddin Hossain Smriti Natyotshab O Smarak Shammanana '12, will take place at the National Theatre Hall and Experimental Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.//////Rosy Siddiqui, known for her versatile prowess, maintains a strong presence in theatre, TV plays and films.

It was a scene that was as bizarre as it was incredible. Here was the deputy speaker of the Jatiyo Sangsad not only not doing anything to discipline those foul-mouthed lawmakers, but seeming to be indulging them as they went on with their nonsense. //////What is the difference between the Third Front, that jaded name for an amoebic coalition that is never quite sure which part has fallen off and what has joined up, and a Federal Front, currently being nourished at quickening pace from embryo to entity by Orissa's Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, with silent help from present and future allies? As//////The Honourable prime minister at long last has eaten humble pie. In a view-exchange meeting with the Khulna district unit of Awami League at the Gono Bhaban last week, she admitted that the strict government measures prior to BNP's March 12 rally caused public sufferings. But what she said thereafter was rather an act of self-defence than a confession. Without recognising the heavy-handed measures as undemocratic, she rather asserted that the measures, including those of equipping BCL activists and pro-AL labour wings with sharp weapons and ammunitions, were necessary to ensure public safety and welfare. //////The World Food Summit (1996) defined food security as: Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. This definition covers three major areassufficient, safe and nutritious food for all. But in recent times, emphasis is given mainly on having sufficient food for all and accordingly on producing more and more food. This overshadows two other major aspects of food security: safehow safe it isand nutritionhow nutritious it is. We have to keep in mind that market availability alone cannot guarantee food security//////When the ALwas voted to power by a sweeping majority in December 2008, there was a sense of shared hope and optimism shared by many across the country. There, right then, was the opportunity for a new style of politics to emerge that would be dictated by the interests and welfare of the people rather than the vested interests of a few self-serving demagogues as seen in the past. Election Day, itself, seemed like a day of celebration akin to any other festival in the country. That fantasy of a stronger, more politically stable Bangladesh has, since then, ruthlessly unravelled.//////
