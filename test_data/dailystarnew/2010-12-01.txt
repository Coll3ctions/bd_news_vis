Sporadic clashes between the law enforcers and pro-hartal activists in the city left over 150 people injured. //////One more hartal has come and gone, with the usual disruption of life and damage to property which such political moves entail. Stray incidents of violence have occurred at different places of the country, with vehicles and the like coming under attack. Now that the hartal is over, it is our sincere expectation that it will not be repeated and that the political opposition will find alternative means of expressing its point of view on the issues. We have consistently made our position clear, which is that we have never had any reason to think that hartals or general strikes accelerate in any way our march to stable democracy or a vibrant economy. We believe that the end of autocratic rule in 1990 and the elections of early 1991 should have been an opportunity for our political classes to guide the nation toward a new, substantive democratic opening through eschewing hartals and promoting a spirit of energetic political engagement and cooperation in parliament as well as outside it. Unfortunately, at a time when we as a nation stand ready to take the necessary steps to catch up with the rest of the world in terms of political and economic advancement, we remain bogged down by issues that increasingly look more personal to politicians than fundamental to the national interest.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Japan visit has produced some tangible results.

But the sons of our soil, without even hesitating a little about their lives, protested that move. 'Bangla is my mother tongue' was the slogan of our people. When our protest got stronger, the Pakistanis open fired and killed many of our Language Movement protesters.

I feel that it will only remains more as an opinion than any thing else! //////Is there an obvious answer to why people smoke? Some say it relieves us from tension, others say, it is a habit and may be the so-called 'coolness,' for the youngsters. Well, I would definitely not re-mention the drawbacks that are being advertised all the time in symposiums or radios, because those who smoke don't give a damn about it; and this is why in economics when it comes to the example of a product that is inelastic, the example is always cigarette.

The stamp concept is excellent. I know, because I am a father of three children who are avid stamp collectors.//////At any moment, an earthquake can destroy Dhaka city, in fact, the whole country. Experts say all the non-engineered structures in Dhaka will collapse even if a moderate earthquake hits the country.//////The Daily Star has carried an editorial under the caption "Call off hartal, shun the practice for good" on 24th November 2010.

And can you think back on an era where it was in the nature of politicians to dwell exclusively and purposefully on matters relating to the constitution, to the future of their nations, indeed to an adherence to principles they thought ought to define their own places in history? In Bangladesh -- and that means we are speaking of the last forty years -- do you recall the last time you came across a leader who could reach out to an entire nation and shape dreams for them?//////On November 23, the North Korean military fired artillery shells on and in waters surrounding Yeonpyeong Island, only 8 miles from the North Korean coast.

As many of our expatriate well-wishers, he could not help following the home country's news flashes through online news sites.

It is time for us to ponder over our present situation and the link between Aids and development because it has the potential to debilitate and even thwart the process of development itself.
