However, their tactics did not backfire due partly to the more experienced batting line-up of the English and the partly to the guile of Graeme Swann who took 10-for to take England to a 181-run victory.//////Name: Mohammad Jahirul Islam//////Arsenal face Barcelona in the Champions League quarterfinals in a repeat of the 2006 final won by the Spanish giants.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has terminated Rokibul Hasan's players contract with the national team and banned the batsman for three months.//////Indian IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury maintained his solitary lead in the Six Seasons Grandmasters Chess Tournament at the close of the fifth round at the Tulip Hall of Uttara Club yesterday. //////Scholastica School, BIS, Green Herald and Dhanmondi Tutorial won their respective opening matches of the Sunny Dale 7th Boys' Mini Handball Tournament at the newly-build Handball Stadium yesterday.//////Pakistan gave permission Friday for banned former captain Shoaib Malik and all-rounder Rana Navedul Hasan to play in the Port City League (PCL) the Bangladeshi domestic Twenty20 league that will take place in Sharjah later this month.//////Pakistan excluded banned ex-captains Younus Khan and Mohammad Yousuf from a list of central contracts announced Friday, raising further doubts over their international careers.//////Michael Carrick believes Manchester United can open the door to an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title by slaying their recent Liverpool jinx this weekend.//////Unfashionable Fulham stunned mighty Juventus to reach the Europa League quarterfinals on Thursday where they were joined by seasoned campaigners Liverpool.//////Barcelona's fight for the title with Real Madrid depends more than ever on the form of superstar Lionel Messi who has scored eight of their last ten goals.//////AC Milan could end a tumultuous week which saw two of their star turns end up under the surgeon's knife by sitting atop Serie A for the first time this season.//////Bayern Munich begin their 'three weeks of truth' on Saturday against Eintracht Frankfurt with the Bundesliga leaders still bidding for three trophies.//////Three-time winners Liverpool face a tricky Europa League quarterfinal against Benfica after the draw made here on Friday.//////Fabio Capello has confirmed that he has asked David Beckham to join the England squad at the World Cup, despite the midfielder being ruled out of the tournament with an achilles injury.//////Jermain Defoe will be sidelined for up to a month after tearing one of his hamstrings in a blow to Tottenham's hopes of finishing fourth in the Premier League and securing a place in next season's Champions League.//////Japan midfielder Keisuke Honda, who helped steer CSKA Moscow into the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time, said Thursday he had always dreamed of scoring in Europe's elite competition.//////The world economic downturn has forced World Cup organisers to review initial projected ticket sales, but host South Africa on Friday was confident of full stadiums.//////Despite a fabulous 60 from Irfan Pathan, Kings XI Punjab fell to a 6 run defeat against Deccan Chargers in their IPL clash at Cuttack yesterday.//////Michael Clarke has had to display a lot of patience over the past fortnight and he applied an unflappable, measured approach as his century steered Australia into a strong position.

It is not unusual to see highly motivated groups with radical views against the establishment using violence as a means to make their point.//////THE European Commission is in the midst of an innovative exercise. This was reflected a few days ago in its proposals published in the format entitled Communication on Europe 2020. This contained certain concrete proposals, which could be described as being a successor format to the Lisbon Strategy. The impact of the public finance crisis coupled with demographic trends has made this reform a critical success factor for Europe's economic and social model and for long term sustainability. It is expected that these will be discussed at the forthcoming Spring Council.//////WHILE the nation celebrated the 100th International Women's Day, the stark reality is that the status of women has not substantially changed for the better even after an appraisal of the fact that empowering women, meaning redistributing power from men to women, can ensure more balanced development. Gender inequalities in access to resources and opportunities negate the concept of human development and the spirit of democracy. Empowerment that would have given the vast majority of women the choice and self- development is missing.//////JIHAD has different meanings. Islamist terrorists have one. Leaders of other backward classes (OBC) in India have another. The latter have used the word jihad to raise the standard of revolt against the government headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. His Congress party had the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, endorse the controversial Women's Reservation Bill.//////IMPROVING the quality of primary education largely depends on improving the teaching and learning in the classroom. And to facilitate improved teaching-learning in the classroom, a crucial factor is to ensure that effective teachers are engaged in teaching. But it is hard to come by such teachers in our socio-economic context. In the circumstances, the single most important factor is to establish a teacher development system to properly train the teachers, upgrade their knowledge and teaching skills and bring about an attitude change in them, so that they can improve their classroom teaching permanently. //////THE discovery and control of various forms of energy is one of the greatest achievements of man as energy is a strategic input necessary for socio-economic development. We want energy supply at the flick of a switch to turn on a light, fan or any utility device. In fact our way of life now depends upon instant access to energy. The demand for energy is increasing day by day.//////Despite claims of late that polar ice and mountain glaciers would not melt at the dreaded rate apprehended, Bangladesh remains one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts as before. Its low lying coastal belt just gets inundated whenever there is even a mild cyclone surge from the Bay. Only half of the calculated rise in the sea level due to envisaged lesser melting of polar ice would render quite a sizable of its population climate refugee.//////While complaining about the gas and power crisis, most seem to overlook the diminishing supply of water against the increasing population in both urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. //////Global warming has significant impact on conditions affecting plans, including temperature, carbon dioxide, precipitation and the interaction of these elements. Climate change induced by increasing emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is likely to affect crops differently from region to region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that due to decreased water availability because of global worming, the poorest countries will be hardest hit with reduction in crop yields in most tropical and sub-tropical regions. //////The question What is love? still intrigues those who have experienced love and those who are yet to experience it. Poets, novelists, dramatists, philosophers, psychologists and educators have tried to discover the meaning of love. It seems no word is more misused or overused than love and leadership. //////I breathed my last yesterday morning. As I now lie in the casket waiting to be lowered into my final resting place, I can hear my wife, or should I say my widow, whispering to my brother Sam about something, probably a last minute detail or to check on some other arrangement before the four gravediggers are called in to crank the pulley to lower the coffin into the crypt. //////Incense scented breeze, platters of cheese and thou (the muse going into overdrive) - this may not be vintage Khayyam but for some of us this is the stuff that dreams are made of. //////In some areas of the world, one in four people with tuberculosis (TB) becomes ill with a form of the disease that can no longer be treated with standard drugs regimens, a World Health Organisation (WHO) report says.//////Like many countries in the world, Bangladesh is facing an acute crisis of skilled nurses. Although nurses are the essential part of healthcare system, there are very little initiatives to promote this noble profession. Thousands of patients are not getting proper medical care due to deficiency of skilled nurse. With proper attention and suitable programme, we can help revive the profession.//////The death rate for oral cancer is higher than that of cancers which we hear about routinely such as cervical cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, laryngeal cancer, cancer of the testes, and endocrine system cancers such as thyroid, or skin cancer. It is not because of the fact that it is hard to discover or diagnose, but due to the cancer being routinely discovered late in its development.//////One in eight people do not have access to clean water. Two million people, most of them children, die every year from water-borne diseases like diarrhoea and millions become seriously ill. Diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, polio, trachoma and tapeworms spread through water  many of which can be fatal to people in the developing world like Bangladesh. Other water-associated diseases, such as malaria and filariasis, affect vast populations worldwide.//////Long-acting insulin works better than other types of injections for people who need more than pills for their type 2 diabetes, researchers reported.//////LASIK eye surgery reduces a person's need to wear glasses or contact lenses. But an improvement in vision often is not quick. You can expect the followings after the procedure://////A fungal infection of the fingernails or toenails can make them hard, brittle and discolored.//////BY Iraqi standard, the second general election since the US intervention held on March 8th ended peacefully. Voter turnout, though lower at 62% than 76% in the previous one, was significant. However, with the US committed to withdraw its combat troops of 50,000 by August and the rest by end of next year, the election was held to take Iraq into comfort zone politically and from security point of view, given the fact that in recent times Iraq has made significant strides on both counts. The US has not so far seen any negative elements in the elections and has reiterated its commitment to withdraw. However, analysts are expressing apprehensions.//////EARLY this month the Vienna chapter of the Non-Aligned Movement, in a veiled criticism of the Western powers and Israel, along with a reaffirmation from the new Director General of IAEA, stated that it is the basic and inalienable right of all states to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The NAM also reiterated their support for nuclear free zone in the Middle East; declared any attack or threat of attack against peaceful nuclear activities, operational or under construction as a serious danger to human beings and environment and a violation of international law; expressed concern and sought clarification from the DG of IAEA of the possible implication of the departure from standard verification language in the summary of the report of the DG; and more or less expressed happiness over access given by Iran for inspection of its nuclear facilities. It concluded that diplomacy and dialogue are the only way for long tern solution of Iran nuclear issue.//////India's home-grown interceptor defence shield developed to detect and destroy incoming ballistic missiles failed during a test on Monday, military officials said.//////President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, believe Washington and Moscow are close to reaching agreement on a new nuclear disarmament treaty, the Kremlin said March 13.//////William B. Milam served as America's top diplomat in Bangladesh and Pakistan at points of critical and crucial significance for the two countries. You can call that a most opportune happening or a mere coincidence. But the fact that the United States government thought it proper to have Milam serve in countries which once were linked through politics, indeed were a single state, is a rarity. And rare too is something else: Milam witnessed the fall of General Ershad in late 1990 and the beginning of a move back toward democracy; and then, in October 1999, as US ambassador to Islamabad and away in California, he heard about the coup that brought General Pervez Musharraf to power in Pakistan. And over the years since then, Milam has clearly made it his preoccupation to study politics in the two countries, which again would be regarded as analyses of the similarities that have characterized their political landscapes. Milam's subtitle, Flirting With Failure in South Asia, is a pointer to the questions he has before him.//////The wound in the heart of the Middle East has been bleeding ever since the Jewish state came into existence. Thousands of Palestinians have been killed, hundreds have been evicted from their homes and abodes have been pulled down to make space for the growing number of Jews migrating from across the world. This never-ending process has the direct support of the United States and many European allies. Despite efforts at eye-washing on the part of the United States to establish peace, nothing concrete has happened. Such efforts have only acted as an intoxicant to keep many a Middle Eastern country in a state of stupor. //////Inspired by his boyhood in rural Arkansas, John Grisham has come up with this unique novel. Set in the early summer and late fall of 1952, it is a heart rending account of a little boy's journey from innocence to experience. It is the writer's first major work outside the legal thriller genre in which he has established himself. Narrated through the eyes of the seven year-old Luke Chandelier, the story comes with pictorial descriptions of the cotton harvesting season. Arkansas, called the Natural State, is depicted with picture perfect sceneries throughout the moving tale.//////
