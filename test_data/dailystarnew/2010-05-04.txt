We have elegantly crafted mission statements. We have well- defined goals and objectives.

And the cave paintings of such celestial beings as ancient as 10,000 BC in the cavern of Val Camonica, Italy to the latest Hollywood blockbuster Avatar only signify man's fascination with things extra-terrestrial in origin. Even though the media have projected aliens as both good guys (Spielberg's E.T) and bad guys (Ridley Scott's Aliens), the global scientific communities have been relentless in their search for such beings within and beyond the solar system. Numerous satellites and radio-telescopes are scanning the skies as well as radio waves are being sent with the hope that someday our lonely Earth will find a friendly neighbour somewhere in this cosmos.

According to the eminent astrophysicist, Stephen Hawking, the chances are aliens are out there, but any interactions with their kind with humans might bring disastrous consequences for this planet and its inhabitants! In a new T.V documentary series titled Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking, the 68-year old former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics gently warned us with these words: If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans. //////What makes an oil spill really bad?

The image captures the violent activity atop a pillar of gas and dust that stands three light-years tall.
