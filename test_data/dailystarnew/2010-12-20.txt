We expect the leader of the opposition to speak for Bangladesh, especially in terms of its foreign relations, when she meets the Chinese leadership. We are, however, quite intrigued that Begum Zia, just before her departure for China, made a demand for the Awami League government to quit office over what she called its manifest failure to govern. She, like everyone else, is entitled to her opinion on how she perceives the performance of the government at this point. But what we cannot quite agree with is Begum Zia's berating the government on an occasion which should have been focused on what she expects out of her visit. What kind of signal is she giving out on the kind of politics she and her party have been pursuing since the general elections of December 2008?//////Another tragedy has struck us. This time a motorboat carrying almost 100 people capsized after being hit by an empty cargo boat in the River Dhanu in Sunamganj. 35 bodies have been recovered, as of last report; most of the victims are women and children.

It is about a great deal more than punishing the deed. Some girls seem to be being indoctrinated in the belief that, if they were ever raped, they might as well be dead. Why else does the victim of threatened rape choose death, again and again? She obviously believes, rightly or wrongly, that, if she were raped, her family would be so shamed, even victimised, that she would be a terrible burden to them. //////I sadly noticed that a section of media people, intellectuals and politicians are making irresponsible comments on the activities of the Grameen Bank founder Dr. Muhammad Yunus. It is very easy to comment and give lecture on poverty alleviation sitting in an air-conditioned room than working with the people in the field. //////Much has been talked about and thought of siphoning off the fund of the Norwegian donor agency Norad, granted for the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Inevitably, Dr. Yunus has been targeted to be criticized from every direction being the Chairman of Grameen Bank, for 'embezzling' the fund. Whatever, the Norwegian government has finally made it clear that there has been no anomaly of fund and that the Norwegian govt. is satisfied as there is no corruption or misuse of money, nor even is it utilised on unintended purpose.//////I am sorry to say I find most of the people of the country insolent and arrogant. Prophet SM of Allah SWT said, "A smile to your brother is a charity." I wonder how many people in this country talk to a person with a smile. //////Usually in the national parliament we find the national leaders busy finding faults of others, rather than cooperating with each other with the intention of building a successful nation. We must stop this blame game, because blaming others is nothing more than excusing ourselves. //////Three cheers to Professor Faruq Aziz of Chittagong for putting into words what most people are thinking and asking, Has Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina lost touch with the common people? //////Deck the halls with boughs of holly whenever I hear this I think of Christmas. Red and green presents flash in my mind. I imagine Santa going over the moon with Rudolf guiding him. I think about the big Christmas tree standing proudly by the fireplace, with presents wrapped in shiny wrapping paper, cookies and milk beside the fireplace, waiting to be eaten by Santa. I think of baby Jesus lying in the manger glowing, the three wise men gathered around him, gazing with amazement. //////We saw more garment workers die the most horrendous death.

The exhibition has been organised by Hashem Khan-Parveen Trust, and will continue till January 2. //////Winter festivals always seem to evoke our childhood memories. Pitha over the fire, heavy mist lifting off the tree tops, the list of mental images are endless. So when we were invited to the commemoration of RKB Mallick School at our ancestral home, we started packing almost immediately. It was an opportunity to pay homage to the school that had transformed the village from a farmland to a modern hub. Taking part in the age-old festivities rural Bangladesh is famous for was a cherry on top.////// When we take the stage, performing to hundreds or thousands of music enthusiasts, we feel that the audience -- representing all generations -- see and hear our father's reflection in us.//////This month's instalment of 'Praner Khela', a musical soiree organised by Bengal Foundation, was held at Bengal Centre in the capital on December 18, according to a press release.//////The 5th solo photography exhibition of Bangladeshi photographer S.A.

In consequence, on Saturday, December 18, workers of the factory were again in panic. Why so? Because some plaster and cement came off the ceiling of eighth floor and fell with a thud on the floor. A rumour that the roof of the building was collapsing also went the rounds pushing the panic button. As expected, there was a stampede and in consequence 25 workers were injured. //////Do we remember what we have heard or what we wanted to hear? Famous last words are tricky. Even strangers can get infected with nerves at the bedside of a dying man, not least because evidence of mortality induces depressing thoughts of your own inevitable departure. Relatives and friends are too affected by sentiment. Assuming that the deathbed utterance, if there is one, is more likely to be a mumble rather than oratory, the opportunity for tweaking is high, either in the interest of clarity or to improve the quality. Did Groucho Marx really say, "Die, my dear? Why, that's the last thing I'll do!?" Or Conrad Hilton, founder of the eponymous hotel chain, depart on the less-than-grand note of "Leave the shower curtain on the inside of the tub." The great Italian traveller sounds far more credible: "I have not told half of what I saw." As does the brilliant Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, "I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record." Such pitch perfect sentences seem edited by a benefactor for an anthology, which is where I have picked them from.//////Bangladesh is presently producing 4,000 MW of electricity during peak hours against the demand of 5,500 MW.
