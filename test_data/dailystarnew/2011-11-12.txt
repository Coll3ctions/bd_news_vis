The sad reality is that many such murders of persons having political identity have occurred in the last decade and even before that. Temporarily, there were some worries for such unsettling crimes but with the passage of time all concerned chose to forget the dark episode without displaying the resolve to effectively combat the menace.//////Massacres recede into history. But their memory haunts us. A strain of music, candlelight in the wilderness or a sad face re-enacts the tragedies once again. If concrete evidence emerges, it leaves us forlorn and helpless.//////Wide and long roads herald economic growth. Former US President John F. Kennedy had said: "It is not wealth that built our roads but the roads that built the wealth." Judging from the dilapidated state of the roads as well as lanes and by lanes in Dhaka city, people are constrained to believe that Bangladeshi leaders thought the other way round.//////The Cold War was widely seen as a bipolar world order dominated by the era's two rival superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. While the two of them did not (indeed, could not) control the rest of the world, there was a Soviet-American dimension to much of the Cold War era's international relations, especially where there was conflict. However, with the collapse of communism as well as of the Soviet Union itself in 1989-91, Moscow was no longer able to play the role of superpower. Since then, the United States has been seen by many, including many in Russia, as the sole remaining superpower, or even a hyperpower, attempting to unilaterally impose a unipolar world order. And this, in turn, was seen by many, especially in Russia, as unfair, undesirable, and to be resisted.//////For many in the city of Dhaka, celebration of Eid ul Azha this year was seriously marred by two incidents. One was the unprecedented rush and delay in the movement of traffic from Dhaka to other parts of the country. There was not only acute crisis of transport facilities but also serious disruption of time schedules of bus, train and motor launches.//////Human ecology inquires into the pattern and process of interaction of human with environment. Human values, health, life-style, consumption, wastage, etc. are influenced by physical and biotic environments. Physical environment includes land, air, water, natural resources, construction and infrastructures. On the other hand, living things like plants, seaweeds, animals and organisms constitute biotic environment. The changes in physical environment has been changing climate and hydrology, which has influences on biotic components and subsequently on food supply and living condition of human being.//////Climate change, the most talked about issue, is now posing a threat to livelihood, economy and social condition of Bangladesh. Climate change impact is working as a catalyst for natural disasters such as flood, river erosion, cyclone etc. It is believed that agriculture sector which employs the most number of people will be the hardest hit by climate change and natural disasters induced by it. As this sector employs a great number of women and in most cases is the only source of income for rural women, climate change will exert a very negative impact on gender dimension. //////Even though he has been longing to meet Rehana, Shojib doesn't seem to have been overpowered by a surge of sudden emotion when he finds his love within his reach; rather he looks sedated like a calm sea as if all is quiet on the battlefield. Staying overnight at Nasim's place, he arrives at the Sadarghat terminal right on time to receive Rehana. With a see-through blue chiffon sari tucked in the petticoat under the navel, she is looking seductively attractive. When their rickshaw gets stuck in a notorious traffic jam at Mitford, Rehana lets her head lean against his broad shoulder, insinuating that she is lovestruck. Being indifferent to the surroundings, she gets closer to him and softly says: //////I had to describe the cottage in the woods. I was asked to explain its existence, history and related issues in front of everyone. //////Tonight the stars descended on my bed//////Brightening it up//////Ushering in the moon to bathe me in its//////Shine//////Adorning me to meet you //////In sweet slumber//////Pneumonia takes more of our childrens lives than any other disease. Each year, it is responsible for the deaths of nearly 26,000 Bangladeshi children under age five.//////We generally accept that physical frailty is inevitable as we grow older. A large number of studies in the past few years also showed that after 40 years, people typically lose their muscle mass with age. But a growing body of newer science suggests that such decline may not be inexorable. Exercise, the thinking goes, and you might be able to rewrite the future for your muscles.//////Getting plenty of sleep is important during pregnancy, but those inevitable physical changes while you are pregnant can make sleep uncomfortable. Following suggestions may help pregnant women get a better night's sleep.//////Since HIV was discovered 30 years ago, 30 million people have died from the disease, and it continues to spread at the rate of 7,000 people per day globally, according to the UN.

The objective was to exchange their views and ideas on the future dynamics of India-Bangladesh relationship. The programme was jointly organised by the Jamia Millia Islamia of New Delhi, Dhaka University and Sikkim University.//////America's debacle in Paris the other day has eclipsed all its 'achievements' during the past few months such as the killing of key terrorists and the ouster of the Gaddafi regime. The conferment of full UNESCO membership on Palestine has come as a diplomatic knuckle sandwich for the US-led western bloc on an aggressive campaign to shore up its international image and reassert its global dominance.//////One of the more enduring legacies of British colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent has been the civil service structure it forged into shape, the better to ensure its hold on the psyche of the country. It has not mattered much that the withdrawal of the foreign power in 1947 through the partition of India left two countries created out of the original one, and that too through much communal bloodletting. Power may have passed into local hands and politics may have gone into a process of reshaping the land. And yet such new configurations of authority have hardly affected the administrative structure the British thought, and rightly too, would help bring about governmental discipline in the country. In independent India, the Indian Civil Service, the fabled ICS, was quickly replaced by the Indian Administrative Service, or IAS, with the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) not far behind. In the new state of Pakistan, the pre-1947 ICS was quickly supplanted by the Central Service of Pakistan or CSP. It is equally interesting that in both countries, the federating units developed their own civil service structure which of course was, in the ultimate analysis, subservient to the central administrative organ. For Bangladesh, the pre-1971 CSP administrative structure was succeeded by the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) soon after the country's military triumph over Pakistan in December 1971.//////This is a difficult book to review, but, strangely enough, also a relatively easy one. ////// is a 600-plus-page tome whose dizzying array of topics relating to the indigenous people makes it a taxing task to take stock of within a limited space. However, the editor, Philip Gain, has simplified the task by presenting a thoughtful and comprehensive introduction (An Introduction to the Adivasis of Bangladesh) that encapsulates in twenty four pages the diverse contents of the rest of the book. The entire book and the introduction are monumental efforts in presenting the sometimes misunderstood, often partially understood, at times totally ignorant of, and ignored, life and society of the diverse indigenous people inhabiting Bangladesh. The entrancing cover photograph of a Garo woman who was reported to be over a hundred years old when photographed in 2006, gives one a partial insight into the editor's passion. He is an avid and accomplished photographer and a vigorous advocate of upholding and advancing indigenous rights as a distinctly minority community with its own cultural and societal norms, traditions, and practices. Gain is Director, Society for Environment and Human Development (SEHD), an NGO, researcher, freelance journalist, and adjunct faculty teaching environment communication in the Department of Media and Communication, Independent University, Bangladesh.//////There have been many approaches towards poverty alleviation for many years. Poverty was attributed the degree of scourge following population, the number one problem of the nation. One of the notable approaches or rather the most notable approach has been the concept of micro credit. It gained popularity and credit that has brought it and its pioneer the highest honourthe Nobel Prize. By now there have been a number of institutions and NGOs operating microcredit services across the country and beyond. But the spread of the problem is so vast and deep that despite all this only a partial result is apparent. So there is scope, rather need for further effective approaches and innovation of more potential ways towards an alleviation of poverty. //////
