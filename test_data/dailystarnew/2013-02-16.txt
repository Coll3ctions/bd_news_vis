I would know a few hours later why Forbes magazine had ranked the Inca Trail as one of the ten toughest races (among all endurance sports) in the world in 2005. The morning sun rose and painted the trail yellow with strokes of low-angled light rays finding their ways through small trees and shrubs. Little did I know at that time that on that day the morning would not show the day. I was surprised to see how clean and quiet the trail was throughout. The breath-taking beauty and the variety of vegetation in the first half of the trail made me stop to take photos of the flowers, the river, the locals, and the animalsalone or with someone riding on them. //////The steering guides well//////Those ripples bordered with//////Endless greenery//////Thick, gloomy, sloping skyward//////Sudden horns and window above//////Beckoning the clouds//////Seagulls breaking the solitude//////A face illusive across the sills//////or not at all or glimpses of Rose//////No no Ruth gentle ripples//////Flowing eternally across the borders.//////Shoulder Impingement Syndrome (SIS) is a common cause of shoulder pain, often seen in aging adults.

One of the earliest references to such renewed outlook can be traced in the speech delivered by Edward R. Stettinius, US Secretary of States, in the inaugural meeting of the UN on June24, 1945. He said, "The battle of peace has to be fought on two fronts. The first is the security front where victory spells freedom from fear. The second is the economic and social front where victory means freedom from want. Only victory on both fronts can assure the world of an enduring peace." //////On Feb. 1, a Turkish national named Ecevit Sanli walked up to the side entrance of the U.S. Embassy in Ankara like many others had done that day. Dressed inconspicuously, he waved a manila envelope at the man inside the guard booth as he approached the entrance. The security guard had no reason to distrust the man approaching the checkpoint; the entrance is used to screen packages, and perhaps the guard assumed Sanli was dropping off a document or was a visa applicant at the wrong entrance. What the guard did not know, perhaps, is that Sanli was a person of interest to the Turkish police, who suspected that he was plotting an attack.//////--Thomas Carlyle//////
