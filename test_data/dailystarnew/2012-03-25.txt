I was privileged and honoured to have witnessed all of you making history in the last three matches (BAN vs IND, BAN vs SL, and of course BAN vs PAK). Like millions of Bangladeshis, I cheered during the boundaries, jeered when the extras were given, cried when those 2 runs became too far, and stood up clapping with great pride at my national team that has truly come of age. What made us even more emotional during this tournament was to see all of you play like a real team. There was respect and unity for each other which, to be honest, we had not seen before. You played strength by strength and every player contributed to the team's achievements. For a nation that is divided on so many grounds, it was the Tigers and their united front that brought 160 million people together under the same banner. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for playing like the Tigers you really are!//////This month my weekly column "Shifting Images" celebrates its first anniversary. The column started fortuitously when the Editor and Publisher of this paper asked if I could write about unfolding events pertaining to social issues from the perspective of a Bangladeshi immigrant living in the USA. For a while I pondered over the offer given the enormity of the challenge. After all, it is quite intimidating to face a readership that is perceptive, erudite and discerning. But, I decided to take the plunge into the world of writing since it offered enormous opportunities for finding a voice --even if a feeble one -- to express an opinion on contemporary social concerns and controversies.//////
