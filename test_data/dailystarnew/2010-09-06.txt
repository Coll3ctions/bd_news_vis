for taking the steps to make a digital Bangladesh. To implement your dream for digital Bangladesh at first you should recruit skilled teachers at school and college level for computer learning . At college level every teacher is skilled in their respective subject without computer.

They haven't won a rubber since 2006. After the retirement of skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq who was apparently the last of the Mohicans the team became imbalanced.

The ways of this world are not the Lord ways, but He will use them to institute law and order and bring an end to oppression. //////Global warming is one the biggest problems the world is facing these days.

Similarly, when cheating tendency is deep-rooted in a society -- all forms of evil express on a constant basis. (As feared by many) after the long history of association with Match-fixing, Doping, Murder probe (2007 World Cup), Injury feigning, Ball-biting, Ball altering, Betting, Pitch damaging, Religious exhibition during games, Organised crimes, Corruption and Cover-ups -- now a new 'Spot-fixing' cheating allegations are investigated by British police against visiting Pakistan Test Cricket team in England. Secretly filmed footage exposed one British-Pakistani bookmaker Majeed - who has 'managed' Pakistani cricket players over two years - accepting 150,000 (Bangladeshi Taka 16 crore) from a undercover journalist for guaranteeing 'no balls'. The allegations are related to 'no balls' delivered by Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. ICC (International Cricket Council) and Scotland Yard are now investing the matter. No players or team officials have been arrested yet.//////Only the wisest and stupidest of men on earth never change.-Confucius. And as Bangladesh is neither the wisest nor does it possess the desire to prove itself the stupidest it has ultimately taken the initiative to bring in some change and do some good to the country at last. And that very initiative is the introduction of 'e-governance' concept.//////Recently, Bangladesh ranked 88th amongst 100 best countries of the world. Is it a joke or fun? I cannot guess. If we look above our head, across the Dhaka city roads, we shall see a cables jungle, electric 440/1100 KV lines above the roads. We came to know through DS that about 600 cable TV operators and 92 ISPs are using heavy weight of black wires illegally in the poles.

They were charged for the killing of four people by firing on the procession of Bangladesh Nationalist Party on February 13, 2001.//////The fact that only two out of some 702 chemical shops and stores in the old parts of Dhaka have valid fire safety licences represent the decades long mismanagement of the city by the previous governments. The present government has got to free the city from all kinds of congestions. To do this some ministries must be relocated outside Dhaka. The lakes and the rivers outside Dhaka must be freed from unauthorized occupation. All the residential areas should be drastically freed from commercial activities to avoid fire hazards. To evade the cataclysmic destruction of city in case of earthquake, all badly-constructed buildings should be demolished immediately. //////We all should come to know that three of our national leaders Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman & Alhaj Hussain Muhammad Ershad while in power dealt more with the citizens and could discharge their duties on practical grounds based on proper verifications and thus the overall citizens could see the progress in the infrastructural works.//////All laws are framed in parliament. Laws are passed in parliament by voice vote. Simply by hearing the sound coming from the floor the Ho'nable Speaker declares three times that ha/na joijukta hoyachey. That means sound is the ultimate medium or indicator for passing a law in parliament. In a turbulent or a noisy situation in parliament, a common scene, it is difficult to hear the sound correctly creating confusion in making decisions. In this day of modern digital world, an old system based on hearing sound for taking a vital decision for passing law is not tenable. //////Very recently a law has been passed prohibiting the compulsory use of veil in public places, I am concerned when a ban is imposed on the use of veil in this country whose majority of the population are Muslims, while the Honorable Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition are both women and are Muslims too. //////Last Friday a group of policemen came to my residence at Gopibagh, Dhaka for arresting me. They said that a cheating case was filed against me with Rajbari Magistrate Court (though my home district is at Chandpur) and accordingly the Court issued warrant against me. I was not at my house at that moment of police raid. My wife who is a gynaecologist was surprised and panicked to see the aggressive attitude of the policemen. However, as per the information of the police officer I have collected a copy of complaint petition from Rajbari. Surprisingly, I do not know the complainant and other accused of that case. Policemen again came to my residence to arrest me but I was at my office at that time. Then I have talked to a lawyer of Rajbari regarding bail. He says, Rajbari Court may not grant you bail well you should go to the High Court. But the regular work of the High Court is closed now due to one-month-long vacation and these sorts of anticipatory bail-cases do not get priority in the Vacation-Chamber-Judge. As a result, I am moving under an arrest warrant and it disturbs my normal life in the office and in the house as well. Who can help me and where should I go? //////How long our politicians will continue playing the game of making laws? It is now an established practice that, one party while in power makes law according to their will and later on when their opposition comes to power reverses it. Is it the duty of politicians? Clearly, it is a sign of divide, which is very much unfortunate. The proverb goes 'united we stand, divided we fall'. There might be difference of opinion, but it should not be so fatal leading divisions. People expect politicians as their friends. Politicians should consider them as the servants of the people. Delay in realizing this truth by our politicians shall delay our progress. //////Activists of the BCL in RU are committing many crimes on the campus like throwing a student from the upper floor of a building, inserting nails in legs of students. Law enforcers are not taking adequate measures about these crimes resulting in their continuation. BCL are perpetrating these crimes using the backlash against the Shibir. It seems that they are provided clemency when they brand the victims as Shibir men . But it is the law enforcer not BCL who should take action against the bad elements. The government should take the matter seriously. //////Nepal's parliament failed for the sixth time to elect a prime minister yesterday, as the house speaker warned of a "serious crisis" if a new government is not in place soon.//////Taliban insurgents appear to be making good on threats to kill candidates in Afghanistan's parliamentary elections, adding a grim dimension to the ambitions of political hopefuls in the war-torn country.//////The message in black Urdu lettering on a white sack of supplies for flood relief says it all: "In tough times, the Pakistan Army is with you."//////Armed Basque separatist group Eta says it will not "carry out armed actions" in its campaign for independence.//////The United States likely will need to keep thousands of troops in Iraq beyond 2011 to keep a lid on sectarian tensions and to bolster Baghdad's fledgling military, experts and former officers say.//////One of Belgium's top politicians warned the country's citizens yesterday to "get ready for the break-up of Belgium," as King Albert II seeks to relaunch knife-edge coalition talks.//////The Indian government is looking at proposals to legalise the country's multi-million-dollar underground gambling market to tackle corruption in cricket, according to a newspaper report yesterday.//////Pakistani authorities were trying to protect another town from floodwaters in southern Sindh province, as the nation continues to grapple with its worst natural disaster in living memory.//////India yesterday test-fired an advanced version of a supersonic cruise missile, officials said, as part of the country's drive to boost its defence system. //////Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says he has warned Israel's prime minister that he'll quit peace talks unless Israel extends a curb on settlement construction.//////A peace deal with the Palestinians will require a creative, new approach to issues that have defied resolution in past negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday.//////The body of a second Palestinian killed in Israeli air strikes on southern Gaza was recovered yesterday, according to Palestinian medics and witnesses.//////Suicide bombers hit a Baghdad military headquarters yesterday and killed 12 people, two weeks after an attack on the same site pointed to the failure of Iraqi forces to plug even the most obvious holes in their security.//////The Hubble space telescope has returned to view one of its favourite subjects - a giant stellar explosion that was first seen on Earth in 1987.//////A suicide bomber rammed into a Russian firing range killing five people and wounding scores yesterday in the volatile North Caucasus region of Dagestan, law enforcement sources said.//////An Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery now faces being whipped for indecency, her son says.//////A photo exhibition, titled Sacred Relics of the Prophets, is on at Goethe-Institut, Bangladesh.

But his top agents and civil officials do not seem to believe this and are singing from different music sheets. //////Tears. Such a small word but profound in connotations. The obvious explosion of it is in sadness, the very moment when a heart experiences any loss, goes through pains and agonies. There is "positive" outburst of tears as well -- we cry when we are extremely happy after possessing "something" after long and difficult trials. For me there is a presence of another dimension -- the tears of inspiration.//////
