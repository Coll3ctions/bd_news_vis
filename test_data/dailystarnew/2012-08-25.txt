What is of import here is that under the original Grameen Bank (GB) Ordinance, 1983, the authority for appointment of MD lay squarely with the Board. No longer is this the case.//////That 42 people died in road crashes in different parts of the country during the Eid holidays comes as shocking news.

The commissioner should know they are different not because how they see people, but because how people see them."//////It is that time of year when you remember a summer of madness running riot across India, destroying lives, razing homes and putting heritage to flight. The partition of India, for all the association you bring to it of freedom, of a tryst with destiny (in Nehru's oft-quoted phrase) remains a metaphor for horror brought about through sheer fratricide. In August 1947, as Jawaharlal Nehru took charge of a free India and Mohammad Ali Jinnah assumed power in Pakistan, as many as a million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs died in a frenzy they had no hand in the making of. No fewer than fourteen and a half million people left their ancient homes, on both sides of the border decreed by Cyril Radcliffe, to find refuge and a future in unfamiliar new homelands. Radcliffe did the job in a bare thirty six days.//////The political as well as economic situation in the country is perhaps heading for chaotic times with no apparent signs of a redeeming future for the people at large. Millions of them have started wondering whether elections or people's government could bring about substantial change in their lot. Happily, food shortage could be avoided during the last two years because of intensive thrust on agriculture to increase productivity, but most people in the countryside, where 70% of the population lives, remain as poor as ever. //////The last few decades witnessed a dramatic increase in the globalisation trend, particularly for the emerging market economies. Increased pace of globalisation was aided, among other factors, by the spectacular advancement of technology, removal of trade and investment barriers and collapse of the former Soviet regime. Although the wind of globalisation has swept over many South and Southeast Asian nations and reached the shores of Bangladesh, Bangladesh still has to exploit the full potentials of this powerful undercurrent unleashed by the globalisation process. //////It is hard to write an obituary, especially about someone whom one has known well and has been the proverbial larger-than-life character in one's childhood memories. Abdur Rouf Chowdhury was such a character, a dear friend whose outlook on life was so positive one wondered whether his drive to succeed was a reflection of keen ambition or simply a challenge to live, and live well. We think it was the latter. //////At the beginning of the new millennium we live in a world of unprecedented population numbers. And currently cities are populated by about half of the world's population, a figure which is probably to increase to two-thirds by 2030. Currently, each person shares 4.7 acres of land considering almost 22 billion acres of productive land on earth. //////In the sizzling summer heat I've been thinking about igloos. To chill out in, of course, but also because I admire their elemental simplicity. Inuits traditionally used bone knives to carve bricks from quarries of hardened snow. A short, low tunnel led to the front door, trapping heat in and keeping out fierce cold and critters. Mortar wasn't needed, because the snow bricks were shaved to fit, and at night the dome ossified into a glistening ice fort. The human warmth inside melted the ice just enough to seal the seams.//////Athena picked up the crumpled paper, smoothed it gently with her hands, and stared at the two words: ////// and //////. She threw it back in the full basket. For her, the right thoughts were there but the right words had paused. She was having trouble in constructing a full sentence.

Today it was not to be. //////Five Asian and African journalists, who recently gathered in Hamburg to attend the IIJ Summer Academy 2012, set out on a trip to Amsterdam, the Dutch capital, one Friday in July. It was an experience to be remembered in years to come. Being in a European city for the first time in their lives was in itself an excitement incomparable with any other. And travelling to another city of the continent was a real adventure.//////For many, life has become an epic struggle for survival. In exasperation they wonder: What does the future hold?

The clarifying moment came on August 11 when President Mohamed Morsi removed the two top military leaders, consolidating the Brotherhood's hold over the government.//////Small state becomes an important feature of international society in the 21st century when a large number of states of the state centric international system belong to that group. The concept of small state suffers from definitional problem because of their variation in terms of territorial size, population density, market potential, administrative capacities, resource possession and mobilization, as well as degrees of geographical remoteness. David Vital tried to offer a comprehensive definition in his famous book titled //////. He settled the definition via some upper limits: "(a) a population of 10-15 million in the case of economically advanced countries; and (b) a population of 20-30 million in the case of underdeveloped countries." (Vital 1967:8). A study produced by the United Nations Institute forTraining and Research in 1971 quoted the UN Secretary-General's definition from 1966 which defined small states as "entities which are exceptionally small in area, population and human and economic resources." (UNITAR 1971:29) The report concluded that smallness "is a comparative and not an absolute idea." (UNITAR 1971:29)//////The Rohingyas, numbering nearly a million and thereby constituting a significant portion of the approximately 55 million population of Myanmar, are recognised by the UN as one of the most persecuted ethnic minorities in the world. The level of persecution has only varied over the past few years, and has worsened now. General Ne Win, former dictator Premier of erstwhile Burma (now Myanmar), caused the greatest misery to the Rohingyas and started the process of their deprivation by stripping them of Burmese citizenship in 1982. There has been no reversal of this trend by successive military junta leaders. Instead, further socio-economic isolation and persecution has been brought upon the Rohingyas by successive governments in Yangon. As per conditions presently prevailing in Myanmar, the Geneva Convention on Refugees of 1951 and its Protocol of 1967 are being grossly violated in respect of the Rohingyas.//////Be forewarned.

Nilufar Huda's life could and might have been different had politics and war not come in her way. ////// is the war she has waged for decades. To comprehend the nature of her war as an individual, you need to go back to the two wars which left her life changed for ever, to a point where the happiness she looked forward to quickly and dramatically gave way to tragedy.//////Reading an author's first book is very often a great pleasure.
