He was of course referring to the hartal called for yesterday by the BNP-led 18-party alliance over the rise in fuel prices. While no one will dispute the truism that a hartal or general strike is an accepted political norm in a democracy, one is surely a trifle bewildered when a political party that has been in power more than once in the 41-year history of this country decides in cavalier fashion to order a nationwide shutdown over issues that ought to have been discussed in parliament. Muhith's assertion that the BNP, having been in government, should be knowing how a government is run certainly makes sense.//////The nationwide dawn-to-dusk hartal enforced by the BNP-led 18-party alliance, protesting the latest fuel price hike, was marked by incidents of arson, vandalism, explosions, and chases and counter-chases yesterday.//////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia yesterday ducked appearing before a Dhaka court in a corruption case for the 10th time citing security concerns. //////Police recovered the handcuffed body of a BNP leader from Kushtia on Saturday night, around three hours after he was allegedly picked up by Rab members from Jhenidah.//////Dhaka Polytechnic Institute has been shut indefinitely after Chhatra League activists went on the rampage and attacked teachers demanding pass mark for two students.//////Indian Border Security Force picked up four Bangladeshi nationals in Moheshpur upazila of Jhenidah early yesterday. //////Four accused in the Tangail gang rape case were sent to the district here yesterday on expiry of their three-day police remand.//////The father of an Indian student whose brutal rape provoked a global outcry said he wanted her name made public so she could be an inspiration to victims of sexual assault, a call that was quickly taken up by social media users and may pressure authorities to allow her identity to be revealed.//////The International Crimes Tribunal-1 yesterday asked the prosecution to submit the probe report on the alleged crimes against humanity of Jamaat-e-Islami leader Maulana Abdus Subhan on February 18.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's scheduled address to the nation yesterday was postponed as necessary "formalities" were yet to be completed, highly placed sources said.//////Allegations of recruitment irregularities and audit objections have put Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU) in a fix.//////A team of archaeologists and other experts yesterday started salvaging a 200-year-old boat that surfaced on the Kuakata beach last year.//////India's bid to explore Mars will be a scaled down affair with the space agency flying experimental payload of less than 15 kg as against 25kg planned originally.//////Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez's allies staged a show of unity on Saturday, re-electing the ruling party's Diosdado Cabello as parliamentary speaker, while their president battles cancer in Cuba.//////At least nine people have died in clashes between al-Qaeda-linked Islamist rebels and Somali government forces and their Ethiopian allies, a village elder said yesterday amid conflicting claims from both sides.//////Several people were missing and feared dead yesterday after wildfires swept through the Australian island state of Tasmania, destroying more than 100 homes and forcing thousands to flee.//////The government's decision to go for an almost across-the-board fuel price hike, for the fifth time during last four years of its tenure, has raised questions about the justification of the move from different quarters.

In a press conference, FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz allowed that the charges came from a staggering number of Google's competitors, and at face value they are plausible: Google essentially controls search with something like 70 percent of the market share and, like any company with near monopoly power, might be tempted to use that advantage to slyly divert traffic away from competitors.

Why should any girl who has been raped, not commit suicide or want to live when they have been indoctrinated to believe that their future life is doomed - they will be unmarriageable, a liability to their family, an object of shame in their community - in other words, they might as well be dead? But who told them this - WHO? If that is all the 'sex education' some communities give their children, the argument for a correct and compassionate version to be part of a compulsory syllabus, in schools, mobile classrooms and street theater, is overwhelming. Let me invite some of your readers, sir, to ask their friends, family and employees the following questions://////Only a day after the UNGA overwhelmingly passed a resolution on November 29, recognising Palestine within the 1967 borders as a non-member observer state, Israeli government showed the audacity to announce a new settlement plan of constructing 3000 residential units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. On December 19, 14 out of 15 member countries of the UN security council condemned Israel for its intention to build the new settler homes on occupied land and on December 21, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a televised interview reacted by saying, I don't care what the UN says about. //////In Bangladesh, winter is the season of vegetables. Huge quantities of different varieties of vegetables are cultivated throughout the country. The prices of vegetables usually decrease in this season. But this year the consumers are confronting a different situation. The price of every vegetable in Dhaka is abnormally high. //////Four dead bodies on the border in two days - this is how our big neighbour greeted us in the early hours of New Year 2013. Home minister of Bangladesh has already said that the Border Security Force (BSF) of India has the right to shoot in self-defence. What boggles our mind is how on earth two alleged petty criminals (illegal cow traders BSF version) could pose such serious threat to disciplined, trained and firearm carrying soldiers. This is not the first time that BSF showed total disrespect to Bangladeshi lives. The killing of Felani, an innocent girl, comes to mind. Even her dead body was left to hang on the barbed fence of the border for days. Her family suffered as they could not arrange a proper burial ritual for days as BSF declined even to handover the dead body. The brutal beating of a cow trader by BSF (as was shown on YouTube) is another example. The list will go on and on. //////In the early morning of January 1, 2013, Border Security Force of India (BSF) killed two Bangladeshi cattle traders on Bujruk border in Thakurgaon. Nur Islam, 28, and Moktar Dai, 27, died instantly. Then again on January 2, BSF shot dead two more Bangladeshi cattle traders near a border area in Chapainawabganj and held two others in Joypurhat.//////It's amazing that the IWCT and the parties are all focused on Skype conversation and on poor 'Amar Desh'. This little newspaper has outreached the boundaries of Bangladesh. But they are not looking at the Economist, a respected journal with international readership. That weekly has published far more damaging revelations, such as Ahmad Ziauddin drafting the charge sheet against Ghulam Azam; a government minister approaching Justice Nizamul Huq to expedite the verdict; and the government being mad for judgment in Sayedee's case before 16 December. //////The other day I bought wet wipes for my newborn baby from a renowned pharmacy at Banani. It was "Chu Chu Wet Wipes". I have seen some TV commercials of this brand. I was surprised that there was no company name, no manufacturer's name, or no importer's name on the packet although "Chu Chu" is a registered trademark. //////Former England cricket captain and famous commentator Tony Greig has died on December 29, 2012. He played 58 Test matches for England, scored 3599 runs and took 141 wickets during his career and was named one of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's players of the year in 1975. He captained 14 Test matches. He became a popular commentator with his extraordinary interpretation. The entire cricket world will miss him.//////The gang-rape of a schoolgirl in Tangail has shocked the whole country.

Traditionally, DCs have been recruited as ROs to conduct the elections at the constituency level. Since the 1st Parliamentary election held in 1973, the EC recruited at least 618 ROs, and all of them were from the administration cadre of the government. Additionally, at least 3,888 (data was not found for 1988 and 1996 elections) assistant returning officers (ARO) were recruited for the Parliamentary elections of 1973-2008, but only 36 of them were recruited (in 1996, 2001 and 2008 elections) from the EC's own personnel.

The population explosion does not have the sharpness and visible urgency of a cyclone or a sudden onslaught by an enemy, but its effects are even more far-reaching. Intellectual awareness of the causes and effects of overpopulation as well as introduction of population slogans for motivating the donor agencies are not enough. The problem is to generate the emotional commitment necessary to take the matter out of the halls of intellectual speculation and into the area of organised action. Over the past four decades, concern with the problem of overpopulation has spread around the country but none of the family planning programmes have matched the proportions of the problem.////// (Boris Pasternak). //////What's the secret of writing a good screenplay?
