Then, with the Cabinet approving renewal of the pre-existing bilateral trade agreement, the BNP has literally raised a hue and cry threatening street protests. //////Now that an elected government is in office, it is time to expect swift action on some prime plots handed out by the previous BNP-Jamaat alliance government to its loyalists and friends between 2002 and 2006. Originally marked out as a site for a future hospital back in 1973 (and in fact the foundation for the building was laid by then prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2001), the 25 bighas of land in question were and are the property of the ministry of health. The alliance government simply commandeered 14 bighas of the land and gave them out to its friends and supporters at throwaway prices. Indeed, among those who benefited from such questionable munificence of the then government were some media people only too happy to be part of what came to be known as a media palli loyal to the powers that were.//////THE government's plan to send some 40 lakh skilled or unskilled workers abroad during its tenure to fulfill the election pledges for poverty alleviation, outlined by the expatriate welfare and overseas employment minister on January 28, is merely wishful thinking far away from reality.//////J.M.

A cricketer with both his knees operated on and has been fighting against freakish injury ever since his Bangladesh debut in 2001 added another daring chapter in his never-say-die career on Friday.

The city buses and trekkers stop anywhere for any amount of time which creates artificial traffic jam. The driver does not even care to look behind to see how much traffic chaos he is creating. Sometimes buses create a road train by stopping at bus stops in a line. It can be often seen in all the busy areas in the city-- Mirpur, Mohakhali, Farmgate, Rampura, resulting in pollution and health hazards for the pedestrians. They suddenly stop on the slightest signal without considering that they are driving on a public road which may lead to an accident.//////The way the MPs are behaving in making parliament the focal point of all development and political activities is not producing any results due to the absence of the opposition from parliament on childish grounds and possible lack of quorum due to the absence of the government party members. The childish issue of sitting arrangement is condemnable by any standard. I think the outgoing speaker applied very bad judgment to make the issue, and the present speaker is equally ineffective to take any agreeable decision. The other striking factor is the continuous no talk policy between the two top leaders of the country. Why these two leaders of this unfortunate nation are not talking yet is beyond our apprehension. The political parties have changed their political strategy without any change in their policy!//////Every morning when I pass through the main gate of Kaderabad Housing in Mohammadpur, a bad odour comes to my nose & my mood changes. Common people use that place as a public toilet. We frequently see that vehicles of the DCC carry wastes, creating air pollution.

It was written by a retired judge. The article appears prima-facie to be informative, among other things. Congratulations! //////The BNP is clamouring as to why the name of the late Ziaur Rahman was not cited in the president's speech in the inauguration of the ninth parliament. They are very unhappy and hurt. Our reaction is 'why the hell?' Historically, Ziaur Rahman is not at par with the other national leaders of Bangladesh. His contribution towards the political movements, mass upsurge, emancipation, freedom of Bengali nation, liberation war etc. is not at all comparable to the contributions of Bangabandhu, Sher-e-Bangla, Moulana Bhashani, Shaheed Suhrawardy, Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, Monsur Ali, Kamruzzaman, Gen. Osmani etc. His name can not be taken at the same breath and with the same respect and honour as the above mentioned ones. Contribution of Ziaur Rahman is comparable with that of Shafiullah , Khaled Musharraf and other sector commanders. //////Recently a local political leader of Barabagh area under Mirpur-2 has set up a kitchen market at the entrance road of a residential area known as Popular Housing-1. People from the adjacent areas use Popular Housing-1 approach road to go to Monipur School to drop their children. Popular Housing-1 is located at Barabagh under Mirpur-2 and this is a very busy connecting road between Monipur and Barabagh. At the starting point of the approach road the local leader has set up the kitchen market occupying the city corporation road. The market starts at 7:00am and continues up to 1:00pm. Different types of traders gather here and set their shops occupying almost 70-80% of the road to do their trading. During this time it becomes extremely difficult for us to go to school. The shopkeepers and some unruly boys tease the school girls while they pass through this road. //////A vice chancellor is the academic and administrative CEO of a university. To understand the great importance of the post one must know what the principal function of a university is. Like all other educational institutions a university also propagates knowledge. But a university is different from all of them for the unique role it plays. A university creates knowledge, others do not. Therefore, a vice chancellor himself must have an outstanding academic career. He must have the academic excellence to create knowledge by carrying out research work himself in his own field of knowledge. He must also be able to provide leadership and guidance to other research scholars under him. The universally accepted yardstick to measure such academic competence is the number of publications he publishes per year in internationally reputed professional journals. //////Thanks are due to Syed Badrul Ahsan for speaking up, in no uncertain terms, about the plight of students in 'On dormitories and schools' (DS 4.2.09). The problem goes even wider. //////The Sheikh Hasina-led government has started reshuffling the civil administration with a view to translating the pledged Digital Bangladesh into reality but in the same way that every political government, after holding the state power and authority, forthwith does. The government at hand is restructuring the administration by promoting the persons dedicated to the party to the higher ranks on the basis of political consideration, rather than seniority that contradicts democratic principles. The civil bureaucracy administered by inexperienced and partisan personnel can neither produce the desired results, nor serve the gross national interest. Reasonably, it should be run by the experienced, competent and efficient personnel. Therefore, the government should prioritise seniority and meritocracy, irrespective of party loyalty, as the principles of promotion in the bureaucracy and should shun the path repeatedly followed by the past political governments to set a good example before other political parties.//////Although the outgoing Speaker Mr. Jamiruddin Sircar has proved his bipartisan role once again by putting the last nail on the board, I think it is not a big deal for the party in power to negotiate with the opposition by providing them one more seat in the front row of parliament. It will rather strengthen their image further to public. //////Since Shab-e-Barat is not mentioned in the Holy Quran and since its status is disputed by the ulema groups, so we should not observe the day as a govt. holiday. //////Hundreds of sick and wounded people are stranded in a makeshift hospital in war-wracked northern Sri Lanka, the Red Cross said Saturday as it urged the government and Tamil Tiger rebels to let the patients out of the conflict zone.//////Aid from the Obama administration to Pakistan should come without strings attached, Pakistan's ambassador to the US said in a newspaper interview published yesterday.//////Vice President Joe Biden delivered a clear message to Iran, saying Saturday the US was willing to talk, but will act to isolate and pressure Tehran if it does not abandon its nuclear ambitions and support for terrorism.//////The head of Nato and US Vice President Joe Biden joined forces Saturday to urge European allies to step up efforts in Afghanistan, as the United States prepares to send in thousands more troops.//////The White House is considering at least two troop withdrawal options as it weighs a new Iraq strategy one that would preserve President Barack Obama's campaign pledge to get all combat brigades out within 16 months and a second that would stretch it to 23 months, two officials said Friday.//////Assailants threw a bomb at a police checkpoint in eastern Pakistan before dawn yesterday, killing seven officers, police said.//////Bomb blasts, ambushes and other incidents left seven Afghans dead, including government officials, authorities said yesterday, also reporting that security forces had killed 10 insurgents.//////Fourteen people died and more than 100 homes were destroyed in wildfires raging through southeastern Australia yesterday, with arsonists suspected of starting several blazes, police said.//////Madagascan police shot dead at least seven supporters of opposition leader Andry Rajoelina Saturday as they tried to march on a palace of President Marc Ravalomanana during a protest.//////Iraqi politicians backed by the radical anti-US cleric Moqtada al-Sadr yesterday said they would lodge an official complaint about votes being excluded during last weekend's provincial elections.//////BBC television presenter Jeremy Clarkson said yesterday that while he was sorry for having made fun of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's appearance, he would not apologise for calling him an "idiot".//////Terror infrastructure in Pakistan is "existing and active", according to Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor, who puts the number of terror camps there in between 30 and 50.//////BJP, which had kept its pet issues like Ramjanambhoomi on the backburner because of coalition compulsions 10 years ago, today revived the Ayodhya chant saying it would build a magnificent temple for Lord Ram if it gets a majority on its own.//////Pakistan yesterday sought to allay international concerns that the release of its disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan could lead to renewed nuclear proliferation.//////Theatre troupe Drishyapat celebrated its 18th anniversary by honouring eminent cultural personality Professor Abdullah Abu Sayeed, The event was held at the National Theatre Stage, BSA on February 6.
