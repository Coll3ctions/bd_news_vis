Inside the bank, it was in the air that something grossly wrong was going on at three Sonali Bank branches -- Ruposhi Bangla, Gulshan and Motijheel local office -- regarding loans to a powerful company named Hall-Mark.

And with hooligans having now entered the scene at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in questionable defence of an embattled vice chancellor, it now becomes critically important that Vice Chancellor Nazrul Islam and the pro-VC of the university do the decent thing of handing in their resignations in order for Buet to get back to normal.//////Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday said the decision on the Padma bridge project would be taken after sitting with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Jica.//////Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday threatened to resign when a cabinet member criticised him severely over the issues of Grameen Bank and the World Bank loan for the Padma bridge project. //////Former communications minister Syed Abul Hossain yesterday claimed that there was no corruption or irregularities in the Padma bridge project.//////The cabinet yesterday finally approved the draft of Grameen Bank Amendment Act 2012 to turn the ordinance into a law in the current session of parliament. //////Asking the government to reduce the power tariff, the main opposition BNP yesterday urged the people to build up a tougher resistance against the government's decision to increase price of electricity repeatedly.//////Detectives yesterday arrested a member of a transnational drug smugglers' gang, who had sent 50 small consignments of heroin coming from Pakistan to the UK through local branches of international courier services. //////Two important selection criteria -- district quota and physical fitness -- were not applied properly in recruiting 334 railway security personnel last year, a departmental probe of Bangladesh Railway revealed recently.//////The Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) yesterday claimed that it had foiled a bid to kill three physicians following an internal feud between two groups of the Doctors' Association of Bangladesh (DAB), a pro-BNP organisation. //////A prosecution witness yesterday told International Crimes Tribunal-2 that Jamaat leader Muhammad Kamaruzzaman and his accomplices had abducted his brother who was tortured at a military camp in Sherpur and was later shot dead on June 30, 1971.//////The defence yesterday cross-examined two prosecution witnesses in separate cases against war crimes accused BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami at the International Crimes Tribunal-1.//////Seventy generals in the Egyptian armed forces are to be retired, the government announced on Sunday.//////An editor of one of Pakistan's leading English dailies was beaten up by four men outside his home in the port city of Karachi for watching TV and listening to music. //////Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad yesterday said the general election cannot be free and fair with parliament still not dissolved. //////A worker died and two others were injured in a lift crash at the office of pharma company Renata Ltd in Mirpur-7 yesterday.//////Islamic extremists occupying northern Mali said Sunday they have executed an Algerian diplomat kidnapped five months ago, after an ultimatum given to his government to fulfill their demands expired.//////It is indeed worrying that the turmoil in BUET that has been going on for five months has not yet been solved, and is, in fact, getting more complicated by the day. Although in keeping with the High Court order the teachers had suspended their agitation programmes classes have not resumed and procession and sit-ins by the students still continue. //////We welcome the government's revised decision to hold admission tests for students enrolling at medical and dental colleges this year as in past years. The fact that the change in the government's unthinking declaration comes in the face of a prolonged and at times violent agitation by students, however, sets a bad precedent. //////The Bangladesh

Roughly translated, that is 1.3 billion tonnes of food getting lost in the supply chain or wasted for multifarious reasons. When one considers that globally about a billion people go to bed hungry and some 3 billion people are undernourished, such wastage becomes unacceptable. It is interesting to note is that the amount of food wastage is nearly at par between developed and developing countries with 670 and 630 million tonnes respectively. However, food wastage by consumers in rich countries stands at 222 million tonnes that is equivalent to practically the total food production of sub-Saharan Africa, i.e. 230 million tonnes. In case of industrialised countries, the bulk of wastage occurs at the consumption level, whereas for low-income countries, the substantial losses occur at early and middle stages of the supply chain and not so much at consumer level.//////If the Indian government thought it could politically isolate the growing nationwide anti-nuclear power struggle, it's manifestly mistaken.

This is alarming news for our banking as well as the financial sector as a whole. //////The Earth was born 4.6 billion years ago and the Universe about 13.7 billion years ago.
