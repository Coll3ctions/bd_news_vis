opposition rivals forged an alliance against him.//////Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown has become an honorary Hindu, taking the name Govardhan Brown, during a ceremony to mark the Diwali festival, an umbrella organisation for British Hindus said Thursday. //////The recommendations of the report on strengthening local government are a reflection of the needs of the times. They are so because much debate has gone on around the issue of a devolution of power from the national government to local authorities. There has been an acutely felt need for administration to be decentralised through a necessary and proper empowerment of local government institutions. The suggestions made in the report surely go a long way toward meeting such goals. Indeed, the reality is that democracy does not function very well, or runs into roadblocks, when political power is absent where it matters, in this instance the grassroots. That is one more way of saying that participatory democracy is ultimately dependent on how strong and effective local bodies are in a country.//////Although the adviser for industry, Geeteara Safiya Choudhury has changed her tack a few times since she first blamed the fertiliser crisis on media hype and the impatience of farmers in long queues, her original observations do not cease to ring into the ears. She is urging the journalists now to read out to the farmers 'who can't read' the newspaper ad. put up by the government declaring that there is no fertiliser crisis. But if insistence on stock position being satisfactory and admitting to existence of some 'distribution problems' do not constitute a crisis than what does? //////The story has it that once a centipede was happy until it met with a frolicking frog. When it saw the frog jumping in the air with only four legs, it thought it should be able to do the same since it had many times more legs. So the centipede wanted to give it a shot and that is when it started to hesitate. It tried to lift one leg, then another, but couldn't figure out which one was to come after which. In the end, the legs got tangled and the centipede couldn't even stand up. The short moral of the long story is that fewer legs can increase speed, but too many legs aren't a good thing.//////If there is any serious attempt by caring Bangladeshis to understand the reasons for the malfunctioning of our polity by placing them in the historical, sociological and political context, it may turn out to be an agonising experience. The suspicion could be that our concern for democracy amounted to merely false consciousness or, worse, was it a crude legitimisation of the so-called politically driven conflict? Should we look for the roots of the problem in the phenomena of social exclusion, economic marginalisation, contests for power, and other contingent factors?//////The present caretaker government (CTG) is unique in the sense that it was established after proclamation of emergency to save the country from total collapse because of the short-sightedness, arrogance, and greed for power and wealth of some top leaders of some major political parties. In the name of democracy, anarchy was established. Muscle and money ruled the society. //////Sachin Tendulkar hit a stunning 97 as India beat Pakistan by six wickets in Gwalior on Thursday to claim a first one-day series win over the archrivals on home soil since 1983.//////Abahani return to Bordoloi Trophy after 15 years when the Bangladesh professional league champions take part in the 56th edition of Assam's premier football tournament. //////AFC vice-president Monilal Fernando ended speculations that Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) could lose FIFA development funds by promising more help for the country yesterday.//////Mahfuzur Rahman of BKSP became the only male swimmer to have broken a new national record in the 22nd National Swimming Championships yesterday.//////Before Sri Lanka start their final campaign to win a Test in Australia with their golden generation they must first make a couple of crucial decisions over the make-up of their team.

president of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, says a press release.//////This year also Nur Hussain Day was observed on 10 November as before. Nur Hussain sacrificed his life for democracy. The blood of Nur Hussain helped end autocracy and establish the so-called democracy. Unfortunately, the political parties are not strong believers in democracy, rather they are interested in having the charm of governance and staying in power, showing zero tolerance to the views of the opposition and maintaining no norms of democracy in their official functions.//////Bangladesh is a country having great tourism potential. There are many attractive spots like the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, Cox's Bazar sea beach, and many historical sites. Many tourists will come to our country and Bangladesh will earn foreign currency if we can manage things well. //////ALO is a welfare organisation for creating Drug Awareness and is run by volunteers. It is engaged in various activities focusing on making society, especially the vulnerable youth, aware of the dangers associated with taking drugs and becoming addicts. For the past five years, ALO has been striving with limited resources, to help those in need of assistance against drugs.//////One of my closed relatives reached Zia International Airport (ZIA) from Hong Kong on 08/11/2007 at 01.00am. They had to wait with their luggage up to 02.30am because the Belt Operator was not there at that time. There were many foreigners in that flight, besides locals. It was very surprising for the foreigners. Even locals were annoyed though they are accustomed to being harassed in their daily life. After a long journey they wanted to come out from the airport at the earliest. Another point of harassment is customs formalities, though it is a bit better now then before. Customs officials should behave politely, especially with the passengers from the Middle East. They may not be aware of customs rules but customs officials can convince them about the applicable rules in a polite way. If more officials are required for that purpose , the authorities can think about it. But, harassment of common passengers should be avoided. For security reasons and necessary formalities there will be some delay which is acceptable, but harassment due to inefficiency, negligence, corruption and misbehavior is not at all acceptable.//////Today the economy of the country is showing an upward swing in general amid growing consumerism. In the early eighties, Dhaka had only a few markets, but today we have many shopping malls, the number may exceed our imagination. Still these shopping malls are buzzing with buyers. With the rise in financial capacity, there will be demand in the following sectors://////The political sky is getting more and more cloudy as anticipated by an election commissioner-cum-political analyst. The country is now watching the adjustment programme. The BNP is put to the process of structural changes, and the AL to emotional adjustment. Rest of the political parties will now watch and make necessary adjustments and alignment to remain on course. The Islamic parties as usual are looking for strong support to proceed and to remain on course with a firm footing at the grassroots.//////It seems like anything and everything is happening in Bangladesh and elsewhere without any thought or consequence. Although nothing big, but I was dumbfounded to see the interview of the father of the nation's killer in the newspaper. It is very unfortunate to see one of the killers of our father of the nation get the chance to speak his mind and give his opinions on our sacred independence and its leaders. The trouble with publishing his interview is giving him a voice, which he does not deserve. //////Kindly note that I regularly read "The Daily Star" and the important part of the news comes under the "Headlines". I do not know why you have to install it so tiny with tiny fonts, so much so that I have to wear my reading glasses for it and then I find it difficult to click on the right spot since the mouse and arrow cannot be exactly lined up. //////This is in reference to Prof. Sufi's letter on Flawed Maps (DS 11/9/07) on sale all over Bangladesh. My experience is similar to those of Prof. Sufi. I also started travelling around Bangladesh equipped with maps published by different publishers, My dependence on these maps promptly got me hopelessly lost.//////Our heartfelt thanks to the caretaker government headed by Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, their performance is highly laudable. The country was in a mess, they are trying to bring back a stable condition.//////UN's IPCC Indian head, R K Pachauri, gave a rather obsessive lecture this month at an Asia conference in Delhi in which Bangladesh was made out to be a complete joker in the pack. Not considering the fact that hundreds of millions were affected by disastrous floods in India and the rioting, terrible problem of management of the crisis, diseases, food shortages, hunger in the last few months in his own country, Mr. Pachauri gave a glowing picture about India's wonderful ability to cope with these; this was contrasted by the helplessness in a neighbouring country. Mr. Pachauri suggested that India must intervene in future. //////I would hardly be classified as a supporter of Musharraf. In fact, I despise his , or any non-autonomous foreign policy, as well as his dismissive attitude towards both local and international law. Yet, the fact remains that the recent crisis and protests against Musharraf are of inherently racist nature - as Pakistani politics largely has been since the dictator Ayub Khan's time. //////With the advancement of e-media and e-publications, today's world has reached such a volcanic point where one country may erupt in doing either consciously or sub-consciously or unconsciously any faux-pas with its heinous and sinister lava at any time to subvert another country's economic, national, ideological or religious base. This is happening all over the world. But this shameful and aggressive attitude imposed, especially by the powerful countries on the comparatively weaker ones, in a different way these days is more skilled than before. Not that this trend of vicious circle is newly developed, rather its source originated in the past and is likely to be gargantuan in the days to come. This is not a mere deduction but deeply evaluated calculation done on the insightful observation that the way of attacking one country chooses for another one in a different modus is more psychological and less physical than that of their forefathers. This is because the fusion of strategy with the highly advanced technologies is leading the world to the state of schizophrenia as a whole. //////Former Pakistan premiers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif have agreed to join forces to oust President Pervez Musharraf from office, a top party official said yesterday. //////The United States has again asked Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to end emergency rule and take off his army uniform even as Washington's defiant key ally publicly rejected its demand.//////A group of 20 Tamil Tiger suicide bombers have infiltrated Sri Lanka's capital and are planning to murder the president and senior government officials, an MP warned Thursday. //////Pakistani troops killed 20 militants yesterday after launching a counter-offensive against pro-Taliban rebels in the northwest, the army said. //////US forces said yesterday they had killed 25 suspected al-Qaeda fighters and arrested 21 in a two-day operation in central Iraq. //////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas yesterday called for the people of Gaza to oust his Islamist rivals who seized control there five months ago as he seeks a lasting peace with Israel. //////House Democrats pushed through a $50 billion bill for the Iraq war Wednesday night that would require President Bush to start bringing troops home in coming weeks with a goal of ending combat by December 2008. //////Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday came out against granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, after weeks of pressure in the presidential race to take a position on a now-failed ID plan from her home state governor. //////India will host a 2-day Regional Conference on Global Literacy in New Delhi on November 29-30 to promote literacy at national and international levels.//////The Philippines government and separatist rebels have struck a deal on creating a Muslim homeland in the country's south which is expected to lead to a peace accord next year, officials said yesterday. //////The recent drive against obscenity and piracy, two major issues that Dhaliwood (the Dhaka-based film industry) has been grappling with, has raised hopes in the industry. Task force is striking the possible places in search of 'cut pieces' featuring vulgar and obscene scenes that are added to films, and officials are arresting individuals involved with such activities. //////Jatiyo Nabanno Utshob Udjapon Parshad organised a daylong Nabanno utshob yesterday at Bakultala, Institute of Fine Arts, Dhaka University.

Bangladeshi immigrant communities in the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand are well-established, and are contributing the lion's share to our revenue earning and the forex reserve. Perhaps accepting this reality, the interim government is seriously considering ensuring their voting right in the new context of our political realm. However, I am not sure that the government as well as the Election Commission have done sufficient homework on the implications of such a crucial decision. This article tries to capture some possible detrimental consequences of providing voting rights to Non-Resident Bangladeshis (NRB). //////Iread both the published and the unpublished versions of a recent article by Professor Abdullah A. Dewan (Economic growth and property rights, The Daily Star, November 4) that inspired me to put forward my personal views that I had developed while I was a student of Economics at the University of Lund in Sweden in the seventies, on these issues. The question "Why do some countries prosper while others lag behind?" could be put as "What makes some countries poor while others are rich?" //////Traffic jam is not a new problem for residents of Dhaka. Due to urbanisation, the demand for different kinds of urban transport has been increasing in big cities, and so has the number of vehicles. In Dhaka, we have seen that in the last six years the number of rickshaws, three-wheelers, buses, and cars has increased greatly. But we have not seen many bicycles. In Dhaka, the bicycle is not considered as a mode of transport. What is a bicycle like as a mode of transport? Can it change people's habits? In this writing I shall try to answer those questions in the light of my experience in Beijing.//////
