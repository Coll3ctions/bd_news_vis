In a column published in The Anchorage Daily News on Sept 16, Alaskan writer Elise Patkotak wrote: "There was a time when I thought John McCain really was a different kind of politician, one who would put the country above his personal desire for grandeur. I stopped thinking that the day he announced Sarah Palin as his running mate. ... Sarah Palin is untested and untried. There were dozens of other people much more qualified to be McCain's running mate who would not have caused people to question how ready they'd be to take over if something happened to McCain.

I see the Pakistan analogy is wrong and illogical. Even if we assume that Mr. Kabir?s analogy is right, I highly doubt that the US would start bombing some random part of India for violating the nuclear deal. But, if suddenly, Indians start harbouring anti US terrorists in their territory and keep thinking that territorial integrity and sovereignty would save them from US fury, they should think again. Well, who knows, what would happen to that kind of India? I am sure the US will be furious.//////I thank Mohammed Zamir for his fine PCP article on this issue. A couple of years ago, I had the good fortune to meet him and discuss with him my book Islamic Calendar: A Global Blueprint which clearly lays out a perfect mathematical lunar calendar based on mere counting of either 29 or 30 days alternately for Islamic months and a provision for a leap month every two years ( with some easily memorable exceptions).//////You won't live long, said the doctor to my aunt.//////I am extremely thankful to His Excellency, the Ambassador of Thailand to Bangladesh, for kindly responding to my letter on "Thai visa issue" published in DS on 26 September 2008 through his letter on 6 October 2008.//////Skipping a decision on polls in Jammu and Kashmir, the Election Commission today announced one-day poll in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Mizoram while Naxalite-infested Chattisgarh will have two-phased elections between November 14 and December 4.//////US military successes in Iraq have forced sophisticated and well-trained insurgents to pour into Afghanistan instead, part of the reason violence has spiked in Afghanistan, the Afghan defence minister said yesterday. //////North Korea planned to resume dismantling its nuclear programme Tuesday for the first time in two months, days after the United States removed the communist regime from a terrorism blacklist as a reward under a disarmament pact. //////Pakistan is facing a "very serious internal threat" to its integrity as a grouping of al-Qaeda, Taliban and local 'Jihadi' elements wanted to take over the country, Information Minister Sherry Rehman warned yesterday.//////Pakistan yesterday threatened to go for third party arbitration if, it said, India does not compensate it for the loss of two million acre feet of water due to an alleged reduction in the flow of the Chenab River.//////Georgian and Russian officials are to sit down face-to-face Wednesday for the first time since a five-day war in August, but tensions over the regions at the heart of the conflict threaten to derail the talks in Geneva.//////Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has solidified his lead over rival John McCain with 51-54 percent support in four key battleground states, a poll released yesterday showed.//////Russia ended a decades-old border dispute with China yesterday by giving it a stretch of river island territory in a ceremony symbolising the Cold War rivals' warming ties.//////Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and his main political rival arrived for talks Tuesday with former South African leader Thabo Mbeki aimed at saving a flagging power-sharing deal.//////Syria's president issued a decree yesterday establishing diplomatic relations with Lebanon, and a foreign ministry official said the country will have an embassy in Beirut by the end of the year. //////A Thai court yesterday agreed to hear a case which could see three political parties including the ruling People Power Party disbanded, in a further blow to the protest-hit government.//////At least 28 Taliban militants and a tribesman were killed in the latest clashes in Pakistani tribal regions bordering Afghanistan, officials said Tuesday.//////Defying Mayawati's attempts to scuttle her plans, Sonia Gandhi yesterday visited her Lok Sabha constituency calling it her "karma bhoomi" and declaring that she is ready to go to jail for the sake of development. //////Scattered fighting in northern Sri Lanka killed 38 rebels and three soldiers as the government pressed ahead with its offensive against the Tamil Tigers, the military said yesterday. //////A solo exhibition titled "The Journey of a Legend" featuring photographs by Shahadat Parvez is on at Zainul Gallery-1, Faculty of Fine Arts, Dhaka University.//////I recently viewed a Kabuki performance, which was inspiring.
