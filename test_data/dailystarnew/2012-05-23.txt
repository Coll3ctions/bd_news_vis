In an effort to halt such malpractices, the cabinet has approved a draft bill Bangladesh Water Act, 2012 that promises to put in place a series of checks and balances aimed at halting misuse of said resources. While it is commendable to see that the government has finally taken heed of decades of outcry by affected communities, environmentalists and water experts, it will be interesting to see whether the stringent provisions proposed in the Act, such as, five years' imprisonment or a fine of Tk. 5 million will actually be enforced with due diligence in reality. Reasons for disruption of natural flow of water and pollution are well known, but we often overlook the disastrous effects such wilful trespassing have on the natural state of affairs. Whether it is pollution or obstruction of natural flow of water, there is no denying that manmade interventions have helped bring about ecological disaster to entire communities of people who depend on these water resources for their livelihoods.//////Kolkata Knight Riders breezed into the final of the Indian Premier League (IPL) after scoring a thumping 18-run win over Delhi Daredevils in the first Qualifier here on Tuesday.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club brought down high-flying Abahani with a 2-0 defeat on their perennial rivals in their Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League champions at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Despite a series of meetings the last three days, the two panels in the upcoming Bangladesh Chess Federation polls have failed to reach a consensus which means the two panels will fight it out as they are.

He has been nominated best footballer of the year by the FIFA three times at a stretch and has pocketed a lot of other international records. My respect and support for Messi increased when he extended his helping hands for saving the life of Walid Kasas, a young footballer of Morocco. Kasas, a twelve-year-old boy, is suffering from a kind of hormonal problem which requires a long term and expensive treatment. A relative of Kasas then made an appeal to Messi for financial help to save the helpless boy. Messi readily agreed and declared that he would bear the expenditure of his treatment for the next six years so that Kasas can bounce back. It is interesting to note that this great footballer Messi was also suffering from the same disease in his boyhood. It is fabulous that overcoming this physical hurdle he has become the world's best footballer. May be Kasas would also be a great footballer like Messi in the future. However, the philanthropic response of Messi has drawn our attention. Other celebrities and rich people can also learn this great virtue from him and extend their helping hands for humanity. My heartfelt wishes for him. I also pray for Kasas' quick recovery. //////When I read newspaper reports describing the wickedness and evil that still exist in the Bangladeshi school system, I feel great shame to be a Bangladeshi and a member of the same profession.//////Indeed it is too late to formulate biosafety rules in our country.

Besides, I came across this piece of news that train journey is getting better and more comfortable day by day which, in fact, got me interested. It was Rajshahi bound Silk City Express leaving Kamalapur at 2.40 pm. My wife and I took the window side seats in the AC compartment with a desire to enjoy the scenic beauty of the countryside. But, poor us, the window pane was cracked and filled with water in between. That really upset us at the outset. And then, to worsen the situation, small size cockroaches jumped on our lap getting out from different holes. And during the whole journey we were busy sweeping them away using a newspaper. Couple of months back, I hired one pest control team to get rid of cockroaches at our Dhaka residence and at that time I came to know that these small sized cockroaches are called German cockroaches which are more or less one cm in size. //////The back page photograph published on 4th May in a local English daily depicted the grabbing of the foreshore land of the Turag river in Tongi.//////Nato put on a brave face at its Chicago summit but the reality is that the alliance has been weakened by the euro zone crisis and faces an identity crisis about what its role will be once it ends its intervention in Afghanistan in 2014.//////The International Atomic Energy Agency will soon sign an accord with Iran aimed at trying to resolve disputes over its nuclear drive, the UN watchdog's chief Yukiya Amano said yesterday.//////Syrian security forces carried out a spate of raids in Damascus early yesterday after a deadly bombing hit the capital and UN chief Ban Ki-Moon warned the search for peace was at a "pivotal moment."//////Opening a new era in private space flight, the US company SpaceX yesterday became the first commercial outfit to launch its own craft toward the International Space Station.//////Sri Lanka must co-operate with any international investigation into alleged war crimes, ex-army chief Sarath Fonseka told the BBC yesterday, a day after his release from jail.//////US and Pakistani leaders Monday signaled optimism that a deal on reopening vital supply routes to Nato convoys was within reach as Islamabad ordered negotiators to seal an agreement.//////NCP leader and former Lok Sabha Speaker P A Sangma, who is being backed by BJD and AIADMK for the President's post, yesterday sought to reach out to political parties, saying he hoped they will respond "to the call of conscience of the tribal people of the nation."//////Tunisia will extradite former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's prime minister to Libya and the handover could take place in "days or weeks", Justice Minister Noureddine Bouheiri yesterday said.//////As UPA completes three years in office in India, BJP yesterday claimed the government may fall anytime as coalition partners were unhappy and were not even ready to break bread together.//////The US ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, is to leave his post early, the embassy confirmed yesterday, a day after Nato leaders charted a path out of the Afghan war at a summit in Chicago.//////A buzz of excitement swept through Cairo yesterday, a day before its first presidential election since an uprising overthrew Hosni Mubarak, ushering in a tumultuous military-led transition.//////At least eleven people were killed and more than 30 people wounded as violence erupted in Karachi after unidentified armed assailants opened fire at a political rally in the provincial capital yesterday, DawnNews reported.//////The head of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced his resignation Monday, just months after a public spat with colleagues over the need for proof of safety in the wake of Japan's disaster.//////A global network that used social networking sites such as Facebook to distribute child pornography has been smashed after a tip-off from New Zealand authorities, officials yesterday said.//////Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi will address an International Labour Organisation conference in Geneva next month during her first trip outside Myanmar in 24 years, the ILO yesterday said.//////The US ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, is to leave his post early, the embassy confirmed yesterday, a day after Nato leaders charted a path out of the Afghan war at a summit in Chicago.//////As every year, there has been a rush of visitors to the two Nazrul Smriti Kendra (memorial centres) at Kazir Shimla village and Darirampur in Trishal just ahead of the birth anniversary of the National Poet.//////International Centre for Nazrul (ICNAZRUL) held its soft launch on May 19 at Radius Centre, Bay's Galleria in Gulshan 1, Dhaka, according to a press release.

I was impressed with the quality of the questions that were placed before the US secretary of state, for they were tough and relevant and were a demonstration of the level of knowledge India's young have about America and its policies in the geo-political context. It took Clinton quite some time and quite some thinking before she could respond to those questions. On a question related to American pressure on Iran regarding Tehran's alleged nuclear programme, a young woman asked the secretary why Washington was not applying similar pressure on Israel. Clinton fumbled, before going on and on about why Iran needed to be given the harsh treatment.
