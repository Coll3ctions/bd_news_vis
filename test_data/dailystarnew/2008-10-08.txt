All concerned agencies and institutions must be complimented for their role in completing this project within a very short span of time. This new addition comes as a part of the larger context of the port operation, which would have remained incomplete without this technology. The changeover is also heartening because it is a product of public-private partnership.//////It is surely a matter of concern that many products in the market do not carry the mandatory seal of the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution. In fact, there are hundreds of products that are openly being sold in the market, with hardly anyone to check whether these products, minus BSTI approval, can be offered to the public. Intriguingly, the BSTI always seems to be in the news every time there is bad news about what it does not do or how people can skirt around it. That says a good deal about what must now be done to turn the organisation into an effective body if goods sold in the market are to maintain safety standards.//////SYED Muhammad Ibrahim started it all. The former military officer let it be known a few days ago that former army chief and president Hussein Muhammad Ershad bore responsibility for the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, and the murder a few days later of General M.A. Manzoor. //////THE AL is clearly in disarray and has lost its direction. Or else why should it be wooing a fiendish tinpot dictator like Ershad for reorganising an alliance called //////. The disturbing rumour had already been in the air, and now it has been spelt out by the man himself. He claims he was in the ////// and is still in it.

Broad Gauge, which is the widest, measures a distance of 5feet 3inches between the two parallel rails. It was pioneered by the British, and laid in England and it's colonial railways subsequently.

The narrow gauge is usually set at track width of 2 feet.//////Apart from the increase in population in the city with non-availability of pure water, erratic electricity supply, intolerable traffic congestions, limited number of roads and insufficient healthy accommodation facilities, the biggest challenge Dhaka will face is earthquake.

We should be grateful to BDR authorities for their good management of these shops and contribution to society. The shops ensured cheaper price as well as genuine goods for the buyers. //////Since tobacco requires large quantities of water, fields are mostly located near water bodies. Since large amounts of pesticides are used on the tobacco plant, the chemical residue flows back to the water bodies when the fields are irrigated. //////This is no longer a new issue that most of the foods we purchase from the markets are made in an unhygienic and frowzy condition.

You may or may not agree with me but that is not the issue here. Today, I am raising the issue of upazila polls. I only read what the political parties and the EC want. What about your view points ? Why is your political correspondent not doing any investigative reporting on it? //////After a nine-month long nightmare we got independence. Some valiant sons of this soil sacrificed their lives to uphold our rights and to establish a National Flag. We had a dream. //////I am informed that the education ministry is planning to make the mark-sheet appear in the HSC certificate along with the grade. This could make the whole admission thing for HSC students a lot easier as the university authorities could easily judge a student's merit by the marks.

Norton & Co., 2008) by Khademul Islam in your publication. //////Today everyone wants an MBA degree after his name, even if he has done undergraduate in theology, as if MBA is an inevitable requirement even for the post of a clerk. Just open the vacancy announcements, you will see that each and every job needs an MBA degree- this is degradation of the degree.//////It is technology that is developing rapidly all around the world. One of it is DTH service. This service is now available in Saarc countries like India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. This service will replace the dish service providers. Most of the time they cannot provide good service to customers. But it is a matter of regret that the Bangladesh government has not taken the initiative to allow its operation in Bangladesh. It would be a source of optimal revenue collection for the government. And people could get the best entertainment facilities from DTH.//////The Daily Star has published a number of letters from concerned citizens regarding sexual harassment by teachers. No doubt, if such heinous activities are actually taking place in our educational institutions, then those should be properly handled by the administration. However, after reading a letter on the topic, which was published on September 25, I actually had to wonder if some letter writers were confusing 'failed relationship with teacher' with 'sexual harassment'. Unfortunately, that's the impression I got after reading Nasrin Pervin's letter published on September 12, 2008. According to the writer, her friend was having a long relationship with her teacher and when the teacher backed out (for whatever reason it might be), then it automatically became a 'sexual harassment by the teacher', just because the guy who was flirting with her friend was a teacher by profession. //////I was amazed to watch TV where BNP leader Mr. Delwar was demanding a level playing field without specifying what that meant. However, from another channel I understood that he wanted the RPO to be repealed and rejected the idea of registration of political parties, etc. It appears that the Jamaat is riding on the BNP. //////Taking responsibility for the actions, especially the wrong ones, of the followers and subordinates is one of the most important qualities of any leader in any profession. One may quote a number of incidents from recent history wherein ministers in other countries, including our neighbour India, resigned for the failures and lapses committed by the junior members of their respective departments. For example, a railway minister resigned for two trains colliding face to face on the same track. A civil aviation minister resigned because two airplanes collided in the air. A defence minister resigned because his soldiers failed to fight efficiently. CEOs of many multinational companies resigned because their respective companies failed to make profits. On the other hand, in Bangladesh no leader takes responsibility and never resigns for the failures and lapses committed by their followers. They rather encourage such wrong doers to commit bigger crimes. We are yet to hear any word of regret or remorse from the two women leaders of these convicted persons, let alone their resignation. The nation was shocked to hear that the standing committee of a political party recently decided to make one such leader the chairperson of the party for life. Like master like servants!//////The nation must have been shocked when Begum Zia and her party, soon after her release from the sub-jail, stubbornly rejected all the 12 provisions of the RPO without assigning any reason, while the AL accepted nearly all the provisions. What does she hope for- to take us back to those dreadful days prior to 1/11? //////Afghan refugees were flowing over the border from a Pakistani battle zone yesterday after officials accused them of links with Taliban militants and ordered them out, police said. //////Former Pakistani premier Nawaz Sharif is willing to broker talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, his spokesman said yesterday, amid reports that Sharif is already playing a key role.//////Two powerful bombs exploded outside the Iraqi capital's tightly-guarded Green Zone yesterday as US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte was ending a visit focused on a controversial military pact.//////Kyrgyzstan yesterday dispatched helicopters to evacuate victims of a devastating earthquake that killed 75 people, including 41 children, in a remote mountain village near the Chinese border.//////Republican John McCain questioned Barack Obama's character, and the Democrat pressed his foe's alleged weakness on economic issues, as tempers escalated ahead of Tuesday's presidential debate.//////Thailand yesterday deployed troops to quell anti-govern-ment protests in Bangkok that left hundreds of people hurt as months of political turmoil boiled over into violence, officials said.//////Schools, businesses and government offices reopened yesterday and vehicles were back on the streets in Indian Kashmir as authorities lifted a two-day curfew in the troubled Himalayan region.//////Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said yesterday he still has enough support to topple the government and is deliberating over how to carry out his delayed plan to seize power.//////Sri Lanka's top opposition party called yesterday for an international investigation into a bomb attack the previous day that killed a popular former army general and 26 others.//////If the whole world could vote for US president, Democrat Barack Obama would win by a landslide, according to polls conducted in 17 countries by Reader's Digest magazine.//////A bitter campaign ahead of historic elections in the Maldives drew to a close yesterday, with a veteran Asian leader and a prominent dissident each confident of victory.//////China yesterday declined to release updated figures revealing how many children have been affected by the tainted milk scandal, as it attempted to boost confidence in its food safety standards.//////Afghan and international troops killed 60 militants in southern Afghanistan in a battle that erupted after a patrol came under attack from several directions, the US-led coalition said yesterday.//////Authorities in Malaysian Borneo have called on police to investigate reports that women and girls from the Penan tribe have been raped by workers from jungle logging camps.//////Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet approved an extension of German participation in the Nato-led force in Afghanistan yesterday and added 1,000 more soldiers to the mission, government sources said.//////Contrary to what the pundits and aficionados may argue, in the real world classics and masterpieces do have a shelf life. How do they retain immortality? Every few years or decade, it takes artists/ filmmakers/ litterateurs with empathy for the classics to give them a contemporary touch. If it was not the case, the language of the original Shakespeare plays would remain incomprehensible to the masses or classic jazz/ blues compositions would stay confined to museums and libraries. Putting a work of art on a pedestal often makes it unreachable; soon it becomes a niche genre -- perhaps not a fate the masters would have wanted for their creations.//////Culture and heritage reveal our identity and of the artists seeking to revive our folk and traditional work, Abdus Shakoor is one such artist. Over a large span of his career, Shakoor has been working on folk motifs and ancient ballads.

It is a mixture of spiritual sublimity and an enlivened sociability that gives it a multi-dimensional excellence. //////WHAT a few weeks it has been, banks and financial institutions in the US, and to a lesser degree around the globe, are falling like nine-pins. Suddenly, the whole global financial system looks shaky and crumbling. Nothing seems safe and banks, strangely but understandably, least of all. //////THE subprime-mortgage crisis laid bare America's decadence. The world's largest economy is rife with over-consumption of everything from McMansions to tchotchkes from Target, cursed by negative real savings rates and weighed down by debt that has spilled from Wall Street to Main Street. //////A Western journalist called me the other day to ask what Asians thought of Sarah Palin.//////
