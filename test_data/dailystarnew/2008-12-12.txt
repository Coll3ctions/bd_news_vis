Indeed, it is a proper and fitting response to the demands voiced in recent weeks and months by the political parties as well as members of civil society for a withdrawal of the state of emergency in the interest of a full and enthusiastic participation of all citizens in the electoral exercise. The decisions reflect the general expectation that political activities will be conducted in a peaceful and purposeful manner by all political parties. That will entail an observance of the electoral code of conduct in its letter and spirit by all parties and candidates. We are constrained to say, however, that there have been instances where intending nominees at the election have violated the code of conduct. That should not have happened and we hope such acts will not be repeated.//////SABINA'S one person-led sun cap factory has made it big -- from a scratch.

England's decision to return to India and get on with cricket, life and everything else is, on balance, difficult to argue against. Less difficult to argue against also is that the decision vividly illuminates the double standards of almost the entire cricket fraternity in dealing with India's neighbour Pakistan: that nobody much cares about touring Pakistan has rarely been more apparent.//////Australian cricket legend Shane Warne on Wednesday threw his support behind a musical stage show that presents a warts-and-all account of his controversy-laced career.//////Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar says it is "impossible" that India will tour Pakistan early next year due to strained political relations following the Mumbai attacks.//////Bangladeshi players Mohammad Imran Ali Elin lost in the sixth round of the Asian Junior Chess Cham-pionships in Chennai, India to local International Master P Karthikeyan yesterday.//////Mohali will stage the second Test between India and England, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said in a statement issued here Wednesday.//////Former England all-rounder Chris Lewis has been charged with attempting to smuggle cocaine with a street value of more than 200,000 pounds into Britain.//////Australian cricketers are wary of travelling to India for the second season of Indian Premier League (IPL) in April-May next year after the recent Mumbai terror attacks, according to a report.//////Arsenal slipped up in their bid to top their Champions League group on Wednesday as they went down to rivals FC Porto 2-0 in their final group match. //////Returning striker Didier Drogba hit the winner in Chelsea's 2-1 victory over Romanian team CFR Cluj on Tuesday to see last season's Champions League finalists safely through to the knockout stages. //////A Franck Ribery-inspired 3-2 victory at Lyon on Wednesday night shot Bayern Munich to the top of their Champions League group in rainy conditions in France. //////Brazilian star Ronaldo was set to put pen to paper on a deal to join Brazilian giants Corinthians, the club announced here Tuesday. //////Struggling Spanish champions Real Madrid fired coach Bernd Schuster on Tuesday and immediately replaced him with former Tottenham and Sevilla coach Juande Ramos. //////Local soybean production is on the rise, as the industries, mainly poultry feed makers and edible oil refiners, are strongly in need of the item, according to industry insiders.//////Grameenphone yesterday submitted the final prospectus of its initial public offering (IPO), largest in Bangladesh, to the stocks regulator to raise $65 million (Tk 449 crore) from the capital market.//////A multinational Swedish firm engaged in outsourcing home textiles and home furnishing items is planning to expand its operations in Bangladesh.//////The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said yesterday that growth in Asia's developing countries will slow to 5.8 percent next year, and regional governments must boost domestic demand to offset a deeper slowdown. //////At 35, Eguchi Shunjiro is Nokia's top designer.

The two ladies are now back again to the political arena and resumed their full activities targeting to bring their parties to power through the next general election. Some of the big fish from the major political parties probably will fail to participate in the election due to their conviction in corruption cases but most of the power aspirants are the old faces. So, there will be no qualitative change in politics and consequently in the expectations of the general people for a brighter future. Moreover, the reformist politicians are already in trouble and facing the risk of demise of their political careers.//////Are we only supposed to dream of a clean Dhaka city? I just want to point out the huge benefits a clean road can bring to us. It has both long and short-term results, at a very small cost. //////Those who broke the cultural artefacts thinking they are doing a service to Islam are wrong. According to Islam, a sculpture or statue is simply a piece of earthly material. A devotee of Allah should not be moved by such things. //////MB Naqvi very correctly identifies the real causes of Pakistan's woes and suggests the methods for combating the Taliban. His statement that Taliban are moved by an ideology and it cannot be defeated by guns because ideas cannot be killed by shooting in the head is very pertinent. But I am afraid that such ideological battle against Taliban cannot be won in Pakistan by the methods he proposed. Pakistan's very raisons d'tre is intolerance of all ideas outside religion. The national curricula from primary to tertiary level of education in Pakistan conveys the ideology of Islam only. Pakistan's official history in its textbooks describe the birth of Bangladesh as a vile conspiracy of Hindu India to exact revenge on Islamic Pakistan for the creation of the country in 1947 and Bangladesh in Pakistani public perception is still East Pakistan!! The madrassah education system in Pakistan is highly organized and developed and teaches Taliban ideology and produces its armed Jihadi battalions. The army is the self-proclaimed defender of Islam, Islamic culture and ideology in South Asia. The army actually owns the Pakistan state. The elected government in Pakistan has only outward trappings of power for exhibiting in media. Pakistan army's power lays in its guns, money and men. There are no secular social groups, civil society associations and political parties who represent the exploited illiterate people. The people are so thoroughly brainwashed that they are unable to develop a balanced view. The grip of the triumvirate mullahs, military and the punjabi-muhajir elites on society, culture, politics, economy and minds is so complete that any liberal-humanist education system based on secular worldview is unthinkable there. There are no intellectuals in Pakistan who can present a countervailing humanist ideology against the dogma proclaimed by the state. The most terrible aspect of this structure is the supremacy of ISI over every institution, organization of Pakistan and its tentacles have reached every corner of South Asia. All Jihadi organisations across the subcontinent were spawned by the ISI. And it has the support of Pentagon which nourishes it.//////Fareed Zakaria's article on terrorism in Bombay published in you pages on 2nd.December has its beginning that in my views can be linked to the American proxy war in Afghanistan to throw out the Russians. That was the start given to the Jehadists. About this Zakaria states, The Pakistan government has created, supported and financed Islamic Jehadists for decades. This is not totally correct. Zakeria, however, conveniently forgets that this was done with the full support and financing by the USA in the first place! It was these Jehadists who fought the proxy war for the USA; while Afghanistan was fully under control of the Russians. Godless communism was an excellent political motivation for the Jihadists that led to the birth of al-Qaida, a CIA misadventure that badly misfired against them!//////We are the teachers of non-government high schools. Near about 98% students of secondary level are studying here. But we are getting a very poor salary. When a teacher lives in a poor condition, then teaching properly in classroom becomes very difficult.//////December is here again. So will be the 16th of December. Our Victory Day. We have been celebrating Victory Day for the last 37 years. Yet we never felt like victorious in anyway. Instead we felt like vanquished with each passing year. And those, who were defeated on 16 December, 1971, smirk with arrogance and vengeance. With every passing year, these anti-liberation elements are multiplying like amoeba and slowly but steadily enwrapping our everyday lives and the way of our living. //////Hearty congratulations to Hillary Rodham Clinton on her appointment as the Secretary of State of the United States of America. I also appreciate President-elect Barack Obama for the appropriate selection of the Secretary of State for his cabinet. In my opinion, Hillary is one of the most competent women in the United States for appointment to such an important post. Meanwhile, I endorse Hillary Clinton's statement which she made recently saying America is a place founded on the idea that everyone should have the right to live up to his or her God-given potential, and it is that same ideal that must guide America's purpose in the world today. And while we are determined to defend our freedom and liberties at all costs we also reach out to the world again, seeking common cause and higher ground.//////What's wrong with the Election Commission? Why have they rejected FEMA? This is a recognised and experienced organisation having thousands of real volunteer-observers throughout the country. //////The Awami League declared that they would form a unity government if voted to power. //////Your two front page reports (Dec:06) by Liton & Hassan; and another from Natore only goes to expose the character of almost all of our politicians who sadly represent us! For them breaking the law of the land is as common as having a cup of tea. There capability is in bluffs, lies, exploitation and fooling the people, which appears to be their expertise!//////Terrorism, murder, assault, mysterious deaths, hijacking, black money, child and female trafficking, acid throwing, unfair means in exams, leakage of questions, drug business, toll-extortion, adulteration of medicine and foods etcetera are the symptoms of moral erosion. //////People of Bangladesh are going through a gripping month-- December 08. For, in this month, as always after 1971, we celebrate the victory over the occupation Pak army in Bangladesh through a concerted armed struggle with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the founding leader. We conceded huge loss to them, but won the freedom-- we emerged as an independent nation. We mourn the monumental loss, and celebrate our historical victory at the same time --- we pledge/vow or renew the spirit that went into ousting the illegal and the ugly from the land. //////Like millions of mothers, my mother also told me the tale of Siraj and his mother-wife-daughter in my boyhood, where Siraj was sketched as a hero and Clive as a villain. Siraj was defeated in the Battle of Plassey through a conspiracy. As a result, the English ruled this land for about 190 years. //////As much as I admire the new Pakistani civil government, I feel less optimistic about whether it can finally put the genie back into the bottle that its military had created in the name of national interest. The sixty years' Indo centric policy has resulted in nothing but a weak state with no purpose and aims. Paradoxically, it has become a victim of its own creation. //////US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte held talks with Pakistan's president yesterday as the government came under renewed pressure to crack down on militants blamed for the Mumbai attacks.//////India announced a massive overhaul of its security and intelligence agencies yesterday in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks that left 171 dead and provoked a public outcry over the government's response.//////Riots and looting erupted across Athens yesterday as the Greek government confronted a sixth day of violent protests over the police killing of a schoolboy.//////Indian's ruling Congress party has won elections in three out of the five states that released results on Monday including all three states that voted after the Mumbai terror attacks.//////A UN Security Council panel declared Wednesday that a Pakistan-based charity is a front group for the terrorist organisation blamed in the attacks on Mumbai that killed 171 people.//////At least 150 civilians were massacred in a Democratic Republic of Congo town last month, Human Rights Watch said in a report yesterday, which strongly criticised UN peacekeepers.//////US Special Forces killed six Afghan police and wounded 13 Wednesday in a case of mistaken identity by both sides after the police fired on the Americans during an operation against an insurgent commander.//////Pirates dodged foreign navies and hijacked another two boats even as an international conference here yesterday explored securing one of the world's busiest shipping routes off Somalia.//////His career in shreds, Illinois Gov Rod Blagojevich clung defiantly to power Wednesday, ignoring a call to step down from President-elect Barack Obama and a warning that Senate Democrats will not let him appoint a new senator from the state.//////At least 45 people were killed and 93 wounded in a suicide bomb attack on a restaurant near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk yesterday, the city's deputy police chief Torhane Yussef said.//////Nobel peace laureates opened a summit in Paris Thursday to draw world attention to the plight of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, but former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was forced to miss the gathering.//////North Korean nuclear disarmament talks collapsed here yesterday after failing to reach agreement on how to determine if the secretive nation had told the truth about its atomic programmes.//////Britain announced Wednesday it will withdraw all but a handful of its 4,000 soldiers from Iraq next year, ending a mission that was unpopular at home and failed to curb the rise of Iranian-backed Shia militias in the south.//////Police say the death toll after a speeding bus caught fire in northern India has risen to 63.//////Six decades after the United Nations endorsed the fundamental principles of our shared human rights, campaigners Wednesday demanded action to defend these values against the worst abuses.//////President-elect Barack Obama has chosen Nobel prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, a strong advocate of alternative and renewable energy research, to be his energy secretary, US media reported yesterday.//////Every year we eagerly await this festival called 'Wanna' which is a source of spiritual and mental rejuvenation, said Sister Minita of Jhaljhalia Mission in Haluaghat Upazila of the district.

Iran, by contrast, is close by and not going anywhere.
