With their fixed incomes unable to cope with ever rising prices of essential food items, it is now their bare savings which are under threat.

On Saturday, he beat his wife, poured kerosene over her body and set her on fire, following a family feud at about 11:00pm. She died on the spot, according to police and locals.//////News entitled Special drives in Ramadan against food adulteration in The Daily Star of 1st August drew my attention. This drive will continue during the whole month of Ramadan. That news indicates that our unethical and corrupt activities increase more during the holy month of Ramadan than the rest of the months of the year. In our country it is difficult to find out any food item or fruit which is free from chemical or other harmful elements. But as a Muslim nation such attitude is disgraceful for us. Islam teaches us to live in an honest way. In my opinion, social awareness is very urgent for peaceful living. No drive will eliminate adulteration in food and corruption in the society until and unless we follow the teachings of Islam and change our corrupt mindset. How many places will the law enforcing agencies or BSTI go to find out the dishonest businessmen? Only moral lesson can change our corrupt mindset. //////Poor media coverage on Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's 1st death anniversary surprised us. Only a few words from Dr. Akbar Ali Khan's speech, given in the memorial meeting held in Jatiya Press Club on 30th July 2011, were published in some dailies. But Mannan Bhuiyan was a veteran politician of this country who served as secretary general of BNP for 11 years. We know that BNP expelled him in September 2007, and is this the reason why our media did not cover this news?//////Crime is increasing in Bangladesh day by day, particularly in the capital. In Dhaka the most common types of crimes are hijacking and robbery. In the daily newspapers, every day we get several news of hijacking in the capital. It is very common news that the muggers snatch away money after stabbing the victim. //////I laugh at the Food and Disaster Management Minister's suggestion that the Election Commission should impose more restrictions on spending money by union council polls candidates on electioneering to curb misappropriation of money because it shrewdly bypasses their offenders. It is like admonishing the guardian for his son's offense. Actually what we have to do is to plug the loopholes of law and stem the corruption so that bad people cannot misappropriate government money. This year government gave two lac taka to our college but to draw that money we had to bribe the upazila officials and fight the student cadres at the college. So please do not beat about the bush, keep your golden children at bay and remove corruption from government offices which is one of the promises you made in the election manifesto. If that can be done, it will do wonder. //////At present the main problem of Bangladesh is obviously price hike. It is increasing day by day. As a result, middle class and lower class people are suffering most. During this holy Ramadan some greedy and selfish businessmen are increasing the price of the necessary commodities. I would like to draw the kind attention of the authorities for taking effective measures to control price hike so that general people can buy necessary commodities at a bearable rate. //////In the past, life was not burdened with so many problems. People used to go out, travel from one place to another in a care-free manner, feeling safe and secure. During journeys they used to make new friends, exchanged addresses and shared food and drinks. Nowadays we have to be always on guard, unable to trust unknown people because so many untoward incidents are happening. We have to warn our children to remain distanced from strangers and after the incident at Amin Bazar, we have to tell them not to go in groups anywhere. In former days, many school children, even some in class VI or VII used to go to school riding bicycles but now it is unthinkable because miscreants will hijack the cycle, killing or seriously injuring the child. The condition of our society is deteriorating fast. If nothing is done to improve it, the outcome will be disastrous. //////Thank you Daily Star for publishing a courageous and timely report, on illegal police boxes erected around the corners of our city, which bears the names of some business houses of the country, made to serve their business publicity in disguise (DS: 1.8.11). We, the city dwellers, are used to see that the traffic police even use the umbrellas with the names of some known infamous business houses, realtors or even manpower export agencies which bestow them some sort of legality or reliability.//////The government has decided, finally, to build a new international airport and the Prime Minister has directed the authorities concerned to report about the prospective sites to her within a week (DS: 2.8.11). It appears from the report that Sirajdikhan is about 18 km. away from the zero point while other places are very far except Arial Beel, where the government failed to convince people earlier and the PM personally negated to build the dream airport there in the end. Considering the physical location and proximity with the capital city, cost, time for commuting, passengers' convenience including the VVIPs (local and international) etc., we think the proposed new international airport should be established at Sirajdikhan. We would like to request the PM not to be happy with the sycophancy of some timeservers; rather she should be meticulous and take the public with her before investing thousands of crores of taka of our poor people.//////What I perceived having seen the current trends and development in the international political arena, there is no absolute code for relationship between nations and there is no postulate for keeping diplomatic communication. It's good, if it is really meant for greater good, international peace and security if the United States wishes to come closer to India and strengthen Indo-American relationship. Unfortunately Pakistan which was very closer to US's heart lost its position and became an alien to its best friend, America!//////I love the kitchen market. The rocketing prices have ensured I don't have to worry anymore about what I have to buy. Life is so much easier now. Besides, the increase has also given me something to think about when I am utterly bored. No matter how hard I try, I just cannot figure out the amazing percentage increase in the prices. It defies logic. I wonder how it can happen, but I don't have a clue. I feel proud to see some of my fellow countrymen trying their best to increase their profit from the kitchen market sale! At least someone will be happy this Eid! //////Recently I read a news in the daily Inqilab that a teacher of Dhanmondi Boys' School made some unpleasant comments about our beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Not only him, there are many people who satirize our beloved prophet (pbuh). The above mentioned daily is not subscribed by many, hence the news did not get due attention. Our prophet said a Muslim is not a Muslim until he/she loves Allah and His Messenger (pbuh) more than anything else, even more than his/her parents. Allah also says in Surah Tawba that if a person loves his family and friends more than Allah and His Messenger (pbuh), Allah tells him to wait for his destruction. From this we learn that if we do not love our prophet we are not Muslims. I request The Daily Star to report such incidents and I also urge the government to take strong initiatives against these unpleasant elements of the society.//////The question posed by Sir Frank Peters made us ponder. He said, What would happen if a hartal were announced in Bangladesh, but the media (television, radio and press) totally ignored it and would not give the announcement even a mention? That's a challenging and stimulating question that deserves serious consideration. The opposition usually holds a press conference before calling a hartal. If the media collectively refused to convey the message, it's doubtful if the hartal would even get off the ground. Hartal is most damaging to our economy and it is ruining our image abroad. What contribution is the media making towards mitigating the untold sufferings of innocent families who live from hand to mouth? Maybe the media should reconsider its role.//////Needless to say, Sonia Gandhi's recent visit to Bangladesh played a very significant role in terms of improvement of relationship between the two countries and regarding their mutual concerns. And when it comes to establishing peace in border areas of Bangladesh and India, this visit had a very important role to play. India is a friend of Bangladesh, so security of Bangladeshis should be their concern too. But what BSF is doing nowadays in border areas is not what a friend does.//////Emergency services yesterday restored order to a London district where rioters torched homes and looted shops as a protest at the fatal shooting of a local man by police turned violent, leading to 42 arrests.//////Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday promised change as he tried to ease growing anger over the cost of living after an unprecedented number of Israelis took part in nationwide protests.//////Myanmar's democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi is to make her first overtly political trip outside her home city since she was freed from house arrest, her spokesman said yesterday, defying authorities' warnings.//////Thailand's first female premier has already clinched a place in the history books, but she could struggle to survive a full term in office and end her country's cycle of instability, analysts say.//////Nato in Afghanistan said yesterday it was probing the Taliban's claim that they shot down a helicopter, killing 30 American troops, including special forces, who were targeting militants.//////Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh left hospital in Saudi Arabia yesterday, government and medical sources said, two months after suffering severe injuries in an assassination attempt at his palace compound in Sanaa.//////Rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas opened talks yesterday in Egypt aimed at implementing a reconciliation agreement struck in May, state news agency MENA reported.//////A hacker group on Saturday claimed it has "defaced and destroyed" websites at scores of US police agencies in retaliation for the arrest of suspected peers accused of hacking into the CIA, British crime agency SOCA, and Sony.//////Philippine President Benigno Aquino's secret meeting with the head of the country's main Muslim rebel group revived hopes for peace in the troubled south, an insurgent official said yesterday.//////Former Israeli president Moshe Katsav went before the Israeli Supreme Court yesterday to appeal his conviction and sentence for rape and sexual harassment, a justice ministry official said.//////Insurgents killed at least six people in a bomb attack on the home of a Shia family in a mainly Sunni town south of Baghdad yesterday, part of nationwide violence that left a total of eight dead.//////Eastern China yesterday braced for the arrival of Typhoon Muifa, with thousands of boats ordered to stay in ports after the storm left one person missing further down the coast.//////Sri Lanka's foreign ministry plans to protest to the United States after fighter jets intruded into the island's airspace last week, the local Sunday Times newspaper said.//////Nepal has banned smoking in public and threatens to punish repeat offenders with steep fines.//////Shahiduzzaman Selim is the embodiment of a gifted actor.

So far, these two issues have been kept separate, and Bangladesh is focusing on duty, fees, etc. while considering the transit issue. This is a wrong approach. Transit is a strategic issue. Bangladesh should aim at some strategic gain in exchange for transit. Bangladesh should offer a historic compromise of giving transit facilities to India in exchange for full flow of all shared rivers. //////Seven months into the Arab Spring, Israel's leaders are getting over their initial alarm and confusion about how to react, and have begun to embrace the region's new uncertainty. Increasingly, they see it as a diplomatic opportunity to affirm Israel's importance to its traditional friends. //////Many countries experienced unprecedented economic growth and a significant reduction of poverty over the past decades. With an average yearly growth rate of 10%, China was able to cut poverty by nearly three quarters since 1990. In Latin America and the Caribbean poverty fell by a quarter between 1995 and 2005. Globally, a one percentage point growth in income has been associated with a decline in poverty of about 2.4 percentage points. //////Replay of the January/February events, or exciting new phase?
