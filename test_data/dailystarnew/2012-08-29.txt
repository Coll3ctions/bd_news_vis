The interests of the nation are at stake here and we find ourselves back to square one. In the case of former Communication Minister Syed Abul Hossain, it was the refusal of the Prime Minister (PM) to remove him that led to the cancellation of the WB funding in the first place. The government failed to take constructive steps on WB's confidential memo and dilly dallied with anti-corruption investigation terming the evidence as lacking in credibility. It is ironic that Canadian authorities found the evidence credible enough to launch investigation against two former executives of a Canadian engineering firm and we didn't. The government made a farce of not accepting Abul Hossain's resignation by delaying its official acceptance. The whole matter turned the nation into a laughing stock on the international stage. All this is water under the bridge and we find ourselves in another situation.//////In a move to bring more professionalism and improve the standard of the country's first-class cricket, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) have brought one hundred and twenty first class cricketers under central contract.

Both sunrise and sunset can be watched from Kuakata sea beach. Kuakata attracts tourists for many reasons. But we have heard that Kuakata has become almost an inaccessible place due to bad road condition. Even a recent picture of Kalapara-Kuakata road, published in this daily, showed that there were sticky mud and potholes on the road, riskng vehicular movement seriously. In addition, some of my relatives who dared to visit Kuakata by road recently, advised us not to go there until the road is repaired. They also said that erosion of shoreline has become a problem for tourists.//////As a regular user of Facebook, I can say that there are as many disadvantages of using the online social networking sites as there are advantages. It is almost impossible to imagine life without Facebook these days. People spend a lot of time on Facebook to stay connected with their family members and friends. But the downside is that the users give more information about themselves on Facebook and there is no proven way to deter the hackers from stealing vital data from millions of Facebook accounts. Thus the users should always remain alert about what they are sharing on Facebook.//////Indeed, the incumbent education minister has taken a bold step to contain private tutoring. There was a time when teachers used to treat their students as their own sons and daughters, and they were not involved in private coaching. But now they are busy tutoring privately. Not just that, they often harass students in many ways if they do not take private coacjing from them. Thus, several thousands of poor students fail to make good results. //////I am surprised at the way educational institutions all over Bangladesh are degrading the noble profession of teaching. It's almost like a coordinated effort to establish the fact that anyone can be a teacher, provided the person has a Masters, preferably from abroad. Is that the only thing needed to be a teacher? I see my friends coming back from abroad with Masters and immediately getting a job at any of the private universities around the city. And I wonder, what happened to the need for experience to be a university teacher? How can someone become a university teacher with just a Masters? Doesn't that person need experience? Does a degree reflect the person's ability to teach? Then, every PhD holder would prove to be a brilliant teacher. When will these institutions sober and start employing 'actual' teachers instead of 'students' posed as teachers?//////I have been researching for a reply to Md Asimuzzaman's letter of July 20th. He complains that there are too many dogs in West Rampura, that people are afraid of them, that all dogs should be chained up or they are dangerous (!) and wants 'the authorities' to 'take effective measures'. //////In both South and North DCC, tons of garbage are stockpiled on many roads, lanes and by-lanes for days together. Sewages in drains overflow and important public thoroughfares are water-logged, posing a serious threat to public health.//////The daily local newspaper is an index of the state of affairs and happenings in Bangladesh. Scanning through the pages, it seems clear that violence and killings are the order of the day. As a retired person, every day I go through five English dailies; from cover to cover; and most of the news items from Bangladesh is either related to violence, criminal acts or killings! //////Condemnation of unilateral actions -- particularly sanctions on Iran and other nations -- and a demand for greater say in UN decision-making dominated talks in Tehran yesterday preparing for a Non-Aligned summit later this week.//////Pakistan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that growing confrontation over Iran's nuclear programme threatens further instability in the broader region.//////Sonia Gandhi, the president of India's ruling Congress party, yesterday upped the stakes in a six-day parliamentary stand-off that has paralysed government plans to revive the slowing economy.//////Myanmar has removed about 2,000 exiles from an immigration blacklist drawn up by the former junta to allow them to return home as part of political reforms, the authorities yesterday said.//////On the occasion of the 36th death anniversary of National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, Bangla Academy organised a discussion and a cultural programme at its Seminar Room on August 27.//////National poet Kazi Nazrul Islam's 36th death anniversary was observed at Tewta, the ancestral place of Nazrul's wife Promila Devi, under Shivalaya upazila in Manikganj on Sunday. //////As part of the ongoing Selim Al Deen Festival 2012, Dhaka Theatre staged the playwright's Dhaboman, at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, on August 27. //////One of the most popular Kolkata-based contemporary shows is 'Mirakkel Akkel Challenger', aired by Zee Bangla.

Outside the parameters of the soul, it is the spectacle of falling leaves which give September a distinctive symbolism that has translated itself into poetry over time. Indeed, W.H. Auden once gave us a poem, //////, that ensured a place in history for the month. In the soul, therefore, September comes in that vastness of history. There is a sweep about it, a reaching out as it were, into the human consciousness.//////The government headed by Dr. Manmohan Singh and Mrs. Sonia Gandhi has laid down its code of governance. You can sell a fertile womb at heavy discount as long as the child is still inside. This metaphor passes the test of common parlance: our natural resources, like coal, are the gift of Mother Nature. The Supreme Court has held that a natural resource is also a national resource. It is a property of the people, and government is only a temporary caretaker. It is duty-bound to maximise the returns to the people in case of any economic exploitation of natural resources.//////During his visit to Dhaka last September, Prime Minister Dr. Singh invited both former PM Begum Khaleda Zia, opposition leader in the parliament, and former president H.M. Ershad, currently the chairman of the country's third largest political party -- Jatiya Party -- in the Parliament. //////The fourth International Disaster and Risk Conference (IDRC) opened at Davos on August 26. The experts on risk and disaster have joined here with the aim of promoting "integrative risk management in a changing world." The Global Risk Forum (GRF) has very strategically identified its objective for this conference, i.e. finding out "pathways to a resilient society." Don't we find a gradual change in the standpoint which the international drivers in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction were concentrated on earlier?//////The sign of a truly great business is that it changes lives. There are few more noble examples than Muhammad Yunus's Grameen Bank, which has helped to drag millions of Bangladeshis out of desperate poverty since 1979. Organisations such as Grameen, and pioneers such as Muhammad Yunus, should be cherished in today's global economy where big business more than ever needs to be a force for good in the world.//////
