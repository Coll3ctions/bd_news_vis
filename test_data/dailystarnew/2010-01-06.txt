The Indo-Bangla Joint River Commission's secretary-level talks in Dhaka have resolved some issues but could not reach a consensus on sharing of the Teesta water.//////Industries grouped in seven zones will remain shut once a week from now on --each zone in turn--to help ease the acute gas supply crisis, Petrobangla sources said yesterday. //////What truly separates an Awami League government from others is its emphasis on agriculture and food self-sufficiency. This probably comes from the party's grassroots base, a totally committed minister like Matia Chowdhury and Sheikh Hasina's own personality. Sheikh Hasina naturally inclines towards the poor when formulating her own priorities. As in her first term, so also now, from day one Sheikh Hasina's government made food security and agricultural productivity its foremost priority. Starting from availability of agricultural credit, fertiliser, seeds and power for irrigation to ensuring a reasonable price for the farmers, the government deserves full credit for ensuring a healthy performance in this vital sector. One decision testifies to this priority as none else. When the rest of the country was reeling from load shedding, uninterrupted power was ensured for irrigation throughout the growing season.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said she would not invite trouble for the country by allowing militants and terrorists to use Bangladesh for carrying out terrorism in another country.//////The words Bismillah-Ar-Rahman-Ar-Rahim in the preamble to the constitution and declaration of Islam as state religion will remain as they are, since they reflect the beliefs of the people, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said yesterday. //////A multi-layer security system will be in place in and around Maurya Sheraton Hotel in New Delhi where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will stay during her three-day state visit to India.//////An inter-ministerial meeting yesterday formed a 17-member technical committee in the environment and forest ministry for preparing the draft policy on ship-breaking industry.//////Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) is going to launch a drive to remove the garbage including polythene from the bed of the Buriganga today.//////The High Court yesterday started hearing a 12-year-old writ petition that challenged the government move to sign production-sharing contracts (PSCs) with foreign gas and oil exploration companies.//////Sixty-two police and Rab members, including 16 policemen who were injured in the August 21 grenade attack, were decorated with 'Bangladesh Police Medal' and the President's Police Medal'.//////The Supreme Court (SC) yesterday scheduled January 18 for hearing two petitions seeking reinstatement of a stay order on the High Court (HC) verdict that had declared the fifth amendment to the country's constitution illegal. //////India were far more crafty and disciplined than Bangladesh the previous night and they also had a few more runs on the board. But all that failed to have a significant impact as Sri Lanka coasted to their second victory in successive days under lights at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday. //////The education ministry yesterday issued a warning regarding a false advertisement claiming to be recruiting 1,100 teachers and lecturers.//////The government will not allow real estate business by grabbing canals, rivers and wetlands, State Minister for Housing & Public Works Abdul Mannan Khan said yesterday. //////Andaleeve Rahman Partho, chief of Bangladesh Jaitya Party (BJP), a component of BNP-led alliance, must join the current parliamentary session for at least one day to save his membership.//////The dense fog and mild cold wave that have swept over most parts of the country for the last week are expected to start waning from today, said Met Office sources. ////// and Nielsen Bangladesh have jointly conducted an opinion poll on the performances of the government and the opposition in the last one year.//////A policeman shot himself dead while he along with his fellows was guarding the arsenal of Dinajpur Police Lines early yesterday. //////Senior police personnel yesterday proposed to the government formation of a separate environment police unit, conferring of the state award Swadhinata Padak on police personnel, and inclusion of police representatives in the steering committee for Police Reform Programme.//////Iran has banned its citizens from having contact with 60 organisations including the BBC, Human Rights Watch and opposition website Rahesabz as well as US-funded broadcasters, state media have reported.//////The US mission in Yemen reopened yesterday following a two-day closure as security fears prompted by al-Qaeda threats against Western targets in the impoverished country eased, the embassy said.//////THE coalition government of the 14-Party Alliance led by the AL has completed one year in office today. It's only natural that one would take stock of its performance, particularly because of the fact that the alliance government was voted to power with a huge majority. //////PAKISTAN remains in a state of siege from a number of quarters. In these past few weeks, conditions have deteriorated on essentially two fronts. On the one hand, the spate of bombings which has been a regular feature in various areas of the country in the last one year has continued, with explosions occurring on and off. The latest of these destructive occurrences have been the blasts at the Ashura procession in Karachi, which has left scores of people killed and hundreds injured. That the Pakistani authorities have so far been unable to identify or nab the perpetrators of the grisly incident and that people have been pointing fingers at one another demonstrates the sense of panic Pakistanis today happen to be going through.//////A year into the Awami League government, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ought to do better than act as petulant as ever. Its grandees, none of whom made us happy in their days of power and glory, are these days the very emblems of stubbornness. In politics, if not anywhere else, stubbornness does not pay. More to the point, being stubborn does not help political parties which have lost elections badly. In politics, being sore losers is almost always counter-productive. And yet that is not what the BNP appears ready to accept twelve months after it saw its hold on the electorate loosen dramatically, for all the right reasons.//////THE Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 lays down the protocol of diplomats as well as the protection of diplomatic missions. //////THE world is becoming smaller. We are all becoming interdependent more or less. Compartmentalisation no longer works. Bangladesh, a least developed and badly affected country due to global warming, particularly needs//////It was refreshing to watch the Bangladesh batsmen get off on the right foot in the first match of the Idea Cup tri-nation tournament against Sri Lanka at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Monday. There had been a lot of negative talk about the Tigers' batting in the recent past but it seemed that they have gained confidence after a successful 2009. There is, however, still a long way to go to match the character of the modern day's limited-overs game where almost no score is deemed safe. //////Kumar Sangakkara won the toss for the second successive occasion and in the end came up with big smile thanks to a blazing hundred by Thilan Samaraweera as the right-hander's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a five-wicket victory against India in the second match of the Idea Cup tri-nation tournament at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////Samir Omari fired the Citycell Bangladesh League's second hattrick to power Sheikh Russel KC to a convincing 4-1 win over visiting Chittagong Mohammedan in their fourth home match at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Sepoy Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////Australia's aura may have vanished over the past year but the players' self-confidence remains untainted, with Shane Watson insisting the team still has a chance of victory. Pakistan have controlled the second Test for three days and should level the series on Wednesday after the hosts scrambled to an 80-run lead by finishing at 286 for eight.//////The Sydney Cricket Ground museum has among its many artefacts the shirt Danish Kaneria wore during his seven-wicket haul against the Australians five years ago.

The ship breaking industry is not subject to any environmental laws or health and safety regulations for workers. The Chittagong ship-breaking yard is a highly polluted coastal belt of 20 km. The number of accidents and casualties at the yard is believed to be the highest in the region. Workers cut steel plates continuously without eye protection. They don't wear uniforms, protective gloves or boots.//////It is often said that Cox's Bazar has great potential to be a leading tourist destination for foreign visitors to Bangladesh. Recently some business contacts of mine, who are Europeans, visited the area but left with a sour taste in their mouth.//////Many of the challenges we face, from poverty to armed conflict, are linked to the effects of global warming and Climate Change. Now we are finding solution to the climate change problem. Some scientists are now warning that the sea level could rise by up by two meters by 2100. We must cut emissions of Green House Gases (GHGs) as well as carbon dioxide (CO2). According to the Kyoto Protocol (1997), the combination of Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous oxide, Hydro-fluorocarbons and Per-fluorocarbons sulfur hex fluoride is called Green House Gases (GHGs).The carbon dioxide accounts for more than sixty percent of total Green House Gases(GHGs) emissions.//////Many attempts, suggestions and speeches have been made at Copenhagen in order to decrease global warming around the world. It is a common issue today. The intellectuals from different corners of the world have interacted on the issue of changes going on in the world's atmosphere. My plain question is, are we all aware of these issues? I mean, why the nature changes, why temperature rises etc. It is due to globalisation, deforestation, urbanization etc. //////At last, the government has taken the right decision to go back to the previous time that is Bangladesh Standard time (BST), changing the controversial DST. BST was effective from 1st January. //////The news, with the headline "Fake Phensidyl factory in city busted", was published in the front page of your newspaper on 25 December, which drew my attention.//////A comment on the subject was published on the last day of the last year, which was a matter of shame. Hopefully, it was the energy adviser's last 'sin' of 2009! Illogically, however, one may say in his defence that as a conscientious energy adviser, he was conserving energy and saving fuel by taking a short cut by driving on the wrong traffic lane! Maybe, he was also saving valuable time, knowing fully well, that "time is money". //////Like many, I welcomed the change on January 11, 2007. In spite of lot of criticisms, I don't repent my support. One-eleven was not a political adventure of any ambitious army official, rather it was a reality stemming out of the political arrogance of the BNP reflected through unconstitutional moves of the then President Mr. Iajuddin Ahmed. Had there been no such change on that day the country could have remained in a state of constant political agitation. Hawa Bhaban style plundering coupled with complete politicisation of the administration could have put the state in total disarray. //////Yet another DS editorial today, 26th December, after the editorial last week on BNP's attendance in parliament. The DS is one of the most neutral dailies and we sincerely value its comments. I hope the chairperson of BNP and the party's top leaders will at least read the editorial, even if they do not agree with the paper.//////Smoking is a very bad habit. It is also dangerous for health, the environment and climate. Smoking causes cancer, heart attack, chronic bronchitis and some other fatal diseases. It damages brain and lungs. It also harms the nerves and sometimes spoils character. People addicted to smoking lose their appetite for food and energy for work.//////Drug addiction has now become one of the major problems of our society. Many youngsters, students are falling victim to this deadly menace. As a result, the future of these youngsters is ruined. They also shatter their parents' dreams. Once they take it, they are caught in the death trap. //////It is said that in a madhouse, sanity is the most hated behaviour. In this sense, Pakistan is essentially a madhouse where everyone is trying to out do each other in madness. The Taliban claim to be Muslims and yet they are slaughtering Pakistanis who are supposed to be Muslims as well. The Pakistan army is supposed to protect the people. And yet it is not capable or even unwilling to stop daily bombings by the Taliban as its eyes are fixed on fighting a war with India. But the greatest madness is that Pakistanis continue to blame India and America for the mass murders by the Taliban.//////Digital time that means daylight saving time (DST) which started on 19 June 2009 has given a new lease of life. This means office and business start and close earlier than they used to. The system was introduced to save electricity for the evening. So far, the government has not informed exactly how much benefit has been achieved by introducing the DST. So, the DST timetable since its inception spelt a lot of suffering for the ordinary people. //////BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia is continuously alerting the people about some conspiracies being hatched against the country. The latest alert came when she was addressing a delegation from the Christian community on the occasion of Christmas, the previous one was during the last Eid -ul-Azha. The occasions she had chosen are both holy and also of joy and celebrations , yet she did deliver a message of fear alongside the message of goodwill to the people.//////The government has failed to do justice to the POOR OLD pensioners.//////The Textbook, namely English For Today, meant for the HSC students contains 24 units. Each unit contains several lessons. At the end of each lesson there are some questions which require the students to work in'' pairs'' and ''groups''. In fact communicative method of language teaching requires the students and teachers to take part in such activities.//////The ACC must feel like fighting a monster in its effort to curb corruption. To kill this monster, all sane people should unite and make themselves a separate force, big enough to hem the monster round and force it to a trap placed by the ACC! //////Drug resistance is a familiar term to many of us. The drug resistant bacteria develop or acquire techniques to bypass the action of antibiotics. When the bacteria develop this protective mechanism against many antibiotics, they are generally termed as multi-drug resistant bacteria. But a certain type of bacteria usually doesn't have resistance mechanism against all available antibiotics, rather this mechanism is developed against most frequently used antibiotics.//////Electricity and fertiliser production is fully dependent on natural gas. But it is misused in different ways, especially in the fuel sector. The demand of electricity is increasing day by day.//////Our batsmen are still throwing away their wickets. The ODI against the Lankans was lost when they were four down for a measly 70 odd runs. Still, Ashraful tried to give it a respectable look.

At the very outset, we got the good news that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has decided to confer knighthood on Fazle Hasan Abed, the founder and Chairman of Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (Brac) for his outstanding contribution in "tackling poverty and empowering the poor" in Bangladesh and beyond. Earlier, Abed had received numerous awards for his exemplary contributions to social improvement. Notable among them are the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award, the UNDP Mahbub Ul Huq Award, and the inaugural Clinton Global Citizen award. //////AS we welcome 2010, we, as conscientious people, must ponder and ask how well we performed as a nation during 2009, which coincidentally began with the installation of this elected government with a massive mandate and ended with the completion of its one-year rule. Let us not forget that this AL-led government came to power amid high hopes of the people after the nation witnessed corruption and crime with state patronisation during the five-year rule of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government, and went through a two-year rule by the caretaker government headed by Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed. //////WHO is to blame for the COP15 summit disaster? The US? China? The EU? The G-8? In fact, all of the above. It was a coming together of states that killed off a vital resource for the world: Trust (Christian Schwagerl in Der Spiegel)."//////
