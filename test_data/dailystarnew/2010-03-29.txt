In these past few weeks, instances of murder have come upon us with a ferocity which boggles the mind. The killing of a middle-aged couple in Gulshan a few days ago by a young man enraged by their refusal to give their daughter in marriage to him is surely a new and macabre dimension to urban criminality.

The issues are a. trial of war criminals b. declaration of independence. On the issue (a) my question is, is it not a clear fact that millions of people were brutally killed and lost their dignity in the hands of the identified and self confessed killers who opposed the independence of Bangladesh physically with arms? Those who were born at least in the 60's clearly remember those dark days of our history. //////An interesting presentation on crossfire was heard from a photo journalist of international repute on Channel i talk show-- Ajker Sangbadpatra.

March is indeed very welcome news. But will it really happen? Engr. Fazlur Rahman's paper on the subject at the roundtable on 'Potential of Wind Power: Vision2021' on March 14 was a pragmatic and practical presentation of real issues on the subject.//////Majority of the population of our country live under poverty line and cannot meet the basic need like education due to their economic insolvency. Needless to say, education is a prime requisite for any kind of national development and progress. Reasonably, the incumbent government since its assumption of office is showing keen interest in educating the students with proper knowledge of morality, patriotism, communication technology, that the new national education policy serves. Due to emphasis on the sector, pass rate of the students in the SSC and the HSC examinations over the past years has significantly increased. Consequently, the number of students seeking admission for higher education in different universities and colleges is already higher than the prevailing admission capacity of universities and colleges and is increasing rapidly day by day. As the existing public universities accommodate only a small number from the massive number of admission seekers and many for lack of their economic solvency cannot afford the exorbitant costs of higher education in the private universities, it categorically paves the way for higher education of the richer section of society. //////As one of the inhabitants of a small district town of Bangladesh, Bogra, I have been experiencing for the past few days an acute power crisis.//////We came to know that the present government is going to impose a ban on the religion-based parties in the country.//////Sarat Chandra Chatterjee has remained immortal for his creative genius.

Her role in climate change dialogue, improving the economic and political relationship with India and China - the two big world's power-, defusing tensions with Myanmar and her government's persistent efforts to improve the infrastructure development such as road, gas and electricity in lifting economic condition of the country certainly deserves much appreciation. The schemes to improve the traffic congestion and rivers around Dhaka city, rehabilitating beggars through employment creation, curbing the politics of militants, trial of war criminals and a corruption free cabinet are some of the notable achievements of the present government. The county will grow and reach the level of middle-income countries sooner than expected if our governments continue performing like this. I would urge the people to support the government and give them the credit for their genuine efforts to improve the condition of Bangladesh, as everybody expects recognition of his or her good work. This should also be a lesson for others who are willing to lead the country in future as the true and patriot leaders act to improve the fate of common people, not of themselves. Also, no minister has the courage to engage in corruption if the leader does not endorse it. //////I am responding to Joost Kurstjens' letter of March 19. Fortunately, it seems there is nothing to worry about! I also was concerned about the fate of Gulshan Park but, upon inquiry, was told that a major cleaning is taking place.

The event was homage to Satyen Sen, founder of Udichi, on his 103rd birth anniversary (March 28). //////DHAKA, the old Moghul capital, has become a modern day disaster. The years of inefficiency and neglect on the part of successive administrations have truly turned this once peaceful, beautiful city into the "second-worst" liveable city in the world. I wonder what the city mayor, gazing at the Dhaka skyline from his imposing office, will make out of this dubious distinction Dhaka has earned.//////IF development is defined as a multidimensional process of change from a less desirable to a more socially desirable state, then orthodox and critical alternate perspective of development comes into play (Caroline Thomas and Melvyn Reader-1997). The orthodox view of development encourages the South to replicate more or less Walt Rostow's "Stages of Economic Development" while critical alternate perspective argue for a more holistic approach that would meet the physical, environmental and spiritual needs of human beings. //////TODAY is March 29, 2010 -- on this day last year the first session of the 9th Parliament adopted the Right to Information Bill. The precondition of basic democracy in a country is to ensure participation of the people in its development process. One of the core determinants of participatory democracy is that the government proactively recognises its people's right to information and takes measures to implement this right. //////PEOPLE may say a lot of things, but to me the main disadvantage of being a least developed country (LDC) is that no one really cares about whether we exist or not. I never would have said something like this if it were not for the results of the last conference on climate change. I am talking about the COP (Conference of Parties) 15 that took place in Copenhagen last year.//////WHICH is the bigger crime in politics, hypocrisy or stupidity? On careful consideration it must be the second, since hypocrisy is not merely useful but often necessary. Only a very foolish minister or member of parliament would tell his or her constituents that the petition scribbled on an untidy piece of paper is either meaningless or untenable. //////
