According to some estimates, the sector accounted for more than 99% of the exports, 93% of the employment, and 75%, 73% and 89% of the investment, fixed assets and value added, respectively, in 2004, against 26%, 71%, 29%, 66% and 44% respectively in 1980.

It has only gravitation and weak interactions. There are two types of dark matters: the hot dark matter (HDM) and the cold dark matter (CDM). Hot dark matter occurred during the earlier stage of the universe while the cold dark matter occurred later. Examples of cold dark matter may be neutron stars, black holes and brown dwarfs. These objects are not directly observables as they do not emit. But their presence can be detectable due to their strong gravitational effects on the surroundings.//////The mysterious Saharan Cheetah is an ultra-secretive elusive creature. A sub-species of cheetah, it is also known as the Northwest African cheetah. It was only back in 2009 that scientists from the Zoological Society of London were able to photograph one for the first time using a nighttime camera trap in the Algerian deserts. And very recently (December, 2010) scientists from the Saharan Conservation Fund (SCF) photographed the wild cat in the deserts of the Termit Massif, Niger. As these cats are very rare, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified them as critically endangered species. And naturally the image captured by the scientists from SCF has created a great enthusiasm among the conservationists as many believe that fewer than 10 of such cats survive in the harsh deserts of Termit, Niger. Experts also believe that the total number of Saharan Cheetah (scientific name Acinonyx jubatus hecki) is somewhere around 250.//////The discovery of a planet orbiting a dim dwarf star about 20 light-years from Earth has encouraged astronomers in their hunt for habitable, and maybe even inhabited, worlds elsewhere in the galaxy astronomers suspect that dozens of potentially habitable worlds will be discovered as the number of known exoplanets continues to climb.//////Most galaxies in the universe, including our own Milky Way, harbor super-massive black holes varying in mass from about one million to about 10 billion times the size of our sun.

This gas "infall" into massive black holes is believed to be the means by which black holes grow.//////Israeli archaeologists have discovered human remains dating from 400,000 years ago, challenging conventional wisdom that Homo sapiens originated in Africa, the leader of excavations in Israel said on Tuesday.//////Medical science is only beginning to understand the ways in which the mind influences the body.

It is one of the primary theories on peak oil. The theory is named after American geophysicist M. King Hubbert, who created a method of modeling the production curve given an assumed ultimate recovery volume.//////
