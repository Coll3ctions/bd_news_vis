This is a repeat of last edition's final last year in Colombo where Maldives came out on top beating India by a solitary goal to lift the coveted trophy for the first time. India will try to wrest back the title they won a maximum three times, but they start the match as underdogs having lost to the same opposition in a group match earlier. Their impressive 1-0 win against hosts Bangladesh in the semifinal will no doubt give them heart. On the other hand, Maldives are no short of confidence, as they have grown in stature throughout the tournament, and specially after thumping Sri Lanka 6-1 in the semifinal. Whatever happens, the football-lovers of South-Asia are in for a mouth-watering clash at the big bowl tonight. State-run BTV and satellite channel ESPN will telecast the match live from 7 pm.//////An international scientific effort has revealed the genetics behind Asia's diversity.//////The "crowd-sourced" data that comes from victims of natural disasters and conflicts is now a crucial part in disaster management, says a new report.//////British Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday telephoned Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and informed her that an adaptation fund has been formed to help Bangladesh and other most vulnerable countries to calamitous climate change caused by the global warming.//////THE government's decision to formulate a single-child policy for all families by the year 2015 has come rather late in the day. That the growth in population, which has been rather unbridled, would someday turn out to be a barrier to socio-economic progress should have been recognised much earlier. And, indeed, the kind of move that has now been made through the preparation of a draft policy on the issue ought to have been prioritised years ago in order for the country to have experienced some positive results by now. Obviously, the absence of a clear, well-defined policy on birth control has had grave ramifications. With the present population of Bangladesh being 150 million, one hardly needs any convincing reasons to comprehend the dilemma. Even so, the fact that the government has now looked reality in the eye and has moved to act is welcome.//////PEOPLE of Bangladesh are known to be resilient while facing up to yearly visitation of some form of natural calamity or the other. They are driven by a strong survival instinct to be fending for themselves. Though this is an inherent trait here, yet the kind of challenges that severe forms of climate change pose to their lives requires more than just resilience. It warrants ingenuity, improvisation and innovation on a scale never demanded before as it is today. //////OF late, there have been a number of meetings, workshops, seminars and symposiums on the very sensitive subject of security, both traditional and non-traditional, by concerned groups and institutions. The atmosphere of frankness and hitherto unobserved candour in such forums of interaction was a refreshing departure from the past. Such discussions brought together serving and retired practitioners of the security apparatus, prominent academics and other public leaders and experts under one roof for meaningful deliberations.//////A possibility exists that despite the struggle against the al-Qaeda in Afghanistan a day may come when the US will be faced with "Vietnam syndrome" (totally discounted by President Obama in his West Point speech on December 1 on grounds of legitimacy of the Afghan war given by the international community. Unlike Vietnam, the US is not facing a broad based insurgency, and unlike Vietnam Americans were viciously attacked in the US homeland from Afghanistan).//////I wrote a piece for //////, entitled "Extradition of the Fugitives" (October 28) summarising the processes needed to be followed in extraditing the fugitives from Canada.

New Zealand were trailing by 57 runs with only five wickets in hand, Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori were yet to settle in, Danish Kaneria was in hot form having run through the middle order and the second new ball wasn't far away. Either team could have grabbed the ascendancy. It was Vettori and McCullum who broke the shackles of the first two sessions with a combination of intelligence and exhilarating strokeplay, and seized control of the game.//////The fallout continues for Tiger Woods who says he will step away from the sport to try and fix the damage his infidelity has done to his relationship with his wife and family.//////England captain Andrew Strauss cruised to a century and Kevin Pietersen played himself into form on the first day of the touring team's two-day match against a South African Invitation XI at Buffalo Park on Friday.//////Simon Katich doesn't want to replace Ricky Ponting as captain and is happy supporting the current leader.

Early in the week USD soared buoyed by positive jobs data, with the US Nov job losses only at 11,000 compared with the forecast of 130,000. On Monday, the dollar index had hit a 5-week high. On Tuesday the euro took another massive hit after Fitch cut Greece's rating. Fitch Ratings cut Greece's debt rating to BBB+ from A- with a negative outlook, the first time in 10 years a major ratings agency has put Greece below an A grade, citing fiscal deterioration in the euro zone's weakest member. By Wednesday the euro had fallen to a one month low against the dollar as investors unwound positions in riskier assets ahead of the year end, prompted in part by rising debt woes for Greece and Dubai. Worries about Britain's fiscal health continued to pressure the sterling which had slid to an eight week low against the dollar. The euro dipped against further against the dollar on Thursday on concerns over the poor fiscal health of Greece and Spain highlighted by rating agencies in recent days. The Australian and New Zealand dollars jumped, however, on expectations of higher interest rates after strong Australian jobs data and as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand signalled rates there may go up sooner than thought. Standard & Poor's cut Spain's credit outlook to negative on Wednesday after Fitch had downgraded Greece's credit rating, sparking concerns about sovereign debt and highlighting the troubles facing some countries on the euro zone periphery. This could mark a switch from the recent trend for currency markets to trade on the basis of risk sentiment, where the euro tended to gain in tandem with perceived higher risk currencies such as the AUD.//////Iraq struck a deal with Russian energy giant Lukoil on Saturday to develop one of the world's biggest untapped oil fields as part of efforts by Baghdad to dramatically ramp up its crude output.//////US President Barack Obama has hit out at Wall Street "fat cats," expressing anger that banks bailed out by the government again plan huge bonuses as millions of Americans battle poverty and unemployment.//////The troubled Airbus A400M military transporter, which has overshot its development budget by billions of dollars, carried out its first test flight in Spain on Friday.//////Sri Lanka plans to offer three more blocks off the island's northwestern shores for oil exploration, the government said on Saturday.//////While parties were struggling to reach an agreement at the Bella Centre in central Copenhagen before the high-level segment of climate talks, environmental activists from across the globe staged demonstrations yesterday with a call for 'Climate Justice'. //////President Zillur Rahman yesterday laid emphasis on making advances in science and technology to reach out their fruits to the doorsteps of the common people to improve their living standards.//////Speakers at a roundtable yesterday said the government must make public the agenda of the prime minister's forthcoming visit to India to deal with issues of national interests effectively.//////LGRD and Cooperatives Minister Syed Ashraful Islam yesterday said a bill would be placed before the upcoming session of the parliament to bring amendments to the Upazila Parishad Act to make the local government body more powerful.//////Home Minister Sahara Khatun yesterday said there is no restriction on foreign devotees to attend Biswa Ijtema to be held on December 22-24.//////Twenty-two female freedom fighters from different districts were honoured for their bravery in the Liberation War in 1971.//////Participants at a discussion here yesterday called for efforts to detect breast cancer at an early curable stage by educating people about risk factors and through clinical and self-screening.//////Speakers at a seminar yesterday called on the government to give the citizens their rights.//////Rabid Action Battalion (Rab) Director General Hasan Mahmud Khandaker will leave for Muscat, Oman today to attend a three-seminar on south Asian security.//////Environmental activists denounced the uncertainty in making a just climate deal at the ongoing Copenhagen summit.//////Governance Advocacy Forum, a platform for 35 NGOs, yesterday demanded that the government formulate a comprehensive national decentralisation policy with a view to establishing an autonomous local government system, a press release said.//////Members of Rapid Action Battalion (Rab-3) recovered two walkie-talkie sets with DMP frequency and some other electronic goods from a house at Kamrangirchar in the city yesterday.//////The government will announce a development plan for four satellite towns within a week, each having 1,00,000 apartments, surrounding the capital. //////Three people, including two women, were killed in a road accident on Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway in Sadar upazila yesterday.//////Land grabbers and their musclemen looted paddy from six acres of land at Char Mothbaria under Baufal upazila yesterday morning. //////A freedom fighter (FF) was beaten to death in the town over a trifling matter on Friday. //////A huge human chain was formed at Laboni point of Cox's Bazar beach yesterday morning with the slogan "Save Cox's Bazar, save Bangladesh;

Colliding and capsizing of launches have become almost a regular feature in our river ways. As reported in the press, overcrowding was the main cause behind the accident. The launch MV Coco-4 was packed with around 2000 passengers on board which was almost three times the capacity!//////The environmentalists say 1.5cr people will be displaced in Bangladesh by 2050 because of climate change. //////I think time has come to say good-bye to our 'go abroad and earn your higher degree' kind of attitude. An attitude that has been so much glorified, from time immemorial, within our academic premise, and also has become part of our non-academic schemata. First, I would like to clarify that I am not discouraging the brilliant and persevere students who are working hard and are becoming successful to earn prestigious degrees from the different educational institutions of the west. But, what I am stressing at: is our patronising attitude that, if we want to earn a PhD or if we want to do an in-depth-research on any particular topic, then we must go abroad. There was a time when a few students from Bangladesh came abroad on different full-bright scholarships to do their degrees and they did that successfully. But, the reality of the present context is pretty harsh. There is hardly any scholarship available now for the international students; given that in the UK, there are three categories of students; Home, EU and International. While the first two categories are characterised similarly, the international students need to pay three times as much tuition fees as the others, and also the international students are not entitled to compete for the same scholarship schemes. And there is no exclusive scholarship available for being Bangladeshi students (there are some for particular countries). At the same time, living expenses are rising every day, and getting 'odd' kind of job is becoming difficult every day due to the recent economic downturn. At the same time, juggling between intellectual commitment and working as a manual labourer often poses a challenge which, not surprisingly, can distract a student's real intention. //////Engr. Ahmed's comments on the matter published in your letters column on 2 December are justified; particularly for conventional nuclear power plants, using U-236 as the reactor fuel! The critical issue for these power plants, using Uranium-236 as the nuclear reactor fuel is the reactor operating temperature; control of which is critical for such reactors! U-236 is a dangerous radioactive material and any abnormality, on reactor cooling, could lead to runaway nuclear chain reaction catastrophe, which happened in the conventional U-236 fuelled nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, USSR. Additionally, there is also the constant danger of containing the radioactive contamination within acceptable levels!//////Eid is a festival of joy. Throughout a year, a person waits for this day. As soon as he gets the holiday, he wants to go home. The same thing happens every year. Naturally, a safe mode of communication is essential. //////A two-day film fair, 'Mini INPUT Dhaka 2009', has showcased a number of the finest of public television programmes all over the world in Dhaka, screened documentaries as well as dramas at the Goethe-Institute from Dec 2-3, 2009 INPUT. It stands for International Public Television. It is the leading public television organisation in the world. //////I would like to congratulate the Education Minister, Mr. Nurul Islam Nahid, for successfully introducing and completing the Primary Level Exams. This was no small feat that was completed in record time. This is proof that the government ministries can perform, can complete tasks if the Minister in Charge takes a proactive interest and acts as a catalyst for change by providing Transformational Leadership. Through his leadership the Minister convinced all the stakeholders such as the parents, the teachers and the students on the necessity of an exam at the primary level. He created interest among all and the opposition propaganda against the exam was just washed away. Therefore other ministers should not give lame excuses that things are not possible because of the incompetent bureaucracy. Yes, the bureaucracy is incompetent, but it's the only one we have. We cannot import the bureaucracy from Japan or Singapore. The success of the minister lies in doing the job with whatever he has. If things are not moving in other ministries, it's because the concerned Minister is content to command from staying inside his AC room enjoying all the perks and privileges. The government has only four years left of its tenure. So far none of the projects such as elevated expressway, underground subway/monorail/power sector/improvement in traffic situation etc. promised have even been inaugurated. There is hardly any time to implement its election pledges to the people. The BNP is waiting anxiously for the government to fail!//////Wining a much expected victory in the presidential election Barack Obama took his oath in January and became the 44th president of the USA. After about eight months of presidency he won his second victory when he was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. Obama accepted the prize on December 10. The Nobel committee picked Obama, who was inaugurated less than two weeks before the February 1 nomination deadline. The committee did not select Obama observing his activities as President. They selected him considering his presidential pledge. Now we can see the differences between Obama's pledges and his activities. During his campaign for the presidency, Barack Obama advocated a phased redeployment of troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan. But recently Obama has ordered 30,000 more US troops into Afghanistan. He also says the United States will begin withdrawing its forces by 2011. But we cannot see any sign of withdrawal. Though Obama advocates for peace, but we are observing a stalemate in the Middle East peace process. Even Obama rejects UN-sponsored Goldstone report which accused both Israel and Palestinian armed groups of committing violations of international humanitarian law during the war of Gaza. These activities imply that Obama did not deserve a Nobel Peace Prize. For me, I do not believe that Obama is worth this Noble Peace Prize. It is just not a right time for him to get this important award, it is way too early.//////We came across to learn from media report that prior to Copenhagen Summit on Climate Change, some of the Heads of State of the South East Asian countries are holding the Cabinet Meeting at places where the effect of the curse of greenhouse gas emission is predominantly high. This is unique both in the sense that it is creating global awareness as well as our right to protest and to protect our right to live.//////When 80,000 (later increased to 120,000) Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan to stop the fanatical Mujaheedins from toppling the pro-Moscow regime in Kabul, they took up the combat and didn't equip and train the Afghan army. The Soviet commanders were supremely confident that they could do the job themselves. The Soviet Union was a formidable superpower and the Soviet forces were backed up by fighter-bombers, helicopter-gunships and tanks and spearheaded by mechanised infantry divisions in full combat gear. Rag-tag Mujahedins had little apparent chance against such a military machine.//////It was the day after Eid, Sunday, 29 November 2009. With a few places to go to with my two children and wife in such an evening, I opted for the Wonderland Park in Gulshan in my neighbourhood. We found our way into the over-crowded amusement centre with a ticket of Tk 100 each which included 'Entry+All Rides'. Thrillrider, 3D Zoo, Water coaster and Coin Games were kept out of the Eid Package. We queued for the Merry-Go-Round ride but the line was unbelievably long. Discovering that the Bumper Car queue was much shorter, we went over and joined it. Before it was our turn, we got to know that we would have to pay the regular price, though the ticket clearly said it was not excluded from the package. We had to miss the turn, buy the tickets and queue up again. I asked the attendant about the matter but he advised me to talk to the authorities. The joke of it was that all the popular rides were kept out of the offer and many people had to wait for two hours just for a Merry-Go-Round ride. Spending almost a couple of hours, we managed a 3D ride and a Bumper car ride, paying the regular charges for both. //////All English medium schools are following the rules of British Council and students are also concentrating on that. A time comes, after completing their O' level and A' level, when the students have to migrate to foreign countries for achieving higher degrees. But every student is not capable of going abroad for having higher degrees. Because they do not have enough source of money. They cannot afford these expenses. Because of this reason many brilliant students cannot obtain higher degrees.//////It came from newspaper reports that a celebrated Indian minister travelled in the economy class of the plane while on official visits. The present Congress chairperson also did the same thing. Then came the news of a young MP who travelled in the general class of the train. When fellow passengers discovered him beside them they became overwhelmed and commented, is not he our leader Rahul Gandhi? Yes, he did what is expected from dedicated true leaders of the people.//////The writer of this letter while visiting a food shop in the Rifle Square detected some anomalies in the price of the food items compared to the previous prices.//////The Daily Star and the mobile phone company Aktel have taken programme entitled 'English in Schools' for popularising the English language among the students of secondary schools at the district and upazila levels.

Riepe Company performed in Dhaka on December 10. Goethe-Institut Bangladesh invited the group to perform in Dhaka, according to a press release. The performance was held at National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. The five-part performance series, titled "Love, Death and the Devil", is Dsseldorf-based choreographer Ben J. Riepe's latest work. The production is characterised by a synthesis of precise choreographic management of time, movement, space and context on the one hand, and the individual improvisation of all involved artistes on the other. Powerful images and baroque costumes are other highlights.

We regret this inadvertent error. //////AS we celebrate the 38th anniversary of our victory over the repressive powers of Pakistan we need to pay homage to those countless souls who laid down their lives in giving us this day. The 1971 War of Liberation was fought on several fronts by people from all walks of life. While the main war is largely known by the battles fought by our brave freedom fighters both inside and outside our borders, much of our success came from the resistance and random acts of bravery by people in all nooks and corners of our country. //////THE presidential election in the South Asian island state of Sri Lanka, scheduled for January 26, is expected to witness tough contest between the two top candidates.

But what are the dynamics that have facilitated such a large outflow of migrant workers from Bangladesh to all over the world? In fact, such outward migration is significantly facilitated by the dynamics of globalisation, and has turned into an "invisible export" from Bangladesh that brings billions of dollars to the Bangladesh economy in the form of remittances. //////
