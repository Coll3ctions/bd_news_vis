This is because everyone wants to end corruption but not end it completely. And so the BJP would like honesty everywhere, with a little margin for mine-diggers in Karnataka. The Congress wants a clean India down to every well in every village, but not so pure that it cannot feed the venal thirst of ministers or its holy cows -- and these days the herd includes a holy bull.

Eid-ul-fitr, one of the two main festivals in the Islamic calendar, brings joy and happiness together with a glorious opportunity to "return to normalcy" for Muslims all over the world. It was Eid-ul-fitr and yet the great Caliph Omar bin Khattab (RA) -- the man whose walking stick, in the words of Emerson, "struck more terror into those who saw it than another man's sword" -- was weeping and trembling like a lamb ready for slaughter. //////We, generally, get a picture of pathogens and disease causing microorganisms in mind when we think of bacteria. However, many of them are also beneficial to humans. In fact, our body harbours a large number of bacteria on our skin and inside our gut. We call them commensals. They are useful bacteria that probably became associated with us in course of evolution. But those bacteria, which are not commensals, may also benefit humans by preventing diseases carried by insect. Recently, scientists have shown a way to prevent and, possibly, to eradicate dengue fever with the aid of a bacterium Wolbachia. In two papers published recently in Nature, Australian researchers showed how female mosquitoes infected with the Wolbachia bacteria transmitted the bug to their offspring with ease, making them all dengue free and hence unable to spread the virus in humans. The scientists claimed they have discovered a cheap and effective method of preventing the transmission of dengue fever. Until now, pesticides are being used to kill mosquitoes carrying particular types of viruses inside them but those contribute to only increasing the resistance of the mosquitoes to these chemicals. However, the newly discovered method gave rise to dengue- virus-resistant mosquitoes and they can be released in the wild to spread their population making the mosquito population of a particular region homogenous for the dengue resistant ones. //////Most bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics such as penicillin, discovered decades ago. However, such drugs are useless against viral infections, including influenza, the common cold, and deadly hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola.//////Increasing global population, ongoing urbanisation, and humanity's growing dependence on science and technology are leading to a sharp increase in the demand for energy. Fossil fuels, being the core source, account for 75 - 80% of today's global energy use and three quarters of humanity's total carbon dioxide emissions. The consequences of the emissions-- a global temperature rise and natural calamities leading to catastrophes. Millions of dollars are spent on research to surmount this change, either through efficiency improvement, fuel switch or the use of renewable energy. But with oil, coal and gas to remain the primary sources of energy for decades to come, besides renewable energy sources, a technology is to be thought of that strikes the balance between economic development and environmental sustainability. One such technology is Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS). What's striking about CCS technology is that it isolates CO2 from the atmosphere by providing long term storage options that are economically feasible and environmentally acceptable.//////The European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope has taken a striking image of a beautiful yet peculiar pair of galaxies nicknamed The Eyes.

This picture is the first to come out of ESO's Cosmic Gems programme, an initiative in which ESO has granted dedicated observing time for outreach purposes.//////Well, more than 1,500 specks, most less than 50 millionths of a meter in diameter.

Now, scientists have decoded the particles and read in them a tale of the asteroid's history, a story that spans billions of years, from the asteroid's birth to its future demise.//////LightSail, designed by the Planetary Society, measures 5.6 meters on each side.
