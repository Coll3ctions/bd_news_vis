For Muslims the occasion should not be confined to the ritual of sacrificing animals only. It is essential to understand the true spirit behind the religious practice that commenced with Allah putting Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) to a most difficult trial, to test the depth of his love for, and faith in, the Almighty, by calling upon Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) to sacrifice his most beloved possession. Not only did the Prophet Ibrahim readily surrender to the will of the Almighty, Ismail, his son, also readily agreed. And the rest is known to all of us.//////THE business leaders of the country have identified some important goals for the next government's consideration in order that Bangladesh can become a middle-income country. Towards attaining the 8 percent growth target the elected government will have to overcome the power crisis with greater acumen, take steps to increase private sector investment, encourage foreign direct investment and strategise effective branding of Bangladesh. The clarion call came from a seminar titled Maximising Growth for Bangladesh: A Private Sector Vision, organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) in the city. Eminent economist Wahiduddin Mahmud made it known that Bangladesh is the only nation in South Asia, which maintained 5 percent GDP growth rate in five successive years, despite some major obstacles. //////IF you have asked me last week who, if any, is my role model, I would have emphatically said none.

Will there be any change in their attitudes, mind-set and smelly practices? I wonder! It will be only more of the same; and as we say "Old wine in old bottles" with nothing new to write home about.//////The mindless carnage of 26th November in Mumbai has immensely angered the Indian government, people and also us all. We all condemn the terrible act in the strongest possible terms. The Indian government needs to devise means to combat terrorism in its own soil and safeguard its populace, and prevent its escalation in other Asian countries. A pertinent question arises- why does it keep on happening? India experienced terrorist attack in 2003 and then it kept on repeating. Early finger pointing at Pakistan or Bangladesh or Nepal will not help solve the problem, rather it will alienate them and the situation will turn more difficult. //////Re: Op-Ed: "This fire needs to be put out," by Fareed Zakaria (Dec. 2).//////I am a non-resident Bangladeshi living in Canada, working as Software Engineer. Recently RAJUK invited applications for plot allocation in Uttara and Purbachal. They have given the opportunity for expatriates also, but the time is so short that it is almost impossible to collect all those papers . They asked to scan and email all the papers, I am sure most of the people will have problem to do that because that will be a huge file to email, there will be the bandwidth issue which RAJUK never considered.//////I watched with horror how some Indian media tried to implicate Bangladesh in the Mumbai terror attack. MSNBC cable TV of USA was feeding from NDTV of India and it was reporting on the very second day that 29 Pakistani and 11 Bangladeshis were in the terror group! MSNBC, I'm sure, was sucked into NDTV's agenda driven, unsubstantiated, innuendo based news. NDTV dished out anti Bangladesh propaganda to US viewers with the help of MSNBC. //////Bangladesh railway is doing a great job from its introduction. It's one of the most comfortable and secure mode of transportations since the British period. Commuters of our country feel comfortable to make their journey by train because of reasonable prices of tickets. We usually see the long lines of commuters in front of railway stations. //////Due to changes in the Immigration and Refugees Protection Act (IRPA), Federal skilled workers' applications received on or after February 27, 2008 will now be assessed for eligibility according to a set of instructions issued by the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, Canada. //////The PSC has introduced a new method in the 28th BCS exams. Well, basically a change is for betterment. But the change in BCS exams is a suicidal one-- deduction of 0.5 marks for each wrong answer. Has PSC been highly inspired by the caretaker government's mission against corruption? The drastic decision taken by the PSC can destroy all dreams & hopes of BCS candidates. The PSC should reconsider the decision. //////Needless, to say that the visit of U.S. Senator John McCain, carried much importance. After the Mumbai massacre, the arrival of McCain added a new dimension to the oriental politics. //////The BNP has flouted the provision of the RPO (in nominating their candidates for the parliamentary polls) which required grassroots leaders to send panels of candidates and then only would the parliamentary board select candidates from that list. The BNPPB has instead unilaterally nominated candidates. To make matters worse they have nominated people with dubious backgrounds, accused criminals (an Aug 21st grenade accused has also got nomination!) and convicted persons. The recent HC verdict barring EPR convicts from polls has been a positive decision and hopefully this will keep away some of the notorious persons. While the AL has followed the grassroots' recommendations (though in some cases they have not), their alliance with the former military dictator H.M.Ershad is a sign of AL's "win at any cost" mentality. Ershad, it appears is keen to get the post of president (as a part of a deal with AL) to lead the last days of his life "respectably."//////Our whole education system is completely enveloped by an invisible curtain namely "Private tuition" which is absolutely responsible for producing the unemployed educated (!) groups. Private tuition is now a better job than teaching in any reputed school or college or university. Most of the teachers are highly interested to serve as an expert "private tutor" rather than a skilled teacher in any educational institution. For this reason, the students who are regular in their academic classes are being deprived. Moreover, they, the private students, achieve good results through those teachers who taught them in private and the students who did not join the private classes get poor marks in that subject. This is not an ideal situation.//////Words are insufficient to condemn the terror attack in Mumbai. //////It's really nice to hear that the Election Commission (EC) plans to organise electoral debates on crucial issues before the December elections. It would be really good to get academics and thinkers to ask the political leaders detailed questions on their plans to turn Bangladesh around and also on their visions for the country. //////The news story entitled "Dhaka [BCS] exams row sparks violence" on BBC website (Tuesday, 2 December 2008) does not seem to meet the usual BBC standard of neutrality and fairness.//////"Pakistan rallies support as tension with India rises" was news headlines of some dailies after a couple of days of the Mumbai terror attack. Myself and rest of the Bangladeshis would like to see which country supports the terrorist nation if there is a fourth war between Pakistan and India. //////After terror attacks in Mumbai, the Indian Home Minister resigned as he thought he had failed to do his duty properly for the security of India.

All the Bangladeshi channels are offering a surfeit of entertainment ranging from special TV plays, telefilms, musical shows to magazine programmes. Whatever the medium, there's likely to be something for everyone. A rundown of the Eid-special programmes on different channels://////EID-ul-Azha brings an opportunity to receive Allah's mercy and reward through sacrifice and patience. Popularly known as Bakrid, it is celebrated on the tenth of Dhul-Hijja through sacrifices and prayers in memory of the glorious sacrifice of the Prophets Ibrahim and Ismail (peace be upon them), and shows the way in which both father and son cheerfully offered to suffer any self-sacrifice, however painful or difficult, in order to obey the Allah's command. Although the world "Eid" in Arabic means "joy," Eid-ul-Azha is certainly not an occasion for unbridled fun and frolic, not an opportunity for immoderate gluttony or gourmandism, but is a solemn, sacred festival which enables a person to enjoy through Azha -- sacrifice and surrender, resignation and renunciation, selflessness and total submission to the will of God. //////IN our last two pieces (published in these pages on Dec 4 and Dec 7), we focused on centres with incredibly high voter turnout. While the high turnouts point to irregularities, significantly low voter turnouts may also be problematic, particularly in the context of alleged deprivation of minority groups from casting their votes. This is the focus of the current piece. //////Election 2008 will be an unprecedented one as it is going to be held in a completely different context, because the failure of the immediate past CG headed by Prof. Iajuddin Ahmed in resolving political crisis brought in the incumbent government on January 11, 2007. //////BUYER, beware.
