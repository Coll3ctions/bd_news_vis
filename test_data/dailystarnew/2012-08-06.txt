Such lament comes from confusion. News is not synonymous with politics. It is simply new information about anything we are interested in; and the reasonable fact is that people are more interested in what makes them happy, from fashion to fiction, than the depressing snarls of politics. But there is always a political story which bridges these compartments, since it is intrinsically amusing. All you have to do is pause and think.

Cost being the main factor, compromises are made in quality of the panels, charge controllers, and number of batteries needed to supply the required AH to support the prescribed load. In addition to that, the power factor of the loads is not taken into consideration. These days, the major portion of the off-grid AC loads are CFL bulbs, which are not known for good PF. Samples from major brands were collected from Bangladesh market and tested. And a shocking fact was discovered. The on-grid system directly injects AC current by inverting (synchronised) Solar DCV directly into the home AC outlets through which it becomes a part of the power grid systems without relying on battery and the household load. //////
