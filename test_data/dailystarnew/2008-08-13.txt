The determined manner in which Russian forces have pounded away at Georgian positions in and around the breakaway republic of Ossetia have resulted not only in a serious loss of innocent lives but also in huge damage to Georgian infrastructure. Not even the capital Tbilisi has been spared; and despite the brave claims by the Georgian authorities that they have been inflicting blows on the Russians, the bigger truth is that Moscow's superior firepower may now have caused a situation where Georgia could collapse unless a cessation of hostilities comes about soon.//////THESE days you will hear much talk going around of why politics must not come into things local.

Only to survive as a nation, we have to fight a lot. There are many challenges before us. Such as, new economic and cultural colonialism, natural calamities, environmental changes and so on.

A woman was allegedly burnt by her (educated!) husband. //////Barisal, the Venice of Bengal , had some mysterious anecdotes since long. But now the city mayor's election under strict emergency rule made Barisal even more vulnerable to mysterious happenings. When we were getting bored watching the one sided election results on the night following 4 August, Barisal came with the unusual jerk, so desperately needed to break the boredom. Brushing aside all the predictions, a candidate supported by a newly formed and recently divided King's party came to limelight marginally following the main candidate. Fortunately, I am married to a not-so-mysterious Barisal woman, who has a lot of politically informed relatives. I used my mobile phone to know about the whole drama. The end of the drama became tragic for the surprise candidate. We could see on television the helpless face of the returning officer declaring the number of votes polled by different candidates but he refrained from declaring the highest vote gatherer as winner. //////Yes, I agree that ZIA airport is not up to the standards of any modern airport in our neighbouring areas like Bangkok, Singapore or the Middle Eastern countries. We do need an upgrade to improve the image and make it a more attractive place for all tourists and foreigners who come to Bangladesh for whatever purpose. But, being a less endowed nation than those other countries, Bangladesh is still cash strapped to be able to compete. Perhaps it will happen but may be not when we all want. I do agree that building another airport from scratch may not be a good idea since that will be so much more expensive. I don't see that sort of a quantum leap in people coming in/leaving that necessitates such a radical plan at this point of time. Again, may be in the future.//////It was a real wonder to watch the gala opening of the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing. The theme and the performances are so real that one could get lost easily in the rich history of China. The National Geographic Channel has shown a documentary on the fantastic efforts of the people of China and the technological support of the engineering genius of the western world in completing the main Olympic Stadium and other complexes well in time to stage such an unforgettable opening show. This is a perfect mixture of human ingenuity, science and technology and above all the will and effort of the Chinese people and the government to show what they can achieve.//////"Bangladesh is a nation of 150m people; the biggest nation never to have won an Olympic medal. (BBC commentary on Beijing Olympics opening ceremony team parade, Fri. 08.08.08). Why? This year we have just six participants. It is good to be represented in Beijing and heartening to see our distinguished flag flying - but we need to win. //////In the recent local election the caretaker govt. tried their best to attract as many educated candidates as they could but admitted their inability to do more than what they did since at the end of the day it is the educated person's decision whether he would run the election or not. We saw so many candidates who didn't even finish high school but ran for Mayoral Election. Now the question arises whether the govt. has failed to attract the educated class into politics or the educated class failed the country to lead? My answer to this query is somewhat in the middle. //////The rivers around Dhaka are getting dangerously polluted day by day. Pollution creates pungent odour and turbidity increase.//////The viva voce of the 27th BCS exams has recently been completed and the result will be published soon. A few days back a report carrying the news of vacant posts of the cadre service was published in DS. There has not been any recruitment in the cadre service, though almost three (03) years have passed after the circular of the 27th BCS was issued. On the other hand, there is shortage of manpower in the administration that creates problems in many sectors of the administration. Many can argue that if large scale recruitment is completed the quality will go down, but I don't believe that. All the candidates are from different universities. I'd like to give an example. In the 27th BCS a total 16,000 candidates participated and if 750 of them are declared qualified in the general cadre the quality will not go down. Recently, the Judicial Service Commission appointed 394 Assistant Judges.//////Tata recently withdrew its $3b investment proposal after the Bangladesh government failed to give any commitment on gas supply. The FBCCI and some economists commented that it would have a negative impact on foreign investment in the country in future.//////The Gulshan Lake has a nice walkway on its western bank, and every morning a lot of residents including many women from Gulshan, Badda and nearby areas take their morning walk. Unfortunately, the bank of the lake is sullied by refuse and garbage being dumped there; mostly by the residents of the flats and houses bordering the western lakeside. Possibly the same thing happens in the eastern side of the lake too, but there is no walkway. I have seen garbage being brought from Badda and dumped on the north-west corner of the walkway into the lake. I have pointed it to the police in their camp right opposite this corner; but they couldn't care less. Possibly they too dump the refuse from their camp, into the lake! Despite many complaints to the Gulshan municipality, they do nothing about it. Is it not a part of their conservancy function?//////A roadside bomb hit a Pakistan air force truck in a northwestern city yesterday, killing as many as 14 people including a 5-year-old girl, as the military pounded insurgent positions in a nearby tribal region. //////Indian security forces shot dead at least 11 Muslim demonstrators in Kashmir yesterday amid a wave of anger against New Delhi's control over the disputed region, officials said.//////Afghan senators demanded yesterday that international troops operating in Afghanistan be brought under the country's law to make them accountable for mounting civilian casualties.//////India abhors the "political vacuum" in Pakistan created by the tussle between President Pervez Musharraf and the Pakistan People's Party-led ruling coalition, says National Security Adviser MK Narayanan.//////Aid agencies mobilised yesterday to help an estimated 100,000 Georgians displaced by the fighting, as foreigners evacuated from the country flew into Paris with tales of the devastation.//////Ousted Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra's retreat into exile marks a dark day in his turbulent political career, analysts say, but could be a chance for his allies and enemies to heal rifts in society.//////The United Nations has begun airlifting food to the southern Philippines to try to avert a major humanitarian crisis as thousands flee fighting between Muslim rebels and troops, officials said yesterday.//////Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has offered a peace plan giving the Palestinians 93 percent of the occupied West Bank, an Israeli newspaper said on Tuesday.//////A senior American official lobbying for an expeditious approval of the Indo-US civil nuclear deal has held out the prospect of finding an "easy agreement" with the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), but said it could take "another" meeting after August to finalise the waiver for India.//////Pakistani forces killed an Arab al-Qaeda militant in an air strike on a hideout in a tribal region bordering Afghanistan and are working to identify him, officials said yesterday.//////Ratko Mladic, the former Yugoslavia's most wanted war crimes fugitive, sheltered between 2002-5 at properties owned by the Serbian military and in Belgrade apartments, a Serbian minister told a German magazine.//////Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said yesterday that resistance by nations against major world powers pays off, state television reported.//////Ahead of the crucial Friday vote, Maoist chief Prachanda's hopes to become the next prime minister received a fresh setback today with CPN-UML refusing to back his government if it did not include the Nepali Congress of his arch-rival G P Koirala.//////Three security officers were killed in China's remote northwest yesterday, state media reported, raising the death toll from over a week of unrest there that has flared during the Olympics to 31.//////Running can slow the aging process, according to a study conducted over two decades by American researchers and published on Monday.//////Lebanese President Michel Sleiman heads on Wednesday for a groundbreaking visit to Damascus carrying an agenda loaded with thorny issues, including the establishment of diplomatic ties.//////JMM chief Shibu Soren yesterday staked claim for Chief Ministership of Jharkhand, demanding that the incumbent Madhu Koda should quit soon, failing which support to the state government will be withdrawn.//////Ferdousy Priyabhashini has captured the imagination of the art lovers in Bangladesh.

We are exceeding the carrying capacity of our planet, challenging the existence of several species, including our own. //////WHILE no government in Bangladesh tried the war criminals after the country became independent, the government of Serbia has arrested Radovan Karadzic, 13 years after he ordered the worst acts of brutality Europe has endured since the Nazi campaign -- including the siege of Sarajevo and the slaughter of 8000 Muslims men and women in Srebenica -- as head of the breakaway Bosnian Serb Republic during 1992-1995.//////BARACK Obama is a process guy. That doesn't sound like much of a compliment, but changing the way Washington works is at the heart of his message. The election will not be won on his energy policy or health-care policy. If he wins, it will be because voters want to fix the way we make decisions -- and they think Obama will drive the modern-day equivalent of the biblical moneychangers from the temple and set the country back on course.//////BOO hiss.
