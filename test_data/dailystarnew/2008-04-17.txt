evacuate and leading to the deaths of two firefighters and a pilot.//////THE Chief Election Commissioner has, as we understand, invited the two factions of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to tea today, separately of course. In light of the fact that earlier he ruled out the possibility of inviting both factions of the party to a dialogue, this is encouraging news. We, however, feel that the Election Commission should issue formal invitations to both factions to the dialogue it has initiated with the political parties. Given that the caretaker government itself has initiated a move to talk to the Delwar-led group as well as the pro-reform faction of the party, the stand adopted by ATM Shamsul Huda smacks of a paradox. The point is simple: if the government can go for a political dialogue with both groups, what prevents the Election Commission from doing the same to ensure smooth elections? Besides, it must be remembered that the roots of the present problem regarding the BNP lie in the earlier, obviously ill-considered move by the EC to invite the pro-reform faction of the BNP to the talks. It was that move which led to the present impasse; and the CEC cannot absolve himself or his colleagues over their role in the making of the crisis. It was a mistake which the CEC is yet to acknowledge. //////THE government has rightly decided to address traffic congestion in the city, which is worsening day by day, through implementing the recommendations of a committee constituted to examine the traffic issue in all its ramifications.//////THE forthcoming parliamentary election could turn out to be a poll that marks a turning point in Bangladeshi politics.

A variety of promises, highlighted by drastic economic and social reforms along with a tough anti-monarchy stance, helped them win the hearts of the masses in a country where the throne ruled for long and conventional political parties failed to deliver when they were at the helm. The final result has not been announced, but indications are clear that the once dreaded radicals will be in the driving seat in changing political dynamics.//////HILLARY Clinton and the Republicans are ecstatic! For once, they can attack Barack Obama for something he has said, without appearing racist.//////Shakib Al Hasan's century yesterday would remain a landmark for two reasons, one overriding the other.

An instance in point is the latest news item with pictures ( 9 March Sunday) where two artefacts recovered from Bogra were given the price tag of Tk 9 crore. Such grossly speculative valuation of antiquities is, in fact, doing more harm than good to our art and antiquarian treasures, for these antiquities are not saleable articles, rather strictly forbidden objects of trade. As such, there cannot be any price tag on these antiquities. Such unchecked fanciful pricing is always the outcome of unbridled imagination of the discoverer or the reporter and as such only whets the cupidity of the smugglers for clandestine traffic in antiquities.//////It is widely believed that after the declaration of the state of emergency the newspaper industry is struggling for survival.
