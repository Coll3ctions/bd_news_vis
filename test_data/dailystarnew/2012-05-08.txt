It was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian-American astrophysicist who predicted it in 1930. White dwarfs, unlike main sequence stars, resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure, rather than thermal pressure. The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction. White dwarfs with masses greater than the limit undergo further gravitational collapse. Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs. The Chandrasekhar limit is analogous to the TolmanOppenheimerVolkoff limit for neutron stars.//////Hundreds of students and their guardians flocked to the schools in Chittagong city and burst out in joy after the results of the SSC examination were out yesterday afternoon. //////
