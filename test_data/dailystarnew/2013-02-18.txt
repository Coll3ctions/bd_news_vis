The memory of the sharp decline in reserves and a substantial depreciation of the taka during January 2011 to February 2012 is still fresh in the minds of investors and citizens. So the improvement in the balance of payments, reflected in rising reserves and appreciation of the taka, must be welcome news. What explains this positive outturn? How sustainable is this development? What are the implications for policy management? These questions have emerged in several conversations with business, researchers and journalists.

Since the discovery of the immortality gene in 2009 for which three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine, researchers in different countries have been working to find out ways and means to switch on the immortality gene in human cell. Perhaps, due to Nature's universal control over life and death, the immortality gene is permanently switched off in each and every single human being on planet Earth. The immortality gene produces a very specific life-extending enzyme that has the ability to stop, prevent and even reverse the aging process.//////Just a few days ago, it was tough for the young people like us to realise the spirit of our freedom fighters. But being a part of the movement at Projonmo Chattor demanding capital punishment for all war criminals, it is now almost crystal clear to me how the freedom fighters felt during 1971. Chanting slogans with thousands of people helped me to understand the spirit of the freedom fighters. I never knew that yelling "tui rajakar" and "rajakarer fashi chai" could give me such bliss.

Mahmoodul Haque for his letter (published February 15th) in response to my earlier letter. I had considered the possibility of government influence or an alleged AL-Jamaat deal with regards to the Abdul Quader Mollah verdict before writing my original letter, but I dismissed these ideas as I could not figure out why the AL would think either option would be successful in reducing Jamaat violence.//////Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal is a seriously flawed court system, as cited by The Economist's investigative reporting which revealed that the presiding judge was receiving instructions from Awami League. This seems like more of a sentencing court, rather than a fact-finding one. A defence witness goes missing, allegedly another victim of enforced disappearance. While one defendant, conveniently hiding in Pakistan, receives the death sentence, another defendant, inconveniently still in Dhaka, gets life imprisonment. Most observers of Bangladeshi politics know how permanent imprisonment is. One need not look further than former president/dictator H.M. Ershad, who was jailed after a mass uprising. Today, he's back to politics who stole billions from the nation. //////UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi yesterday urged international backing for a Syrian opposition offer to begin talks with the regime, which he proposed be held in United Nations offices as rebels pressed the "Battle of the airports" in the north.//////A draft of a White House immigration proposal would allow illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents within eight years, USA Today reported on Saturday.//////Pakistan's unpopular government, which is gearing up for elections expected within months, faced growing anger yesterday for failing to deliver stability after a sectarian bombing in the city of Quetta killed 81 people.//////Liberal and Islamist political leaders met privately on Saturday to try to ease tensions that have sparked protests in which some 60 Egyptians have died since late January, politicians said.//////The commander of US-led forces in Afghanistan yesterday said he would comply with President Hamid Karzai's order banning Afghan security forces from seeking Nato air support.//////Several car bombs exploded in Shia Muslim neighbourhoods across Iraq's capital Baghdad yesterday morning, killing at least 26 people in blasts that tore into shops, restaurants and busy commercial streets.//////The trial of Israel's former foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman on charges of fraud and breach of trust opened at a Jerusalem court yesterday in a case which will decide the former bouncer's political future.//////Gunmen kidnapped seven foreigners and killed a security guard when they stormed the compound of Lebanese construction company Setraco in northern Nigeria's Bauchi state early yesterday, police said.//////As it turns 150, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) yesterday said it faces unprecedented challenges in the complex age of modern warfare.//////At least 13 people were killed over the weekend in Indonesia after heavy rains triggered floods and landslides, officials said yesterday.//////Russian authorities yesterday halted their search for the meteorite that spectacularly struck the Urals last week, leaving about 1,200 people injured and damaging several thousand buildings.//////A bomb killed two people in southern Thailand yesterday and police said they had defused other devices, apparently placed by Muslim separatists showing their capacity to strike despite a failed attack on a marine base last week.//////Creativity is a powerful source of inspiration; we all remember Shadhin Bangla Betar Kendro (SBBK), keeping the national spirit high during the days of war in 1971.

It is also the month when, historically, the fire of protests and dissent sweeps through the country. //////Shahbag Square - where's that? Abdul Kader Mullah - who's he?//////Politicians in every democratic society claim to represent the wishes of the people. It is the wishes of the people that become the prime movers of the successful political parties and the leaders who lead them. You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time- this famous saying of a great American President Abraham Lincoln was proven wrong time and again by a political party of Bangladesh. Lies, distortions and deceptions are the forte of this party which is once again proven by the party's two successive statements vis-a-vis the history which is in the making at Shahbag Square,newly renamed as Projonmo Chattor. Bengalees living in every nook and corner of the world know very well who and how this movement started and how it is being relentless led by a few youngsters strictly maintain its apolitical character. The patriotic Bengalees all around the globe are coming out in unprecedented numbers to declare their absolute allegiance to the sole cause which is to ensure ultimate punishment to perpetrators of the crimes against humanity committed in 1971.//////Men and women from across the United States who are proud of their much cherished values of freedom of conscience, equal rights for all and separation between Church and State will soon be celebrating the 350th anniversary of the official recognition of the establishment of Rhode Island as an English colonial settlement in North America.
