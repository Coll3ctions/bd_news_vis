The expropriation of public lands including forest resources by professional land grabbers and poachers managing impunity to legal action during successive governments left the nation poorer on many counts. Huge acreage of land went into wrongful possession diminishing space for development projects as tree cover dwindled and the natural drainage channels got clogged. //////MAHATHIR Mohamad's assessment of the recently deceased Suharto does not hold up to scrutiny.

"Future of Pakistan." While it is true that extremism and sectarianism pose a serious challenge to Pakistan, I disagree with the author's assertion that "Al-Qaeda / Taliban enjoy considerable support amongst the masses" of Pakistan, a deduction reached by the author by pointing to Bin Laden's supposed "popularity" in Pakistan. I believe the results of opinion polls suggesting "support" for Bin Laden need to be investigated thoroughly before reaching any firm conclusion as to their findings. //////Robert James Bobby Fischer, former world chess champion from the USA, died of kidney failure in Iceland at the age of 64. He was born in 1943, the son of two physicists (divorced when he was two).//////The government needs to make fresh guidelines to create awareness among tourists, both local and foreign, against purchasing and exchanging wildlife souvenirs made from the endangered species. //////The ruling regimes since 1972 failed to introduce discipline and transparency in our inspectors and inspection networks. It means R&D and QC (research and development; and quality control) were wasteful expenditures; especially for goods and services not exported (like RMG and manpower exports). The local consumers have been suffering, being offered shoddy goods and services. This type of systems losses are huge over the decades, tarnishing the image of Bangladeshi products and services.//////The recent hurricane-strength Sidr has made obvious the need for a flexible school calendar in disaster-prone areas; but it is as well necessary in many other regions across the country. Though all our education commissions have recommended decentralization of the education system, the right for scheduling one's own school calendar has been overlooked all along. It is however known that the District Primary Education Officers had certain number of holidays in their hands to give to local schools until it was revoked, maybe, towards the end of the 1980s. Again, on 22 April 1998 in a meeting at then Primary and Mass Education Division (PMED) a decision was taken for some flexibility in local school calendar with due permission from the Division. //////The caretaker govt has taken myriad steps for reforming and reconstituting various govt organisations including the Public Service Commission (PSC) as the organisations have plunged into corruption and irregularity. The govt successfully reconstituted the PSC, which is the highest recruiting body of govt officials and the steps taken were lauded by all. The caretaker govt has also taken the initiative to bring about changes in the PSC recruitment process, so that the meritorious candidates could get chance. The measures would deter mischievous and fraudulent candidates who enter govt service using loopholes in the recruitment process. Recently, while reading DS, I came to know that the committee, formed to bring changes in the process, is indifferent towards taking any initiative regarding the quota system.//////This is perhaps for the first time that the Finance Adviser warned scheduled banks not to harass their clients.

We request all banks to provide on-line banking services and take care of clients' account accurately, send their balance regularly, include adequate precautions about the safety vault and lockers and honour every customer as a valued one. //////It has been said in the UN report that the world's climate is undergoing significant changes. If the world's temperature changes drastically many living beings may face extinction! The sea level is rising day by day. Bangladesh is located at a very dangerous point. We should make all-out efforts to keep the situation under control.//////Through your daily we would like to draw the kind attention of the authorities concerned that many consumers/customers have not received the yearly clearance certificate of payment of their monthly Desa and Wasa bills for the last two years, as yet.//////To develop our overall standard in different sectors of the state, we need some rules-regulations and their appropriate execution. But unfortunately the political governments didn't perform those tasks effectively, though they were vocal always in favour of those rules. For example, Separation of the Judiciary has been a long standing demand. But in 36 years they have done nothing meaningful. They have deferred it by showing lame excuses like red-tapism, bureaucratic complexity etc. But now we are encouraged. This government has initiated a lot of good things. They have made the EC, ACC, PSC, UGC, HRC and other organisations effective. But the challenge is to make these corrections institutionalised. Otherwise, future political governments will attempt to make the ventures futile. //////I felt very sad after reading the report about the above-mentioned project which was published in your paper on 30 December 2007. The information that the project is not being implemented properly due to the apathy of the officials concerned is very unfortunate. The frequent downward revision of the budget is proof that it has not been formulated properly. Most of the croplands of the projects area are haors (flat low land) suitable for growing only one crop in winter (mostly boro rice) but rice crop is damaged by floods, partly or wholly, almost every year. This has been happening from the time immemorial. //////British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Monday that next month's elections had to be credible, insisting the country's stability was vital for South Asia. //////Kenyan military helicopters opened fire Tuesday above feuding gangs in a western town, and 13 died in fresh clashes elsewhere as the murder of an opposition lawmaker sparked new chaos. //////US President George W Bush warned Iran Monday that the United States will "confront those who threaten our troops" and defend its allies and interests in the Gulf. //////After evading a question from former UN official from India Shashi Tharoor at Davos, Afghan President Hamid Karzai has told an American newsmagazine that there is Pakistani "complicity" with resurgent rebels in his embattled country.//////Indian Kashmir militants announced yesterday that they would not use guns to force voters to boycott state elections due later this year, a report said. //////Florida voted in its key Republican presidential nominating contest yesterday, with top contenders John McCain and Mitt Romney tightly matched and ex-New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign hanging in the balance. //////The EU's special envoy for Myanmar on Tuesday urged the country's military regime to free democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi as he kicked off an Asian tour aimed at pressuring the junta for reform. //////A suicide bomber drove into a hail of bullets to set off a bomb outside a police station in eastern Algeria that security services said killed four people and injured 20. //////Former US spy chief John Negroponte admitted that the United States has used a controversial interrogation technique known as waterboarding but does not anymore, according to a published interview Monday. //////A senior UN official has urged the countries to put the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) into action and take measures to enforce it strictly.//////Pakistani security forces exchanged gunfire with Islamic militants holed up in a house in the southern city of Karachi yesterday, with at least two policemen and one militant dead, police said. //////THE First International Children's Film Festival Bangladesh was inaugurated on January 28 at the Shawkat Osman Auditorium, Central Public Library.

Similarly, we observe that the study of private policing is about who, how, to whom, and when in absence of any check on their performance by the relevant authorities. //////IN recent years the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has become synonymous with three issues -- the war in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq and the nuclear program of Iran. Although I am sure UNSC undertakes a lot of other very important tasks, it seems on the surface to be driven by a specific group of nations united by a common agenda.//////I was very excited when I heard about a Metro network in Dhaka. However, my enthusiasm has been somewhat dampened since reading the article on the front page of the Daily Star of January 8. Although a total cost of Tk 6200 crore was mentioned, and an outline plan of the metro network was published, I could not find any other relevant information about the project. I could not be sure whether a detailed feasibility study was carried out prior to making an estimation of the total cost. A feasibility study must include initial land and traffic survey, survey of the traveling public and major business locations, soil test, and also a list of existing public and private transport routes. //////ACCORDING to the latest news reports, avian influenza (commonly referred to as bird flu) has spread to at least 20 districts in Bangladesh.
