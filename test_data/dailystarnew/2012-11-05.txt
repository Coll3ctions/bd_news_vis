November. It highlighted the ministry's problem for real evaluation and effective solutions of our systems loss problems. This is an important task that needs to be undertaken by professionals in a proper and independent manner. In my view, forming a 'Task Force' locally, may not be the ideal way to go about it objectively. Further, the evaluation will take time and skilled resources, working totally independently and without any subjectivity. Therefore, for carrying out this fairly complex study, I believe that outside professionals may be a better solution.//////Recently, while returning from school, a traffic officer stopped all cars on both sides of the road.

He is unquestionably the most important witness in the case and it is also obvious that he is now a target of the criminal gang who killed his parents.
