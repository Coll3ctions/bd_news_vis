Indeed, the incident raises a few questions not only about the nature of the deaths themselves but also about human nature. The first of these questions relates to the matter of why these young people, ten in all, suddenly decided to pile themselves on a boat that bore the risks of an accident. The lake (or jheel in common parlance) is these days brimming with rainwater on account of the on-going monsoon, which should have been reason enough for these young people to stay away from that fateful boat ride. It is understood that the boatman had earlier warned these young people about the risks involved. Unfortunately, no heed was paid to him.//////It's a spectacular sight. Bangladesh from the vantage point of a small, low-flying sea-plane is by any measure breath-taking. The silvery net of the innumerable criss-crossing rivers, the green on green patchwork quilts of the fields in planting season, the precise little boxes of the homesteads dotting the landscape, neat postage-stamp sized tin structures surrounded by shade trees, the occasional pond.//////A popular writer has been recently clobbered because he claimed that writers enjoyed freedom in this country. Other things he said were incidental to the same line of logic. He slighted a writer who was brutally hacked for his writing. He claimed that the sedition charge brought against a prominent activist was stage-managed. Then he made insensitive comments on the food prices and showed his weakness for the current "army-backed" caretaker government. On all those counts, the critics argued, the writer who made those remarks during an interview with a Bengali newspaper put his foot in his mouth.//////Phnom Penh: Cambodias political parties are in their last day of campaigning before the electors go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new government.

challenge for the present world. Poverty is widespread in the rural areas. Because of this situation most of the poor people face many social problems. As a result, the target groups (poor, rural women, young generation and the unemployed) are also not conscious about environmental problems like global warming and climate change in Bangladesh. They cannot contribute to the campaign against environmental degradation. //////Form newspaper, I got to know that the education ministry is planning to introduce GPA based admission system in the Intermediate level. They found that it would stop the unholy business of the coaching centres.//////What is common in the behaviour patterns of our Stock Exchange and the RMG industry?

The attitude is a disease of society.//////A few days back the CTG successfully completed the preparation of national Voter ID.

When the lady just in front of me reached the checkout after staying on the queue for at least 10 minutes, the checkout operator surprisingly looked at her face for a few seconds and then said to her, You look like Helen Clark. Guessing his implied question that if she was Helen Clark, she simply replied to him, That's right. Yes, I then noticed that she was New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark. //////We could learn from the media news that the govt. is contemplating amendment to the existing EPR, particularly some clauses to enable the convicts to seek election. In the past the convicted persons who suffered three-year term of imprisonment were barred from seeking election.//////Eve-teasing is a rampant social evil. This has become a common phenomenon on Bangladesh Agricultural University campus. The issue always surfaces when something ugly happens. Knee-jerk reactions such as police patrol, `white' brigade actions, etc., continue for a short time. Public memory happens to be short and soon things return to the usual anarchy and we accept the fact that `nothing much can be done.' //////When it comes to the economy, the of-repeated drumbeat is monotonous: the demand from the third world to liberalise its economies as a 'requirement' for development. Looking at the international development, that has taken place in the last three decades, we see the domination of capitalism. It has completely monopolised economic development and enforced its formula upon the world. //////This is high time to check what's happening in SAU. Our university was opened on 14 July after 39 days, but nobody can say when the classes will start. //////Recently, a freedom fighter was assaulted in a Jamaat-backed so-called freedom fighters' meeting. We would urge this silent government to wake up and try the razakars and war criminals without further delay. They were identified in 71, there is a list of collaborators, and everybody knows it. There is no need to find out a new process or way to detect them in order to prove their crimes. This essential task has to be accomplished before the national election and all religion based political parties should be banned in order to bring about the change that we need.//////A couple of days ago a policy suggestion made by IMF caught my attention and forced me to write something. They suggested that the central bank go for a contractionary monetary policy (less expansionary according to them) to stabilize the price level. I, with many of the general people, failed to understand how an organisation like IMF could suggest such a preposterous policy. The uncontrollable inflation in Bangladesh is not caused by excessive money supply. Had that been the case, then the banks would not have raised their interest rate on deposit to solve their acute liquidity crisis and the business people would not have claimed that they are facing shortage of credit supply. That clearly suggests that there is not enough money in the money market that could create inflation. From our experience, we have been watching that inflation in our country stems from the ever-rising fuel price, shortage of supply, artificial supply crisis created by our suppliers, increased labour and import costs and above all the huge population that is creating tremendous pressure on the limited supplies of economic goods and services. Rather than solving these problems, if we go for reducing money supply, it is certainly not going to do any better. Instead, such a contractionary policy would be detrimental for our economy by slowing down the economic growth through reduced investment and consumption expenditure. //////As mentioned by the Nobel Committee chief during his visit to Bangladesh, proper education is the only instrument to overcome global crisis of terrorism, social unrest, food shortage and corruption. //////"One's blood, another's life" the slogan of a voluntary blood collecting organisation has to be appreciated fully. Last Friday I donated blood for a teenager at the Orthopaedic Hospital in Dhaka for the first time in my life. I felt so good after donating blood. I thought, how close one can become to another human through blood transfusion! My blood is flowing in somebody's vein and working for her betterment --what an incredible feeling! //////On July 18, 2008, we lost two BDR soldiers in a shooting by Indian BSF. BSF killed so many people of Bangladesh near the border areas over the years, but when they killed BDR members it was a different story. Any country's border security force is a symbol of that country's sovereignty. Therefore strong protests should come from the political parties as well as the government. But we are unlucky. We don't find any voice being raised from our political parties, especially the big ones!//////Can the EC explain to the nation how they have maintained the required transparency or public information to prepare correct and complete voter lists? We are aware that the contracts were awarded to the NGOs for public information and mobilisation purpose, since they have not visited homes for voter listing as done before. At least, I apprehend some gaps in the entire efforts and that many voters have been left unregistered. Yes, we know they can register now, but why it has not been possible to register them during regular listing?//////An earthquake is the shaking of the ground caused by a shift of rock along a fracture in the Earth known as a fault. It results in the abrupt release of energy in the surroundings from the Earth's surface. Myths and religions Scientists believe that most earthquakes are the result of the motion of the plates that exist inside the earth surface. Our Earth's inner mantle is a thick layer of solid, dense rock consisting mainly of magnesium and silicon. The outer crust is made up of a number of plates that float on the molten rock of the mantle. These plates are forced to move across the convection currents caused by the heat rising from the centre of the earth. The rate of plate movement can be measured by accurate techniques. //////It won't be an easy task to bring back all the high profile people who were involved in corruption and fled the country. But at least the ACC or the government can set up a special unit to find out where these people are currently living and can request the governments of those countries to extradite these corrupt people.//////It seems another flood is at our doorstep as many places in Eastern India have already been flooded. It doesn't need to be a rocket scientist to predict that if Eastern India is hit by floods now, we are also going to be affected by it pretty soon.//////I am a retired government servant. During my long service-tenure of three decades no itching palm disturbed me. I submitted my tax-returns regularly for a good number of years. When no tax was imposed on my income for five successive years, my tax adviser instructed me not to submit returns any more. After retirement I started living on my tax-free pension and the profit of a few Bonus Sanchaypatra (10% of the profit earned was regularly deducted). For the last three years, I have been earning a small amount every month for my participation in television programmes on a private channel. The channel authorities regularly deduct tax on that earning of mine.//////Pakistan will not allow foreign troops into its tribal areas to root out extremists threatening coalition forces in neighbouring Afghanistan, its foreign minister said here yesterday.//////Pakistan has warned a deal leading to increased Indian access to nuclear fuel could accelerate the atomic arms race between the rivals, according to a letter obtained on Wednesday by The Associated Press. //////India said yesterday it was sending out envoys to lobby for the final international clearances needed to finalise a controversial nuclear energy deal with the United States.//////The Israeli army chief of staff has said in Washington that all options must be prepared to counter Iran's controversial nuclear programme, in remarks relayed on Thursday.//////Asia's top security forum agreed yesterday on military exercises aimed at forging a regional taskforce to deal with calamities like those that struck Myanmar and China this year.//////Pakistan's security and intelligence agencies have been put on high alert following reports that local Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has prepared a hit list of 300 high-profile figures, including top political leaders. //////The loss in the parliament trust vote may have dashed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati's immediate dream of power in New Delhi, but she is returning to Lucknow with a larger national profile, including new allies who are more than ready to accept her as prime ministerial candidate. //////At least nine people including women and young children were killed in fresh outbreaks of violence in Indian Kashmir yesterday, officials said.//////The UPA today rallied behind Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, a day after the veteran Marxist was expelled from the CPI-M, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh meeting him, a move aimed at assuring him of the coalition's backing.//////With war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic finally in custody, Serbia came under increased pressure yesterday to capture his fugitive wartime military chief Ratko Mladic, also wanted for genocide.//////Japanese and Mongolian scientists have successfully recovered the complete skeleton of a 70-million-year-old young dinosaur, a nature museum announced Thursday. //////A massive hunt is on to nab Anwarul Azim Anar, a top listed international gold, drug and arms smuggler, who was snatched by his cohorts from police custody following his arrest at Kaliganj on July 23.//////It was a classic case of life imitating art.
