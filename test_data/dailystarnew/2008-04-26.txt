But that relieving spot has been somewhat taken away by the doubling of CNG price now. Some upward adjustment in CNG price was inevitable, if the books of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), or for that matter, the subsidy budget of the government, were to be balanced. Yet raising the price by hundred percent by one single stroke is something that can have a shock effect on the road transport sector that is associated with environment-friendly use of fuel.//////EVERY other day, we hear the sad tale of fortune seekers returning home from a totally frustrated pursuit of the El Dorado -- physically and mentally ruined with nothing to subsist on and up to their necks in debts. There is hardly any place in the world our youths cheated by manpower frauds have not been repatriated from. Many have landed in jail, requiring counsellor assistance that was hard to come by. //////THE power generation scenario with the onset of this summer season is going from bad to worse. It has been learnt from the PDB sources that the country's average power generation capacity has come down to 3700 megawatts as against the demand of 4350 megawatts. But unofficially the demand curve exceeds 5000 megawatts. Special Assistant to the Chief Adviser on Power and Energy Professor M.Tamim said in a recent press briefing that the shortage of power at the moment is more due to transmission problem than generational. It has been further learnt that constraints in supplying gas from Bibiyana and Jalalabad gas fields to power plants at Ghorasal, Siddhirganj and Chittagong now stands in the way of enhancing power generation. Shockingly, as Professor Tamim said, the move taken in 2005 to install 4 (four) compressors at the national grid with the assistance of ADB for increasing gas pressure did not materialise. Compounding the problem is the sudden drop of gas extraction from the only offshore gas field Sangu which Cairn Energy plc, the operator of the gas field, failed to ascertain earlier. Further, their effort to extract gas from other wells including Mognama and Hatiya has not met with success. //////MEMBERS of SAARC hold ASEAN in high esteem. We admire the cohesion and stability that this regional organisation has brought for its members in Southeast Asia over the last forty years. We compare SAARC with ASEAN and discover many areas where we lag behind. I shall first try to enumerate the areas where ASEAN has stolen a march over SAARC.//////AFTER Jawaharlal Nehru assumed power as India's first Prime Minister it was expected that he would build it up as a welfare state. But when it came to writing the Constitution, even the word, socialism, did not figure in the 395-Article document.

Ordinarily, such a tour would represent one of the biggest challenges that any of these players could hope to face - last month, their former captain, Stephen Fleming, recalled his team's 2-1 victory in 1999 as the proudest moment of an illustrious career.

In 500 BC, Athens purchased food from Ukraine, Rome from Africa. The breakdown of long-distance commerce in food has worried Bangladesh, particularly because her neighbours -- India, Myanmar and Bangkok have restricted export of rice in apprehension of world-wide food scarcity. Bangladesh has a landless and incomeless population of about 20 millions, badly crippled, disabled and ailing population of about 20 millions, all of whom need to be healthfully fed free or at subsidized rate.//////This is a country of rivers and rivulets.//////This a country of rafts, floats and boats.//////There is no impassable river//////That you cannot cross.//////Is there any fool//////Who will like to cross the river swimming//////When the boats are waiting at the quay?//////Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Barack Obama has been facing the music from the media particularly radio talk shows and cable networks, including Fox News which appears to be ending the honeymoon with print and electronic media. Obama has been enjoying favourable coverage since he announced his candidacy for president last year. The press has marvelled at his oratory, swooned over his campaign strategy and given him credit for inspiring youth voters, and reach across party lines to come to vote during primary elections. Senator Obama was spared the negative onslaught by the media until recently.//////Bangladesh with a population of 150 million and having only 91,500 sq km of land under cultivation is in a critical state so far as food security is concerned. Environmentally it is also in a crucial situation with less than 15 percent forest cover (preferable 25 percent). Available agricultural lands are fast depleting as: (i) about 100 sq km of agricultural land is eroded by rivers each year; and (ii) about another 1300 sq km is going out from agricultural to non-agricultural uses each year. Population increase of about 2 percent per year and simultaneous reduction of cultivable land are making the situation more and more precarious day by day. Increase of cultivable lands by reclamation from Meghna Estuary is one of the viable alternatives for enhancing individual and national food security as well as improving natural environment. //////As different factors like lower-fertility, arsenic contamination, pollution of air and water coupled with draught and attack of pathogens put a dent on harvest Professor Dr Md.

It was the first time I read Pakistani writers on our liberation war. After that, however, I could not access any more of their writing on this subject. Until now, when Professor Niaz Zaman and Asif Farrukhi from Bangladesh and Pakistan have jointly edited ////// (Dhaka: UPL; 2008). Umme Umara's story, coincidentally, is the first one here. The volume is noteworthy for its attempt to portray the diverse, complicated experience of 1971 from both sides, with stories translated from Bangla, Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi, as well as some originally written in English. Translations rather than stories written originally in English form the main bulk of the book. //////Buddhadev Bose was a prolific letter writer. In ////// he narrates how during his Noakhali childhood he was his family's designated letter writer, and about its post office and indolent postmaster. In ////// he rues the loss of several hundred letters to ravenous termites. Now we have //////, a collection of his letters written to his younger daughter Damayanti Singh Bose from 1962 till his death in 1974. These were first published--178 out of roughly 300--in 1988-89 in West Bengal's ////// magazine. They have been reprinted in a 256-page volume, the language even in these informal, sometimes-dashed-off missives gleaming like zamindari heirlooms. Its flow is marred by busy footnotes by Damayanti, who otherwise has penned a loving tribute to him. In these pages Buddhadev emerges as a conscientious, affectionate father and family man. No less valuable is the portrait drawn of '60s Calcutta, its gritty materiality.//////The first ever World Malaria Day was observed yesterday with a view to increase mass awareness and ramp up the global efforts to provide effective control of malaria around the world.//////Safe disposal of medical waste continues to be a matter of serious concern for health.

And it helps that she is an artist herself, for such a background explains not just the various manifestations of aesthetics in purely modern terms but also provides details of why an appreciation of art could eventually turn out to be a study of the artist herself. The forty-something Anish's admiration, followed by infatuation followed by a falling head over heels in love with the slightly over twenty Trisha, is but an instance when the image and the image maker become a complete whole for an individual. It is the paintings at Ajanta and Ellora that Trisha admires. For Anish, a West Bengali Indian resident in distant Canada, it is the art in the being of East Bengali Trisha that matters. He then falls in love with the art, eventually to discover in it the woman he needs to love.//////The master storyteller in Isabelle Allende holds up a world of dictatorship through the eyes of a poet in Of Love and Shadows. It is a story of love, triumph and tragedy that can occur under a dictatorship. It is a love story about a journalist, Irene Beltrn, and a photographer, Francisco Leal. They live in a country in Latin America that is run by a military dictatorship. It is also a story that unearths the brutalities perpetrated under harsh military rule. It is a beautiful story that grows in the folds of atrocities, love that finds roots while two souls search for justice. //////Love is a symbol of truth and beauty and gives us insights into blissful and spiritual life. Without love and affection, it is rather difficult to think about the existence of the soul in the body. Loving humankind and feeling empathy, delight and liberty are the four aspects of true love. Love is tranquil, quiet, honest, virtuous and based on conviction, esteem, confidence, support and truth. It does not have any room for jealousy, distrust, conceit, snobbery and unfairness. Love excuses all. Love happens when a wish is developed from an attraction, which leads to submission and then urges one to take the path to commitment. A deep attachment is felt for the person we love; we feel sensitive and are mesmerised by our love and thus seek devotion and regard. Love brings people together, as opposed to hate which separates people from one another. Love is refined and if allowed to flow naturally will smoothen the trail chosen after birth. Love makes life healthier and fuller. These comprise the essence of Murtaja Baseer's poetry. To express wonder and to feel exceptional sensibility are two kinds of emotional experience. He excels in uniting different sensibilities//////I read a book one day, and my whole life was changed.' Thus begins Pamuk's The New Life, the fastest-selling title in Turkish history. Contradictorily to all praises, to me the opening line comes like the beginning of a review by a fan of Paulo Coelho. But perhaps that's what Pamuk meant when he says in this book, 'A good book is something that reminds us of the whole world'.//////
