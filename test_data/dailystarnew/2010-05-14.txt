The move is significant considering the manner in which the youth was killed and the way in which his death was passed off as a matter of routine law and order. It brings to the fore once again the critical issue of 'crossfires' which have aroused, naturally, public fury at home and outrage abroad. Sadly enough, these 'crossfires', which first became regular practice on the part of the security forces, have continued even under the present elected Awami League-led government. What is infinitely of grave concern is the fact that despite their pre-election position against 'crossfires', the leading lights of the government (and that includes the home minister) have instead tried defending such questionable acts as part of law enforcement measures.//////Abahani will bank on their on-song striker Enamul Haque when they square off against Hasus NTCPE of Chinese Taipei in the AFC President's Cup Group A Qualifiers at the Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////England cruised into the World Twenty20 final with a seven-wicket thrashing of Sri Lanka at the Beausejour Stadium here on Thursday.//////Bangladesh continued their dismal performance in the Asian Games Qualifying hockey when the hosts played out a 3-3 draw against Sri Lanka at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////They can't play at home, they have arrived in the Caribbean without several senior players, a former coach has questioned their sanity and yet they are in the World Twenty20 semifinals.//////The momentum will be with West Indies A when they take on South Africa A in the final of the ATN Records tri-nation series today at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.//////Visiting Bangladesh cricket team have suffered a major blow with their captain Shakib Al Hasan coming down with chickenpox.//////Grand Master Niaz Murshed won his sixth round game of the Commonwealth Chess Championship in Delhi, India yesterday.//////Forward Rasel Mahmud Jimmy and defender Mamunur Rahman Chayan exchanged heated conversation in the dressing room after Bangladesh were held to a 3-3 draw against Sri Lanka in their Asian Games Qualifying hockey match at the Maulana Bhasani National Stadium yesterday.//////The RC Cola Federation Cup Invitational table tennis competition was inaugurated at the Wooden Floor Gymnasium in the capital yesterday.//////In the group stage, they were prolific in front of goal and, although England held them to a goalless draw, they were heavily fancied to thrash Wales in the last eight.

As a part of this programme Mr Simon Reeve embarks on an epic journey around the world following the Tropic of Cancer and uncovers environmental, political and human stories from some of the most remote places on the planet.

Moreover, the distance between the houses is very little, thus this window makes things worse. //////The story of a sinking ship is unfolding slowly. The CI can defend his contention politically, but his chances of gaining the status of the chief investigator as per charter of the act was remote and literally impossible. He was behaving like a typical government servant. //////With the new academic year beginning, parents, particularly those belonging to the middle and lower middle classes, are a harassed lot. In the past, schools were run by governments and the quality of education was good. Teachers were dedicated and there was no need for private tuition. But now private schools and coaching centres are mushrooming all over the country. We find them giving huge advertisements on their pass percentage and successful candidates. Accordingly, they also demand huge fees. Another growing trend is publicity in schools that they coach students for entrance examinations right from the fifth standard. Of course, they charge a premium. //////'Taratari', a remarkable jute fibre reinforced fishing boat; modelled in the lines of our local fishing boats of Sundarbans, was developed by the NGO 'Friendship and Bengal Foundation'.

How come some people drift through life trying to find the energy to go on, and others have abounding energy? Is there some magic potion that the successful have access to? The answer is yes. The magic potion is belief. The idea of the magic of believing is born out of the fact that masterpieces, world architecture, societies and cultures, discoveries, new skills, world records... man's achievements have all resulted from the quaint beginnings of a simple belief. What magnificent and incredible power, and apparent magic, stems from a clear cut belief!//////I'm writing in response to the cover-page articles in the latest issue of The Daily Star (30th April 2010) on energy options for us. The lead article 'The Case for Coal' explored, and, to a great extent, as I understand, suggested coal option to ensure our energy security, and the next article advocated for solar breakthrough. Well, the first thing first. The real solutions to the energy and climate crisis is well-addressed by it, and what the writer told are available today if we focus on what we have in abundance. //////With the voluntary resignation of Mr. Abdul Matin, the chief of the war crimes investigation agency, what has the government taken as a lesson/learnt? This type of incident is embarrassing both for the government and the individual concerned. Is there any guarantee that the next person selected will also be a correct choice? Therefore to avoid such incidents in future the government may formulate appropriate procedures. //////Black money generally means what is earned through illegal means. But, legally earned money would be black money if the earner does not pay tax on it.//////Recently, the issue of taxing the share traded income and mandatory TIN for BO Account created panic amongst the share investors. But it is also necessary that the government earns from such a huge transacting market. I think that the easiest way could be to impose a 0.1%(zero point one percent) mandatory fees on all the amount transacted, which could easily bring Tk. 1 crore income to the government on the 1,000 crore transacted daily. This could be a hassle free way for both. There are many other benefits in taxing this way.//////14th February 2009. It was 12'O clock. It is fourth floor of Shahid Mahfuzur Rahman Hall.

However, they require a long time to set up, between 4 to 5 years, in the best of circumstances. //////YOU could detect a faint cracking of the voice in Gordon Brown as he said farewell before 10 Downing Street last week. And it was only natural, considering that the man was giving up power, and everything that came with it, with great reluctance.
