Generally the central banks of most of the developed and developing countries prudently control the deposit rates and lending rates of the commercial and other financial organisations.

The tirade of Begum Zia about Fakhruddin-Moinuddin's unconstitutional regime was not a new one. //////It seems in Bangladesh if one wants to kill a person, he can do it easily. The only condition for the killer is that he must be associated with the ruling party. After the killing, the killer will not be arrested as long as the party he belongs to is in power. Then when the opposition party will come to power, the killer will have to hide for five years. And, again, when the killer's party returns to power, if he surrenders and asks for clemency, he will be pardoned, as it happened in many cases. Thus the fortunate killer can remain free forever and become a hero. //////The hanging image of Felani, shot dead by BSF, is still fresh in our memory. And now we see another instance of their brutality on a Bangladesh citizen. The continuous killing and torturing of Bangladeshis by BSF show clearly how India treats us. India has violated all international norms and human rights while dealing with Bangladesh. //////Unemployment is one of the major problems in most countries of the world including Bangladesh. In this regard I would like to recall a saying of Bill Owens - "Job creation in the 21st century economy can't be business as usual. Competition is global, and it's fierce......tourism and agriculture are superb economic generators and we are all proud of these key industries."//////Just like every other morning I was reading newspaper on January 4 and a heading "small mistake great loss" caught my attention. I felt very sorry for the irresponsible mother as well as the ill-fated child who was found dead on the staircase of DMCH. On 5th January, it was found that the child was murdered. The victim child died due to suffocation. Several other injuries were found on her body. On 9th January, we came to know that the mother of the child was also involved in the crime. I was shocked for a moment. Only God knows how a mother could do this to her child. //////Saudi Arabia's Gulf allies joined Riyadh yesterday in pulling out of an Arab League monitoring team to Syria, risking the collapse of a mission whose presence has not halted violence in a 10-month-old revolt against President Bashar al-Assad.//////Diehard supporters of Muammar Gaddafi seized control on Monday of Bani Walid, a one-time bastion of the slain dictator, Libyan officials told AFP, claims denied by the interior minister.//////Pakistan's under-fire President Asif Ali Zardari arrived in Myanmar yesterday for two days of talks and a meeting with veteran democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi.//////Martin Scorsese's lavish 3D adventure "Hugo" won 11 Oscar nominations yesterday, just ahead of hotly-tipped silent movie "The Artist" with 10 nods for Hollywood's top awards.//////A planned video address by British author Salman Rushdie to an Indian literary festival was scrapped yesterday because of security fears, organisers said.//////Pakistan's powerful army and intelligence chiefs met with the prime minister yesterday, state television reported, during the worst political crisis since a 1999 coup.//////Pakistani judges investigating a major scandal threatening President Asif Ali Zardari summoned the country's interior minister yesterday after a key witness refused to appear in person.//////An escalation of a dispute with Iran could see Britain sending military reinforcements to the Gulf, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said yesterday.//////Yemen's outgoing President Ali Abdullah Saleh is seeking exile in neighbouring Oman, but the sultanate is reluctant to host him for fear of hurting its relations with any future Yemeni government, diplomats said yesterday.//////Monday marks the beginning of the Year of the Dragon, and Chinese communities around the world will celebrate with extravagant festivities, vibrant parades and an influx in consumer spending.

A few days ago, when he and his party should have come forth with a clear, outright condemnation of the recent attempt to remove the Awami League-led government through one more murderous coup d' etat, he remained charmingly vague about what position the BNP had on the issue. Now, that would be all right for a lot of people. But then, do not forget that there are all those cynics spread all over the place. And they will not soon forget the demand made by the BNP some weeks ago for a disbanding of the International Crimes Tribunal now busy trying to bring the war criminals of 1971 to justice. That was a wrong, almost suicidal move for the party. Here you have a party which says nothing about the three million who died in the War of Liberation, of the intellectuals led away to a gory end by the death squads of the Jamaat-e-Islami on the eve of victory, but which comes out strongly in defence of the very men who were part of that murder machine along with the Pakistan army forty years ago.//////Which of the two is more difficult to deal with in the political style of South Asia: affection or anger? In physical terms, the first. The principal motif of any display of popular support is the jostle.

Historical records show that there were three Silk Roads that connected primeval China with the Indian aubcontinent. The Southern Silk Route was a bridge between the eastern part of Bengal (today's Bangladesh) and the Middle Kingdom. War and other conflicts in the region, particularly during and after World War II, disrupted the Sino-Bengal historical ties and connectivity. //////Samson Chowdhury lived an enviable life. He died an enviable death: a glorious one indeed, at the mature age of 86. He left behind his wife, children and grand-children besides thousands of friends and well-wishers to mourn his death. He was a venerable man, a half-legend in his lifetime, morphed into a full legend after his death. A favourite icon of his time he carried all before him by his presence, drive and elegance. It seems death has imparted additional lustre to his living self. Paying homage to him is a pleasure, we all enjoy it. //////
