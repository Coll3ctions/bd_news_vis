Most have never heard an unkind word about these bedrock institutions, which they know to be the foundations of American power and prosperity.//////Mashrafe Bin Mortaza is a special one in our country's cricket. His performance with Abahani in the ongoing Premier Division Cricket League once again proved why he is exceptional from other cricketers of his generation. Constantly living with a career-threatening injury and barred from bowling at any pace to heal his recurring back pain in the last four Premier League games, the Narail Express still played a major role in holding Abahani in pole position either with his off-spin or with the bat.

Every day we hear the news of labour retrenchment by foreign companies or their employers. A large number of workers are coming back home because of faulty recruitment, dishonesty of the employers who don't pay wages and other benefits regularly and finally prevailing global financial crisis. Labour unrest, nowadays, is a common phenomenon around the world. Bangladeshi workers who go abroad (mostly the Middle East and some South East Asian countries) sell their only possession like a small piece of land or mortgaging their own house to the village mahajons or lenders in order to meet the expenses with the hope that they will be able to earn some money. But when they are betrayed and those minimum requirements are not fulfilled as promised earlier, they don't have any way out but life long disappointment. In most of the cases, it is due to some dishonest middlemen and recruiting agencies who form a syndicate along with their foreign counterparts. There is an allegation that our missions in those countries have failed to tackle the situation in many cases. They have not taken any effective measures in this regard. We should keep in mind that those poor and unfortunate workers, who are the lifeblood of our economy, send a huge amount of remittance to our country every year. //////Strike at the DMCH by interns was unexpected. The strike was called to protest alleged misbehaviour by the relatives of a man who had died half an hour after his admission in the hospital. But the alleged misbehaviour was not a good reason to call a strike. The doctors in their bid to protest what they deemed unfair, themselves indulged in activities which were a stark violation of the norms of their noble profession. As a result 10 patients have died (report from BBC) and 2000 patients were deprived of emergency medical care. What were the interns trying to achieve through inflicting such punishment on the innocent treatment seekers?//////Referring to the article, "Students these days", by Mohammad Lutfor Rahman, PhD Student, Genetic Epidemiology, and University College London (UCL), 2009/03/20.//////Health policies in schools, as well as skill-based health schooling and the conditions of different health services, can help attain health, sanitation and nourishment of kids. But superior school health policies should go afar this to certify a secure and safe corporal setting and a helpful psychosocial atmosphere. Such policies should address issues of abuse of students, sexual harassment, health-related practices of teachers and students, school violence etc to help promote inclusion and equity in the school environment. Policies regarding the health-related practices of teachers and students can reinforce health education: teachers can act as positive role models for their students, for example, by not smoking in school. The process of developing and agreeing upon policies draws attention to these issues. The policies are best developed by involving several levels, including the national level, regional and district level, and the school level with the participation of the teachers, children, parents and the wider society. //////The Buddhist Religious Welfare Trust is a government institution under the Ministry of Religion. But actually it doesn't reflect its real appearance through the activities accomplished by the trust. The Buddhist community of the country is not happy with its performance. At present the post of the secretary is vacant. //////Any way, the price of rice is continuing to fall. The government step to sell rice at Tk 18 per kg to garment workers will definitely further lower the price. But this artificial price fall will adversely affect the paddy growers. This year farmers had to purchase urea at Tk 600 per bag, just double the price they paid last year. the long drought increased the irrigation cost considerably. Labour cost these days has also increased a lot. So it is apprehended that next month when boro paddy will be harvested, the price of paddy may go down further. The marginal farmers who will be compelled to sell their products immediately after harvesting will suffer most. //////There is not need to introduce Dr. Muhammed Zafar Iqbal. Everybody knows him. He is not only a scientist and university teacher, but is also a famous writer. He is the son of a martyr of 1971. He has always been with progressive social and secular movements.//////The transit issue is not only an economic one, it's a political issue which needs careful handling. Recently, India has started building Tipaimukh barrage which will hurt our agriculture and environment as it would dry up the flow of Surma and Kushiara rivers. Tension also built up last December when Indian naval ships entered Bangladesh's waters to explore gas and oil. There are also so many unresolved issues between India and Bangladesh like water sharing, enclave transfer, Farakka problem, obstacles faced by Bangladeshi exporters while they try to export goods to India etc. //////In recent times too many cockroaches have filled the homes of many people. These cockroaches are increasing in number day by day. No one seems to take drastic action against these mighty cockroaches. And it is also not possible to 'minimize' these cockroaches with chemical spray only. These cockroaches have become used to living under any circumstances. //////There are about 15 thousand hermaphrodites in our country. They live in abject poverty. Most of the hermaphrodites are discriminated against by their families, society and state. A team of hermaphrodites comes to an urban area from village for livelihood. They are controlled by the leader (Sorderni) in society. //////Women need to be represented in the ministries as part of the AL's policy of bringing about changes. But remember they were/are not bred or groomed like Ms. Rice or Hillary Clinton of the USA. They could be made junior ministers to gather experience and be adept in the know-how of running the administration.//////Every year we can see that slight rainfall leads to water logging in Dhaka city. The water cannot pass through drains, or pass very slowly. Moreover, water overflows from the drains. Very bad smell spreads out from this water. In many places, there are no covers on drains and manholes. People are throwing whatever they can in the drains every day. They are also throwing polybags, various plastic products, coconut shell etc into the drains.//////Some days ago there was a documentary on CNN, portraying Bangladesh as a "drowning country", but to me America seems to be the real drowning country. As the economies around the world are so closely linked to America, it is going to pull them all deep down when it drowns.//////Ilias Kanchan is one of the leading film stars of this country. But in my view, as a social worker he is more important. I have never met him. Probably, I will never get the chance to meet him, but he is really rendering valuable social service. //////An editorial of 22nd March, on the subject, published in a local daily, gave a synopsis of the "Pass the buck on" syndrome of our Mayor, whose subjects (the mosquitoes) are creating a lot of problems by indiscriminately attacking peaceful law abiding citizen of the metropolis!//////In this modern age, most of the people are far, far away from religious knowledge and practices. Religion has been replaced by hypocrisy. People do not care much how they are living.

Brilliant Japanese composer and multi-instrumentalist Kitaro (born Masanori Takahashi) is obviously thinking along these lines. As part of his Love and Peace Tour 2009, the Grammy and Golden Globe winner delighted the Delhi audience with a spellbinding concert. As he asserts, My message is from the heart.

Obama's message to the Iranian people in Now Ruz (Iranian New Year) did little to appease the Iranian leaders. They continue being hostile, if not reactionary. How long can this anti-US rhetoric be maintained? Long enough, the evidence suggests but there are unforeseen elements that may make it counter-productive.//////
