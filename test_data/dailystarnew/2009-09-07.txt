Saifur Rahman in a road crash brings to an end a life that was spent largely in public service from the late 1970s onward. In the years after he joined the government of General Ziaur Rahman as commerce and then finance minister, Rahman played a pivotal role in the way Bangladesh's economy was to shape itself. He remains --- and this is to his credit --- the man who has presented the highest number of national budgets, to the country. That is testimony, in a broad sense, of his indispensability to the party and government he was part of almost to the end of his days. Saifur Rahman found himself on the national political canvas under Zia and then went on to expand his role in the two governments headed by Khaleda Zia. The economy, in a sense, came to be what he conceived it to be.//////-- Pablo Neruda//////WISDOM has a great advantage over philosophy. It is simple.

Swine flu doesn't often infect people, and the rare human cases that occurred in the past mainly affected people who had direct contact with pigs. But the current "swine flu" outbreak is different.

What does this very word change mean? Though the government has made some qualitative changes in many sectors, the change spree is to a great extent anti-democratic, anti-people and unethical. Why does the government need to replace people in high positions with their own people? Every now and then honest and efficient people are asked to resign to make room for the people of the ruling party's choice, who may be less efficient. Did "Obama" government make such changes in the administration? In our country, the politicians are eating up the very core of democracy, "respect people's will".
