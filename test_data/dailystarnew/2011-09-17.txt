With the growing use of these devices by businesses and households, the rate, at which people are constantly rejecting outdated product, is rapidly rising. Many of these are having short lifespan and not costlier to throw the old and buy the new one. These escalating obsolete and rejected electrical and electronic equipment, known as electronic-waste or e-waste, have become a significant concern to the society.//////Since the 1990s, scientists have been able to change the genetic makeup of plants and animals that are used for human consumption. These products are called genetically modified foods (GMFs), or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMFs are produced to enhance or improve the organism's natural traits. In order to produce GMFs, scientists combine genes from different organisms. For instance, researchers have added genes to plants, such as corn, to make them more nutritious or insect resistant. This is done through a process called recombinant DNA technology.//////Metro rail stops at air force red signal has been the headline of a news item published in The Daily Star on September 13, 2011, followed by another news item published in the same daily on September 14, 2011 headlined Now Louis Kahn's JS masterpiece at stake. To any conscious citizen, these news items are disturbing and arising out of reasons relatively insignificant. First one is a security concern and the second, environmental. But these can be overcome without disturbing the proposed metro.//////Prologue://////Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) is considered to be the greatest Bengali writer ever born. Although a 'myriad-minded man', he was not much confident of his English language skills. He made a clear confession of this to Ezra Pound, William Rothenstein, Ramananda Chatterjee, and his daughter Bella and niece Indira. He thought his English was not good enough to suit him fine. But the success of the English versions of his Gitanjali poems and that of his speeches in the American lecture circuit even before he had risen to prominence by winning the Nobel Prize must have proved that his fears were groundless. Researchers have explored many qualities of permanence in his English writings.//////Bangladesh is an emerging organ bazaar that has been in existence for more than a decade. It is operating by local and international patients, who buy organ within Bangladesh and then obtain the surgery mostly in India, as well as in Bangladesh, Thailand, Singapore etc. The sellers are the poor citizens, who eventually sell their body parts to get out of poverty.//////Most people think of anaesthesio-logist only as the "doctor behind the mask" who helps patients sleep during surgery without pain and who wakes them up when surgery is over.

When it was sparked in Tunisia and spread to Egypt, it was just a matter of time for the other dictatorial regimes in this region to face the similar fate. However, for the USA and its allies, the democratic Middle East has always been a hard choice to make. As the political and economic landscape of this region has attached much importance to the global peace and security, the USA and its allies never wanted to loose the grip over this region. Therefore, although the initiation of Arab Spring has jostled the USA and its allies for a while, it did not take much toll for them to come back fine.//////The hearing in the case concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary between Bangladesh and Myanmar in the Bay of Bengal has started on 8 September, 2011 at the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). Both the parties have submitted their claims on maritime boundary entitled to 12 nautical miles of territorial sea and other maritime zones. We are publishing two important maps related to the boundary delimitation between Bangladesh and Myanmar. One (Map: 1) is focused on the conflicting claims in territorial sea which covers 12 nautical miles from the base point. Another (Map: 2) shows the conflicting claims on the boundary in the exclusive economic zone, out to 200 nautical miles and in the outer continental shelf out to 390-460 nautical miles. The hearing will continue upto 24 September, 2011. //////KABUL, Afghanistan -- Raising the death toll sharply, American and Afghan officials said Wednesday that the complexity and execution of the siege of the American Embassy and NATO's headquarters in Kabul bore the hallmarks of a militant group based in Pakistan that has become one of the American military's most implacable foes.//////Mohammad A Quayum, a Bangladeshi, teaches English at the International Islamic University Malaysia and has taught at universities in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States and has published 21 books and numerous research articles.

Thus does Kristoffel Lieten, editor of //////, introduces the book, although, considering the social norms and stresses obtaining in the country, it is difficult to see a direct correlation between progress in basic education and serious child labour problem. He then proceeds to concentrate on the topic of child labour in Bangladesh, beginning with a crucial observation: The Bangladesh Child Labour Law 2006 primarily acts to prohibit hazardous work for children below 18 years old.... The implementation of the law, however, remains the key challenge. Indeed! True to form, laws abound on paper in Bangladesh, but their practical application, more often than not, falls below par. Lieten then brings up a fundamental problem that impedes scrupulous implementation of the law: The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its 2009 tri-annual assessment of the progress in Bangladesh, reiterated its concern that there is no uniform definition of the term 'child': definitions and legal provisions vary between civil law, the Convention, and //////.//////
