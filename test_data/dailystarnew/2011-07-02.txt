It happens all over the world because the enthusiasm with which they start peters out, the promises which they make become remote and the schemes which they take up lack push. This is the most charitable explanation of the Manmohan Singh government's non-performance. It has no sense of direction. How can it direct the nation?

When I asked about the stained glass window which had been installed in his wife's memory, I was told that it must have been broken. In any case, I took photos of the stained glass window behind the altar. Later in the day, I was in a photo shop which was selling old photos. //////The Indian journalist and writer Khushwant Singh was once asked about the importance of books in life. His reply came in a melange of Hindi and Urdu, pure Hindustani: ////// -lots of light. You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them. Perhaps Aldous Huxley said it in a terse statement, 'The proper study of mankind is books.'//////I was brought up in a family that was always associated with books. I still remember ////// that fascinated me in my primary school. I grew up reading Walt Disney books and collected golden tokens unheard of these days. ////// and ////// gave me thrills I can still imagine. There were days when my brother read to me tales form Sukumar Ray's ////// and ////// all of which seemed real. I remember buying the English version of the book, Select Nonsense of ////// when I visited Kolkata in the 1980s. It contained an introduction by Satyajit Ray. I wonder why some schools do not attempt enacting excerpts from it as plays or skits. They could be interesting musicals like ////// or Little Red Riding Hood.//////Midwives not only deliver babies. They do much more. They care for mothers before and after delivery. They protect the health of newborn and children. They offer family planning counselling and supplies tools. They are crucial for the communities and to the survival of women and children.//////Everyone wants to avoid back trouble, but surprisingly few of us manage to escape it.

Back pain is notoriously difficult, and expensive, to remedy.//////High blood pressure gets all of the attention, but very low blood pressure can be just as dangerous, experts say.

The extract found in cinnamon bark, called CEppt, contains the therapeutic properties.//////The insurgency in Afghanistan has expanded far beyond its stronghold in the south east. Transcending its traditional Pashtun base, the Taliban is bolstering its influence in the central-eastern provinces by installing shadow governments and tapping into the vulnerabilities of a central government crippled by corruption and deeply dependent on a corrosive war economy. Collusion between insurgents and corrupt government officials in Kabul and the nearby provinces has increased, leading to a profusion of criminal networks in the Afghan heartland. Despite efforts to combat the insurgency in the south, stability in the centre has steadily eroded. Yet, with nearly one fifth of the population residing in Kabul and its surrounding provinces, the Afghan heartland is pivotal to the planned transition from international troops to Afghan forces at the end of 2014. Given the insurgency's entrenchment so close to the capital, however, it appears doubtful that President Hamid Karzai's government will be able to contain the threat and stabilise the country by then. Countering the insurgency in these crucial areas requires the implementation of long-overdue reforms, including more robust anti-corruption efforts, stricter oversight over international aid and greater support for capacity building in the judicial and financial sectors.//////Since its independence in 1991, the government of Uzbekistan took the development initiatives for the reformation in economic and political sectors. As the country was under the structure of the Soviet Union so for the sake of the development as an independent country the government needed to take such initiatives. But from the very beginning, Uzbekistan has followed its own way of political and economic development, showing little interest for political pluralism or an open economy while preserving several old principles of Soviet structures. Now-a-days, the reformation process of the country has been questioned by the political realities because no development is possible without a sound political structure. The country is ruled by dictatorship, headed by President Islam Karimov, with no legal opposition parties and no free elections since its inception as an independent state. The economy of the country is closed, which is largely run for the benefit of a small elite group of families in or close to the government. The existing political realities of the country have made the reformation process difficult to be implemented. //////Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards fired 14 missiles in an exercise Tuesday (June 28, 2011), one of them a medium-range weapon capable of striking Israel or US targets in the Gulf, state media said.

It is hugely informative, scholarly in its foundation and yet an eminently readable book. Through this book the writer has filled a gap that has been there since Bangladesh came into being.//////Translated from the Norwegian by Ingrid Christophersen, //////, authored by Asne Seierstad, gives us an overview of war-ravaged Afghanistan and its courageous, resilient people after the fall of the Taliban. Written by a journalist, it appears in a literary form; it is at once well-researched, keenly-observed reportage and a very readable story book. //////, a little magazine on poetry published from Chattagram (Chittagong in Anglican terms), has brought out a special issue on Rabindranath Tagore on the sesquicentennial birth anniversary of the Nobel winning Bengali poet. On this great occasion, which is being observed across the world through the initiative of the United National Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), scores of books and periodicals dealing with the works and life of this internationally acclaimed author and activist have flooded the West Bengal book markets. However, worthy publications on the poet are only a few from Bangladesh and among those ////// can certainly draw the attention of many.//////
