It is a rare achievement for a semi-government organisation in Bangladesh. I would like to take this opportunity to make a request to BPC. A good number of domestic and foreign tourists go to Rangamati for boating in the picturesque Kaptai Lake. The cruise boats in the lake, including the one belonging to BPC, use shallow tube well engine to run. This engine makes deafening noise and emits black smoke continuously, from burning diesel, and thus turns the boat ride in the lake into a nightmare. The noise and the smoke of the boat pollute the environment of the lake as well. //////Business today as it appears is not business with conscience. It is devoid of any social responsibility. As a result, people's sufferings know no bounds. The price of essential commodities is skyrocketing. Are all the businessmen aware of the cut-throat profit many of their fellow businessmen make at the cost of the suffering millions? Business syndicate dictating price was not heard in the old days. There existed a healthy competition among businessmen to get hold of the customers as much as possible. We know that in undivided Bengal businessmen coming from different parts of India did their business with honesty earning the hearts of the clients. Those businessmen were satisfied with their minimum profit and so were the customers, getting products at a fair price. Both the parties -- the sellers and the buyers -- remained satisfied and happy. The present-day Bangladesh is a far cry from those olden days. //////Bangladesh is passing through a purple patch in cricket at the moment, as they went so close to winning the Asia Cup.

The BCB should realise that there is no alternative to playing more international matches. When the Premier League ends, there is no domestic cricket too. But if Bangladesh does not play well in T20, everyone will blame the players, not the BCB.//////Bangladesh is surrounded by the seven sister states of India except in the South. The country needs a large number of cattle but do not import it from India. It is true that thousands of cattle are smuggled from India into Bangladesh regularly. Border Security Force (BSF) of India kills cattle traders on a regular fashion, which is not acceptable. Bangladesh and India are neighbours and friendly countries. Bangladesh import many things from India. If Bangladesh imports cattle from the seven sister states of India, cattle smuggling would stop. Indian cattle growers in the seven sister states will get good price and Bangladesh will be able to meet its local demand. Border killings would also stop and this will strengthen the relation between the two neighbours. In this circumstance, I would like to urge the governments of Bangladesh and India to sign a deal for importing cattle from India to Bangladesh as soon as possible.//////I have a feeling that we Bangladeshis miserably lack the qualities of patriotism and fellow feeling on which hinges the well-being of a person, society and the nation.
