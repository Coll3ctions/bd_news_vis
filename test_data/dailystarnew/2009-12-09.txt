On the first day of the conference, where as many as 192 nations are taking part and which will be joined later by heads of government and state, these risks were highlighted. Perhaps Yvo de Boers, the UN climate chief, put it in perspective when he noted that the time for formal statements is over, that indeed the moment is here and now for governments across the world to take concrete action. A major component of such action must be a deal that will have the world's rich and emerging economies promise to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. //////TAKING a comprehensive approach with regard to supervision of our borders would be our advice to those entrusted with the task.

This and practically all other ills of our hapless society can be traced to the relentless force of 'Population Pressure' on our resources and psyche. In our country human life seems to the cheapest commodity and this accords with the laws of economics that the value of any commodity is dependent on its 'relative scarcity'. Successive governments in Bangladesh have failed to curb the explosion of population as a priority, often misguidedly believing that a large population is a source of economic strength. So people are what we now have in utmost abundance on every square foot of soil or water surface of Bangladesh, and that is why according to the economic principle it is now the cheapest commodity. It is no wonder people are dying on the roads, the rivers, of malnutrition and ill health, and as victims of criminal gangs, unbridled corruption, extortion, etc.//////The Sundarbans is one of the most beautiful and largest mangrove forests in Bangladesh and it is the largest remaining tract of mangrove forests in the world. The forest covers 10,000km of which about 6,000 are in Bangladesh. It became inscribed as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1997. Royal Bengal Tiger as well as numerous fauna including different species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes etc are found here. But the bad news is that the Sundarbans has a population of over 4 million and they are spoiling its beauty. The population pressure resulted in half of this eco-region's mangrove forests cut down to supply the fuel wood. Other natural resources are also extracted from these forests by this large population. The Sundarbans play an important role in the economy of the south-western region of Bangladesh as well as in the national economy. Now it is contesting to be a part of the Seven Wonders of the World.//////Failure of the traffic light based automated system of traffic management was reported in the front page of most dailies on November 23. This is nothing but the natural result of most drivers' normal response to usual traffic management system, where hand signals by traffic policemen supersedes traffic lights! Drivers are used to manual traffic control, so even with the red light they will go on driving! They naturally wait for the whistle and hand signal before stopping! This is what they have been used to at all times.//////A mugging story on a busy road of the Dhaka city is basically a glaring evidence of poor law and order situation in our country, especially in Dhaka.//////One of the UK's best known scientists, Professor James Lovelock, says only a catastrophe will prompt the world to tackle the threat of climate change seriously. He also said: In late 1930 when I was a student we knew that war was imminent, but there was no clear idea of what to do about it. We think that something unpleasant may soon happen but we are as confused over what to do about it as we were in 1938. Our response so far is just an attempt to appease.//////I am not at all religious, but even I was flabbergasted seeing the distorted mentality of people. The other day I was coming back home from Dhanmondi when I saw a bus sporting a nice advertisement on its back. The advertisement informed consumers about the chance to get a free butcher for the upcoming Eid if they answered a very clever question. //////We can and we build the mega sea beach from Cox's Bazar to Teknaf as Asia's greatest tourist attraction. If Tajmahal is Asia's most beautiful monument and people from all over the world flock to Agra, why does the most panoramic and longest sea beach of Cox's Bazar of Bangladesh fail to quench the thirst of the people all over the globe?//////Corporate governance has become a buzzword in the corporate world, especially when the latest global financial crisis originated in the U.S.A. due to poor governance of financial institutions. Therefore, recently corporate governance which replicates a mechanism to mitigate the conflict of interests among the stakeholders of a corporation, has also received increased attention from our regulatory bodies.//////After the historic Supreme Court verdict on the killing of Sheikh Mujib many people have claimed that it's a glorious triumph of the rule of law in Bangladesh. However, we must not forget that this verdict was made possible because its facilitation was one of the foremost priorities of the ruling party. The family members of the incumbent prime minister were the direct victims of the brutal massacre of 1975. Obviously, no one can possibly condone the killers of his/her family members and as the most powerful person of the nation she was firmly determined to bring the killers to justice. //////Well, in the careless utterances (or mutterings) of many of our great leaders vagaries abound. I would have given the whole episode a rather farcical pass. But the fact that the question was raised by the personal physician (I suppose he is competent and more of a doctor than a politician) of a sitting PM, it becomes an issue of national importance and of national security. This needs to be delved further, and if true, proper medical and legal intervention is in order.//////Women have basically achieved parity in participation in most areas of undergraduate and coursework postgraduate study. However, there are still some areas such as engineering and architecture where women are under represented. Again, there are fewer women these days undertaking post graduate study. This is partly due to financial restraints and less funding options to undertake this level of study. We feel more emphasis is required to make all careers at all levels of education more accessible to women. Girls in general have excellent completion rates and results at junior and senior high school level. //////Sri Lanka's former military chief who led troops to victory over Tamil separatists in May said he fears fugitive rebels will try to assassinate him during his presidential election campaign.//////Delegates to a pivotal climate conference welcomed an Obama administration move Monday to regulate greenhouse gases under existing clean air law, but said they still expect more.//////Google search is getting eyes and ears, moving beyond typed key words to let people scour the Internet with mobile telephone cameras or spoken words in multiple languages.//////The UN's top weather expert warned yesterday that the world is in its hottest decade on record as climate negotiators plunged into talks seeking a historic deal on cutting carbon emissions.//////Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik has said that substantial evidence regarding India's interference in Pakistan's internal affairs has been handed over to the Foreign Office, which will take it up at an appropriate forum.//////Amnesty International called on the Philippine government yesterday to revoke martial law in a southern province, where troops cracked down on a powerful clan and its armed supporters blamed for the massacre of 57 people.//////The United Nations urged Nepal's government and opposition Maoists to exercise restraint after deadly clashes between police and landless settlers in the west of the country.//////British billionaire Richard Branson unveiled a commercial rocket plane here that will allow tourists a chance to view the Earth and experience weightlessness from sub orbital space.//////Eight youths were killed and 26 injured when students descending a crowded staircase after evening classes at a school in central China lost their footing amid a crush of bodies, state media and the local government reported yesterday.//////President Hamid Karzai yesterday condemned the death of six civilians during a Nato raid as US Defence Secretary Robert Gates vowed US troop reinforcements would keep civilian deaths to a minimum.//////A report said yesterday that the high-level talks between the United States and Japan on the relocation of an American military base have been suspended.//////EU foreign ministers were seeking common ground yesterday on the vexed issue of a future Palestinian state, after an initial proposal that east Jerusalem should be the capital angered Israel.//////President Barack Obama's envoy began a rare trip to North Korea yesterday for the highest-level talks with the communist nation in more than a year as a senior US official warned of strong sanctions against Pyongyang unless it rejoins international nuclear talks.//////President Hamid Karzai said yesterday that Afghanistan lacked the resources to fund its security forces for the next 15 to 20 years, appealing for foreign aid to stand up the police and army.//////US prosecutors have charged a Chicago man with involvement in the deadly Mumbai (Bombay) attacks of a year ago.//////A German visitor was caught trying to leave New Zealand with 23 geckos and 20 skinks hidden in his underwear, a court was told.//////A Serbian court fined President Boris Tadic 400 euros (593 dollars) for drinking champagne, in contravention of an alcohol ban in football stadiums, to toast Serbia's World Cup qualification.//////Thai customs officials said yesterday they had arrested a Pakistani man at Bangkok's main international airport with 98 aluminium foil packages in his stomach containing more than a kilo of heroin.//////Warfaze has become a legend in contemporary Bangladeshi music scene right from the band's inception in 1984. Known as a hard rock and heavy metal band, the number of their fans only kept on increasing, crossing generations. And why not! When they started almost 2 decades ago, the average Bangladeshi music enthusiasts was not keen on rock. Some said this was the devil's music. As rock and metal went through an evolution all around the world, in Bangladesh as well we had our very own icons. As rock and metal caught on in Bangladesh, Warfaze never had to look back.//////Britto Arts Trust, Bangladesh and Visiting Arts (from UK) jointly organised a two-month long international experimental workshop, titled 1 Mile2, which ended on December 4 through a daylong exhibition.

In the course of the festival, Padatik and Natyajan staged their productions. Other groups from Delhi, Assam and Kolkata also performed at the festival. //////THE previous piece tried for a dissection of the hard reality of climate diplomacy, which now hovers around the few major emitters, both from the developed and the developing countries. The UNFCCC-led universal multilateralism has been relegated to some non-voting observer status in the whole drama. The walkout of the 51 African countries for a day on November 4 in Barcelona, led by the Ethiopian leader, is a loud protest, but it seems to have no significant impact on the remaining two days of deliberations. //////IRONICALLY, one of the great injustices prevalent in many of our societies today is that those who produce our food are often impoverished. In recent years, the struggles of indebted farmers and migrant field workers have increasingly gained attention as food prices have risen and rural poverty has increased. On the other hand, the plight of our fishers, and in particular our small-scale fishers, has rarely been considered. In ignoring their problems, we have created a crisis that now confronts us all.//////A man in a black suit walks into a courthouse and says to the duty lawyer.
