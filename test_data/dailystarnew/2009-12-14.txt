Today, it is especially significant that we recall yet once more the brave men and women --- academics, journalists, writers, doctors, et cetera --- who were picked up by the infamous al-Badr and Razakar goon squads and done to death on the eve of the liberation of Bangladesh. Those who died at the hands of the collaborators of the Pakistan occupation army, obviously with the nod of the army, were like the rest of us individuals who awaited the arrival of freedom with huge anticipation and a multitude of expectations. And those who murdered them thought, in all the darkness that conspiracy can muster, that by picking these men and women off they would be maiming the new, emerging nation at birth. Nothing could be more satisfying for a soon to be defeated force than plunging its already bloodied teeth one last time in the vigour and vitality of oncoming freedom.//////The enactment by of the Consumer Rights Protection act 2009, to safeguard the interest of the consumers was very timely and welcome step.

And there was precious little that the consumer could do and had very little scope to have their grievances redressed. //////Till the BNP's just concluded cou-ncil the party had indeed been in an existential problem.

If sometimes she comes in touch with Radhika she would take a bath immediately to get purified.//////The green car has arrived! It heralds the end of the era of the gas guzzlers merrily polluting our environment for the past decades, as reported in your pages on December 4.

The number of cases of dengue fever and its deadlier form has increased considerably in the city. If you take statistics from the diagnostic labs, you can easily see the worsening situation in Dhaka. The DCC administration seems to be asleep. People have got apathy. The media is busy with BNP's internal clashes on the eve of its conference. Who will care for us? It seems that the mayor is not getting the BNP nomination for the upcoming mayoral election, so he just remains insensitive to mosquitoes. //////After the Taliban slaughtered scores of Pakistanis in a Rawalpindi mosque on Friday, Dec. 4, Lahore's Daily Times editorialised on De. 6: "Pakistanis have become almost resigned to the daily fate of suicide bombing and other attacks by the barbaric terrorists who pretend to speak in the name of Islam.
