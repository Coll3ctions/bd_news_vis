Actually, the present environmental problems call for more environmentally benign technology. In the context, many believe that the solution of today's social and environmental problems is possible through more and better technology -- not from less technology. However, it requires achieving a radical change there like a shift away from hydrocarbon-based energy technologies to greener options like renewable energy source, or innovative technology to treat pollutant or adaptation technology to adjust to the climate change impacts.//////CURITIBA has become a model for developed and developing countries alike when it comes to environmentally sustainable transport, one that Dhaka can learn a lot from.//////Forest Mensuration provides forest inventory, forest resource monitoring, measurement principles, stand structure parameters, different sampling methods and applications.

His biographies called ////// (1929) and ////// (1930) promoted Indian spiritual ideologies across the world. All such facts have meticulously been researched by the Bengali writer Abantikumar Sanyal (1926-2007), who was born in tradition-rich village Korokdi in district Faridpur and who has two books on Rolland and two translations of Rolland's books to his credit.//////Last summer, my wife informed me that she was planning to take some of her students to Bangladesh. Interesting! I remarked, and went back to the newspaper story I was reading about a new archeological discovery in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, an area we visited a few years ago. I am not sure if it was my apparent lack of interest in her project, or my total immersion in my new passion, Egyptology, that prompted her next remark. Well, if you join us, you will be able to travel in Bangladesh almost for free. That added attraction obviously tipped the scales for me.//////22-year-old Fahim was diagnosed with epilepsy, a recurrent seizure disorder 12 years back.

The main objective of that war was to destroy the Taliban that held power and had given sanctuary to Al Qaeda for its operations against US and western interests and capture Osama Ben Laden for allegedly masterminding the 9/11 attacks. Although the Talibans have been driven out of power, they have found new and impregnable sanctuary in the no man's land between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Osama Ben Laden is still free and the Talibans are on a resurgent mode in Afghanistan.//////On 22 July, the Government of Pakistan announced that it has decided to extend the term of the army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani (58) by three years.

The Arrow 3 will make it possible for Israel to intercept long-range ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction from outside the atmosphere.//////A major problem involved in dealing with Emily Dickinson is the essentially reclusive nature of her individuality. In death she has been what she was in life, a symbol of obscurity and distance for those who would study her poetry and with it her personality. And then comes another problem. And that is fundamentally the difficulty in an understanding as well as appreciation of her poetry. Scholars of American literature, and not just in the United States, have gone to various lengths in attempting explanations of her poetic works and yet, in more instances than one, have quite been unable to present Dickinson in clearly outlined dimensions before readers. That has been quite a tragedy.//////Autobiographies are generally interesting for the obvious reason that they deal with graphic and narrative accounts of different events and that often range from the early days of the individual to the last ones. When the writer has varied experiences professionally and otherwise finding an opportunity of traversing in different occupational fields at times in somewhat conflicting ones an autobiography may be even more exciting. Mosaic Of Memories more or less falls in this category as the autobiographer seeks to bring the readers to the changing pattern of six decades that cover the period between his initial schooling and the last of several professions he has been in including a politician contesting national elections, despite the fact that this stint has not been very fascinating as far as electoral success is concerned. But the bottom line is that the author had the unique opportunity of working as a teacher, civil servant, international bureaucrat, lawyer and last but not the least politician. Whether politics is a profession or not like the earlier professions of A.T.M.Shamsul Haque may be a subject of intense debate, but this in the nearly last phase of his career definitely provided enthusiasm and stimulation to a person whose student life especially during prime time in college and at Dhaka university was not devoid of student politics that was also somewhat inextricably linked with the national political psyche. //////Human life can turn tragic corners without any notice and yet leave traces on the cycle of eternity, leave stigma that refuses to go away. Nicky Dillon and her father stumble upon a new born baby left in the snow in the woods. They take the baby to the nearby hospital and save the infant. However, the hospital authority notifies the police and the inquiries begin. From this moment Nicky and her father's lives change and overnight they become the hot news of New Hampshire, the place where they live.//////Mario Puzo's classic work ////// was immensely popular when it first hit bookstores throughout the globe. Based on the saga of the Corleones, the topmost crime family of New York, the much acclaimed novel and probably the best known work of Puzo wowed the readers . So it was not a surprise when it got its exposure on the silver screen of Hollywood. But the book in review, ////// is not a sequel to the original Puzo masterpiece or the script of any Hollywood flicks with Pierce Brosnan in the leading role. So Godfather enthusiasts are likely to be a little bit disappointed by the feat of Mark Winegardner, who has incorporated new characters and made experimentations with some characters in the plot of the story. But on the whole, Winegardner deserves kudos for this brilliant piece of work.//////
