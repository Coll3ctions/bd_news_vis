This can encourage unstable or brain-washed individuals to think they have the right to persecute and even murder those who disagree with them, even members of their own faith community. //////Two of the few occasions when Dhaka city actually runs out of sweets and the sweet manufacturers get nastily busy to refill their stocks are when the nationwide SSC and HSC exam results are published.

My operator told me to dial a special number to get connected to RAB, police, fire service or blood bank during any crisis period or in emergency. //////Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslims fast for the sake of Allah and to offer more prayers than usual. Muslims believe Ramadan to be an auspicious month for the revelations of Allah to humankind, being the month in which the first verses of the holy Qur'an were revealed, on Lailatul Qadr, to the prophet Muhammad. In the Qur'an, Allah proclaims that "fasting has been written down (as obligatory) upon you, as it was upon those before you." //////Let me applaud and endorse the views expressed by Sir Frank Peters about corporal punishment. It is sad that most teachers do not know about the UN Convention on the Rights of Children. The teachers require a thorough orientation to increase their awareness levels. The authorities can think of introducing a feedback system through which the outgoing students of a class can give an assessment of the teachers who taught them during the year under review. A dispassionate assessment of the feedback will help in improving the system.//////It's unfortunate that in our country constructive criticism is almost non-existent. When we criticize something we generally use a range of disgraceful words that often create unhealthy conflicts and confusions in our society. As a consequence, criticism often becomes synonymous to harassment. We fail to understand that every individual or institution has its own flaws and limitations. //////There is considerable debate about the date of birth of Khaleda Zia. I do not want to participate in that debate. Even if her birthday is on 15th of August, she should not celebrate it publicly. Those who show their eagerness to celebrate it publicly can not be her well-wishers. //////It is very much disgusting to read in the newspaper that a group of advertising agencies in connivance with the traffic police is making unauthorised police boxes and are using them for advertising without having prior permissions from the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC). The DCC does not know about these police boxes that are being built without their knowledge. //////Every year during the month of Ramadan the prices of essentials like sugar, cooking oil, brinjal, cucumber, mint, cumin leaves, tomato, carrot, rice, chicken, beef, mutton and fish go up. Extortion by traders and business people reach intolerable heights. Even the rates of bribes increase in this holy month! Lives of the common people become very difficult. We wonder whether Ramadan is a month of sacrifice or a month of extortion by greedy traders. We think a consumers' rights movement should be waged to combat these anti-people greedy practices.//////Road accidents are being occurred so frequently that we take it as a common phenomenon of our life, and we do not take enough action to minimise the incidents of accident. Every day some of us lose our relatives and friends in road accidents. How to curb this? Firstly, I think we need to emphasize on raising awareness; we have to make drivers understand that they should care not only for their own lives but for the passengers' lives also. Media can play a vital role in this. //////Commerce minister gives solution to price hike of essentials //////British Prime Minister David Cameron unveiled yesterday new measures to end the worst riots in decades, and admitted he had considered ordering the army to quell the violence.//////Police began raiding houses across London yesterday to make arrests over the riots that rocked the British capital, with more than 100 warrants issued already, a senior Scotland Yard officer said.//////The fires which have raged in London's worst rioting for decades have forged a sense of community rarely seen in the British capital, with Sikhs in the western borough of Southall leading the way.//////Prime Minister David Cameron said yesterday the government was looking at banning potential troublemakers from using social media, after it was used to organise riots across Britain this week.//////Syrian forces killed at least 14 people yesterday while the army stormed another two towns in pursuit of anti-regime protesters, defying Western calls for action after a "chilling" UN Security Council briefing.//////Nepal edged closer to political crisis yesterday with the prime minister confirming a threat to resign at the weekend ahead of a deadline to revive the country's stalled peace process.//////Myanmar's democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi is to hold a second round of talks with the country's nominally-civilian government, her spokesman said yesterday, amid tentative signs of a thaw in relations.//////A delegation of Arab foreign ministers will urge permanent members of the Security Council next week to vote for Palestinian UN membership, a top Palestinian official said yesterday.//////Chinese artist Ai Weiwei believed he was "close to death" during the more than 80 days he was held in a secret police detention centre, a source close to the artist told the BBC.//////A Republican lawmaker accused the Obama administration Wednesday of jeopardizing national security by cooperating with a Hollywood director planning a film on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.//////Rupert Murdoch won boardroom backing Wednesday to remain at the helm of News Corp as he worked to shift attention from the phone-hacking scandal to his media behemoth's healthy bottom line.//////UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said in Seoul yesterday that North Korea should be given humanitarian aid regardless of "political considerations or any other calculations".//////Indian President Pratibha Patil yesterday rejected mercy pleas from three Tamils convicted of the 1991 assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.//////Five Nato soldiers were killed by a bomb in southern Afghanistan yesterday, as the Taliban rejected a US claim to have killed the fighters who shot down an American helicopter killing 38 troops.//////Israel's interior minister has given final approval for the construction of 1,600 new settler homes in east Jerusalem, his spokesman said yesterday, prompting a furious reaction from Palestinian officials.//////A female suicide attacker and a handcart bomb targeted Pakistani police yesterday, killing seven people in the first deadly attacks to hit the northwest during Ramadan, officials said.//////An alleged mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings was extradited from Pakistan to Indonesia yesterday, after his arrest in the town where Osama bin Laden was killed, a security official said.//////President Hamid Karzai, who has led Afghanistan for nearly a decade, said yesterday he would not seek a third term in office at an election due to coincide with the end of Nato combat operations in 2014.//////A splinter group of notorious hacker collective Anonymous was fomenting support Wednesday for a plan to "kill" online social networking star Facebook.//////Seasoned Lalon singer and teacher Shofi Mandal was born on December 13, 1953 at Daulatpur, Kushtia.

They won't know which is what or, for that matter, which side is telling the truth.//////Our son lives next to a Turkish mosque on Kingsland Road in Hackney, where some of London's worst mob violence has occurred. When looters rampaged through Hackney last weekend, there were few police officers to stop them and residents had to chase them off with butcher knives, truncheons and baseball bats. Vigilante action succeeded where normal policing failed. //////Patriarchy in high political callings seems to be waning in direct proportion to pedigree, dynastic lineage or sibling connection waxing.//////The US appears to be sinking into a quagmire in Afghanistan. The number of US troops on the ground keeps rising, and the number of troops killed and wounded keeps rising as well. The much-trumpeted operation in the Helmand River valley didn't succeed in permanently removing resistance fighters. Since that was its sole purpose, it was a failure. The planned attack on Kandahar has been delayed, and many outlying operating bases have been abandoned by US forces as too costly to hold. Isn't the United States losing the war on the ground in Afghanistan?//////India's stature as the world's largest democracy is redoubtable, except for perturbations -- attacks against minorities -- that often threaten the very foundation of democracy. Time and again the polarised mentality of certain sections of the politicians coupled with the embittered communal history of the land seems to shake the edifice of Indian democracy. Repeated attacks on the "freedom and existence" of minorities in India, unless effectively checked, pose not only a democratic challenge but also civilisational threats to India's millions of religious and ethnic minorities. //////Perhaps Bangladesh government's most significant decision in realising the Digital Bangladesh dream is to provide 3G (third generation) technology licences which will be issued through auction.//////The newest version of Apple Inc's popular iPhone has already hit the Chinese market -- the fake market that is.//////Asus, a leading computer manufacturer in the world, has brought its latest notebook A53E in the local market, says a press release.//////Culture-changing technology outshined crude oil with iPhone and iPad maker Apple eclipsing ExxonMobil as the most valuable company in the world based on the value of its stock.//////If you're anything like me, your cellphone and its built-in camera is always on you, while your digital camera gathers dust at home.//////
