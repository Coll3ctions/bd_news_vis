Due to mismanagement, corruption and irregularities in the sector, the country sustained a loss of Tk 10,626 crore in 2005-06 fiscal year alone.

It really did not have a choice, seeing that the High Court has served a stay order on the EC's earlier action of inviting the faction despite the brewing conflict between the reformists and pro-Khaleda Zia groups in the party. We recall that we had made it clear in an editorial that the EC appeared to take sides by their move and suggested it should have sought legal advice before issuing a letter to any of the BNP factions. We did so because we could clearly see the potential for controversy about its neutrality that underlay the EC's action.//////General Harunur Rashid has been doing an admirable job of keeping us all posted on the need to resist the anti-liberation elements which have, of late, been rearing their heads. His careful and determined handling of conditions, especially through his efforts to organise the surviving sector commanders of the War of Liberation, is proof, if proof at all were needed, that the spirit which informed our view of the war and underlined our participation in that war is yet alive, and that it only needs men of courage and patriotism to rekindle it in order for the dark forces endangering our liberty to be sent packing.//////For the first time since 1990, we are facing the aftermath of a severe cyclonic storm that has killed hundreds and devastated countless homes.

Our country has faced a lot of troubles before and we are a nation accustomed to coping with natural disasters. We shall overcome this time as well and move forward for building a stronger nation.//////Syed Badrul Ahsan has doubtless a facile pen. By my watch, he is the best among his peers in Bangladeshi journalism in crafting precision English syntax. But unfortunately, in his post-editorial titled Of Suhrawardy Udyan, of history and golf printed in your daily on 14 November, 2007, his thoughts have gone off-key. //////The present caretaker government closed four big jute mills. Thousands of workers lost their jobs. Poor workers (and also their families) do not know their future destinations. I am deeply shocked by it. //////Yaba has been sorted out to be a dangerous drug which may damage the entire nervous system of an individual if taken on a regular basis. //////People were waiting for news of the catastrophic hurricane. As the news-craving people turned on their radios for news, they were disappointed by the constant round of laughter over fan mails, song dedications and non-stop hit tracks that our dear private radio stations were playing. The news update that so many people were waiting for was never aired. //////I am writing this letter in the same tune as one of your writer Nur Jahan from Chittagong.//////I came across a news item in the UAE media about a Bangladeshi labourer suffering from plastic anemia who was treated in a UAE hospital for certain months for free. He was then sent back to BD as he was an illegal entrant to this country. He is in BD now and apparently no hospital in BD is ready to treat him, though money is no issue for him. This man's name is Abdul Hakim and since he is not educated he cannot communicate his problems. I seek the readers' assistance in finding a volunteer who can guide him to the doctors. Let me reiterate, he does not need financial assistance at this point of time. His number is 01715979961.//////Khaleda Zia's incompetent and corrupt government created such a situation in Bangladesh that those who were paid by our poor people to arrest criminals and fight crime didn't perform their duties, because they were afraid that they might lose their jobs. In some cases people even lost their lives for doing their job. According to a DS report (Alarming use of Yaba in posh areas, 28 Oct), a narcotics officer said, We did not dare to challenge the suspected traders though we knew well how some people in luxury cars were peddling the drug. In the same report, a high official of the police said, Most of the users are students of private universities, colleges and A and O-levels. They thought they were above the law in the last five years. But the situation changed after the caretaker government came to office. We have been working without interference for the last one year and the recent hauls are a result of those sincere efforts. So much for our democracy! //////We are going through some democratic process/filtration. That "Democracy means what people want" is a totally wrong concept. Democracy means what the majority wants. And the majority means constitution. Therefore, we should strictly follow our constitution. It should not be left useless. We have two options, either change the constitution (saving war criminals) or implement it quickly. If it is implemented politically then the country may again be unsteady. If anyone(s/he may be a victim of the war) wants to implement it, then the best s/he can do is to personally file a case against the war criminals. What the present government can do is to ensure proper justice. If the government files a case against the war criminals, then the situation may get chaotic. I personally believe in forgiveness. But forgiveness should be viewed from the angle of the victims. Personally, I don't like politics which is based on religion but again it should be viewed from the angle of the majority i.e. constitution. Sooner or later, people will realise the negative effects of politics based on religion. Anyway, we must not forget the actual definition of "Democracy" which is majority or constitution. //////To the best of my knowledge, Illegal VoIP operators use either land lines or mobile phone networks to re-route voice/data/call upon termination. How about taking a temporary measure to turn off all the land lines as well as mobile phone network for the period of interruption resulting from sabotage, to take away the means to re-route illegally terminated calls/voice/data. This measure would leave no incentive for the illegal operators to cut off the submarine cable. And, this should be strictly a temporary measure until the government/BTTB has a backup cable line installed.//////From my childhood, I have been noticing that top level positions e.g. prime minister, minister, secretary, additional secretary, chairman of any commission or bureau, etc. carry a lot of prestige, and those who hold the offices, barring a few exceptions, behave like being esteemed. But I wonder why it is so. Aren't they public servants? In that case, they are supposed to be humble, unassuming, unprivileged, subservient, obliging and all the other synonyms you could find in the dictionary. //////A thousand people dead in the cyclone probably does not sound like a big number to a lot of Bangladeshis. After all, no politics is involved in these deaths. Why would a TV station or a newspaper bother to send their crew to the remote village of far south to see whether people are prepared? There is no political party quarrel involved in that news. Why would the media bother to analyse whether the government can evacuate so many people in time, whether it is 30 lakh or 15 lakh? //////Authorities said yesterday they have begun releasing some of the thousands of opposition supporters detained since emergency rule was imposed earlier this month, while Pakistan's military leader departed for a visit to Saudi Arabia.//////Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Tuesday that any future peace deal would not be implemented until the Palestinian Authority retakes control of the Gaza Strip. //////Tribal elders launched efforts yesterday to end bloody sectarian clashes in a Pakistani tribal area, which have claimed at least 112 lives, officials and residents said. //////Southeast Asian leaders opened annual talks Tuesday in an atmosphere poisoned by Myanmar, after the military junta undermined the bloc's credibility by excluding a UN envoy from the summit. //////Pakistani police baton-charged a protest by journalists and rights activists in the southern city of Karachi and arrested more than 140 media workers, witnesses and senior journalists said.
