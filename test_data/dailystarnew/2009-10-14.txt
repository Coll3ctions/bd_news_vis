In time, as a result of Bangladesh's War of Liberation, the second capital became Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, housing the Jatiyo Sangsad and the sprawling verdant area around it. Conceived and shaped into form and substance by the reputed Louis Kahn, the area was expected to maintain its pristine nature and serve as a proper and elegant symbol of Bangladesh's democratic politics. That, unfortunately, appears to have been an aim much to be trifled with. As a report and a photograph in yesterday's issue of this newspaper show, for yet one more time the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar complex is under grievous assault and this time in a way that can only leave the entire structural pattern of the area mutilated.//////THERE appears to be no let up in the rise of prices of vegetables and daily consumer items. We saw a comedy being played out in the month of Ramadan when the FBBCCI and the ministry of commerce through the so-called joint efforts of market surveillance were successful in doing nothing at all to check price hike.

Statistics will bear out the assertion. //////FOREIGN Minister Dipu Moni makes a point. It is one that all journalists, especially those with a fascination for foreign diplomats based in Bangladesh, ought to take note of.

Is this not against humanity because they are staying now under the open sky in rainy season which is a pathetic scene because they are human beings too. As far as I know about 12,000 unregistered Rohingya refugees illegally intruded into Bangladesh a few years ago. Actually they are political refugees because they were deprived of their fundamental rights in Myanmar and had severe restrictions imposed upon them. They have been compelled to leave their native Arakan in search of livelihood and justice or a political solution. They do not have any means of daily earning. They are passing their days in polythene sheds without adequate food and other essentials. As far as I know, they are expecting a permanent solution to their issues and then they will be back to their homeland under UN guarantee. //////The ship breaking industry of the largest breaking zone of this country has turned out to be a death trap for the helpless workers who work there for a mere pittance. On an average a labourer dies almost every day as the job entails risk--an accidental fire here, an explosion there and so on. Even if they survive they suffer from deadly diseases as a result of their contact with the toxic elements. Sometimes they sustain ugly injuries that force them to retire and join the ranks of the disabled.//////Although Bangladesh is primarily considered an agrarian economy, industry now makes a significant contribution to GDP of the country. There are industrial zones pivoting around principal urban centres of Bangladesh. Besides, various small and medium scale industries are scattered all over the country. A recent survey conducted by the DoE (Department of Environment) notes that more than 1200 industries discharge about 35,000 cubic meter wastes that leads to environmental degradation. In my view to save the environment from industrial pollution, the government should adopt the following pollution control strategies://////The editorial of The Daily Star of dated 2 October 2009 depicting the nature's fury in large part of Asia is very timely and a call for our government and the people to undertake emergency preparedness plan for a high intensity earthquake here in Bangladesh that is not a remote possibility. The editorial will also promote our image as sympathizers to the suffering survivors of the disasters and bring us all closer to one another in regional and global perspective.//////Brian Cloughley's fascinating article, analysing in details, the US duplicity on this vital issue, is a must-read article for all. It was published in a local English daily on October 6th, and is worth being reprinted as many have missed it! I hope that all our newspapers reprint this article next weekend. It lays bare the US duplicity against peaceful Muslim nations and their wanton destruction. The article is unbelievable; and sends shivers down the spine!//////We all know that time and tide wait for none and also that time is money but still we are forced to waste time on commuting. The buses are broken and overcrowded and the drivers drive recklessly and there is traffic jam everywhere! //////It is a tradition that the ministers, chiefs of three forces, high ranking officials and foreign ambassadors will be at the airport at the time of arrival and departure of our head of the government. But so many people's presence at the airport creates many problems and it is a wastage of time. //////On 5th October, World Teachers' Day was observed. Along with many other countries Bangladesh too observed this day.//////Almost all the secondary roads in Gulshan-Banani area are in dilapidated condition. They are full of potholes, lumps and bumps etc. We have to drive through these roads every day and the broken roads cause damage to our cars and also to the passengers. Bad conditions narrow the road width and add to already existing intolerable traffic jam. Rickshaws, CNG scooters get broken down easily. Rainfall and resultant cesspools smudge the clothes of walkers.//////As I entered the shopping complex, a placard drew me near a table. At the back of the table a gentleman was standing.//////The government enhanced service charges of public hospitals recently. It is true that maintenance costs of public hospital have increased with the increase of the prices of inputs and remunerations of health personnel. The purchasing power of services of public in general has also increased in recent years. Even then, more than 40% people in Bangladesh are very poor. Considering the ground reality, increase of service charge is inevitable. But the increase should have been rational, considering the poverty and helplessness of common people. //////I am very shocked to see/hear the death of so many animals in Dhaka Zoo. This place is a great amusement spot for me and my brother but now I hear that all the animals have fallen sick, they are not getting medicines and good care and they are dying. I feel too sad. I am also very angry and displeased with the zoo officials. It is the callous attitude of these officials which is costing the lives of innocent animals. //////The 2009 ICC Champions Trophy was a One Day International cricket tournament held in South Africa between 22 September and 5 October, at Wanderers Stadium and Centurion Park.

Two teams from two groups of four qualified for the semi-finals, and the final was staged in Centurion on 5 October. //////The famous Italian film director Federico Fellini used to call a change of scene or a turnaround, Volta. In other words, a new scene was called Volta by him. After the two years of the military backed caretaker government rule and after the Dec 29 parliamentary elections, we also expected that we would be entering a new scene. We expected that this time around things would be different and that this time we would see a real change in the mindset of our politicians, especially after the two years of lesson they had been through ( for all the flaws of the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led government).//////When Dhaka is writhing under vicious traffic turmoil, the words of the prime minister in parliament gave us a sort of relief. On Oct 7 she said before the assembly in a question-answer hour that elevated expressway, underground railway and monorail for Dhaka city and a four-lane highway for Dhaka-Chittagong route were very much under the government's active consideration. Tenders submitted for the conversion of the highway to four lanes were already under scrutiny. On the city traffic imbroglio she also stressed the urgent need of constructing more car parks and additional roads, introducing staggered timetables for offices and educational institutions, school bus services, expansion of traffic police force, and advised the drivers to follow traffic rules. The theoretical aspects are honestly portrayed and there can be no second opinion on the facts produced. //////All of us have some relatives who are unfortunately poor. These poor relatives usually feel uneasy to meet their rich relatives. Some rich relatives also do not want to recognise their poor relatives. But this should not be the case. Relatives are relatives. This relation cannot be judged by money or status. We must remember that our poor relatives suffer mentally for being poor. We should not add more pain to their sufferings by being rude to them. Our greatest and dearest Prophet (SM) warned us that those who cut off relations with their relatives will not be allowed to enter the heaven. //////Parents are caught between a rock and a hard place with mobile phones. They are a great source of comfort and security, because they allow parents to find out where there children are and keep in touch with them. At the same time they make young people targets of crime. Obviously, mobiles need to be used with great caution in public.
