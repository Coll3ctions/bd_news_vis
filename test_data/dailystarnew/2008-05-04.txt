Sweat rolled down in drops and showed through T-shirts. In the deep Lawachhara rain forest, the workers in bright red overalls and red helmets were busy securing the explosive line. And then there was nothing else to do but wait. The big yellow remote explosion box with a long antennae lay on the ground, occasionally the wireless fixed to it cackling--the man at the other end of a wave recording van somewhere in a far away tea garden called for patience. Somewhere the explosive lines had been disrupted.//////At least eight people were killed and over 50 injured as nor'westers swept over Natore, Sirajganj, Bagerhat, Rajbari and Jessore districts on Friday night.//////The Election Commission (EC) might bring changes to the proposed code of conduct for parliamentary political parties, making it effective for only the pre-poll period, scrapping the earlier proposal for having the rules effective for an indefinite period of time.//////The government incurred a loss of at least Tk 40 lakh as a few unscrupulous PGCL (Pashchimancal Gas Company Limited) officials laid gas pipelines for two private housing companies free of charge, said sources at PGCL.//////Law Adviser AF Hassan Ariff yesterday urged the media to arrange grassroots-level public hearings so that people who cannot reach local administration for solutions to their problems or place their demands could be heard.//////The PGCL (Pashchimancal Gas Company Limited) has stopped providing any new connection to industrial establishments and CNG refuelling stations in Bogra, Pabna and Sirajganj due to acute shortage of gas.//////No one could be arrested as of yesterday evening in connection with the brutal murder of two schoolboys in the capital. //////The Asian Development Bank will provide a "sizeable" amount in budgetary support to nations affected by the spike in food prices that is affecting one billion people in the region, its president said here Saturday.//////Intending subscribers of the state-owned BTTB will get telephone connections within 24 hours of payment of their demand note money.//////Jamaat Secretary General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid yesterday demanded withdrawal of the Election Commission's draft gazette notification re-demarcating 133 out of the 300 parliamentary constituencies. //////The BNP is moving step by step towards street agitations, said pro-Khaleda BNP Secretary General Khandaker Delwar Hossain yesterday, asking party leaders and workers to be prepared for that.//////Angry residents blocked the Phulbari highway yesterday demanding immediate resignation of Dr Tamim, special assistant to Chief Advisor, for his controversial role over the Phulbari open pit coal mine.//////The bodies of three of a family, who went missing as their car plunged into the Padma at Maowa ferryghat on Friday, were recovered yesterday morning.//////Miscreants shot dead two youths and took away a motorbike at Sajanpur in Bhederganj upazila of the district on Friday night.//////Fire killed three members of a family and injured 10 others at Ghonarpara in the town early yesterday.//////Harkatul Jihad al Islami (Huji) operative Arif Hasan Sumon was placed on a fresh two-day remand yesterday in connection with the Ramna Batamul blast during Pahela Baishakh celebrations in 2001.//////Regulatory Reforms Commission (RRC) Chairman Akbar Ali Khan yesterday said Bangladesh is still far away from real democracy.//////Indian inflation is at its highest in over three years as food and energy costs continue to rise, official figures show. //////President Pervez Musharraf has agreed to give up his powers to dissolve parliament and dismiss the prime minister following several rounds of secret parleys with the ruling Pakistan People's Party, a media report said yesterday.//////The first legalised home computers have gone on sale in Cuba, but a ban remains on internet access. //////More than 150 Kurdish rebels from the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party have been killed in Turkish bombing raids carried out in northern Iraq this week, the Turkish army said yesterday. //////Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej routinely harasses reporters and attempts to intimidate the media with his foul mouth, a coalition of Thai journalism groups charged yesterday. //////THE move by the Election Commission to redraw the boundaries of 133 electoral constituencies on a district-wise basis has drawn flak from the political parties. Indeed, some politicians smell something of the negative and even the conspiratorial in such a move. While the reaction from the parties was only to be expected, we nevertheless feel that the EC has done nothing beyond its remit. In fact, the constitution obliges the EC to go for a delimitation and readjustment of constituencies. More pertinently, it is the demographic realities (the last census was conducted in 2001) that necessitate a redrawing of constituencies. At this newspaper, we believe that constituencies must be so arranged as to provide for an equitable distribution of population and electoral representation within them. There is surely concern when two constituencies, of 100,000 people and 5,00,000 people respectively, are each represented in Parliament by a lawmaker. The discrepancy in the numbers becomes glaring. Moreover, there is the important question of expenditure ceiling applicable for election campaigns. How could the same limit hold good for constituencies of widely different sizes?//////A number of murders of macabre proportion have taken place in the metropolitan city and elsewhere in the country compelling us to wonder about the competence of the law enforcing agencies. In the recent months, a lady was murdered in her own flat in Dhanmondi while two more met the same fate in a Banani flat. We remember, only a couple of days ago, an army personnel was knifed to death by a group of snatchers when he tried to catch one of them. And as recently as on Thursday last, a trader was shot dead by local extortionists when he refused to oblige them. The discovery of the dead bodies of two young schoolboys in an abandoned house in the city added yet another gruesome dimension to crime situation in the country. These are examples of some recent crime committed in the city. In the rural areas, a major crime that was reported from Bagmara upazila on Thursday was the murder of a police constable and infliction of grievous injury on four others by some outlaws. They had raided the police camp and looted their firearms. //////THE pitched battles that some radical Islamist groups fought recently with the police for two consecutive days around the Baitul Mukarram national mosque to protest against certain provisions of giving women equal rights in the National Women Development Policy (NWDP), have engendered a deep sense of concern among the conscious people.//////IN the light of the Anglo-American opposition to military rule in Bangladesh one cannot but be reminded of Ambassador Richard Hass's essay on The Age of Non-Polar World (May/June Foreign Affairs) in which he tries to analyze the pros and cons of the present state of global affairs in the absence of hegemonic stability.//////AFTER lying low for six weeks in the aftermath of his controversial snippets airing on Fox News and YouTube, Rev. Jeremiah Wright suddenly resurfaced on April 25 and gave an interview to Bill Moyers, defending his reputation, making Barack Obama cringe. Then on April 28, in front of a national television audience Wright reiterated all the outrageous assertions he had made in those snippets, at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, making Obama furious. //////Captain Salma Khatun led Bangladesh from the front to a memorable victory over Pakistan by four wickets in the Women's Asia Cup at the Welegedara Stadium in Kurunegala yesterday.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club came from two-nil down to win 3-2 over Ajax Sporting Club in an exciting encounter of the Green Delta Insurance Premier Division Hockey League at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////Pakistan Cricket Academy took a slender 12-run first innings lead over GP-BCB National Cricket Academy (NCA) on the second day of the second four-day game at the Rajshahi Divisional Stadium yesterday.//////Grand Master Ziaur Rahman maintained solo lead in the 34th National Chess Championship at the federation hallroom yesterday.//////Narail and Joypurhat narrowly escaped with close victories while Chittagong and Tangail won comfortably in the opening day matches of the 28th National Cricket Championship yesterday.//////Shoaib Akhtar's lawyers have asked for a suspension of his five-year ban in a bid to allow him to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and are set once again to approach the Appellate Tribunal looking into his appeal.//////They may have been scraping the bottom of the points table, but the Bangalore Royal Challengers and Deccan Chargers dished out one of the best games of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday.//////A clinical Delhi Daredevils recorded an eight-wicket win to bump their opponents, Chennai Super Kings, off the No. 1 spot and end Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 100 per cent record at the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Friday.

In other words, daily temperature is shooting up --each new dawn heralds in another hot day. Even we can feel the wrath of the sun early in the morning. At midday the heat becomes so unbearable that you need something, say an umbrella, over your head. To make matters worse, the supply of electricity is being disrupted--the ceiling fans are not moving!//////In this globalised and competitive economies, a nation will be just withering away without highly skilled manpower and technological edge over others. The public universities need to be overhauled thoroughly to make these institutions effective for generating and enhancing knowledge to create skilled manpower. Public universities are on the verge of collapse, to say the least. The last BNP-Jamaat government made public universities subservient wholly to their party interest. Appointed VCs were from among nasty party cadres having serious corruption scandals (appeared in the national dailies against some of them). These party cadre VCs still persist in some universities. The Ministry of Education recently advertised for appointing new VCs in 7 public universities where the posts are now lying vacant. Why shouldn't the BNP-Jamaat cadre VCs be removed from all other public universities for the sake of fairness and to depoliticise all the universities before the proposed general elections on a plain field of politics. Why the BNP-Jamaat should get an upper hand in the public universities during the elections under a neutral caretaker government? Why public universities are by-passed in the reform agenda?//////It has been a long journey for Bangladesh cricket. But it seems our performance is still the same as it was 10 years before. We try to be very confident sometimes and at times we perform very badly at the international level. As it is the prime sport of Bangladesh, we can expect at least some fighting performances. We understand all the problems but when we see players not concentrating or playing some risky strokes when the team is in trouble, we feel bad. //////Movement of people, especially the middle class, has become very difficult in Dhaka metropolis. An affordable transport is required to attend a marriage ceremony or to attend a social gathering with the members of the family. Majority city dwellers do not have cars. They have to depend on rented vehicles. Taxicabs are not always available. //////On food shortage, I humbly submit two questions--//////We should show due sensitivity to the environment. Things are going wrong in many areas, but we appear to be unmoved. That's suicidal, to say the least.//////Mr. Mridha's column on the subject published by you on 22 April regrets the lack of response by industrialists on gas consumption reduction. On this subject the letter by Titas Gas asking industrial users for a six hour stoppage of gas use daily does not sound logical. It can only result in increasing specific gas usage per unit of output!//////I was impressed and energized by Syed Badrul Ahsan's article entitled Ground Realities, Bengali women, equal rights and obscurantism in your paper.//////I strongly support the opinion and ideas of Mr. Mohammed Rahat to make Dhaka, the capital city, free of rickshaws. The mega city Dhaka is the most densely populated city on earth but the minimum urban amenities are not there. Mr. Rahat has elaborated the issue from all important angles and showed the way out. I would like to reinforce his arguments by adding the following://////On behalf of the residents of Gulshan Model Town, I offer the heartiest kudos to the law enforcers for removing unauthorised cars from all the roads of Gulshan on the first day of April 2008. Some business companies park their vehicles in such a haphazard way in and around their billion dollar offices whole day and even at night that we, the tax payer-residents, almost were unable to think or recall that the roads are not owned by these companies engaged in crass commercialisation of the Model Town. Any complaint, grief, pain or discontent about their illegal and unauthorized parking was never entertained, rather disregarded.//////Thanks to the DS for publishing a very important news report concerning the mandatory obligation of the government to consult the PSC under Article 140(2) of the constitution. It appears that not only the question of separation of the EC Secretariat is related to this Article of the constitution, but also the question of appointment of the 3 commissioners, and other important appointments made for the service of the Republic are included in it. I am not aware whether the appointment of the advisers is covered under this article or their provision of appointment is outside the purview of Article 140(2). I understand that the service of the advisers is also for the service of the Republic. //////The whole country is now anxious about the stalemate in the Election Commission over the BNP's inner conflicts. There are many opinions that we get in the print and news media on how the EC could avoid or overcome the crisis. The success of EC's own roadmap is now subject to the end of BNP's leadership crisis.//////Is there any government in this country? Everything is crumbling. The prices of essential commodities are increasing day by day, pick-pocketing and mugging have increased at an alarming rate, and the people are fed up with the number of times electricity goes off. Can't the government see all this chaos around them? Or are they totally ignorant about these facts? The government is showing its inefficiency in every way. //////The debacle in Pakistan did not surprise me. It's inevitable. The ability of our batsmen is not unknown to me. The pitches in Pakistan are not suitable for the bowlers. Batsmen play the pivotal role in these pitches. Look at the Pakistan batsmen, they showed their sublime form. When they batted it looked like a paradise for them. On the other hand, the same pitch appeared to be a minefield for our batsmen. They fell like nine pins. Only Shakib & Tamim showed some resistance. //////For God's sake, stop the "Pancho Pandap" from giving any more trouble to us with their vast textbook knowledge on politics They lack, in my judgment, the most necessary knowledge one acquires through his or her experience i.e. common sense. They have already created many controversies by their known and unknown activities surrounding the National Women Development Policy.//////Once again an expatriate traveller has been severely beaten and tortured at Zia International Airport. But I am surprised by the strange silence of Bangladesh media on this issue. The incident happened on April 14. The victim is a well-known humanitarian aid worker from the UK, Barrister Rizwan Hussain. He returned to the UK with a broken arm and leg. As if that wasn't enough, those elements had the audacity to force Mr. Hussain to sign a declaration admitting that he was illegally trafficking humans. Even if we accept that Mr. Hussain did something wrong, it still doesn't give anyone the right to start beating a traveller right there and then. If someone is guilty then it is the court of law that decides on the punishment.//////Electricity shortage and load shedding have become a black spot for the country, despite all big talks about development and other progress claims. This one failure, reported practically everyday in all the dailies, is a major problem overshadowing everything else!//////British Prime Minister Gordon Brown suffered a crushing election "bloodbath" yesterday, as his party lost control of London's City Hall on top of its worst poll results for 40 years across the country.//////Scattered gunbattles and a roadside bomb blast in Sri Lanka's embattled north killed 11 Tamil Tiger rebels and three government soldiers, the military said Saturday. //////Chinese media railed against the Dalai Lama and his supporters Saturday and pledged to crush any campaign seeking independence for Tibet, ahead of a meeting between Beijing and envoys of the exiled spiritual leader. //////A US religious freedom watchdog on Friday asked the State Department to include Vietnam, Pakistan and Turkmenistan in its global blacklist of religious freedom violators, and maintained Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, on a watchlist.//////Pakistan Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani has said that the military operation in Balochistan has been stopped.//////Severe tropical cyclone Nargis lashed Myanmar's main city yesterday, downing power lines and tearing roofs off houses as residents took shelter in their homes and waited for the storm to pass.//////US President George W.

In front of the trial judges in the make-shift court houses she repeatedly declared her apprehensions that the verdicts have already been decided and the trial judges, in her words, have no other option but to hand them down regardless of the merits of the incriminations which are expected to unfold during the trial proceedings. //////IT was a declining afternoon back in 2001 when Rashida Muhiuddin called. She sounded happy, to the point of being thrilled. Could I come over to her Sheraton office for tea? Within the next half hour I was there. She was radiant, with that serene beauty in her giving off a glow of contentment. She had just been nominated by the Awami League for a Jatiyo Sangsad seat in Muktagachha and in celebration wished to share the moment with her friends. I thought myself fortunate in being one of them. //////TO miss someone, one has to be fond of someone. This is truism and it reflects the term endearment. This is based on the scale of positive relationship. But it is also possible not to miss someone on the basis of dislike, disgust, or revulsion. Here works a vicarious solace in not so missing someone. This relationship is based on negative emotions and unsavoury experiences. There is a third dimension to the relationship or mental connectivity. One can perfectly remain a "stoic" or a "cynic" in the philosophical sense and maintain a stoical or cynical frame of mind, distancing oneself from whatever happens to others.
