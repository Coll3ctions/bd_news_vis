Despite claims of self-defence, he was caught on camera delivering a punch no less to a female student. The incident will go down in the university's history as an embarrassment for the teachers' community. We are left horrified, more so since the gentleman in question continues to protest his innocence in the face of evidence to the contrary. Needless to say the uncivilised act has invited widespread condemnation of the teachers' community and beyond. It is true that the campus has seen agitation of a section of students protesting the university's decision to raise fees recently and expulsion of nine students for alleged bad behaviour - a decision that has been challenged in the High Court. And yes, there have been protests and sit-ins in front of administrative buildings. It the Proctor's job to diffuse the situation through negotiation, not inflame it by engaging in physical violence. It would seem that the violence that exists in our society has spread to infect those who are supposed to be the epitome of cultural values, norms and etiquette. It is little wonder that students in our country often betray their violent and irresponsible behaviour on and off campus. With teachers such as Professor Salam, how can we expect better behaviour from them?//////Like on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr, so also now with Eid-ul-Azha only a few days away, the availability and cost of tickets for road, river and train communication are running into all sorts of difficulties. For instance, at bus terminals passengers have to pay extra Tk 50 to Tk 150 beyond the standard fare. Different companies plying the same routes, the same distance and the same category of transports are charging fares at varying rates much to the annoyance of commuters. Such short changing of homebound passengers is rife in a situation of artificial scarcities created by unscrupulous operators in collusion with middlemen. //////Ten-man Sheikh Russel KC scored a last-gasp winner to confirm their maiden final berth in the Federation Cup, eking out a narrow 2-1 win over Mohammedan SC in an excellent semifinal, marred by scenes of violence, at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////It must be a huge relief for the Bangladeshi Cricket Board and its players to see the National Cricket League, the country's sole first-class competition, start today.

The multi-Emmy winning drama rushed through the first season, leaving behind a trail of dust, cloaked in fragments of action, intrigue, religion, patriotism and too many elements to keep count of. It wasn't really the premise that had the viewers hooked but rather the pace of the proceedings.

Awards given to politicians like Kissinger, Begin, Arafat, Obama and Peres generated even greater controversies. So the reaction to this year's award has not been anything unusual. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to give it to the European Union for its contribution "to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe" for over six decades. This decision has been hailed by many across the world but reviled by others. Some have even suggested that it is a cynical decision willfully taken "to discredit this once prestigious award."

They flock together and observe the festivals amid day-long and night-long renderings of Lalon songs. That does not necessarily mean that the off-festival times are devoid of the rendition of songs. As a matter of fact, hardly a day passes when the bauls, either in twos and threes or in larger numbers do not sit round somewhere at the shrine premises, and go on singing and playing music on the local instruments like ektara (a one-stringed musical instrument and khol (hand drum).

That age was dominated by the development of nuclear bomb, ICBM (Inter Continental Ballistic Missile), SLBM (Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile) and so forth. The Cold War came to an end in the nineties of the last century with the demise of USSR. Now we are living in a multi-polar world, arguably uni-polar with the US in the centre. Probably with the demise of USSR, we not only left behind the age of nuclear bomb or ICBM, SLBM, but also we have entered in a new age of armament- the age of drone. According to recent research by International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) there are at least eleven countries that have their own drones while more countries are trying to develop their own version of it. More concern for us that our neighbour India has, as it is known, thirty drones. The unscrupulous and indiscriminate use of drone makes it enough to be worried about our country's national security and of course, security of individuals. //////The demographic transition from rural to urban is continuing in all countries in the world. The number of urban residents is growing by nearly 60 million every year. By 2030, six out of ten people will live in city and by 2050 this proportion will increase to seven out of ten people. Developing countries, in particular the D-8 countries, would not be of any exception. Rather it is estimated that the urban population of developing countries will be more than double by the middle of the twenty first century. This demographic transition is, however, deeply associated with shifts from an agriculture based economy to mass industry, technology and services.//////A little over a week ago, Pakistani youth activist Malala Yousufzai was shot in the head by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

Nearly a third of its population lies under the official poverty line, and hunger and malnutrition are widespread. The country has to tackle several growth-retarding factors: poor governance and a high level of corruption, underdeveloped infrastructure, large-scale tax evasion and a low tax-GDP ratio, extremely high population density and the associated scarcity of land and natural resources, a low-skilled labour force, and vulnerability to natural disasters including the threat of the adverse effects of climate change. And proceeds to pose this profoundly probing query: While the governance environment may have been barely adequate thus far to cope with an economy breaking out of stagnation and extreme poverty, are we nearing a tipping point beyond which it may increasingly prove a barrier to putting the economy firmly on a path of modernization and global integration?//////Chinua Achebe, known as the father of modern African literature, has again come to the limelight, at age 82, with his long-awaited memoir, ////// a fusion of history and experience, poetry and prose, centred around the brutal three-year (1967-1970) Biafran war that nearly destroyed his nation.
