adviser's voicing of resolve that zero tolerance has been ensured in all spheres of forest administration to curb corruption, mismanagement and malpractice is reassuring. Evidently, it is set against the revealing tales of plunder of forest resources by officials of the forest department denying the national exchequer millions in revenue. Their misdeeds exemplified the classic aberration of the gateman becoming poacher.//////WE welcome the government decision to construct a new link road between Old Airport Road and Rokeya Sarani to reduce unbearable traffic congestion in that part of the city. The proposed road will be used by vehicles wanting to go westward - Agargaon, Shaymoli, Mohammadpur and Mirpur - instead of taking a detour from the Bijoy Sarani. The planners claim that the link road will save several minutes of the commutation time for travelling from east to west and vice versa.

attempted to shoot police at Berbari village under Shailkupa upazila in Jhenidah yesterday morning. //////It is a matter of disgrace to the police (a man was reportedly beaten to death by a police officer at Chakoria). The distance between the police and citizens is increasing day by day. The sense of responsibility and humanity has completely vanished from the minds of police. Most of the time they work for the rich (who give them bribes) rather than poor, weak people. The rate of corruption in the police department is so high that now we can't think of any honest policeman. But the situation was quite different in the past (May be during the British period). Police used to command a lot of respect at that time. Even at the time of our liberation war, many policemen fought like tigers. But the situation has completely changed. //////These days many people are found talking on TV on various subjects. There is no dearth of subjects. They talk on dialogue with the parties, jute, price hike of rice and other commodities, increase in oil and gas prices, Nargis and Sidr and so on, but nobody talks about a major problem of the country and perhaps of the world. What is that? Well, that's the 'population problem of Bangladesh'. //////Water logging is a great problem that occurs (as is common for salinisation) in poorly drained soils where water can't penetrate deeply and that are poorly drained topographically. The raised water table results in the soils becoming waterlogged. When soils are water logged, air spaces in the soil are filled with water, and plant roots essentially suffocate -- lacking oxygen. Water logging also damages soil structure. Worldwide, about 10% of all irrigated land suffers from water logging. As a result, productivity has fallen about 20% in this area of cropland. The ultimate results are soil pores have no oxygen, vegetation can turn yellow, growth is stunted and thin, trees and plants can die, bare patches of soil appear, plant species more tolerant of saturated conditions will take over.//////In Sabujbag residential area, mostly middle and lower middle class people live. But the government has not set up any high school or college over here. The private high school and college in the locality are sub-standard. //////At the heart of the concept of war crimes is the idea that an individual can be held responsible for the actions of a country or that nation's soldiers. Genocide, crimes against humanity, mistreatment of civilians or combatants during war can all fall under the category of war crimes. Genocide is the most severe of these crimes. In the context of war, a war crime is a punishable offence under international law, for violations of the laws of war by any person or persons, military or civilian. War crimes can be committed during international armed conflict or internal armed conflict.//////In 1999, the then government started construction of the Patgati bridge over the Madhumati to connect Pirojpur and Bagerhat districts with Gopalganj. Though the bridge would make easier highway links from the southern part towards the rest or the country through Gopalganj, when completed, only two pillars of the bridge have been constructed so far. //////The number of beggars is increasing in the city day by day. They make roads and passages unclean and unhygienic. The Bangkok city authorities made the capital free from beggars and rickshaw pullers since the mid seventies which helped the city to be attractive to the tourists.//////Rectifying a mistake can rather be an easy task, but one wishes that the same could be said about errors in judgement as well. especially with regard to politics. If unleashing a lethal political vendetta between two ladies (leading two major political parties in Bangladesh) for years to score petty-political gains (a major political mistake) was an act of political misdemeanour, then the unwillingness of (a grave error in judgement) these two ladies and their surrogates to realise that they are not invincible was nothing but a political felony/crime. And crime does pay very dearly and perhaps unfairly, at times.//////Recent attacks by Shia Hezbollah on the Sunni-led government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora in Lebanon signalled the coming bloodbath between two hostile Muslim sects in the region. Heavily-armed Shiite gunmen belonging to Hezbollah are slaughtering mostly unarmed or lightly armed Sunnis with the aim to establish a Shiite hegemony in Lebanon and unless other Arab countries stop Hezbollah, Lebanese Sunnis might face a mass slaughter. //////Once Chittagong British Council library boasted a good collection of books. On the cards issued by the library it was labelled as a charity. Hence a good number of students and readers visited the library. Thus the library played an important role that was both educative and charitable.//////It now appears from a BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) report, the ambassador of Pakistan to Afghanistan - who was reportedly abducted by Taliban militants, a few months ago was released recently by his captors. It should be a piece of good news for family and friends of the envoy plus government of Pakistan, per se.//////American Senator and a friend of Bangladesh Ted Kennedy is seriously ill with a deadly brain tumour. He is the man who supported Bangladesh during our glorious liberation war, while his country supported Pakistan. //////Some former members of the Khaleda cabinet who, being members of the then Cabinet Purchase Committee, have recently been arrested for their alleged involvement in the 'Gatco Corruption Case'. Some such arrested former ministers, some 'Talkers' in the local TV channels and some journalists, through their writings and speeches, are trying to give an impression to the nation that the said Cabinet Purchase Committee was nothing but a mere rubber stamp without any significance. As an ordinary citizen, I do not know what is written in the 'Rules of Business' on the duties and responsibilities of the members of the purchase committee. But I can assume that a committee on which sits a number of senior cabinet ministers, and on whose recommendation the prime minister gives his/her decision cannot be a committee on paper only. If the members of the committee conducted themselves as the domestic aides of the prime minister and, knowing the prime minister's mind recommended something which the prime minister wanted to do, the committee members concerned cannot escape the responsibility for the wrong doing by the prime minister. //////This refers to the Star Business report (DS, 23 May) on the dwindling BTTB subscribers. I am not surprised to see its gradual decline. Even making BTTB a public limited company will not be an appropriate solution. As per this report quoting a BTTB high official, it is not the 'limited capacity to accommodate new connections' rather the backward looking and stagnant outlook of the Board that has created this situation. Mind that there is a huge amount of unpaid bills pending with the government organisations and, on the other hand, the individual subscribers are virtually being held hostage by the 'hon'ble linemen' all over the country. And the BTTB has failed to do anything about it as the Board is also being controlled by highly politicised union people.//////Forrest Cookson's gloomy piece predicting that John McCain will win the next US Presidential election may be prophetic. It also is right out of the Republican playbook, despite Mr. Cookson's suggestions to the contrary. I share the view that Mr. McCain has better chance of capturing the presidency than many observers suspect. But the exciting thing is that the rise of Mr. Obama has been both spectacular and unprecedented. Who, six months ago, would seriously have expected him to be ahead of such an establishment figure as Mrs. Clinton? What happens from now on depends on whether Mr. Obama runs a campaign that continues to challenge the conventional rules of US politics, and whether he is able to transcend the past. It is certainly possible that he will do so, and that he will win a decisive victory that may be seen as a turning point. To foretell his failure at this juncture is out-of-touch with the situation on the ground, and is exactly what the McCain camp is counting on. Mr. Cookson's piece is little more than a stealth endorsement for Mr. McCain, and readers need to know that. //////I would like to draw your attention on the news about resident DU students living in complete misery. It's a pathetic view of our best university. When the VC is living in a nice building , I guess, his students are sharing floors in a completely dire situation. I don't know how the administrators themselves used to live when they were students, but I think they should be sympathetic and take necessary steps. Since DU is one benchmark and reflection of country's educational system, where can I hide my face when our national dailies reveal such unpleasant truths. I was a student a few years back though not from DU but I feel sorry for them. //////It is incomprehensible what The Daily Start tried to mean by its very news item captioned A city itself set to dot Dhaka horizon dated 15th May 2008. The content of the news item says that Rajuk is filling up wetland with an area of over 2,000 acres in Uttara. The story is also full of pleas Rajuk usually made in the past in grabbing valuable farmland, evicting the owners, for distribution among the members of the unholy alliance of the politicians, bureaucrats and the businessmen. In this distribution of looted items the Rajuk officials also get a chunk. //////UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is hopeful "a turning point" has been reached in Myanmar's cyclone crisis as an international conference yesterday pledged tens of millions of dollars for some 2.4 million survivors in need of aid. //////The BJP's dream of ruling a southern state appeared certain on Sunday with results in Karnataka showing that it would emerge as the single-largest party in the state.//////More foreign help arrived in China yesterday as forecasts of heavy rain threatened to pour more misery on survivors of the devastating earthquake that killed more than 62,500 people.//////The US has asked LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran to give up demand for a separate Tamil state saying the community wanted a solution to the over two-decade-old ethnic conflict within a "united" Sri Lanka.//////Nato yesterday asked Pakistan to avoid agreements that "put our troops and our mission under threat" with peace talks on that side of the border linked to an increase in attacks in Afghanistan.//////A foreign soldier, two policemen and a dozen Taliban were killed in clashes in a key Afghan opium-producing area on Sunday, while three troops were hurt in a suicide blast in Kandahar city.//////European and developing countries urged the United States and Japan on Sunday to commit to deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 a step they say is needed to defuse a coming ecological disaster caused by global warming. //////Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said yesterday that indirect peace talks with Syria, a process begun more than a year ago and confirmed this week, will be conducted seriously and in secrecy.//////Iraqi forces deployed in the Shia stronghold of Sadr City in Baghdad under a truce deal have seized a large haul of weapons and bombs in search operations, the US military said yesterday.//////The death toll from two weeks of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa rose to 50 yesterday as concerns mounted for an estimated 35,000 people who have been displaced by the backlash.//////At least 10 people including six young children from the same family were killed as torrential rain lashed Swat Valley in northwestern Pakistan, police said Sunday.//////Authorities invited leaders of one of India's lowest castes for talks as the death toll rose to 37 Sunday from three days of bloody demonstrations over caste classification. //////With his rival back in the country, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe fought for his political survival Sunday as he kicked off his election campaign.//////Nazrul was restless -- a defining trait in his character. He had been granted permission to come down from heaven to his beloved country to see for himself how his devotees were celebrating his 109th birthday. While the angels draped him in his favourite 'gerua khadder panjabi', he put on his black military boots that he always wore. His trademark -- untamed long curls falling loosely from underneath the bright yellow silk turban, he hummed a favourite tune Sheye choleye gecheye boley... The twinkle in his eye said it all -- he would hardly wait. //////May 25 marked the 109th birth anniversary of our National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. His works -- poetry, songs, features, essays and more -- played a great role during the movements against the British Raj. During the Liberation War his songs and poetry inspired the nation. //////On Fridays, the busy city life shifts into a slow gear. Last Friday (May 23) many music aficionados gathered at the National Museum to enjoy a solo performance by Kabir Sumon. The main auditorium was packed; some waited outside hoping to get tickets. A local organisation Chirkut organised the programme.//////Department of Production of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy organised a research-oriented programme titled "Bangla music trends during 19th and 20th century" at the Music and Dance Centre on May 25.//////Korean natural beauty and traditional culture were presented through dance performances by BJ Dance Group, an organisation of Cultural Foundation of National Foundation, South Korea. The troupe performed two contemporary and five traditional dance compositions at the National Theatre Stage, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on May 23. //////IT is our privilege that Kazi Nazrul Islam was made the national poet of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Nazrul's song ////// was adopted as the national military song of Bangladesh.//////WITH the arrests of Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia there should not have been any doubt in any quarter, especially among the detractors of this caretaker government, that the government will not waver in its resolve to cleanse politics from the garbage of crime and corruption -- the twin banes of this nation. //////KENNY Rogers, one of country music's icons, has a line in the song "The Gambler" in which a card shark tells a greenhorn that he needs to "know when to walk away and know when to run." This piece of homespun wisdom may or may not have much value for poker players. However, in the game of international politics, where the stakes are considerably higher, it is invaluable advice. As the Bush administration enters the high noon of its negotiations with India over a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement designed to end India's decades-long nuclear isolation -- a result of unwillingness to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- the United States needs to heed the gambler's admonition.//////YOU think the Middle East Conflict is a tough problem to resolve? You should try the Vittachi family reunion. Admittedly, slightly fewer rocket-powered grenades are involved. But in terms of the complexity of issues, the two events are pretty much on a par.//////Biharis residing in camps are in a fear of eviction and uncertainty after the High Court on May 18 granted them citizenship, ending a long-lasting argument over their status. //////Fatima Ahmed has been getting a foul smell in her apartment. Her bedroom reeked of something faecal. And it did not take the schoolteacher long to find the culprit--a leaking toilet pipe coming from the apartment above hers.//////
