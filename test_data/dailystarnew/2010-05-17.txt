To protect or motivate certain sectors a trend of 'cash incentive' is being practiced for last few years. Especially in agricultural sector it is a highly discussed, undoubtedly required, issue. Moreover, to survive from the effects of global recession, most of the industries have received such incentives this year from our government. Apparently, it seems good and a commendable venture but the reality is not depicting the same thing.//////For most of the people, rivers are the main sources of livelihood and transportation. With the rapid growth of urbanization, the breadth of rivers is getting narrowed and the banks are being encroached by the influential people. The major rivers surrounding Dhaka ---Buringanga, Sitalakhya and Turag -- are now mortally sick.//////It's great news for the newspaper as well as thousands of readers that Irene Khan is joining The Daily Star. Irene Khan, an internationally recognized human rights advocate, could easily settle in any other prosperous country but she did not do so. Her decision to stay with us would serve as a burning example of patriotism when a large portion of our brilliant students migrate to the west for better education as well as to settle down there. From the newspaper, I came to know that she would be contributing in the field of human rights, good governance, gender issues and democracy.//////What is going on in the country? The activities of BCL are really shameful for the present govt as they have already failed to tackle the situation. Without controlling them it is quite tough for the govt to keep law and order under control. However, our honourable prime minister has already asked the lawmakers concerned to go tough against the BCL activists but the outcome is not fruitful yet.//////This is about the write-up published in The Daily Star (3/3/2010) named "bridging the academic gap" by Mr. Abdus Sattar Molla. In his article he gave some misinformation about Islam, by which, I think, many can misunderstand Islam. He mentioned the Arabic word "Jihad" as "Religious war". Actually this meaning, religious war is nowhere found in the Holy Quran or in the Hadiths. Jihad means "to strive/to struggle." In another place he said, the Holy Quran (2:256) speaks about secular mentality which is totally wrong. I request him to study the Holy Quran once again with understanding. In another place he said "compulsory religious education course should put more emphasis on interpersonal social relations than on religious beliefs and rituals." I want to inform him that in religious beliefs and rituals of Islam interpersonal social relations are included. Apart from it, he wrote about "Hoqqullah and Hoqqul I'bad" and gave some explanations. I cordially request him to know the factual explanation of these from an Islamic scholar. In the fourth column he wrote, "Compulsory religious education up to Grade-10 has so far failed to raise the literate citizens' moral standards". If you want to increase moral standards of literate citizens you have to introduce more compulsory religious courses and it should be up to university level.//////Once upon a time the petrol filling stations were maintained well.

Their Lordships in the Supreme and High Courts have rightly interceded in areas like illegal land grabbing, forest plundering, lake and river bank occupation, rivers and lakes pollution, removal of illegal bill-boards etc, where the rights of the people have been usurped by criminals due to the lax attitude and/or corruption of the relevant authorities. //////Students have got involved in this politics. Regrettably, most of the students who are involved in dirty politics have taken arms in their hands. They ruin the academic atmosphere through in-fighting and shedding blood of one another; even they are killing each other by being influenced by godfathers of politics.//////The curious diary of Mr. Jam, as its name implies, curious indeed and astute enough to find the jockey tone from nook and cranny, is certainly a breakthrough in writing articles. His dialogue-based articles and trenchantly witty write-ups enabled him to be one of the top columnists in Asia. A satirical tone spiced with an excellent sense of humour and marked moderation is Mr. Jam's palette which kept him as an entirely distinguished humorist. //////It is a matter of great regret that very often a congenial atmosphere in the exam hall is not well maintained. Invigilators frequently get engaged in gossiping. This gossip creates a great deal of disturbance for the students. Although the centre secretary is the only person supposed to use cell phone, invigilators use that device randomly breaking the complete silence. We the students sitting in the front bench are the worst sufferers in this context. When the cell phone rings our concentration is disturbed. It is high time the authorities found a solution to this problem. //////Tree is one of the biggest blessings of nature for mankind. A tiny seed becomes a large tree, gives shed during summer and in winter all of the leaves of the trees fall downward to indirectly supply us further sunlight and the atmosphere becomes warmer. //////The DS's questions to Begum Khaleda Zia through its editorial of 11 May about reasons behind her threat to bring down the government are known to everyone. It is not the failure or success on the national issues. Failure or success does not matter much to her. The prime reason is the court and the present government's continued pursuance of legal process in the cases against her and her two sons. //////Nowadays violence, terrorism, bloodshed, killing and robbery are attributed to the student wings of different political parties. All the campuses of the universities have become a stage of performing the drama of political clashes where the cops, teachers, intellectuals and the common students are the silent spectators. Consequently, students, the hope and future of our country, are breaking the backbone of the nation and dumping the ray of hope into dust. So frustrating is it that seizing the hall, torturing the opponents, unscheduled closure of colleges and universities, session jams have struck firm roots in the seats of learning. How can they ignore their golden past? //////Like every other citizen, I regularly watch news in our private Bangla channels. It is very embarrassing to hear that still some of the reporters cannot even pronounce some words properly. It's very common to hear some of the reporters saying 'SANNEL' instead of 'Channel'. Very embarrassing!!//////Most of the ship breaking yards of our country are located in Chittagong, adjacent to the Bay of Bengal. These ship breaking yards provide us a major percentage of our need of iron. These also give us working opportunities for our unemployed people. In spite of these opportunities, these yards are so much harmful for our environment as well as our eco-system. Every year these yards receive many ships for breaking which contains numerous harmful substances including oil, asbestos, toxic colours and various poisonous chemical substances.//////Nowadays, our new generation is getting less interested in reading and they are more inclined, almost addicted, to computer games and TV. Though, it is necessary to have a visual version of what we are acquiring from our visible world, reading habit is indispensable for comprehensive learning.

I grew up and spent my childhood there. Pulana Paltan back then was a very different place. There were a few buildings and a lot of fields, where we used to play; there were a few ponds around as well. I remember my brothers teaching me to swim in the ponds. Back then there was also a canal in Purana Paltan. On the other side of the canal was Bidyamandir School. The morning shift was for the girls. During the day shift at Dhaka Collegiate School I used to have my classes there, says seasoned actor Raisul Islam Asad.//////In a penury stricken family, it is unlikely that a girl child can get very far. An exception to this rule is the plucky Sunita Mahothra, the daughter of a mason in the Delhi Jal Board and a housewife. Today she is a rising star in the dance firmament of India and specialises in Bharatnatyam. Yes, this dance form is very difficult and requires a lot of practice. I am fortunate to have a dedicated teacher, Guru Chandramani, at the Bal Bhavan in New Delhi, where I now take classes, says Sunita, who has just completed her Class X Board exams.//////Runa Laila is one of the celebrities featured on an entertainment programme for Zee TV Bangla, titled Ke Hobe Biggest Fan (Who will be the biggest fan) hosted by the noted Bollywood director, Anuraag Basu (Murder, Gangster, Metro and soon to be released Kites).

Needless to say, this program will not cover privately run schools, colleges and universities. Even then, the number of students to come under this plan would be over 4 million considering that at present the total number of students in all private and public educational institutions from primary to university level numbers is close to 8.5 million. What is more, the prime minister also has a plan to provide stipends to meritorious students among those that already receive free education.//////THE choice is admittedly difficult, but which of these three is the biggest threat to the social stability of India: greed, hatred or stupidity? Our polity is less vulnerable than our social compact, although the first can, logically, only be a manifestation of the second. //////
