It was, therefore, no wonder that the difference of opinion among senior police officials on police performance, which surfaced during the course of a formal meeting, made headlines in national newspaper.//////We expect 2012 to be a year of slowing global growth, with wide divergences between regions and countries.

Interventions will be required over a long time for adaptation and mitigation. They will need to adopt different approaches to programming, while the ongoing development initiatives will need to be sensitive to climate change.

The government has also been applauded globally as one of the pioneers to formulate the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP). If applied properly, PPP can be an effective approach to reduce vulnerability. Such partnerships can also ensure climate proofing of other projects implemented through PPP in the country.//////Many analysts have blamed Deputy Prime Minister Bijaya Gachhadar for the cancellation of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to Nepal.

This is the only sea-passage for the export of oil from the Persian Gulf states. Recently, due to the revival of the possibility of new sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran, which may include sanctions against the purchase of oil and the sale of petroleum products to Iran, the issue of Iran's reactions, especially the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, has turned into a hot topic. Some Iranian officials have recently claimed that according to the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Law of the Sea, Iran can suspend the passage from the Strait of Hormuz for the countries that impose sanctions against the Iranian oil and gas imports and exports. This is a piece on the legal, political, military and practical aspects of this issue.//////China is going to expand its naval sphere to the Indian Ocean. It plans to build an overseas military base, first ever in its kind, in the Indian Ocean. The decision has double merits: one, this is a significant shift from regional to global strategic reach, and another is the specialty of the location of the base, which is in the Indian Ocean. According to Robert D Kaplan, Indian Ocean will be the centre of global conflicts, because most international business supply will be conducted through this route. Most important of all, it is in the Indian Ocean where the interests and influence of India, China and the US are going to overlap. It is here, as Kaplan says, where the 21st century's "global power dynamics will be revealed." Kaplan identifies India and China as the two key players in the region. India is moving east and west while China to the South. Interestingly, these, relatively, new political players are making the Indo-Pacific a heaven of "realpolitik." The US is also shifting its focus from the Middle East to this region. And it backs India as the leader of the Indo-Pacific. //////History matters in Bangladesh, for obvious reasons. The systematic manner in which it has been mutilated over the decades since liberation by military regimes and their civilian cohorts has taken a heavy toll on the nation, especially the younger generation. The good news, though, is that the return of the Awami League to power after a forced hiatus of twenty one years in 1996, followed by its second stint in office beginning in 2009, has been a boon for those whose interest in the events leading to the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971 has never wavered. In all these years since Sheikh Hasina has led the government, in two distinct phases, a restoration of history has been a priority both for the political class and the broad mass of the population. //////Shaheen Akhter's award winning book Talash in Bangla has been translated into English by Ella Dutta and published by Zubaan in New Delhi, India. The translator has done a polished rendition which in my mind has been possible because she herself is a Bengali and hence accurately conveys the subtle nuances of the Bengali language and culture.//////Dr. Mustafizur Rahman's book, titled above, is an extensive research on the poetry of Raibinod, one of the most influential poets of the 16th century. Raibinod hailed from Tangail and his poetry ////// or Monoshamangal as it is known in West Bengal was widely popular across Mymensingh and Dhaka.
