Notable exceptions were, however, politician-participants who advocated enactment of the reform bill through an elected government. //////How dangerous a place Afghanistan continues to be has just been demonstrated yet once more. President Hamid Karzai has escaped assassination at the hands of the Taliban and that too in the capital Kabul. The incident proves the volatile nature of politics, or the lack of it, in the country. A number of global leaders have meanwhile condemned the incident and some have even lauded the brave work they believe Karzai has been doing in his country. We, like everyone else, are happy that the Afghan leader has survived the onslaught. At the same time, like everyone else, we feel that there are some intrinsic problems in or with Afghanistan that need to be handled if a semblance of normalcy is to be restored there.//////There is such a thing as conscience. There is such a thought as principles.

The rally, as the blonde continued, was driven by a rising General Motors (GM) stock, a major component of the DJIA, on announcement of FY2007 financial results. Most of us would assume, naturally, bumper profits in 2007 pushed the stock higher. But actually not so, GM made no profit rather a staggering US$ 38.7bn loss in 2007, the largest in the history of the auto industry!

We regret the inadvertent mistake. //////ICT plays a vital role in economic and social development of a country. It not only develops the communication technology but also increases the productivity of a country. But it is a matter of regret that Bangladesh is lagging behind in the ICT sector. The World Economic Forum has issued 'The Global Information Technology Report' 2007-08 on the basis of the following things: quick internet facilities, poverty alleviation, ensuring national activities through maximum utilisation of ICT, inventions and e-skills, business network, transmission for IT generation etc. In that report Bangladesh has been given the 124th position out of 127 countries, our IT ranking and the score is 2.65 which is very shameful for us. In South Asia, computer came first in Bangladesh. Yet we are lagging behind other nations in the region. The position of other countries are Nepal 119th (2.88), Pakistan 89th (3.37), Sri Lanka 79th (3.58), India 50th (4.06). On the other hand, some poverty, hunger, war affected countries have done very well. But it is a very interesting development that the present government is issuing licence for Call Centre. It is a positive sign of improvement in the IT sector. Bangladesh needs a definite plan. It has a lot of potential in this sector and also a bright future.//////Years have lapsed since we spoke against the Aerial Seismic Survey in the Sundarbans that was envisioned by Shell Company in September 2003. Now it's Chevron's turn to take steps to conduct Aerial Seismic survey (ASS) in Lawachhara forest and in addition we hear there will be small charges of seismic explosives (biodegradable they claim). Lawachhara is a forest very rich in flora and fauna. Our concern is why are we heading for this survey in the first place? If a better prospect of gas is found in the area, will the next step be to start digging up the forest to claim the gas fields? In the past during the BNP government, the pipeline was laid through the Lawachhara forests and announced when it was nearing completion. Can our forest department or for that matter MoEF take decisions without public opinion? The first lesson in democracy tells us to seek public opinion for state owned property. //////I was awfully shocked when I received my national ID card. I could not recognise my photograph in the card. Those who came to collect their respective National ID card were flabbergasted to see their photographs. They could not, like me, recognise their own pictures. Not a single person was satisfied with the distorted photograph in the identity card. Crores of taka have been spent by the government for the National ID card. The photograph in the identity card is neither colour nor black and white. It is simply an irritating and confusing picture.//////We read very frequently about the drinking water crisis in Dhaka City. How can the consumers expect safe drinking water when Dhaka Wasa does not use sufficient doses of chemicals to kill the bacteria, but they pay the bills to the suppliers of chemicals!!//////The news of government fixing fares of CNG-run autorickshaws and AC/ non-AC taxicabs published in The Daily Star on 04/2008 has not had any impact on the situation. //////Bangladesh's poor people are bearing the brunt of the food price rise as part of the global food crisis. According to a large number of critics the cause of the present food problem in Bangladesh is the inefficiency of the caretaker government. If we do not try to understand the problem in the global context, then the government or the public will not be able to solve or alleviate the food problem to reduce the sufferings of the poor.//////It was a news report in The Daily Star that an 8-year old girl was arrested for drug peddling. I cannot understand why the law enforcers did not apply their common sense and work out that an eight-year old could not commit such a crime. They should have understood that even if an eight-year old girl is found with drugs, she is to be treated as a victim of the circumstances. However, she was freed eventually. I would like to thank the reporter and the DS team.//////After reading The Daily Star report on the Ulema Council's review comments on the National Women Policy, I feel it necessary as a citizen of Bangladesh to put in my "two cents" on several of the issues debated by the Ulema Council as presented in the DS report.//////This objective oriented diagnosis is for finding a solution-- so I studied my daily commuting experience in Dhaka Metropolitan City (DC) roads. We need a turnaround or I call it branding to make the road management effective. This does not require 'rocket science software', as Deming's plan-do-check-act PDCA cycle - a world class execution recipe, can do it effectively. //////Our treatment of animals should be full of sympathy. But not all of us show sympathy. Animals are often mistreated or killed unnecessarily. They are subdued for man's pleasure.//////In our country, a high percentage of non-working women have husbands with a high level of income. Another important finding is that less educated women have more children than more educated women, regardless of their working status. The level of education and work status of women would determine the variation in their performance in different areas at home. As expected, non-working women are found to spend more time in child care, personal care and other activities at home than working women. On the other hand, working women are found to be more efficient in raising mentally- developed and well- adjusted children. Working women take greater control in decision making at home than non-working women. Husbands seem to be more satisfied with the non-working wives than the working wives. A greater percentage of unhappy wives are also working women. Job satisfaction of working women can only make up partially for their discontent regarding child care and house care. //////Due to the whimsical actions of the present government and especially due to the abnormally high prices of essential commodities like rice, oil, pulses etc, the common people find themselves in a very difficult situation.//////Following the win in the Pennsylvania primary, Sen. Hillary Clinton's race for Democratic presidential nomination got a momentum. Congrats, Hillary!//////A few days ago I had to go to Chittagong from Dhaka by an AC bus. The journey was comfortable. But I was surprised to see that almost all the buses and trucks on the trunk road were using "hydraulic horns" causing loud noise. This is causing much discomfort to the passengers as well as the people residing on both sides of the National Highway.//////The interview piece on Babu English by Ahmede Hussain on Bangladeshi writer in English Tabish Khair (DS Star Weekend Magazine, 14- 3- 08) was interesting, but ticklish for the lay readers. The questions were of intellectual level; but it is encouraging to note that Bangladeshi writers are appearing in the world of global English (latest T Aman).//////It appears that the Election Commission (EC) is engaged or at least trying to get engaged in a fruitless "dialogue" and spending months trying to talk to politicians and so-called "dozen men" political parties and wasting its time. It's just waste of time. They are all the same bunch of people who are responsible for bringing the county to this messy situation. I am sure if the EC goes on like this forever, no fruitful result will come out of it.//////My means of transport is CNG. However, when we want to go to any place like Dhanmondi, Rajarbagh or Gulshan, the CNG drivers just reject us rudely. When they do agree they charge double the amount of money, instead of going by the meter as they are supposed to. Add to that, they are always complaining about how they cannot afford the money that they need to give to the owners. But I can always see one or two CNG's sitting idle near every roadside teashop.//////Palestinian militant groups were in Cairo yesterday for Egyptian-mediated talks on a possible truce with Israel that has already been approved by the Islamist Hamas.//////President Hamid Karzai was warned of a weekend assassination plot against him, Afghanistan's intelligence chief said Tuesday, while admitting failings by security services.//////The Communist Party of Nepal (UML) yesterday offered conditional support to a Maoist-led government, demanding a common minimum programme based on "national consensus" and one of the top three posts.//////Asking the Centre to play a 'major role' to bring both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE to negotiating table, the BJP today said the recent meeting between Priyanka Vadhra and Nalini, a convict in the Rajiv Gandhi Assassination case, was done with a 'motif'.//////The judges sacked on November 3, 2007, will be restored through a constitutional package likely in two weeks, Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari said on Monday.//////A damning report by the European Police Office puts Pakistan in the spotlight, pointing an accusing finger at the tribal areas as the "command and control centre" for al-Qaeda's "remaining core leadership" planning attacks in the EU.//////Reluctant "crown prince" Rahul Gandhi is finally getting his hands dirty in India's tumultuous politics after years of dithering about filling the boots of his illustrious forebears.//////Chinese authorities on Tuesday jailed 30 people for between three years and life for their role in last month's Tibetan unrest, state press reported.//////Sri Lanka hailed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit Monday as an important step in cementing closer ties between the two nations. //////As uncertainty loomed over the Indo-US civil nuclear deal, the Bush Administration said it is "never" going to declare the stalled pact "dead" since the deal is considered "critically important". //////Muslim voters have emerged as a key battleground in London's mayoral elections this week, the first chance for most to vote since the 2005 suicide bombings by Islamic extremists in the city.//////The children locked in the basement never saw the light of day for years.

Since the beginning of her career she has telegraphed her intentions and labelled herself more efficiently than any observer. She has titled albums ////// and, in 2005, ////// for a collection that mingled personal and Biblical reflections with club grooves. Flaunting her ever-changing image, she named one tour //////, another //////.//////AT the first World Food Summit held in Rome in 1996, the heads of states of all countries in the world had "reaffirmed the right of access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger." The world leaders at that time agreed to halve the number of hungry people in the world by 2015.//////IT is often said that the housing industry is a fair barometer of the country's economy. Invariably, a successful and thriving economy is represented by a booming real-estate market. A few good examples are Hong Kong and Singapore in the recent past, and India, China, Dubai at present.//////APRIL 23 was the sixteenth death anniversary of Satyajit Ray. The extraordinary talent of Satyajit Ray came to mean a great deal of pride and honour for anyone born in the sub-continent. What started as a daring exposure of life under rural poverty in Pather Panchali, Ray continued in his long journey and went on to open up new vistas in the difficult task of cinematic art. To this world of art, however, Ray was a relative newcomer. But, such was the power of his creative genius that he met with success almost from the very start. //////TODAY is the anniversary of the first time a US president appeared on TV: Franklin D.
