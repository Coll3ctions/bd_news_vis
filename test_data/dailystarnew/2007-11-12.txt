If requisite number of pilgrims are available, the purpose will be well served.//////Suggestions, counter suggestions and controversies are raging in the public mind and the media whether to allow registration of political parties based on religion. This is a wider question than whether to allow a particular party or parties which opposed the Bangladesh independence struggle on the basis of religion, to be registered, because it should be noted that the creation of Pakistan and its separation from India was only possible because of the then Muslim League which was a political party based exclusively on the religion of Islam. The Congress Party (founded I understand by an Englishman!) was, on the other hand, a fully democratic party with followers of all religions being allowed to be its members. This difference in nature of those two parties at that time perhaps is the reason for the sympathy of the last Viceroy Mountbatten and the British government of the day to the demands and aspirations of the Congress, rather than the Muslim League.//////I must congratulate the CTG and the army chief for their collective perseverance and commitment to salvage the lost dignity of our beloved nation. Since independence, and especially following the brutal August coup in 1975, a small elite, to the detriment of our impoverished majority, has repeatedly looted the country. This political class and their cohorts must never be allowed another opportunity to build the nation. So, fixing a date for election was wrong for two reasons://////We all expected during the ongoing emergency power rule that the innumerable irregularities, rules and regulations (anti people) of the past political governments would be amended and made pro-people by the CTG.

No article about Bangladesh is without its quota of insults! //////It's very natural for the Bangladeshis to get outraged at the Jamaat's recent comments. //////Currently, a great many people sound less enthusiastic about letter writing and reading. What makes them show such apathy? It seems that the advantage of current mobile text option and our less cognizance of the importance as well past contribution of letters are responsible for this apathy. If we look 200-250 years back, we find mankind is heavily indebted to letter writers. History says people of the 17th century were more enthusiastic about writing letters. The reason behind this enthusiasm is that very few mediums at that time were as instructive or communicative as letter. Samuel Richardson's "Familiar Letters" 91739) is a luminous example which serves as a model for uneducated in its correspondence. Another thing needs mentioning that Novel, the most popular genre of modern literature, got its origin from the compilation of letters. "Pamela" (1741) by Samuel Richardson is the evidence where we detect a series of letters that serve to instruct pretty girls how to avoid the snares that might be laid down against their virtue. Add to all, letter has another connotation in literature as in some cases letters got transformed into poetry, Elizabeth Barret Browning's "Sonnet from Portuguese," a renowned sonnet-sequence in English literature, is originally nothing but a mere collection of passionate and amorous letters addressed to her sweet-heart Robert Browning.//////With due respect I beg to state that, my husband the late Ruhul Amin was a govt. employee and he expired on 08/12/04 in his workplace, Dhaka Medical College, while on duty.//////We have heard a brief interview of the law and information adviser on the BBC Bengali service regarding establishment of a separate secretariat for the judiciary. The law adviser informed that the government at the moment was not considering the idea of a separate secretariat for the judiciary.

He did not however elaborate on the procedures to be followed to enact and implement such a dual and complex function to be performed by the ministry of law. The functions he briefly mentioned are appointment, transfer, posting, promotion(?) etc, might include financial authority too. Ironically, these are tools for administrative power play. On the other hand, the administrative service association has already put up hurdles on the very process of implementation of the decision to separate the judiciary from the executive. Apparently, they have points for consideration, and the government is trying to address the issue.//////Pakistan's military ruler has amended a law to give sweeping powers to army courts to try civilians on charges such as treason and inciting public unrest, officials said yesterday as a key opposition leader prepared to stage a massive, 185-mile protest march in defiance of a ban. //////Sri Lanka's military has vowed to go "all out" to target Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran during air strikes on rebel positions, a state-run newspaper reported yesterday. //////President Bush stepped up praise of Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf Saturday, hailing "positive steps" the general took by promising to lift emergency rule, resign as army chief and hold elections. //////The United States has developed contingency plans to safeguard Pakistani nuclear weapons if they risk falling into the wrong hands, but US officials worry that their limited knowledge about the location of the arsenal could pose a problem, The Washington Post reported Sunday. //////Top Democratic senators Saturday urged President George W Bush to seek a "more effective" strategy for Pakistan, Afghanistan and al-Qaeda, following the "deeply disturbing" actions of the Pakistani leader. //////Foreign ministers will debate whether Pakistan should be suspended from the Commonwealth over President Pervez Musharraf's declaration of emergency rule at an extraordinary meeting today. //////Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice denied Sunday that the United States was bent on war with Iran and renewed an offer of reconciliation talks if the Islamic republic renounces its nuclear drive. //////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Sunday hailed an "historic opportunity" for peace as his people marked the third anniversary of the death of his iconic predecessor Yasser Arafat. //////Five-metre high waves smashed a Russian tanker in half yesterday, spilling 1,300 tonnes of fuel oil into the Kerch Strait between Russia and Ukraine and sank two other cargo ships, officials said. //////Thousands of Kurdish guerrillas have crossed the border into Iran to escape a threatened Turkish offensive against their mountain redoubts in northern Iraq, a former rebel leader said. //////The death toll rose to three in more clashes in an east Indian farming region where several people died this month in protests against plans to build a massive industrial park, police said. //////Hindu nationalists will take power today in southern India for the first time after a five-week political standoff that finally ended with the reconciliation of uneasy coalition partners. //////Prince Harry and his girlfriend Chelsy Davy have split up after the young royal missed her 22nd birthday party to attend the rugby union World Cup final, the News of the World reported Sunday. //////Talks between public health officials and the drug industry on a deal to ensure that people in poor countries can receive medicines at affordable prices ended inconclusively yesterday.//////Japan's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda may dissolve the lower house of parliament and call a snap election if the opposition passes a censure motion against him, a ruling party leader said yesterday. //////Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki yesterday announced an amnesty for those detainees who had been "deceived" into joining the insurgency in Iraq. //////Sudeep Sen, the internationally acclaimed poet and literary editor, was awarded the Kathak Literary Award for his contribution to Bangladeshi literature on November 9.
