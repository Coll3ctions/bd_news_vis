On the Awami League side were, besides Mujib, Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M Mansoor Ali, Khondokar Moshtaque Ahmed and Dr Kamal Hossain. Assisting President Yahya Khan at the talks were General Peerzada, Justice Cornelius and Col. Hasan. As Kamal Hossain would later relate the details of the day's talks, incidents involving the Pakistan army and Bengali civilians the previous day, when a truck carrying soldiers came under attack from the Bengalis, as also Bengali resistance to an unloading of ammunition from MV Swat (a point which the White Paper of the junta in August of the year would make) came up for discussion. It was especially General Yahya who brought up the issue. In a rather agitated voice, the President told the Awami League team that though he had arrived in Dhaka to find a way out of the crisis and had asked the army to exercise restraint, he could not tolerate any hindrances to movements by troops in the province.//////A rashly driven bus ploughed through a procession, killing at least eight people and injuring 52 others on Dhaka-Kuakata highway at Amtoli of Barguna last night.//////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia has asked the party's expelled vice-chairman Nazmul Huda to work for the opposition-backed panel in the Supreme Court Bar Association election. //////The parliamentary special committee on constitution amendment is now looking for ways to further consolidate citizens' fundamental rights true to the aspirations of the constitution of 1972. //////Japan confirmed the presence of radioactive iodine contamination in food products from near the crippled Fukushima nuclear power station and ordered a halt to the sale of such products from the area. //////BNP Senior Vice-Chairman Tarique Rahman will play an important role in selecting one for the secretary general post which fell vacant after Khandaker Delwar Hossain died, said party insiders.//////Bangladesh has sent 15 project proposals, mostly related to rail and infrastructure, worth $781 million under the $1 billion credit line to the Indian government for final consent.//////The fifth population census of the country came to an end yesterday with complaints of leaving out a lot of people from the enumeration process.//////BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain was laid to rest yesterday at his family graveyard at Khirai Pachuria in Ghior upazila of Manikganj.//////A local leader of Bangladesh Chhatra League was shot dead and 12 were injured in a pre-poll violence in Terokhada upazila of Khulna yesterday morning. //////Two youths died by inhaling poisonous fumes after they climbed down into a newly-built septic tank at Sapahar upazila of Naogaon, yesterday morning.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate the operation of two newly-built rental power plants and also lay foundation for another one at three separate locations in Narayanganj today.//////Muggers tried to snatch a seven-month old girl after shooting at her mother at the capital's Hatirpool area yesterday.//////Sri Lanka's president said yesterday his party's landslide victory in local elections was an endorsement of the government's focus on rebuilding rural areas after decades of civil war.//////Pressure mounted on Bahrain to exercise restraint and ensure the safety of arrested opposition leaders, as a fourth person died yesterday after security forces quelled a month-old pro-democracy protest earlier this week.//////The appeal by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR for international assistance in repatriating thousands of foreigners fleeing Libya is the biggest sign of what governments can yet do to help captive citizens. The situation is particularly difficult for the thousands of Bangladeshis who remain stranded on the frontier between Libya and Tunisia, a condition that looks likely to continue now that the IOM has run out of funds. While one expects the international community to come forward, and quickly with emergency funds, one also believes that governments such as Bangladesh's should be doing a whole lot more to help their own people out of the crisis. //////The state that the national carrier is in at present it can do well without any poorly planned step.

The yen strengthened significantly on the back of strong anticipated repatriation by Japanese investors and a spike in risk aversion. The yen steadied around a four-month high versus the dollar on Wednesday, but Japan's nuclear crisis could trigger more yen demand versus higher risk currencies, raising the prospect of intervention to stem gains. The dollar traded at 80.70 yen, just above a four-month low of 80.60 yen hit on Monday. Higher risk aversion could push up the yen, on speculation Japanese financial institutions will repatriate funds to Japan and on renewed selling of higher risk currencies, although the dollar's record low of 79.75 yen looms. Since a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Japan on Friday, the yen has risen, partly on market speculation that Japanese insurers and companies may repatriate funds to help pay claims and reconstruction costs. Concerns the Japanese authorities will intervene to weaken the yen have limited its upside so far. Other "safe-haven" currencies including the dollar and the Swiss franc were supported by ongoing uncertainty about the aftermath of Japan's earthquake and political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa. The dollar index rose 0.3 percent, while the Swiss franc traded at 0.9166 francs per dollar, hovering in range of an all-time high hit on Tuesday. The euro slipped 0.5 percent to having failed to break above a four-month high of $1.4036 hit earlier this month. Market participants said offers to sell the euro lay above $1.40, keeping downward pressure on the single currency. //////Call money rates stayed steady, and mostly traded in the 11-12% band. //////USD/BDT rates remained steady, while liquidity situation was improved.//////Libyan rebels in general are harmless to Bangladeshi expatriates, said a Bangladeshi chest surgeon, who safely managed to flee home from the Libyan political upheaval along with three nurses. //////Birth registration rate in char and remote areas of coastal region is low as most people are unaware of its importance due to extreme poverty and illiteracy.//////Local businesses having trade links with Japan see no immediate risk from Japan crisis, but are concerned about the potential negative impact on the country's economy.//////A new sector development plan for water supply and sanitation has been proposed for an investment of $21 billion in next 15 years to ensure everybody's access to safe drinking water and sanitary latrines in the country.//////The much-awaited Hatirjheel-Begunbari roads are likely to be opened on a temporary basis from November.//////The government has asked the Bangladesh ambassador in Greece to send home the nine bodies of migrant workers, who jumped off a ship during evacuation from Libya to the Greek island of Crete on March 6.//////Former adviser to a caretaker government Advocate Sultana Kamal yesterday urged all to show a positive attitude towards people with disabilities to protect their rights.//////Prime Minister's International Affairs Adviser Gowhar Rizvi said construction of Padma Bridge would not be hampered, although Japan is affected by a series of disasters.//////A mobile court in the city's Uttara yesterday sentenced a university student to a one and a half years in jail for uploading vulgar photographs of a female college student on the internet.//////Home Minister Sahara Khatun yesterday vowed to extend her ministry's full cooperation in the immediate implementation of the proposed 'Victim and Witness Protection Act'.//////Gono Forum President Dr Kamal Hossain yesterday said a conspiracy is being planned to make the country's judiciary ineffective.//////The general administration committee of Supreme Court (SC) today will decide on a government proposal for the transfer of around 60 lower court judges across the country. //////A private university student was stabbed by miscreants in front of his house in Khilgaon of the city last evening.//////A weeklong art exhibition by artists of the Indian state of Tripura began at the Fine Arts faculty of Dhaka University (DU) yesterday.//////A teenage housewife with severe burn injuries fights for her life after her husband allegedly set her ablaze at their Tongi residence on the city's outskirts Friday.//////The newly-floated Development Care Foundation, a non- profitable social organisation launched a new health initiative titled 'Shushasthya' (sound health) with basic objective to ensure health promotion and disease prevention through creation of health literacy among the community at village Mohammadpur, Bairag of Anwara upazilla on Friday.//////A fire broke out in the forest of Kata Pahar on Chittagong University campus yesterday.//////The 91st birth anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the National Children's Day were observed at Bangladesh High Commission in Washington DC on March 17 with due respect.//////Indigenous people across the country yesterday rejected a parliamentary committee's decision to give them constitutional recognition as 'ethnic groups' and urged the government to consider them as 'indigenous people'.//////The law enforcers are yet to submit the charge sheet a year after the gruesome killing of Sylhet Government Women's College teacher Harun Ur Rashid.//////At least 22 killing grounds (Bodhyabhumi), where hundreds of Bangalees were massacred by the Pakistan occupation forces during the War of Liberation in 1971 here are lying neglected even after 40 years of independence of the country.//////The special court-12 will frame charges against 21 mutineers of 39 Battalion under Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in Chapainawabganj today.//////At least 21 shops were gutted in a fire at a market in Mithamoin upazila yesterday.//////District Task Force members early yesterday arrested three people including owner of a fertiliser factory and seized one truck-load of adulterated fertiliser.//////A woman was beaten to death allegedly by her elder brother centering a family feud at Leshiara village under Kasba upazila yesterday.

On Saturday morning, when the victim went to a nearby pond for taking bath Shafiqul sexually harassed her. As the victim cried for help, locals caught Shafiqul red-handed and took him to the mobile court led by Sundarganj UNO.//////District BNP office of Kurigram was ransacked allegedly by BCL cadres on Friday. Office secretary of the district BNP Ashraful Haque Rubel said following a quarrel between activists of Chhatra League and activists of Swechhashebak Dal near Kurigram Sadar Hospital gate, the BCL men attacked the district BNP office at night. They broke doors, windows, television and furniture of the office. They also hit convener of the district Hindu Welfare Parishad Drejendra Nath Shah with a billhook injuring him seriously. President of the district Chhatra League Minhajul Abedin however refuted the allegation. //////I stood dumbfounded watching on TV the severest temblor (8.9 on the Richter Scale) to hit Japan during the past 140 years since it began keeping record of tremors. //////The recent price hike has certainly irked the ruling party government. The general masses are also suffering a great deal for the upward surge of the commodity price. Prices of oil and rice have already gone beyond the reach of the lower-middle class people of our country. The middle-class is also finding it difficult to keep pace with the market price of the daily necessaries. To curb this annoying problem, the government should reform the regulatory bodies to make them effective to supervise the market situation. The regulatory teams should also observe the market closely and calibrate price lists acceptable to both the customers and traders. Creating a price list somehow or other has not been of any use. Consumers' Association of Bangladesh, CAB, should also play active roles to uphold the interest of the customers. As an average consumer has nearly no clout over the price of commodities, the government must take organized measures to regulate market prices and make the lives of civilians a little easier.//////Fatwa has now become an ugly word, as it is associated with the recent cruelty causing the death of a young girl, coming from a needy family. The excesses being carried out in the name of 'Fatwa' pronounced by illiterate persons, whose knowledge of Islamic thoughts and philosophy is often extremely scant, needs to be stopped! //////The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) recently revealed in its annual Year Book that tons of throw-away plastic and massive runoff from chemical fertiliser are choking the world's oceans. The report stressed on the need for adopting urgent measures to protect the marine environments which has already experienced significant damages due to over-exploitation and acidification caused by the climate change.Time has come when countries all over the world need to take individual initiatives to control environmental pollutions due to industrial wastes and agricultural chemicals. Switching on to organic agriculture can significantly reduce the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides which harm the overall environment including the marine environment. Proper industrial and general waste management, recycling of plastic and other materials can help control the environmental pollution caused by these elements. In all the cases, governments have to design an institutional set-up to regulate, for instance, organic agricultural system, because refraining from the use of synthetic agricultural inputs does not merely mean organic agriculture. It requires an appropriate farming system, certification of organic products, etc. to run organic agriculture.//////Stalking, harassing and killing of girls continue unabated despite condemnation and concerns expressed by many.

I think nothing could be more appropriate concerning what is happening with Nobel Prize winner Prof. Yunus.//////Any American intervention in Libya will raise the accusation that the imperialist Americans are trying to control Libya's vast oil resources. As such, President Barack Obama has been wise not to intervene militarily, despite the Libyan rebels are being slaughtered by Gaddafi's African mercenaries. But if all other nations stand by, Gaddafi will crush the opposition in the same way Burma's military junta crushed the popular revolt in that Asian country. As such, the international community will have to find a way out from this impasse. One solution will be to prod France and Italy to send a joint military contingent to stop the massacre of Libyans by Gaddafi's forces. A joint Franco-Italian contingent will be enough to defeat Gaddafi's mercenaries. Once Gaddafi is defeated, the United Nations should organise a general election and help the country to build democratic institutions. This way, Libya will be liberated without any American intervention.//////While the battles rage in Libya, calls are growing on the international community to impose a no-fly zone to cripple Gaddafi's air force, the reality is there's a lot of, frankly, loose talk about some of these military options, and let's just call a spade a spade. A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses." (Secretary of Defense Robert Gates)//////I often remember Imam Abu Daud (R)--one of the six-purest Hadith book writers--who took just four Hadiths as the fundamental code of his life. The four Hadiths are as follows://////I would rather like to term this action of the government as dacoity in broad day light. The party in power has imposed this arbitrary tax on the owners of motor vehicles of the country, which is on top of Motor Vehicle Tax and Fitness Tax, saying that this tax would be adjusted at the time of submitting Tax Returns. The BNP government, did away with this Tax, which was imposed by the party in power when it came to power the last time. This Tax used to be Tk.3, 000 now it has been raised to Tk.8, 000 an increase by Tk.5,000. The government is further contemplating to impose property tax on those who own property, which I believe is again going to be on top of all kinds of existing taxes that goes with the property.//////Believe it or not, I qualified in the BCS examination not by reading but by leaking the question papers and by political connection. So I know a little English. Throughout my student life I yielded weapons as a cadre so if you want to learn that, come to me said one of the government college English teachers to the students without feeling any compunction. I personally know about many BCS Cadres who find comfortable mixing with drunkards and miscreants rather than with the enlightened. Then to confirm my conviction came the report-A total of 3295 (20.11%) of candidates appearing at the 18th BCS examination (held in 1996-97) got zero in English, even though some of them qualified for BCS posts.//////The logical and sensible essay by Quddus published on 22nd. February, along with his sincere advice to Obama; is easier said than done! It expresses his thoughts on M-E liberty, but may not coincide with US ground realities. Possibly, President Obama is at a disadvantage, for taking a realistic and rational decision; for more reasons than one. Middle East regimes are clearly either for or against USA; which will give all support for setting up democracy in Syria; but will that hold true for Saudi Arabia? //////More than ten million people depend on water supplied by Dhaka WASA. In Dhaka, water for construction work, for washing, for bathing, for cooking food, for drinking is supplied by Dhaka WASA.
