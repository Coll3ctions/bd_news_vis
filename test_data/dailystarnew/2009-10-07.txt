It is so because the move came after the JS rejected the recommendations made by a standing committee of the House to the effect that lawmakers be given advisory roles in the corporations.

However, I believe the politician's understanding of their work is different! After all the musician's work is to make music, the statisticians produce statistics, the electrician does electrical work, and the anaesthesiologist gives anaesthesia.//////The recent report in The Daily Star regarding the alleged abduction, rape and torture of a schoolgirl by BCL activists is extremely disturbing. As the victim and her family appear to be almost imprisoned by the alleged perpetrators and their political big brothers, the first step would be to free them from their clutches. In Bangladesh it is very difficult to achieve unless human rights and/or women rights activists come forward and play their due role. In the prevailing situation, I urge the honourable Judges of the Supreme Court to be proactive and issue a suo moto rule on the issue to bring the culprits and their protectors to book. //////The first day of April is traditionally the fools' day in the western countries.

A leader can change her style, response to well articulated questions (including supplementary) related to national and international issues Bangladesh has to confront and address in the coming days. I think Sheikh Hasina did her best in this interview with Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury of VOA.

I am sure Sheikh Hasina would be very pleased with what she has said in the interview. This will also dispel a lot of our apprehension that she is missing the reality of the situation in her governance. Thanks to Mr Choudhury for his sincere efforts to get the best of Sheikh Hasina. //////Out of 15 crore people in this country only 7 lakh people are taxpayers. This is the story going on through different newspapers, talk shows, and income tax bosses. This is evident from their attitude, talks, behaviour in every forum that they want to extend the tax net to every sphere of life in order to increase revenue income of the government. Conscious people who were so long ignorant about the importance of income tax payment are becoming interested to pay income tax from their salary income, business income or whatever may be the source after observing different advertisements in print and electronic media that payment of tax in time would save them from harassments and legal complications in future and at the same time the poor country would be largely benefited. //////I never understood why as Bangladeshis, we are so enamoured with Indian/Bollywood stars. I bring this issue up and it is most definitely an issue because of the love I see in my fellow countrymen for these so called superstars. I myself have seen one Bollywood movie in the past twenty years but I do know my mother loves Shabana Azmi as an actress and has been her fan since Shabana Azmi's debut on the golden screen. Recently, Ms. Azmi made an appearance in Bangladesh. She made an appearance last week at a prominent business tycoon's residence for dinner and snubbed a lot of these ladies(adoring fans) attending the party. Superstars never should forget what got them there - their FANS ! Ms. Azmi should do well to remember that the high precipice that she walks on was built by her fans. She should not be riding such a high horse just because a few adoring fans wanted their pictures taken with her. //////We were shocked and angry to read the news in The Daily Star of 30.9.09 that some 'filthy' rich people are conspiring to convert the Dhanmondi playground in Road no.8 into a stadium etc. This is a sinister move by 'bhumi dacoits'. In our opinion they are crossing all limits of greed. We wonder what benefits the residents of Dhanmondi will reap from this conspiracy to hijack the playground. They have also shown the audacity and evil 'intelligence' of using Sheikh Jamal's name and goodwill to advance their conspiracy. This is a blatant emotional blackmail of the Awami league and the nation. Probably we, the common people, love and cherish the memory of Sheikh Jamal more than these 'new rich matlabis'.//////The assertion by the Honourable Home Minister that terrorism came into being with the assassination of Bangabandhu is not correct. Terrorism has been there since time immemorial. With the assassination of Bangabandhu terrorism has become multi-faced.//////The govt should find out the unscrupulous traders who create artificial scarcity of goods like rice, sugar, etc. //////Our National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam was a poet, musician, revolutionary, and philosopher who pioneered poetic works espousing intense spiritual rebellion against orthodoxy and oppression.

Among his contemporaries are Murtaja Baseer, Rashid Chowdhury, Devbas Chakraborty and Abdur Razzaque. He made an immense contribution by introducing modern paintings in Bangladesh. He gradually changed his styles, and established himself as a significant painter in Bangladesh. Painting, for me, is the best way to knowledge, the best means to participate profoundly in the global life, said Islam.//////I have seen a great deal and gained a lot of experience. Along the way I have learnt that the world is not so easy as I once perceived it. Gone are those days of innocence when I used to trust everyone and believe whatever I was told.

But that issue, published in August, was only Part 1 of a six-part story. Although Archie did marry Veronica, things will take a turn in November, when Archie proposes to the lady in waiting, Betty Cooper. That's just the latest twist in the romantic triangle that has thrust this nearly 70-year-old character, and his parent company, into the media spotlight.//////WHEN none other than US President Barack Obama says that Bangladeshi peace-keepers, under the blue helmets, not only enhanced the prestige of our country but also the honour of the United Nations, one feels elated and proud. Indeed, our peace-keepers' hard work and efforts during the past twenty-one years in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Somalia and other hot spots have not gone unnoticed. I had the privilege of being involved with the coordination of our peacekeeping missions, first as director general (International Organisations) and then as the foreign secretary, and recall the moments of tension and crises that our peacekeepers had to go through in some missions.//////THE Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of November 2006, which laid the foundation of a temporary peace in Nepal and created a conducive atmosphere for the elections held in April 2008, has come to a standstill.//////IT is not easy to run when you are carrying the top half of a water cooler.
