I do so for many reasons and in many different ways. I set out every morning for work only after I see the sun rising in the east. The red orb, peeking above the trees and houses, is my cue to get going. On days when I get up before the sun, I toss and turn in my bed, with many tunes in my head. But the one I sing often is Tagore's ////// (O my tired soul! Why dost thou not raise thyself?) The first rays of the sun clear any lingering oboshota in me.

First, as I am driving on the country road winding through my town, the sun has just topped the low-lying houses and is of a bright red color, it sometimes comes up right in front of me, often almost blinding my eyes. I need to be careful since if I am not, I might be hitting another driver ahead of me, also trying to shield his/her eyes, and might even have slowed down or stopped. Soon, as I take a northward turn, the sun moves to my right and keeps me company as I drive past Stonehill College, and then some open fields to the right. The red floating ball of fire is now picking up momentum and may be a few inches above the horizon, still in its bright red garb, but more golden than red. While I try to keep my eyes on the road, I turn my head for a split second or two to see if the sun is still there, but more to see its color and its majestic face. //////I could not see the splendor of mother earth so far //////As I have blindfolded myself, overwhelmed by selfish desire //////Which instigated me to craft ways to remain concentrated //////In the self love that almost has left me deserted.////// A wee bit of cloud//////A skimpy shower//////A long night and a short story.//////He was the physique, she the shadow//////He was the immense sky, she its dcor//////The winds that stroked her hair was he//////The sun that made her bloom was his love//////The day he went silent//////The swarthy sky turned the cheerful earth ebony//////All the lights dimmed . . . //////I made up stories, made up excuses//////There was the need for all those//////I wanted to run to you//////There was the rain to stop me//////Maybe the road mayhem//////Or the ranting street//////If I were blind//////It would dissolve//////The dancing landscape//////Letters of language//////Colour of people//////Face of smiles and tears//////I covet the day//////When I fell in love with you//////Yet the mood withers in stages//////Passing countless days and nights//////Restless and sleepless//////Since my days are at the top//////Of vibrations, vices and hurdles//////At every break of dawn,//////The white cloaked boatmen wait pensively//////Tracking our tiptoes //////We perform our pantomime with great elegance//////Perennial visions of the snakes still sovereign his mind.//////Beheaded snakes, he chants there lying in the//////monotonous white reality.//////But we still dance with our strings attached. //////Most daintily, most impeccably.//////Like ballerinas we sway//////You looked up and I beheld//////your eyelids pulled down;//////Got message, you will not ever frown//////Worldwide, about 285 million people are visually impaired and 80 percent of them are either preventable or treatable.
