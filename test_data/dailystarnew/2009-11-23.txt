We wish, and so does the country, that Khaleda Zia had reassured the nation through an emphatic yes. But that was too much to expect from a single gesture of goodwill; yet, the big question is: why should the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have boycotted the JS for such an inordinately long time, doing neither any good to the party nor to the country?//////WE do not want to quote figures - even one death is one too many if that occurs due to abridgment of the due process of law.

In the process, he couldn't but clash with the vested interests, who were dislodged from their entrenched position of privilege. In the invisible war between the two in post-liberation Bangladesh the ire of the defeated elements of 1971 fell squarely on Bangabandhu and AL. The first full blast of that ire and the opening shots of the salvo aimed at the AL could be heard in the wee hours of August 15, 1975, when Bangabandhu, the nation's founding father, fell to the self-proclaimed assassins' bullets. With near precision the marauders mowed down the slain hero's entire family, missing his two daughters.//////LUBNA Hussein is a 34-year-old Sudanese journalist, who is now famous for wearing pants.

On this very day armed forces of Bangladesh took a ceremonious birth. Although November 21, 1971 is marked to be the raising day of the Bangladesh armed forces, the Bengali members of army, navy and air force conducted operations in their respective domains against the occupation forces from March 26, 1971. These organs of the armed forces had been carrying out massive destruction of the occupation forces during the liberation war without any pragmatic national directives and military planning. As a matter of fact in the tense situation of our national life in those days when occupation forces were committing inhuman atrocities all over East Pakistan, the armed forces of Bangladesh came into being to confront the occupation forces.//////Defending champions Abahani tasted their first defeat of the Premier League season as they went down to Biman by 29 runs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday.

As usual the blame is put on the government party. However, my observation is , if they want to go ahead despite all the obstacles {?}, one possible catch is already there. This is regarding the venue of the proposed council. We heard on the media news that they would hold the council in the Bangabandhu International Convention Centre. The question remains when and under what name the BNP will apply for that centre. They had renamed the centre after their taking over of power in 2001. I have never heard any top BNP leader to utter the word " Bangabandhu" of " Jatir Pita". Therefore, the high command of the BNP might not agree to apply for the centre under its present name. They might use the name they changed to. This is the catch I just foresee because the BNP might look for any single opportunity to blame the government if they do not get the centre using the changed name. This is just a characterisation of our overall political culture, especially the policy of the BNP.//////Much has been said about the horrendous traffic jam that has made the lives of Dhaka city residents miserable.
