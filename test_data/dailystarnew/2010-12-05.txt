As a report in Friday's issue of this newspaper makes clear, the shipping and environment departments have obviously seen little reason not to let these ships in. It is here that one wonders: are these departments at all aware of the legal moves taken in the recent past to keep such toxic vessels away from Bangladesh or have they simply decided on their own that High Court directives matter little and can easily be flouted? The sixteen ships in question have been given no objection certificates (NOCs) by the shipping authorities and are therefore now busy with the task of scrapping. Perhaps the issue would not have come to light had the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) not kept track of circumstances. The organization has served a legal notice on those responsible for issuing the NOCs despite the clear, unambiguous High Court orders relating to the issue.//////Why is the CHT region still a place of occasional violence and discontent, so many years after signing of the peace accord in 1997? //////In the past, whenever Mashrafe Bin Mortaza had made a return from injury he came back with more verve.

through the purchase of US Treasury bonds, known as the "Quantitative Easing" (QE2), has generated considerable controversy and debate both abroad and in the USA. The concern abroad is that this would cause their currencies to appreciate against the dollar and thereby reduces their export competitiveness. The outside world, which holds a lot of the US Treasury debt instruments, also worries that this policy will inflict capital losses by inflating the US economy and lowering the real value of these dollar debt instruments. The concern in the US is that the fiscal deficit is already very high ($1.3 trillion or 8.9 percent of GDP); this action will further raise the budget deficit and also increase inflationary expectations. //////Preventing money laundering, eliminating informal foreign remittance inflows and promoting savings among rural people have driven the theme of financial inclusion worldwide. Financial inclusion aims to include more people in the banking process. In Bangladesh, where only 13 percent of the population has a bank account and 33 percent a mobile phone, relevant parties are considering using mobile phones to deliver banking to the unbanked.

But do they take the rapidly changing climate and increasing incidence of natural disasters, such as sudden flood or drought, decreasing availability of farmlands or declining water availability on earth's surface into account?//////Centuries after the leaning tower of Pisa was built, we in Bangladesh are determined to build many tilting buildings in the many urban areas of Bangladesh! The easy way out seems to be to pass the blame on building designers! The reality is however something very much different! It starts as a case of 'ignorance is bliss'; with economy drive being the sole criteria of work! To begin with, ground clearance between adjacent buildings, which is quite important, is ignored! Every one wants to occupy as much land as possible, and the important clearances between built-up areas are ignored! Unlike Dhaka and may be Chittagong, there are no Rajuk like organisation to give approval, after taking into consideration these factors!//////This is a story about an old man and his son. It was a lovely day and both were sitting outside in their lawn. Hearing the chirping of a sparrow, the man asked, What is that? The son, who was busy reading the newspaper, nonchalantly replied, A sparrow. The man asked the same question a couple of times, and each time the son replied with increasing impatience and annoyance. At one point, the son burst out, How many times will I have to tell you that it's a sparrow? The man went in and came back with a diary, asking the son to read it aloud. //////There is nothing the BNP chief likes more than a fit of tantrum, and there is no saying who or what will provoke her. The thought that the destiny of our nation is determined by such people is indeed alarming. Though for long she has been famous for her tantrums, her latest act was a little too much. Unruly behaviour by a senior parliamentarian sets a bad example for first-time MPs. People watching the proceedings of the parliament as well as reports from print media received a jolt on seeing how casually an MP dishonoured parliamentary democracy and the rule of law of the judiciary. //////This whistle-blower website should be applauded for leaking so many secret documents. The best governance or democracy is one that is fully transparent and accountable. These leaks will have a sobering effect on reckless public servants at all levels and will bring greater morality to their behaviour. //////As soon as anyone comes out on the street, he or she is sure to be confronted with this phenomenal problem. It seems there is no respite from it. No one is willing to abide by the law; be he a rickshaw puller, truck driver, bus driver or car driver; everybody behaves in the same manner. Everybody wants to go ahead of the other, no matter whether it is right or wrong. Even a rickshaw puller, knowing very well that he cannot go faster than a motor vehicle, would, by all possible mean, try to overtake the car in front, in a bid to establish his supremacy over it.//////Dhaka University is one of the leading public universities of the country. But it is a matter of regret that the campus environment is going from bad to worse day by day. The university is situated in the middle of the city. As a result, the campus is always overcrowded. The roads are always busy with rickshaws, microbuses, ambulances and even local buses. Road accident is regular news. There are about 100 rickshaw garages in the campus. Besides, there are a large number of unhygienic roadside food shops. There is no place left for the DU students to sit, because outsiders gather everywhere. Roads are dirty and also in a bad condition. DU campus is now a place for the vagabonds, beggars, rickshaw-pullers and drug addicts.//////I came to know about him when I started reading books on our Liberation War. I did not see him face to face, but his activities gave me inspiration. He was Lt. General Mir Shawkat Ali, Commander of Sector-5 in our Liberation War. He was a former minister, lawmaker and ambassador. He was also an active member of the Sector Commanders' Forum.//////Now-a-days inter-district buses plying on Dhaka-Chittagong highway face severe traffic jam frequently at different points. Traffic jam starts from Sayedabad Bus Terminal and continues till the Kanchpur Bridge in the beginning of a journey. It occurs again on Gouripur- Motlob road and then on Moynamoti road of Comilla cantonment area. The authorities can build overpasses or take other alternative steps to save the commuters' time and lessen their miseries.//////Acid throwing is one of the most heinous crimes and very common in our country. Almost every day, we find the news of acid throwing in the daily newspapers. A frustrated lover who fails to win the heart of his beloved usually commits such obnoxious crime. In most cases, the victims succumb to injuries. Those who survive lead a miserable life with irreparable scars on their face and body.//////The root cause of America's unprecedented economic recession is the non-performing home loan. So-called 'sub-prime'- loan i.e. lending to a borrower of poor credit history with high flexible interest rate was made assuming abnormal degree of non-payment risk. Again, mainly basing on banks' huge home-loan business different kind of non-bank financial and non-bank, non-financial institutions in great number, such as Realtor, Processor, Discounter, Underwriter, Insurer, Re-insurer, Inspectors' firm, Service agency, title agency, closing agency etc. appeared and started playing in the market. Derivative financial products like bond, share, debenture etc. were assiduously structured and floated in the market. Most of the banks including the mega ones started to fail one after another due to capital and reserve inadequacy. //////We watched in the media how Begum Khaleda Zia broke down at her Gulshan office as she was evicted from her cantonment residence where she had lived for nearly four decades.

Its cause is not clear and its effect is yet to be understood. It cannot be called a cyber war. Yet cyberspace is the domain which is used to carry out all the belligerence. The war so far looks asymmetric. Here, the big powers looks the weakest and most vulnerable. On the other hand, a single organisation called Wikileaks is the Empire which is striking with full force. The pace at which Wikileaks is striking is simply phenomenal. The world powers are seemingly dazed and in a cyber stupor.//////There are some among us who impact our lives through their thoughts, while there are others who inspire us with their deeds, while the bravest and wisest both think courageously and act diligently. Late S.M. Ali was one of those rare people who belong to the third category. Even though he spent a significant portion of his life outside Bangladesh, it never had any effect on his ability to envision a future for Bangladesh, which not many had the sagacity to foresee. //////Today is the 82nd birth anniversary of Syed Mohammad Ali, founder editor and publisher of The Daily Star. He was the nephew of famous writers Syed Mujtaba Ali and Syed Murtaja Ali. //////It was the most brutal genocide ever known in the history of mankind. History has never seen such a large number of people wiped out in such a short period of the nine months of the Bangladesh liberation war. Between March 25, 1971 and December 16, 1971, Pakistani occupation army and their local collaborators killed 3 million innocent, unarmed people, violated more than a quarter million women; destroyed most of the factories, roads, bridges and culverts, burned houses, engaged in indiscriminate arson and plundering and created such an unbearable situation that 10 million people were forced to leave their country.//////A few hours before the birth of the new nation, on the evening of December 15, 1971, a microbus covered in mud, drove up to the front of our house. They took my father Dr. Abdul Alim Chaudhury away. On December 18, we found his lifeless body lying in a pool of blood in the Rayer Bazaar brickfield along with hundreds of other leading intellectuals of the day.//////The phrase ////// can sometimes give you a misleading impression. If you take the words in the sense of "trial of war criminals" then there is an apprehension of losing the complete sense it tries to convey about the ongoing trial of international crimes suspects. The words confine the meaning within only "war crimes", which should be its genus "international crimes", i.e. war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, and crimes against peace and international law. //////In order to resolve the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) problem through political and peaceful means, the CHT Accord, popularly known as CHT Peace Accord was signed between the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) on December 2, 1997.
