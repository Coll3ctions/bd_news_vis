The statements of the finance minister and the commerce minister on market management, especially on breaking the syndicates, were not based on facts. They should gather full information first and then give a policy prescription. This has only encouraged the private policy oversight institutions to come up with explicit comments on the syndicate issue. It is also important to note that the same person of this powerful oversight institutions has also provoked the existing syndicate to determine their course of action in the backdrop of the political note of warning and how they are going to respond negatively. We heard the commerce minister on channel i First Minister programme. He was informative and adopted a more practical approach to handle the syndicate. The most important thing he mentioned was that the syndicates exist and operate harmfully when political support is extended by the party in power. This is the catch issue. I hope both the ministers would keep this in mind as policy guideline. By the way, we are hearing about the syndicates since the BNP government. Tell us openly who are they or ask the FBCCI to find out who are they, why and how they operate.//////The financial nerve centre of India (Mumbai) faced the worst terrorist attack at 10 important sites.

Gaza has become the death-trap for thousands of helpless women and children.

Students are being admitted to English medium schools from the early stage and they get the opportunity to learn English.//////The people of the whole world found their expectations come true with the election which Barack Hossain Obama won by a big margin. He has acquired a mandate for change. Braving all odds he moved forward to create a new history.

It reminds us of the film "The Roots" where we saw the bravery of another great "Kuntakinte" who refused to change his name as suggested by his captors one hundred years ago. People around the world are now looking forward to watching the mettle of this young leader in tackling various issuesnational and international. //////We always talk about democracy, but how much democracy is there in the educational system? When we see the educational systems of city schools and village schools, we can realise that there are many differences. Most of the teachers of village schools, who have no experience, are not good enough. They cannot teach the students properly or appropriately. //////For developed and industrialised countries free market economy is a means to affluence and prosperity. Their mastery over science and technology and industry have enabled them to produce a plethora of agricultural crops, high standard varieties of goods and commodities, equipment and machineries, arms and ammunition, war-planes, motor vehicles, warships, submarines, atom bombs and what not!.//////Last Tuesday, the new prime minister and ministers took oath. Through the oath ceremony, Awami League president Sheikh Hasina was sworn in as the country's new prime minister and 32 surprise picks also were sworn as ministers to run the ministries. The people of Bangladesh were surprised after witnessing a small cabinet. It's also surprising to note that AL president Sheikh Hasina has left most of her senior party colleagues out of the new cabinet and brought some young, competent and talented people. It is also to be noted that, from 32 ministers, 24 are new and young who have no idea about the ministries. Though they are new and inexperienced, they are honest and competent persons. Now, they have to show their ability in future through firm decisions and activities because ability is something different from honesty.//////The 9th parliamentary election has worked like a mirror which has reflected the results of the activities of political parties and significance of people's might. Results of mistakes committed by the political parties have also been reflected in this election.

To make the industrialists interested to convert their boilers (if possible) more cost benefit advantages should have been spelled out.

We have been along with sane media units insistently protesting against the nefarious activities of the "worms of hell". These are some so-called members of "Shushil Shomaj" and some print media units and a TV channel.

Harold Pinter probably did for English drama what few have done. Indeed, it was said of him that he did to plays what Auden once said should be done. He cleaned the gutters of the English language, so that afterwards it flowed more easily. And so on and so forth. By the time he died at seventy-eight, Pinter had turned into a rounded character, in that particular phrase normally reserved for individuals peopling drama. He was a dramatist, he was a critic, he was a polemicist. That last bit came off rather strongly, and to the delight of many, when he accepted the Nobel Prize for literature in 2005. He excoriated the Bush administration over its adventures abroad. //////Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia. Age has not withered the flute maestro as was evident at a recent concert in Delhi.

One should not bother about whether she got it from Obama or whether it was her real desire to bring about changes in Bangladesh politics following 1/11.
