The move comes in light of the recent instances of a number of high profile prisoners making use of cell phones to keep themselves in touch with families, friends and followers outside their places of confinement. We would like to think that jamming cell phones, especially within the perimeters of the nation's jails, is a necessary step because it will prevent the breach of rules that has lately been going on. However, we cannot at the same time ignore the question of whether the jail authorities are resigned to such wrongful use of cell phones by prisoners and whether they believe the only way of deterring such behaviour is a use of jamming devices. In reality, matters should have been handled differently. A full, efficient observance of the jail code should have been enough to combat the offence.//////ACCORDING to Gary Ackerman, a ranking member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, reliance by the Bush administration on President Musharraf for the "war on terror" has not been a success, as it has achieved neither the stemming of terrorism nor the establishment of democracy. //////THE lead report carried by The Daily Star on February 22, based on the draft Labour Force Survey (LFS) report 2005-06 of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), is really a matter of major concern for the nation.

Over the last few years, if I am not wrong, reform was one of the much-pronounced issue in our political arena. Political parties, especially the AL and its allies, had been of the opinion (before 1/11) that they would not participate in election if no constructive reform was in place. It pressed home the 31-point demand and the BNP-led alliance's stubbornness left the country virtually handicapped/paralysed. Finally, the BNP govt. was forced to sit for discussion.

Both military dictators and political parties failed. If we analyse the causes of their failures, I would have thought that going back on the same route is unlikely to solve our problems. Whenever we fail we must try something new and different, recognising what common people want. Have we properly evaluated their needs and taken care of them? How about engaging academics, students, people from all walks of life who are non partisan to do rigorous campaigning in all the villages, cities, suburbs, mosques for the next eight months to identify virtuous, honest, decent people with a clear conscience to be their representatives at all levels of local authorities and in parliament, These people should not have any allegiance to any political parties for the next two terms. //////The NCTB has set the book entitled 'English For Today' at the HSC level with a new approach of communicative system for the learners, but the book, though its first edition was in 2001, has some glaring mistakes, which make us think about its acceptability and accessibility.

My comments on these three relates to an editorial written by Dr. Anis Chowdhury (DS, Feb 10). //////THE comment seemed like a casual aside. Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton, was touting the New York senator's strong support for Israel during a conference call in January with leaders of major American Jewish organisations. During the call, Lewis energetically contrasted Clinton's pro-Israel credentials with those of Barack Obama. To make her point, she said that Obama's "chief foreign-policy adviser" is Zbigniew Brzezinski, says one participant who would talk about the call only if he were not identified.//////BANGLADESH Bank has made real progress towards selling Oriental Bank to the ICB Financial Group.
