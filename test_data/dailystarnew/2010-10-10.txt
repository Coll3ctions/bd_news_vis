It is an abomination, a clear hint of the depths to which politics in Bangladesh may have sunk. The bad mauling of Boraigram Upazilla chairman Sanaullah Noor Babu by Awami League activists and his subsequent death are once more a warning to the government that unless it can get matters under control through putting a leash on its supporters, we could be headed for some grave times ahead. In the light of what has occurred in Boraigram, there can be no scope to argue about who did what on Friday. There can be no philosophising and absolutely no room for a laid-back dissection of politics. The plain and simple truth is that an individual, a citizen, was brutally waylaid by more than fifty workers of the ruling party and simply beaten to death in medieval fashion. No one came forward to help him. The police, standing close by, watched it all with little thought to performing their duties. That Babu lay on the road for an hour after the beating, that it needed his wife to come and take him to hospital speaks of the steep decline of our value system.//////We know of the turnaround time at Chittagong Port gradually relapsing into the old timeframe of nearly double digit days which basically increases the cost of business and reflects on the lack of competitiveness of the port. This has brought to the fore the whole issue of erratic trade unionism with links to political parties. The situation calls for an intervention by the government on an overall basis which hopefully should be getting underway before things go out of hand. //////After hiding behind tonnes of cloud for the last couple of days the sun smiled for a while yesterday.

After our independence we could not achieve much success due to military dictatorship. After we have regained the parliamentary democracy in 1991, the people of Bangladesh thought that the country would now follow the path of democracy. But this dream was not fulfilled due to lack of good leadership.//////Recent surveys show that about 80 million people of the country are living under the risk of arsenic poisoning as the groundwater of a vast region is contaminated with arsenic. Arsenic pollution is not only causing serious health hazards, but also affecting the environment and creating social problems. More than two million tube-wells are presently being used as the source of drinking water in Bangladesh. Out of those, only fifty thousands have so far been brought under inspection by various government and non-government agencies. The actual picture of the severity of arsenic pollution is yet to be revealed, as the entire country could not be surveyed till now.//////Traffic jam has made our life miserable. We have been told to use public buses rather than private transports. But, are there any good quality buses? Is there any space left for us in those buses? The government should put good quality buses on the city roads, create effective traffic rules and appoint more traffic police to implement those rules. It is also necessary to take the rickshaws off the main roads. A bus can carry 60 to 70 passengers and it requires less space, whereas only four rickshaws occupy the same space and are able to carry only 8 to 10 passengers. There should be lanes fixed for buses with bus stops to pick up passengers and not to block the road. The govt. should persuade the public to use the footbridges and zebra crossings. To make people aware of the traffic rules use of advertisements will be highly effective.//////I read the excellent article "Boi Para on the Wane" in the Star Magazine which has given a true picture of the bookstores. In this regard I have a few more things to add.//////I am a superstitious person and this even grew stronger while living in Houston. How could I possibly refuse to be influenced when I found the scientifically advanced Houstonians believe in such things?//////In 1949 an idol was placed inside the Babri Mosque and later in 1992 the Hindu fanatics, blinded by wild faith that Ram was born at that site though it is not a historical fact, demolished it. Now the Indian court in its rule doles out two- thirds of the site to the Hindus, as if a reward for desecrating and demolishing a historic mosque. However, I'm not surprised, given that Indian politics is highly charged with antagonism towards the minority communities and the Indian Muslims powerless from division into different denominations. //////President Zillur Rahman's appeal to senior officials to discharge their duties according to the constitution and rise above partisan politics is significant. But for this to happen, the appointment of senior officials should undergo a change. //////Ariquzzaman's feature and the photographs with it, published in The Daily Star on 1st October, is a human tragedy. It is for us, the better off in our society, to come forward to help these desperately needy people.

At present the BCL can do anything they want. They are now above the law of the land. The AL leaders should think seriously about this issue.//////When I think of the lives of the mentally and physically challenged, I feel lucky that I am leading a normal life. Previously we were not aware of mental disorders and we used to think that people who act abnormally are mad and should be put into mental asylums. Autism is a brain disorder that often results in impaired thinking, feeling and social functioning for a lifetime. Experts have estimated that 3 to 6 children out of every 1000 have autism. Males are 4 times more likely to have it than females. Girls with autism have severe symptoms and greater cognitive impairment. Three major distinctive behaviours in them are as follows://////The Prime Minister of the country has been awarded by the UN for achieving one of the Millennium Development Goals, that is reducing child mortality. The target was fixed in 2000, and the then incumbent government got only one year to run the country. In 2001, BNP came to power and ruled the country for five years. Then the caretaker government ruled the country for almost two years. The present government has been at the helm only for nineteen months. So, the credit should go to all the governments that ruled the country since 2000. //////The Chief Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim went into retirement recently. A farewell ceremony was arranged for him where some other justices, the attorney general, president of the bar and other dignitaries were present. But the pathetic part of the farewell was that he was told off harshly by none other than the attorney general himself, which crossed all acceptable boundaries of nicety and courtesy (DS: 30.09.10).//////Bangladesh cricket team has been playing ODI matches for more than a decade, but still they lack consistency. I believe the reason behind this is lack of motivation. We should watch how the world champions play. The difference is - in adverse times, the world champions don't get upset and thus overcome the situation, but even when the situation is in our favour, we often fail to perform well because of our complacency. //////A letter entitled 'Physical punishment in schools' published in The Daily Star on October 4, 2010, drew my attention and I would like to write something in this regard. //////It seems that the AL leaders have forgotten about their electoral pledges. This is our culture. We waste time and wait till the last minute to complete any job. The AL leaders should realise that they have zero prospect of coming back to power if they do not fulfil their commitments about the power sector, infrastructure development and administrative reforms. On the other hand, AL should also realise that a pro-BNP group within the administration is working actively to disturb the government's development efforts so that the benefits may be taken in the next election.//////Legal education in Bangladesh has been experiencing a downward trend for a long time.

Solaiman's troupe Theatre Art Unit has been inspiring young theatre activists with this scholarship since 2005. //////A prostitute by birth, one of the first women in theatre by profession. Capturing the life and times of controversial 19th century Bengali actress Binodini, can be a steep challenge for even the most seasoned theatre director. Dhaka Theatre's Nasiruddin Yousuff deploys the soliloquy technique to depict Binodini's complex personality in his eponymous play. On the contrary, well known Indian theatre personality Amal Allana in her Nati Binodini uses a multi-layered approach where action shifts between the aged Binodini and four other actresses who depict her early days.//////Eleven out of 350 contestants got 'Yes' cards in the Khulna regional round of audition test of Lux-Channel i Super Star held at the Khulna Club recently.//////The American Centre, US Embassy in Dhaka and Gallery Cosmos have jointly organised a three-week art project titled Janmasthaan.

Mental health is a neglected issue in our country, like in many other developing countries, because of negative attitude and lack of awareness of mental diseases. //////The Babri mosque was built in Ayodhya, in present day Uttar Pradesh in India in 1527. Some claim that the Central Asian invader and the first Turkic emperor of Northern India had this mosque built by demolishing a pre-existing temple, one that stood on the birth-site of Lord Ram. //////Syed Mohammad Ali, MBE, barrister-at-law, saw his life drawing to a close on Wednesday of last week. You could look back at his age -- he was all of seventy-seven -- and you could tell yourself that he had arrived at a point where mortality would as a rule of nature catch up with him. And yet you would not do that, for in Ali there was that spark which gives some men their vigour, the intellectual vitality that informs their being. //////
