In the last three months, as Sri Lanka's military has systematically pounded away at LTTE positions, as many as 6,500 Tamil civilians have lost their lives in the fighting. That is what a United Nations report reveals, confirming the grave predicament tens of thousands of Tamils have been in with the extent of the fighting shooting up to unprecedented levels of ferocity. It is now fairly obvious that Velupillai Prabhakaran's Tigers are on the verge of defeat and have nowhere to go. His fiefdom today shrunken to a mere strip of territory, Prabhakaran is either on the run or, as some think, already dead.//////SELDOM do we have the opportunity of seeing the two major political parties, whose bitter rivalry has caused us great sufferings in the past, agreeing on any national issue. However, when it comes to exploiting opportunities, particularly those from which pecuniary benefits accrue, the two parties find common ground to work in complete accord. This happens as much at the national level as at local levels involving the party cadres.//////FOR quite some time we had been hearing about a bail-out program for the sectors hit hard by the economic recession.

continued to remain volatile this week. Uncertainty over ECB policy weighed heavily on the euro. However improvements in the German ZEW sentiment index and eurozone PMI have helped the euro to rebound. The latest provisional euro zone purchasing managers' surveys for April showed the indices for both the services and manufacturing sectors improved much more than expected, suggesting the region's deep recession is no longer worsening.  The readings were their highest in six months, but the PMI indices remain well below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction. Other currencies viewed as higher risk such as sterling and the Australian dollar also recovered against the dollar on Thursday. Sentiment was helped by gains in US stock futures, while European equities were steady. Analysts said trade was tentative, however, with ongoing concerns about the global economy and the upcoming results of "stress" tests on US banks putting a lid on any rebound in riskier assets. The Wall Street Journal reported that US banks will be briefed by regulators as early as Friday on how they performed in the tests before the results are made public later. Some estimates of banks' likely losses that were used in the stress tests were tougher than expected, the newspaper said. //////Speakers at a workshop yesterday said poverty alleviation through

Locals recovered the body, said the officer in charge (OC) of Shyamnagar police station.//////The price of rice to the farmer for growing his crop is an important economic index for the country. The selling price of the rice grown by the farmers must provide him a reasonable return on investment.  However, an analysis carried out by farmer Khandokar Abdur Rouf giving the detailed cost of raising the crop and its selling price was presented by S.  Seraj of Channel i at a seminar on 11 April. This presents a very adverse and depressing situation. It will naturally discourage the planting of rice-- the staple food in Bangladesh!//////Our music arena is swelling up with new artists and bands  There are some bands with a real treat; some are struggling to reach a height. Music and lyrics have really scaled a good height in some bands' renditions and certain solo singers are also putting their mark on the track --- Habib,  Bappa Majumder, Fuad and Tapu along with Juli, Anila, and Nancy, to mention a few.//////We are aware that a campaign launched by new seven wonders foundation was going on in order to select  seven new wonders of the world. Can we guess which one came  first  in the group  G?  Cox's Bazar!//////As soon as this government came to power, we thought that at least this time around we would see a change in the political culture of our country and we believed that this time around the government would continue the anti-corruption drive initiated by the immediate past caretaker government. //////After repeated requests, Dhaka City Corporation has kindly put  Zebra crossing mark   on Folder Street  in Wari residential area at Sher-e-Bangla Girls School and Dawn Garments point.  //////There has been a lot of talks, passing of opinions and hot debates between the pundits  on both sides on the legality of lease and cancellation of lease etc., since the prime minister  invited Begum Zia to return the government property in the cantonment,  leased  to her by the Ershad government.//////The mass people have given the mandate to them to govern this country for at least the next five years. If they can convince the people that they are capable enough to govern the state properly, of course people will bring you  to power again. But through their unplanned activities if they make it clear that they have no faith on people and by occupying power they would like to hold it forever, the mass people of Bangladesh will not tolerate it. //////For reducing traffic jams in Dhaka we have to take steps for total ban or less plying of smaller vehicles like rickshaws, cars, baby taxies etc. On the other hand, big buses have to be introduced in greater numbers. In fact, most people travel by buses in this capital city. There are some AC buses whose fares are comparatively high. To travel by a non-AC bus is definitely a bothersome matter, particularly  during the summer. //////If the prime minister  of Bangladesh feels the need to visit another country (DS, April 20) to discuss some important issues, that is certainly understandable. But I am not sure if our PM really needs to take a 35-member delegation with her. This is Bangladesh, not America.//////I would like to bring these following things to the notice of the government regarding their present stance on issues like Pilkhana incident, shortage of power and water supply, BCL violence, traffic, and noise pollution. I wish the government would concentrate more on these serious issues rather than a  petty issue like  Khaleda Zia's house in the cantonment.//////Brahmanbaria Sahittya Academy,  a cultural organisation which has  already passed a long path  in  23 years,  celebrated the Noboborsha (Bangla New Year) in a festive mood. This organisation arranged a week long fair & cultural programme on the premises of the Industrial School here.  Many writers, artists, intellectuals, politicians and journalists were invited to this programme. //////The previous caretaker government launched the hundred days  job   generating scheme in order to create employment opportunity for vulnerable people, especially the extreme poverty ridden people of the northern region. At the outset, it generated employment on food for work basis. People of the poor community saw a light of hope initially, but ironically the elected representatives and government officials could not fulfil their expectations.////// There is no denying that our prime minister's   security is a matter of great concern.  Many a time she was the target of direct attacks. The August 21 grenade attack was the most severe one. It was His kindness and sheer luck that saved her. Now, the terrorists are so desperate  that the foreign secretary of a neighbouring country  had to rush  to Dhaka to ring the warning bell directly to her.  We thank the Indian government for their very good neighbourly gesture. But the question remains can we all the time depend on the intelligence of a foreign country? Like many other things we should be self sufficient in collection of intelligence reports and other related matters. We should develop our own civilian intelligence agencies capable enough to protect our interests both internally and externally. This needs proper handling.  The Cuban experience may be an example, where President Fidel Castro survived the onslaught of world's biggest power just sixty miles away from their coast. But please remember it should be a civil affair professionally crafted.//////Digital Bangladesh is our dream, our weapon  for changing the country,  an expectation of people and a super vision of nation. //////As an avid reader of your newspaper, I try to go through all your printed items seriously  with feelings gyrating between admiration and scepticism. The same spirit drove me when I read the  report entitled Body formed to appoint another ACC Commissioner that you  front-paged. //////In my life I have seen many physicians who help the helpless and poor people considering it their noble duty. I have great respect for them.  But what I have seen tonight (April 20)  on ntv is horrible. It showed that a ward boy was performing an eye operation and another lay person was performing operation in the microsurgery department at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. They did so because the doctors were absent. If I had the authority I would have cancelled the MBBS certificates of those physicians. In fact,  those physicians are the worst enemies of the honest and dedicated physicians. This is very clear that those doctors committed a terrible wrong and they must be brought to justice even if they belong to the 'government party'. We are looking forward to the action the DMCH authorities (if it really has any authority) in this regard. Many poor patients go to the DMCH  and in many cases they are not treated well. Before ignoring them the DMCH authorities and the section of physicians who ignore them  must not forget that the poor people of this country have enormous contribution to our economy which helps us to survive.//////The present government envisions a Digital Bangladesh.  It helped their campaign during the elections as it was highly praised by the masses. But, are we ready for it? The government's inability to supply electricity will do more harm than just foil this delusional mission and let me tell you why. My daily life in Dhaka consists of power-cuts that starts at 9 o'clock in the morning, recurs every alternate hour throughout the day, till 9 o'clock in the night. That would be about 6 hours of load shedding. Recently, there have been power cuts as late as midnight, making it impossible for me to sleep in the heat. The young people- the ones we usually call the future of the nation-- cannot have a smooth evening study session because of the power-cuts.  //////Tens of thousands of civilians trapped in Sri Lanka's northern war zone are facing starvation, the Tamil Tiger rebels warned Saturday as the UN sent its top humanitarian official to assess the crisis.//////"I have resigned.

It is the sequel to an acclaimed cinematic work by Farooki, titled "Spartacus 71."  Both the films feature Shohel Khan, an actor who slips into many a role with ease. //////'Folder Kobita Patra,' a literary magazine of Pabna, recently launched a documentary video CD of the history of Daab-Bagan massacre. The Daab-Bagan incident is significant in our Liberation War. Over 200 people, mostly Freedom Fighters, were martyred during a combat at the site on April 19, 1971.
