Commitment shown by this government, especially the Chief Adviser, is highly praiseworthy. We believe the ordinance will go a long way in strengthening the foundation of 'people's right to know' and thereby lay the foundation of an accountable government. The very purpose behind the ordinance, one for which individuals and groups of citizens have struggled long and hard, is to enable people to come by the information they need in their own as well as in the national interest. We have written earlier of the good that will accrue to the country through the adoption of a Right to Information Act. We have in these months of deliberations on the RTI maintained that citizens in a democratic society hold the right of access to information. That right, we believe, can now be ensured through an expeditious and efficient implementation of the RTI ordinance.//////WORKINGS of some of the state agencies never cease to startle us. But the violation of airport safety regulations by the airport authorities at Chittagong airport tops it all for the way the authorities have displayed an appalling lack of concern for passenger safety.//////THE necessity of a meaningful dialogue between the CTG and the political parties at this moment of the nation's history can hardly be overemphasized. With Sheikh Hasina's temporary release, AL circle is now willing to participate in the dialogue. But the unrelenting attitude of the Khaleda-led BNP to join any dialogue without Begum Zia's unconditional release tagged with her two sons' treatment abroad has almost stalled the dialogue process, going as far as stalling the prospect of an election through participation of all the parties. //////CONSISTENT with his belief that one should have the audacity to hope, Senator Barack Obama has eventually emerged as the first Afro-Caribbean to be the presumptive nominee of a major US political party. It has been an uphill task but he has hung on doggedly. He has soldiered down the campaign trail, with stops to explain, denounce and detach himself from some of his surrogates along the way.//////MOST political observers reckon that Bangladesh may have plunged into yet another period of political uncertainty. It is probably naive to expect that the present caretaker government will be able to put an end to these long periods of political deadlock very easily. However, with the departure of Sheikh Hasina for treatment abroad and the expected release of Begum Zia and her two sons, perhaps there is a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. Some may criticise the caretaker regime for flip-flops, but an overwhelming majority may approve of "constructive engagement" with the two major parties, so that we can finally have an agreement that will make our elections conform to modern democratic practices, and their results will be accepted without the rancorous disputes we normally see in our country. Bangladesh needs to move beyond the corruption scandal. But before it does, the people have to know exactly what happened, regardless of the precise legality of each case.//////The transfer trails for the 2008 football season ended yesterday amid rain, some fun and hope for the game to return to the ground after a yearlong wilderness.//////In a noble gesture, Feroz Mahmud Titu and Co has decided to play for Muktijoddha Sangsad in the coming football season virtually for free.//////Turkey lived up to their billing as comeback kings with a 3-1 penalty shootout win over Croatia here on Friday to put them into the Euro 2008 semifinals.//////As Orange fever rises with every goal scored in the Dutch team's Euro 2008 campaign, lawyers, housewives and school kids become crazed wig-wearing fans adorning their homes, bikes and even their pets in the national colour.//////Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Asif arrived home on Friday after Dubai prosecutors dropped charges against him of possession of an illegal drug.//////The Bangladesh A team arrived in Dublin yesterday to play four matches against their counterparts.//////The MPPJ Stadium here in the capital of Malaysia will host the Group A qualifying matches of the AFC President's Cup from Sunday, featuring Bangladeshi champions Abahani who arrive here on Friday morning, Nepal's Police Club, WAPDA of Pakistan and the 2005 champions Regar-TadAZ of Tajikistan. //////Bangladesh will take on South Asian rivals Sri Lanka in the last four stage of the 3rd Men's AHF Cup -- the qualifying hockey tournament for Asia Cup -- in Singapore today.//////Officials will be allowed to reduce the length of the interval between innings during the remainder of the one-day series between England and New Zealand.//////Russian striker Andrei Arshavin has warned Marco van Basten's Holland to expect his side's attacking machine to hit top gear for Saturday's Euro 2008 quarterfinal here.//////AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti has told La Gazzetta dello Sport he does not envisage Italy missing suspended World Cup winning midfield duo Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso in their Euro 2008 quarterfinal against Spain.//////Germany captain Michael Ballack said his side used the criticism levelled at them after their shock group stage defeat by Croatia to knock Portugal out of Euro 2008 with a 3-2 victory.//////Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed a major blunder by referee Peter Frojdfelt could have cost Portugal their chance of a place in the last four at Euro 2008.//////The Portuguese defence and goalkeeper Ricardo took a hammering from the domestic press on Friday following their 3-2 defeat by Germany in Thursday's Euro 2008 quarterfinal.//////The successor to Luiz Felipe Scolari as Portugal coach will be named by mid-July the president of the Portuguese Football Federation announced on Friday.//////Italian defender Andrea Barzagli underwent a successful operation on his left knee here on Friday, the head doctor of Euro 2008 announced.//////Germans prepared to celebrate into the night on Thursday after their football team beat fancied Portugal to reach the semifinals of Euro 2008.//////Roger Federer will have to get past Novak Djokovic before a probable Wimbledon final showdown with his arch rival Rafael Nadal.//////Manchester United slapped a 'not for sale' sign on striker Cristiano Ronaldo Friday following the Portuguese international striker's most recent bid to pave the way towards joining Real Madrid.//////Sharad Pawar, the BCCI president, has said that all teams participating in the proposed Champions League have the freedom to include players of their choice for the US$5 million multi-club Twenty20 tournament, even it means including players with ties to the unauthorized Indian Cricket League (ICL).

He was a figure of fun at times, prowling around the outfield shouting, Let's play ball, Australia and perching by the boundary rope in typical baseball fashion -- left knee on the ground, right elbow on the other knee, right hand resting under a chin jutting forward in anticipation while regularly spitting out chewing tobacco and applauding the most mundane moments.//////In a bid to cash in on the popularity of India-Pakistan clash, the Pakistan Cricket Board has kept the ticket prices for the encounter between the two sides in the Asia Cup at the highest pedestal.//////Kevin Pietersen's innovative switch-hit has found yet another admirer in Ricky Ponting but the Australian skipper has no plans of trying it himself or encourage his teammates to experiment with it as he is "uncertain" about the shot's legality.//////Five of the top six world ranked men's field hockey teams will meet at the Champions Trophy starting here Saturday in what is the last major international tournament before the Olympic Games.//////The United Nations (UN) Secretary General Ban Ki-moon yesterday made an urgent call to the international community to redouble their efforts to address both the causes and consequences of forced human displacement.//////Coliform, a fatal bacteria, has been detected in the drinking water of several northern districts including Bogra, says a survey report of the environment department of Rajshahi division. //////Around 300 to 500 families become homeless every year due to river erosion causing massive displacement of people in the country, said University Grants Commission Chairman Prof Nazrul Islam yesterday.//////Grameen Shakti, which has installed 150,000 solar home systems in the country and is adding around 5,000 new systems each month, was awarded the 2008 Outstanding Achievement Award at the Ashden Awards ceremony in London on Thursday. //////The 3rd World Hydrographic Day will be observed in the country today as elsewhere across the globe.//////Gono Forum President Dr Kamal Hossain yesterday urged the caretaker government to allow the teachers of non-government high schools, colleges and madrasas in taking part in upcoming local government election.//////Workers' Party of Bangladesh (WPB) President Rashed Khan Menon has again urged the government to withdraw the state of emergency to establish a congenial atmosphere for free, fair and credible election.//////Liberation War Museum will observe the first founding anniversary of Jalladkhana Killing Field Memorial today.//////Members of Agyan Party robbed a rice trader of Tk 2.85 lakh on his way to Gazipur on Thursday night while a gang of muggers looted six mobile phone sets and Tk 40,000 from a mobile phone trader after stabbing him in the city's Badda area early yesterday.//////The 97th birth anniversary of poet Sufia Kamal was observed yesterday with a call for ensuring equal rights of women in every sphere of life. //////A gang of armed dacoits yesterday strangled a housewife at a remote village under Doarabazar upazila in Sunamganj.//////At least two people were killed in separate accidents in Brahmanbaria and Jhalakati yesterday.//////UK Minister for International Development Shahid Malik visited a Brac primary school in the city's Korail slum area on Thursday during his three-day tour of Bangladesh, says a press release.//////A certificate awarding ceremony of the 14th Fighter Conversion Course (FCC) of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) was held at BAF Base Zahurul Haque in Chittagong on Thursday, says an ISPR release.//////A two-day seminar on 'English for Today' began at Jahangirnagar University (JU) in Savar yesterday.//////A four-day Rajshahi Festival 2008 began at Shilpakala Academy in the capital yesterday.//////The body of an unidentified woman was found hanging from a tree at a mango orchard at Ulashi in Sharsha, Jessore, yesterday. //////Bangladesh Jubo Union yesterday strongly protested the bus fare hike on different routes in the city. //////The concluding ceremony of inter-sector Azan and Qirat competition-2008 of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) was held at Pilkhana Central Mosque yesterday.//////Five years into opening, the country's first and longest 'toll road' connecting Natore and Sirajganj on Rajshahi-Dhaka Highway has become risky for thousands of commuters due to substandard construction and poor maintenance.//////Security forces are on hunt for eight 'top criminals' of Khulna city and the district.

In 19 months, the period for which it lasted, every institution got scarred. The constitution was mutilated. Personal freedom was forfeited. The press was gagged. The judiciary was shackled. Parliament had its tenure extended. The largest democracy in the world put under detention more than 100,000 people without trial. And, as the then Attorney General said, the state could kill anyone with impunity. //////WHEN some staff from Helen Keller International (HKI) met Chaindapru Marma (55), she was working in her homestead vegetable garden after returning from prayers at the nearest Buddhist temple.

One of the major differences between biodiversity conservation projects and other projects, however, is that some people think it is often difficult to define -- in clear, operational terms -- precisely what it is that biodiversity conservation projects are trying to achieve. In a business setting, the project goal is usually financial profit and it is usually pretty easy to evaluate how much money a company is making or losing. But for biodiversity conservation projects, what practical and meaningful measures of project impact are available to us? In many fields, the cause-and-effect relationships between specific interventions and resulting impacts are easy to see. They are not so apparent in conservation. This makes it difficult to measure the impact of a project on the biodiversity in a given area.//////Ozone is one of the highly reactive gases, which is photo chemically active. It is composed of three atoms of oxygen (O3) and its role depends on its location in the atmosphere. This gas plays a different role in the lowest two layers of the atmosphere, known as the stratosphere and troposphere. In the stratosphere, above the tropopause about 90 percent of the ozone protects life on earth from the sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation. In contrast, the layer surrounding the earth's surface is the troposphere where the presence of ozone is harmful for the environment as well as for human health. //////June 21st is the Summer Solstice for the northern hemisphere. On this day, the sun rises at its northernmost position, attains the highest position in the sky, and sets at the northernmost position. This day also carries a special meaning for Bangladesh because of an imaginary geographic line that runs through the middle of the country. The Tropic of Cancer runs through Comilla, south of Dhaka, and through Faridpur and Kushtia before it enters West Bengal. On this day, if you happen to find yourself on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun would shine directly overhead and cast no shadow of any erect object. The time would be about 12:30 p.m. //////Sonadia Island, rich in natural resources and bio-diversity, is under serious threat today. The ministry of environment and forestry declared it an Environmentally Critical Area (ECA) by issuing a gazette in 1999.

It is high time to take necessary measures for the recovery and preservation of the remaining bio- diversity of this island.//////Things never seemed to go well for Afra. Sometimes she wondered if she was always going to be doomed to bad luck. Maybe it was her star sign that didn't bode well for her. Taurus, the bull! What good was a bullish nature to an attractive teenager? Why couldn't she have been born a Virgo a beautiful, svelte creature? Or Libra, nice and perfectly balanced? Or even Leo, the audacious and courageous Lion?//////The city of Toronto appears to undergo a subtle change about a week before the Victoria Day long weekend (May 19).There is a murmur that begins in the early spring breeze and lingers on the white sails of the boats in Lake Ontario, bobbing up and down on the gentle aqua blue waves. The murmur swells into a whisper and then into a voice that can be heard on every lips, every heart in the city: It's the first long weekend of the summer - we must get away from the city!//////Angus (Lindsay Ritchie) Calder, b. 5 Feb.1942, d. 5 June 2008//////Book launches are daily affairs in Kolkata.

They allow Israel to retain nuclear weapons (about 150 nuclear heads) but would not allow Iran to pursue nuclear programme to generate electricity. They suspect Iran, one of the world's greatest oil and gas reserves, does not need to generate electricity from nuclear reactor and their nuclear enrichment programme is to make nuclear weapons.//////There are all the various phases of Bengal you go through as you reflect on its history. And you do that considering the seminal events which have contributed to an upholding of its heritage as well as a breaking down of its geographical unity. If the partition of Bengal in 1905 infuriated the Hindu ////// class, it surely offered hope to the poorer, overwhelmingly Muslim population in the eastern part of what was then a province in British colonial India. And then, of course, came the annulment in 1911 of the partition which, for a very large number of people in the province, meant a restoration of history. The wrong perpetrated in 1905, it was argued, needed to be righted. And it was.//////To me Shobhaa De is a 'counselor' who has delved into human psychology to bring out for us a 'manual' which I think is a rare collection for any library.
