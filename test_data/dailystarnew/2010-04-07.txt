Just how much of ingenuity can be applied in destroying nature can be understood through a report in the issue of this newspaper yesterday. Those who would like to plunder forests have now devised a unique method of killing off the trees before getting hold of them. The trees are stripped bare of their barks and then salt and copper sulphate are put into the roots to have these die an inevitable death. In other words, once the trees die, it will be the authorities themselves who will be compelled to dispose of them. And who better to take charge of the trees than those who have caused their unnatural end?//////ONE would have thought what marked out a living organism from an inanimate object is the capacity for feeling. The marker ought to be nobler when you are a human being. You are simply expected to sense the pain and trauma of another who has been physically hurt with the same intensity as though you were the victim. Should you fail the test, you don't simply deserve to be called a human being. Not even perhaps an animal; as even some species exude kindness to the kindred. //////Marketing committee chairman Aziz Al Kaiser Titoo on Tuesday put the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on a spot of bother by saying that he was not fully informed about the National Cricket League's sponsorship deal between the board and ATN Records.//////As events around the wedding between Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik and tennis ace Sania Mirza get murkier by the day, the Indian sports icon's family was "keeping all options open", including postponing the wedding, indicated a close family friend.//////Hosts Bangladesh got off to a flying start in the IHF Handball (U-21) Challenge Trophy handing a massive 46-2 defeat to Afghanistan in one of two opening day's matches at the Shaheed Shurawardi Indoor National Stadium yesterday.//////Mamunur Rahman Chayan struck four times including a hattrick in Mohammedan Sporting Club's 5-0 drubbing of Mariner Youngs Club in the Dhaka Bank Club Cup Hockey Tournament at the Maulana Bhasani Stadium yesterday.//////Brothers Union and Arambagh KS once again shared points in the Bangladesh League when they played out a goalless draw in their second meeting at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////The launching ceremony of the National Cricket League's Twenty20 tournament will be held today.//////Chennai Super Kings completed a sweep of their three-match home leg after the Mumbai Indians' batting fell apart in a rash of poor strokes following Sachin Tendulkar's retirement due to dehydration. //////Tiger Woods took his first steps down the road to redemption on Monday at the Masters, answering questions from reporters and playing his first public round of golf in nearly five months.//////Only hours after his upset loss at the Sony Ericsson Open last week, Roger Federer was back at practice, hitting across the street on the Ritz Carlton's courts.//////Having demanded to launch a probe committee to find out the activities of Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) during the care-taker government, as many as 16 general secretaries of the national sports federations placed a letter to the state minister for youth and sports Ahad Ali Sarkar at the National Sports Council yesterday.//////Hridoy Hossain, an underprivileged Dhaka child, will have the experience of a lifetime when he, as part of an eight-member football team, will take part in a charity football tournament in Singapore titled Soccer Sixes 2010 Tournament organised by the Singapore Cricket Club on April 9 and 10.

Hilsa has a great contribution to our GDP. According to sources, in our national GDP its contribution is 1%. So, it is a matter we should give importance to. //////The rivers that drain into Bangladesh deposit more than 500 million tonnes of sediment each year. Many islands do disappear but new ones emerge. In fact, more land is gained than lost. In this context, the formation of a single island in the 1970s and its disappearance 30 or so years later are not remarkable and do not have any implications with respect to the supposedly catastrophic effects of carbon dioxide emissions.//////We have got a clear message from the students of O and A levels in 2008-2009 academic sessions that Bangladeshi students also can win the world. We feel our exuberance in offering accolades to those 52 students who have got world's highest marks in various subjects in those sessions (highest marks were secured before also). Their marvellous achievements speak for the talent of Bangladeshi students even amid various constraints and shortage of facilities. Surely, we have this sort of talented students in our general education also. //////At about 9.30 a.m. in the morning, I was waiting at a traffic signal in front of Alliance Franchise keeping close to the maiden to take a U turn. Suddenly, there was a knock on the window, turning around I saw a girl in uniform yelling at me. Being unable to hear anything I lowered the window and I was shocked to hear what she had to say. I politely asked her, was she walking on the footpath that I have to make way for her to pass. I was even more shocked to hear her reply. She said it is for the students of Dhaka City College.//////For our daily activities or for journey, we have to ride bus, car, taxi etc but the question is how safe these vehicles are for us to ride in! Abnormal road accident has almost become a normal matter to us. As a result, every day road accident is increasing. //////Lately, the number of crimes has been on the rise in Dhaka city. Every day we are getting news of killing & stabbing from various parts of Dhaka. Crime is also increasing in other regions of the country. If we peruse the newspapers of last ten or fifteen days, we would find news of killing & violence every day. Some of those news reports even found place in the first pages of top newspapers. It is true that we cannot blame the government for those crimes but methinks it should activate its law enforcing agencies. It must be proactive, rather than reactive to reduce those criminal activities. We want to live with safety & security. //////From the time of Alexander, the idea of globalisation has been a much-talked about topic in the intellectual world-- especially in the field of political economy and in the socio-cultural arena. It became a reality after travelling a long path, finally in the 20th century. We are now living in a global environment. Technological development makes the flow of information very easy and we have easy access to it. Almost all the spheres of our society are affected by this surge requiring various kinds of reforms and adjustments with numerous dimensions. People's attitudes are changing as they become more and more aware of the international events and their consequences. Economic adjustments coupled with changing business environment made it mandatory to have required knowledge in the field of business and commerce. Multi-national corporations are expanding their operation much faster than before in the developing countries as they are trying to become cost effective. Skilled and knowledge oriented labour force are the basic requirement to grab those opportunities. We have to compete with other nations if we are willing to capitalize on those opportunities which require extensive education and knowledge in the relevant fields. Business education, which we are acquiring, will help us to cope with this environment. We need to develop our learning from both theoretical and practical context. We must be dynamic and confident by acquiring knowledge of various fields. Interactive, analytical, on-line supporting paper works as well as diffusion of knowledge among the students, intensive group discussion on various real life events, workshop, and debate etc. can increase our decision making power and analytical ability. Therefore, it is high time for the students not to spoil their time engaging in unproductive activities but to be more and more engrossed in the study, so that they can shine and compete successfully in the professional fields. One of us may get a Nobel Prize for our hard work. It is difficult but not impossible. //////Leading University (LU) campus is situated in Sylhet city, a region highly vulnerable to earthquake. The present campus of LU is located in a very old building, Modhuban Market, where more than 1800 students study. //////I was absolutely delighted when I was going through the write-up of eminent Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir entitled Apology Day for Pakistani in The Daily Star on March 26. In his writing, Hamid has demanded formal apology from the government of Pakistan to the people of Bangladesh for the war crimes committed by their forefathers back in 1971. Symbolically, Hamid's awareness seems to me the awareness of Pakistanis, majority of whom feel ashamed and sorry for the genocide imposed on us by the oppressive military rulers during our liberation war. //////In 2010 the nation is divided into two political groups. The practice of democracy is being thwarted by the crude power politics. The mass people have become puppets at the hands of two political parties. It is evident that the top leaders of our two prime political parties always fail to reach a consensus on our major national issues such as health care, education, sovereignty, foreign policy etc. The most worrying fact is that the country's sovereignty is being undermined by some inconsiderate alliances with the external powers. In our country the total policy changes with the change of government. Consequently, poverty and unemployment persist. Due to the conflicts between the two parties, the major issues always remain unresolved.//////Iran should acquire or develop nuclear weapon as soon as possible to ensure its survival against any western or Israeli military invasion. Look, just before the last Iraq invasion, the western powers first misled the whole world by spreading baseless news about Iraqi WMD. They were in such a hurry to attack Iraq that they did not wait for the opinion of the world community. In fact major western intelligences were very well aware that Iraq did not possess any WMD! //////The population of Khulna city is increasing day by day. That's why civic problems are also increasing. Infestation of mosquito is one of them. In our city this problem is becoming a normal one. It is impossible to sit at the reading room, drawing room, kitchen or anywhere without being bitten by mosquitoes at night. This problem has become so acute that even during daytime mosquitoes reign supreme. //////In Shantinagar area, we are getting contaminated water supplied by Wasa. The water we use is full of termite and there is bad odour in the water as well. We can't use this water for cooking and for bathing. //////Last year when daylight saving was introduced, people did not oppose it, most people accepted it. They adjusted to the changed situation. //////Although I believe articles on this matter have been published in newspapers before, I would still like to bring to your attention that despite this, a well known departmental store chain continues to sell counterfeit items such as 'Kellog's Cornflakes'. Any prudent consumer would be able to detect the difference between the authentic Kellog's Cornflakes cartons manufactured in Manchester, U.K. and those counterfeit items. Other small departmental stores in Dhanmondi are also selling these items. I must admit I was really annoyed by the indifference of the sales personnel when I approached them on the matter. They were obviously embarrassed when I approached them and were insistent on taking me aside so that the other customers wouldn't overhear. If they really care about their reputation they should stop the sale of counterfeit items and help bring the people responsible to justice!//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai threatened over the weekend to quit the political process and join the Taliban if he continued to come under outside pressure to reform, according to several members of parliament.//////West Bengal yesterday sounded an alert in three districts of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia following the massive Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh that killed 73 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers.//////President Barack Obama was set to unveil a new nuclear policy yesterday that officials said would reduce the role of atomic weapons in US national security strategy.//////The United Nations yesterday announced a two-day closure of its offices in Peshawar, citing security fears following a deadly attack on the US consulate in the Pakistani city.//////Nato air strike on a residence in southern Afghanistan killed four civilians and four insurgents, an Afghan official and the military alliance said yesterday.//////US special forces have a novel weapon in the fight to expel Taliban from a desolate and war-weary farming community in southern Afghanistan -- heavy metal music.//////Israel yesterday began distributing millions of protection kits against biochemical warfare, Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai announced, stressing the campaign was not linked to any imminent threat.//////The leader of Nepal's opposition Maoists yesterday demanded the government step down, calling it the "main obstacle" to the country's faltering peace process.//////Israel's hard-line foreign minister warned Palestinians yesterday against plans to unilaterally declare independence next year, saying such a move could prompt Israel to annex parts of the West Bank and annul past peace agreements.//////At least five bombs ripped through apartment buildings across Baghdad yesterday and another struck a market, killing 49 people and wounding more than 160, authorities said.//////At least nine vessels and 95 Indian sailors are still being held captive by pirates off the coast of Africa, a government official in Mumbai said yesterday.//////A methane fireball tore through a West Virginia coalmine killing 25 miners, with four still missing early Tuesday when a build-up of toxic gases halted the search, officials said.//////The first of two courts martial set up to try Sri Lanka's ex-army chief, Sarath Fonseka, has been adjourned .//////Scuffles broke out in Bangkok yesterday between riot police and anti-government protesters, while a grenade exploded outside the ruling party's offices, fanning tensions in the capital.//////While expressing his displeasure over union home minister P Chidambaram, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, chief minister of West Bengal on Monday said that the language used by the union Home Minister during his visit to the Maoist-infested areas in the state, was 'not good'.//////Police killed two suspected suicide bombers during a raid in northwest Pakistan yesterday, officials said, further rattling the Afghan border region following attacks on the US Consulate and a political rally that killed at least 53 people.//////China executed a convicted Japanese drug smuggler yesterday, making him the first Japanese citizen to be put to death in the country since diplomatic ties were re-established in 1972.//////Adamant government employees in Jammu and Kashmir refused to call off their strike yesterday to demand payment of arrears of the 6th Pay Commission, a day after the government invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against them.//////As you walk into Nalinikanta Bhattashali Gallery, National Museum, you find yourself under a ////// (bamboo roof) of an actual ////// boat.

Life is getting to be a hugely difficult and expensive affair in Bangladesh. It is difficult because there are things we cannot easily do as citizens. It is expensive because of all the beautiful aspects of living we have been losing for no fault of ours. //////INEQUALITY of income is a growing concern for Bangladesh. There are possibly two reasons for this. First, anxiety over inequality emanates from philosophical and ethical grounds. There is no reason why individuals should be treated differently in terms of access to lifetime economic resources. Why should someone sleep in a flat in Gulshan and the other on a footpath on the plea that they have been born in different endowments of assets? Second, even if we shelve our thoughts over inequality at an intrinsic level, the inequality in income and wealth somehow adversely affects the possibilities of overall growth. The fact that a farmer is denied the access to credit to carry out farm activities not only deprives him of an income but also amounts to a loss of GDP. //////AT last, the BNP has come up with its official position on the government initiative to hold the trial of war criminals.
