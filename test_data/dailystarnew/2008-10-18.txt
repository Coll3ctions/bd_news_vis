a toll of child lives with 54,000 children fallen sick in that country. What have we done all this time to screen out hazardous milk available in the local market? Virtually nothing, just waiting for authentic test results from our research centres as the milk got consumed indiscriminately with damage being done to public health, especially child health -- insidiously. Melamine deposits in the kidney hinders its functioning apart from forming stones in the bladder.//////THE occasion of World Food Day provided the opportunity for local and UN agriculture experts and the government top executives to take a deep look at the prevailing conditions in the agriculture sector of the country. Though we have heard of some success stories like bumper Boro cultivation past season to inspire us, yet we believe a great deal still remains to be achieved to reach the desired goal. There is no denying that with the rapid growth of our population the necessity to pay more attention to increasing domestic food output is but a stark reality that has to be addressed with more dynamism in thoughts and action. Food being the daily requirement of the fifteen crore people of the country, there is no scope to push the issue behind other less important ones. Boosting domestic farm output has become more pertinent today as the price index of food items in the international markets fail to remain at a stable level. From our past experiences we strongly feel the country needs a pragmatic and sustainable agricultural policy backed by government and non-government support to farmers to ensure food security. It needs no emphasising that Bangladesh, because of the lack of a stable agriculture policy, is faced with multifarious problems that need immediate attention of the government. //////RECENT debates have confirmed the important role of such a form of engagement in US electoral politics.

The expectations from the new order were high and thus dissatisfaction is not unlikely in an environment of unfulfilled aspirations. However, the present leadership has to be credited for at least initiating the long due reform efforts that may be carried to its desirable end by a truly representative government in the not-too-distant future.//////THE picture of a sweat-soaked rickety man pedalling away cycle rickshaw may be a thing of the past in India which has unveiled a state-of-the-art solar-powered version of one of the most popular modes of public transport in the sub-continent.//////In any study at any level on the future liveability of Dhaka, the conclusion invariably is that the city is too populated, and the solution perpetually borders on the need to decentralise each and every national institution; in which proposed action the speaker/analyst/discussant without exception reckons that he, his family and his friends, and everything he needs and desires remains within the city premises. This writer is no exception.//////Dhaka is the place which was made as point of attraction for all kinds of human activities since four hundred years back. Since then it has been growing with urban characteristics but in little planned manner. The rate of growth was not that much steeper than other surrounding growth centres. Even in British colonial times some districts near Kolkata were comparatively developed in many aspects in comparison with Dhaka. But after having the status of capital city of the then East Pakistan it started growing at a faster rate than the other districts. And after liberation the growth rate in all urban perspectives was no match with those of other districts in Bangladesh. The provincial level administrative and commercial offices situated in Dhaka had been transformed into the corresponding head offices. The top level policy makers, officials and businessmen, as well as various other professional and non-professional groups, from all corners of the country started making room in Dhaka. Some of course opted for other comparatively developed districts like Chittagong and Sylhet. This migration toward urban centres is still going on. In the past the policy makers and the responsible authorities took little initiatives to cope up the situation for having no vision in their planning. In the present days there is poor headway in these regards; rather the situation is deteriorating so fast that within a short span of time it may go beyond manageability. Then Dhaka will lose its liveability and some may well opt for leaving it. Among the grave concerns, environmental factors will be on the top of the list. This article tries to focus on the anticipated environmental consequences of the development process of Dhaka and what could be the probable steps to mitigate the negatives.//////In some places General Gau's Chicken is better known than Colonel Sanders' KFC.

This included a choral sequence He Begins His Great Trance with three sections, 'The Dark', 'The Music' and 'The Fire', based on Tagore's poetry translated by William Radice, performed by the BBC singers and set to music by Param Vir, the Indian-born composer.

I remember the elation that I felt at Lagos airport, the quick turn of my stomach as the roar of the BOAC airplane turned into a crescendo and it rose into the clouds. After sparring mildly with my brother for the control of the armrest buttons and gadgets, I spotted a teacher from the Nigerian school that I attended. She asked me if I was going for a holiday to London. I heard the faint rustle of my mother's sari, and before I could answer, she blurted out, quite tensely: Yes, yes, we are ////// going for a holiday. My teacher seemed satisfied at this answer, and turned away to attend to her own children's tug-of-war.//////Inadequate access to safe water and sanitation leads millions of our people to various health problems. Water and vector born diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, worm infestation and polio, malaria, hepatitis A and E are too common in the country.

We welcome them the way we did the present Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) and the way we did President Ershad when he called for Jihad against corruption. And also the way we did to all political parties' promises before elections. The consequence of all those optimistic welcome is today's pathetic reality. Instead of going by the history of all those promises/expectations, let us analyze the ongoing initiatives. Look at the mission and vision of ACC with objectivity: all the bigwigs are inside the jail, and in twenty months time corruption increased by 2%. Can any institution assemble more power and energy than the present ACC to eradicate corruption from this country? However, Bangladeshis being optimistic by nature, we don't give up the hope that one day honesty will be reinstated.//////THE US economy is in its worst crisis after many decades, sending shock waves round the world while turning the country itself upside down. Even the US$700 billion bailout package signed into law recently by the US President is being considered not enough to bring the US economy back on rails as people are losing houses, businesses and jobs. So far this year, 750,000 people in USA have lost their jobs. Europe too is in turmoil, and in UK the government has followed the US example and announced an 80 billion pounds bailout package. The IMF boss Strauss Kahn has said: "Intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest US-based and European financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown."//////FOR years, internal situation in Pakistan has been getting from bad to worse. With the bombing of Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on 13 Sept 2008, there is now serious concern about the long-term viability of the state of Pakistan itself. Is it going to be another Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan or Somalia is the question. The worry is many times more because Pakistan happens to be a nuclear-armed state. Any nuclear weapon or fissile material falling in the hands of the terrorists will have disastrous consequence. The North-Western part of the country bordering Afghanistan, known as Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), has been virtually under the control of Islamic Militants, known as Pakistani Taliban. The Taliban are fighting a two-pronged war - in Afghanistan against the Afghan-NATO forces and in Pakistan against the Pakistani military; yet most of the victims of their random attacks are innocent civilians. They have imposed harsh and arbitrary 'Sharia' law on the populace that include random killing and brutal torture. The bombings and assassinations in both the capitals of Afghanistan and Pakistan by the Taliban mean that they have now extended their areas of operations right up to the capitals. The situation is further complicated by the cross-border operations performed by the Afghan-NATO forces into Pakistan, chasing and attacking the Taliban. Although this had been going on for quite sometime, probably with a nod of approval from the Pakistan government, but with the new elected government in place in Islamabad such news are putting them under increasing pressure. Although commentators are quick to blame President Musharraf for the mess, I would argue that Musharraf continued with a legacy that started with the birth of Pakistan as a nation-state.//////India and China plan to conduct joint naval exercises soon as part of bilateral confidence-building-measures (CBMs) aimed at ensuring that competition between the two nuclear neighbours and economic rivals does not develop into conflict.//////Sri Lankan government forces had reached the outskirts of Kilinochchi, the stronghold of the Liberation Tigers of tamil Eelam (LTTE), on 19 September, as part of a major offensive aimed at destroying the rebels as an effective fighting force before the end of 2008.//////As things stand, Bangladesh is scheduled to go through an electoral process to vote in its ninth Parliament, and, keeping with the norms of parliamentary democracy, the next democratically-elected government to run the affairs of the country. After an unbroken run of three parliamentary democratic governments, which were marked as much by some major dysfunctions in governance and the political process as by significant achievements in several key social and economic indicators, the country has been in the undesirable grip of an emergency for close to two years. This state of languishing in the doldrums of political torpor certainly does not help in the march towards the establishment of liberal pluralist democracy in the country.//////Understanding the Muslim Mind by Rajmohan Gandhi looks like recompense for the past 'pitfalls' of the Indian National Congress in the half-a-century long freedom struggle in India that pushed Muslims aside from the political mainstream.
