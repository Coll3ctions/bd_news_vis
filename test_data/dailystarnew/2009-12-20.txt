The mood has got darker. The future looks set, so to say, to be more like the past or even the present after everything that has not happened in Copenhagen. Much as he would like to call the deal the United States has reached with China, India, Brazil and South Africa on coping with climate change a breakthrough, President Obama knows that the long-drawn negotiations in the Danish capital have clearly failed to satisfy the world's more disadvantaged nations. Of course, the developed world has promised to make available nearly $30 billion dollars to poor countries over the next ten years to help them handle the crisis on an immediate basis. Of course, there is the promise of $100 billion more coming after that. And, of course, there is the target of not letting world temperatures rise above 2 degrees Celsius in order to stabilise the planet.//////The latest figures of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) show that the rate of inflation for both food and nonfood items has registered a marked rise, although it is still safely below double digit. What is important to bear in mind is that inflation which had fallen to 2.25 percent in June has been slowly but steadily increasing since July. And in October it stood at 6.71 percent on point-to-point basis, principally because of the rising food price.//////WHAT is the fallout of the two weeks long UN Climate Talks held in the Danish capital of Copenhagen? What has been achieved so far is far short of a perfect deal as envisaged in the beginning. //////AFTER several rounds of discussion, filled with brinksmanship and 11th-hour negotiations on the concluding evening of the Copenhagen Summit conference (between the USA, the EU, China, India and Brazil), President Obama has claimed that there had been "an unprecedented breakthrough," and that a climate deal had been forged. The accord is significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming. Some members of the G-20 have also stressed that the accord has provided a system (a compromise on an issue over which China bargained hard) for monitoring and reporting progress toward national pollution-reduction goals. It has also set a goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050, implying cuts in climate-altering emissions over the next four decades. Attention has also been drawn to the fact that rich countries will provide $30 billion of climate aid over the next three years and $100 billion a year from 2020 to developing countries. The US has announced by far the lowest pledge. It will contribute $3.6 billion between 2010 and 2012, while Japan will give $11 billion and the European Union $10.6 billion.//////A first-half strike from Enamul Haque helped Abahani maintain their hundred percent success in the Bangladesh League as the defending champions handed a lone-goal defeat to Muktijoddha Sangsad at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Long-jumper Sajib Hossain and sprinter Shamsun Nahar Chumki sent a strong message that they were hungry for success in the coming South Asian (SA) Games to be held in Bangladesh from January 29 to February 9. //////Surjo Torun avoided complete embarrassment as the last year's runners-up made sure their place in the Premier Division Cricket League would stay by winning a do-or-die relegation battle against Khelaghar SKS by 64 runs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////MS Dhoni, India's captain, has been banned for two ODIs because India maintained slow over-rate during the second match against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. The penalty is more severe than the usual monetary fines because India were found to be three overs short, which comes under the "serious over-rate offence" category.

The present size of the forest is almost one sixth of the original jungle; less than 8,000 acres as against 45,000 acres a few decades ago. A large variety of wildlife, including tigers, black bears and pea fowls, has already disappeared from the jungle because of human encroachments. The traditional sal and medicinal plant forest has vanished. Thousands of acres of the government protected (!) Madhupur National Park are now at the mercy of timber thieves who pay forest officials to fell trees. The forest is fading away very fast and what stands there now is a mere shadow of the original. //////In the last 11 months a total of 141 people were killed by law enforcing agencies in the country. The news was published in your first page on 11 December.//////Bangladesh is tapped between the Himalayas in the north & the encroaching Bay of Bengal to the south. Bangladesh is most vulnerable to natural disaster due to the frequent extreme climate events & its high population density. In Bangladesh, climate change will affect many sectors, including water resources, agriculture & food security, ecosystem & biodiversity. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) Bangladesh country representative Dr Ainun Nishat told that a three to four degrees Celsius rise in temperature will cut rice production by at least 30 percent. If there is an increase in temperature of 6 Celsius the greater flow of water through Bangladesh's three great rivers will lead to between 20& 40% more flooding. In my view, the government should take following steps to face the impact of climate change. //////I don't know whether my mail will cause any sort of difference or not, but I think I should be writing this. I am a resident of Banani living here for the past 10 years. I have always been in love with Banani as I feel it is one of the best places to live in the whole of Dhaka city. But for the past few years, me including my family members have been facing the problem of new high-rise homes in the area, thus leading to a distressful state of sewerage lines. For the past one year or so, the drain of Road # 7, Block # F has been clogged up and water has been stagnant. It is very difficult for the people surrounding this area to move. Pungent smells are always there. //////An article on the matter was published in a local daily on 9 December, giving the pragmatic opinions of the Hon. Finance Minister as well as an Adviser of the last caretaker government. The opinion expressed by them against introducing politicians in bank management was very appropriate and realistic. They rightly pointed out that with politicians in the bank's board of directors; financial discipline and prudence will be sacrificed for expediency. //////The civilization of cities is rootless. The people there have no tradition, because it is a mass of people from different sections and groups without any unifying culture or ideas. Money is the God of the modern people. //////As reported in your daily, my attention caught glued to the news item that the Minister for Agriculture was asking the agricultural scientists not to adhere to conservative school of thought but to have some imaginative ideas of feeding three million people, the number being added annually to the total populace of our country, while she was attending ceremonies to observe Saarc Charter Day at Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC).//////I am happy to know that the draft population policy advocates introducing "single-child families" at national level by 2015 to avoid a serious socio-economic debacle due to the country's ever-increasing population.//////The successful holding of BNP's fifth council after a long gap of 16 years is an indication that the second largest political party of Bangladesh has been able to stand straight after its crushing defeat in the last general election. There was some doubt about a trouble free council as the party was almost divided during the rule of the last caretaker government centring the minus two formula and the much talked about call of reforms by the Fakhruddin government. But the happy and successful ending of the council will work as a big relief for BNP workers, supporters as well as for overall political climate of the country.//////As it is the capital of Bangladesh, population has been increasing very rapidly in this city and they are polluting its environment. Air pollution in Dhaka has gone higher than Mexico City and traffic jam is crossing the levels of tolerance. Between 1980 and 2009, the population of Dhaka has swelled from 3 million to more than 10 million. Moreover, the urban population has been growing very rapidly since liberation in 1971 and continues to do so at over 3.5 percent annually. The country will have an urban population approaching 50 million by 2015.This rapid growth has been due primarily to migration by the rural poor, particularly to large metropolitan areas. Dhaka is now bursting with people of all categories looking for jobs.//////Heads of administration from more than 70 countries, together with all the key stakeholders, have now signalled that they'll make the Copenhagen conference the foremost Real Summit on global warming where countries are projected to make promises, commitments and good signs to action. This is an incredibly optimistic measure as facing this challenge will need the focus of the major decision-makers in each nation, and their continued support for more than 40 years.//////On almost every Eid horrible launch accidents bring about untold devastation to the people going home to meet their kith and kin. In fact deaths in launch mishaps have been on the rise. To get rid of these accidents strict rules and regulations should be enforced by the government. Launches failing to go by the rules and regulations should not be allowed to operate. Last, but not the least, passengers should be aware of the dangers and take precautionary steps.//////I have just learnt today (15 December) that the government is going change the name of Zia International Airport.

The major and the biggest airport is Zia International Airport and it is in so bad shape that some airlines have warned to stop flights from that airport. Our other two airports in Chittagong and Sylhet are also in poor condition.//////Every year a large number of students are entering into several private varsities. Nowadays it is seen that not only less meritorious and sons and daughters of rich families are studying in private verities, but also students from middle class and even lower middle class background are studying here. //////Since Bangladesh airspace does not have many airplanes flying, this is one mode of transportation that still does not face traffic jams. Building new airports in other cities in Bangladesh will encourage commuters to use air transport instead of road transport thus reducing traffic. Opening new airports will create new jobs, city development, decentralization and improve communication between the cities in Bangladesh. Therefore, when factories and industries are set up in these cities, it will also be easier for executives to commute to these cities in order to visit and manage their industries. //////Expressing solidarity with under fire President Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has made it clear that the Supreme Court's judgement declaring the amnesty law (NRO) as 'unconstitutional' would not have any effect on the Presidency.//////The Heads of State, Heads of Government, Ministers, and other heads of delegation present at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen,//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government yesterday presented to parliament a list of nominees for a new Cabinet that keeps US favourites in several posts critical to the war and reconstruction.//////Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said yesterday Tehran was ready to examine the West's proposals for a nuclear fuel swap, the official IRNA news agency reported.//////Fury erupted at the Copenhagen climate talks Saturday over a draft accord agreed by a select group of leaders, with some delegates comparing it the Nazi Holocaust and Biblical betrayal.//////Environmental campaigners yesterday branded the Copenhagen climate summit an abject failure, saying it made progress on financing the battle against climate change but little else.//////Following are the main points in the draft deal agreed among leaders of more than two dozen countries at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen.//////Senate Democrats appear within reach of the 60 votes necessary to pass President Barack Obama's healthcare legislation after a long year of struggle and a final burst of deadline bargaining with holdout Sen Ben Nelson of Nebraska.//////Iran on Saturday acknowledged its takeover of an oil well on the Iraqi border but insisted the well lies on its land, playing down the fallout from the first such incident since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.//////A Nasa jumbo jet that will help scientists unlock the origins of the universe with infrared observations reached a milestone on December 18 when doors covering the plane's telescope were fully opened in flight.//////The world's media yesterday highlighted the bitter taste left by the provisional climate change deal struck by the major powers at the UN summit in Copenhagen.//////On the occasion of Martyred Intellectuals' Day and Victory Day, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) organised a group art exhibition.
