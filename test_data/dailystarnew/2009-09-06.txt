Wherever he was, he always carried an air of freshness in ideas, vigorous conviction and straightforwardness. And through decades of his political career and wisdom, Saifur almost became a true statesman, often criticising his own party stances on issues such as hartal and anti-privatisation sabre-rattling. Inside his party, he was one of the few saner heads respected across the file and rank.//////A monsoon depression in the northwest Bay and adjoining areas might trigger a heavy rainfall and 3-5 feet high wind-driven surge inundating low-lying areas of 14 coastal districts, offshore inlands and chars. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called upon the expatriate Bangladeshis to extend their wholehearted support to her government in building a modern digital Bangladesh by 2021 through salvaging the country from what she said the ruins left over by past rulers.//////With a view to providing a uniform treatment management of swine flu across the country an 18-member national technical committee was formed yesterday to prepare a guideline on clinical management of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1.//////* Born in Baharmardan village of Moulvibazar in 1932//////Saifur Friday made his last visit to Sylhet where he went to college and competed in parliamentary elections of 1996, 2001 and 2008.//////Three suspected criminals were killed in separate incidents of 'shootout' in Khulna, Kushtia and Pabna Friday night and early yesterday.//////The Foreign Ministers of Bangladesh and India hold bilateral talks in New Delhi on Tuesday (Sept 8) for a review of the entire range of bilateral issues as well as finding out newer avenues of cooperation between the two next-door neighbours.//////Local people and police jointly foiled a robbery in Agrani Bank under Sadullapur upazila while police caught two robbers of the gang of four members red-handed from the spot around 12:30am on Friday.//////The government will deploy 5,000 Rab members all over the country ahead of the Eid-ul-Fitr festival to check black marketing of tickets for bus, train and launches for homebound people.//////Educationists, academicians and teachers at a discussion yesterday urged the government to make the draft report on National Education Policy 2009 public to have opinions of mass people on it before its implementation.//////The high court in the Indian state of Gujarat has ordered the government to lift the ban on a controversial book on Pakistan's founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah.//////Pakistani forces yesterday killed at least 43 Islamic militants and destroyed their headquarters in the lawless Khyber tribal area bordering Afghanistan, officials said.//////Fifteen people, including several Bulgarians, died Saturday when an ageing tourist boat sank within seconds into Macedonia's Lake Ohrid, a popular attraction in the Balkans, officials said.//////LET there be no mistaking facts here. The upazila system is in a state of emasculation. Where it was thought that upazilas would serve as a strong foundation of the local government structure, it is now clear that the Awami League-led government is in little mood to have such a system take root. This of course runs contrary to the pledge the AL made in its election manifesto about a strengthening of local government bodies, with upazila parishads being a pivotal factor in such a plan. Since taking office, however, and particularly since the upazila elections in January this year, the government has backtracked on its commitment obviously in order to satisfy lawmakers. That has been done through empowering MPs to play a supervisory role in the functioning of the upazilas, so much so that upazila chairmen can only have projects implemented if and when they are approved by local lawmakers. That negates the overall concept of devolution the upazilas were supposed to be an embodiment of. What has now happened is a dilution of the authority local bodies should have had under a properly functioning upazila system.//////NOW that the World Climate Conference-3 has concluded with the decision to create a 'Global Framework for Climate Services', we earnestly hope all the countries will work sincerely towards implementing the pledges. The framework aims to help the world community better cope with the challenges of the unpredictable climate behaviour, as drastic changes in the weather pattern and resulting global warming is poised to wreak havoc in many countries, including Bangladesh. Hence, the Bangladesh government needs to keep its attention focused on how and when the recommendations will be translated into action. //////The prime minister has called upon the Bangladeshi expatriates of Europe to invest at home to accelerate country's economic development. The expatriate community's contribution to the economy cannot be overemphasised, especially for the remittance they send home regularly. Reassuringly though, the volume of foreign remittance is gradually on the increase despite the impact of the all-engulfing global recession on the developed economies where our expatriates live and work. Considering their unflinching support matched by robust contribution to the national economy under all circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the government would expect more from the Bangladeshi diaspora, especially who have also the capital, to come in a still bigger way and invest in the country. The prime minister's call in this connection is therefore only reflective of the nation's rising level of expectation from them.//////THE contagion of global meltdown that started in the US has caught up with the others. George Soros, in his book The crash of 2008 and what it means, writes: "The size of the problem is even larger than it was in the 1930s. This can be seen from a simple calculation. Total credit outstanding was 160 percent of GDP in 1929, and it rose to 260 percent in 1932 due to the accumulation of debt and the decline of GDP. We entered into the Crash of 2008 at 365 percent, which is bound to rise to 500 percent or more by the time the full effect is felt. And this calculation does not take into account the pervasive use of derivatives, which was absent in the 1930s but immensely complicates the current situation." He blames the collapse of the "housing bubbles" for the financial crisis.//////The season's transfer market for the upcoming Premier Division Cricket League has been stirred up by the high demands of some of the national players.

One usually associates illiterates and criminals who tend to ignore court orders, but not responsible public and private organisations as such. From the report, and two other reports published alongside, it seems that private organisations like BGMEA and BGFEA too have disregarded court directives! The same is the case with public and private educational institutions too! It only reflects the indifference of the management of these large number of institutions, who think nothing of flouting court directives!//////Different measures have been proposed for reducing traffic congestion at Asad Avenue of Mohammadpur,Dhaka by different organizations including Dhaka Metropolitan Police.

It is inequitable to pick and choose portions of the Act for prosecutor's' convenience; for instance, application only of the penal provisions but not the beneficial provisions of the Army Act which gave better salaries and promotion structure to army personnel and allowed them to go abroad for UN duties. //////Before going into the main point of my letter, I'd like to thank the The Daily Star for providing exposure to the hard work we do.

First of all, BCB made a wise decision by stripping Ashraful off captaincy. Though Mortaza was appointed captain, it was Shakib Al Hasan who led the team against the depleted West Indies side and Zimbabwe because of the former's injury. Shakib not only captained the team brilliantly, but also his all round performance must have inspired his fellow teammates. It is the first time in Bangladesh cricket history when our batsmen are batting more consistently. Tamim, Zunaid, Ashraful, Mushfique, Shakib, Mahmudullah, Naeem Islam are playing good knocks. Only we should look for consistent batting display from Ashraful. Many a time he plays unnecessary shots that bring his early downfall. I hope he will be more sensible when he bats. //////Women and child trafficking is one of the greatest forms of human abuse in the world today. Trafficking is lucrative and linked with criminal activity and corruption. It is often hidden and hard to address. Day-by-day it is increasing and taking various shapes worldwide.

For this to happen, there has to be unwavering commitment by the present and successive governments to elevate the present levels of higher education and scientific proficiency to contemporary international standards. //////EDUCATION in Bangladesh is beset with many problems such as divisiveness, high drop-out rates, deteriorating teaching standards, lack of opportunity for higher education, low pay for teachers, dependence on coaching centers, commercialization of educational institutions, politicisation of both students and faculty and so on. Some of these problems stem from our system of structuring, some from financial constraints while others are caused by political polarization and administrative inefficiency and neglect. While the Ministry of Education has undertaken the task of reforming the entire educational system, my focus is on a single problem the structural weaknesses in our education system. //////DIGITAL Bangladesh" and "Vision 2021" are catch phrases in Bangladesh these days. The buzzwords are no longer confined to the lexicon of information and communication technology (ICT) enthusiasts, but have entered the vocabulary of the educated section of the population. In its election manifesto leading up to the Ninth Parliamentary Elections in 2008, the Awami League (AL) coalition envisioned a Digital Bangladesh by 2021. The alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) countered with a promise of an even earlier delivery. ICT activists in the country may find this competition to own the issue heartening, as it may be a realization among the politicians that digitisation is synonymous with being modern and forward-looking, and that investment in ICT is important for national development. //////BORSHA* did not know she had no right to fall in love.
