It unveils after three years of the creative method having been introduced at the secondary level of education that 30 percent of the teachers are unable to set question papers in the creative segments of the text books. Even this is a partial picture based on surveys of 4810 out of 18404 institutions.

The price has further increased in the month of Ramadan. Bangladesh Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) recently suggested that the government should impose a ban on white fish export in the month of Ramadan. People of Bangladesh have experienced that business communities can do anything for making high profit ignoring the interest of commoners. The Bangladesh government also responded promptly and issued an order banning the export of white fishes, which is unprecedented. Within a couple of days, the price of our national fish hilsa has come down. The commoners have finally got the chance of tasting hilsa. Thanks to FBCCI and the government.//////We, the university students, are pursuing higher education without doing any research work. Without any research activities of applied science and pure science, we can not have quality education. Frankly, what we are studying at the university level in Bangladesh is totally backdated. Most of the lectures given by the course teachers were written in their student life. Moreover, our higher education is theory-based. The books we use are not updated with time. There are thousands of books in the university library but there are less than a hundred journals. Surely, it would be a good initiative if the authorities could collect more scientific journals for the students. //////History will not remember how much salary Dr. Yunus earned after he turned 60. History will not remember how our Nobel laureate was pestered by the government. In fact, history will not bother about the kind of embarrassment this man had to go through. What history will remember is, how he developed the ability and power of the rural people, how the acts of one person changed the course of their lives. As a nation, we should be ashamed that we are silently watching Dr. Yunus being denounced. Of course, we have no power to do anything because we are living in the prison where the government is the warden, and we are shackled at the whims of our utility providers, inept officials and visionary 'patriots'. I often can't help but think, where are the courageous citizens of Bangladesh? Had they all died in the Independence War?//////Bangladesh is in dire need of a 3rd political party. Each of our two major political parties have already shown wice what they can do in the last two decades which indicated that we should not keep faith on them anymore. Future of Bangladesh is not safe in their hands. People have already tested their capability and failed to draw any difference in their quality of governance. //////A recent report of The Daily Star says that the capital's Monipur High School autrhorities were allegedly collecting money from the students in the name of Padma Bridge Project. According to the news, the guardians of the school expressed resentment over the unlawful act of the school authorities. The high-ups of the government said several times that no individual or institution is asked to collect money right now. Then why are the authorities ignoring the matter? Isn't this unlawful money collection tarnishing the image of both the school and the government? Who doesn't want to see the Padma bridge built? But not in such unlawful way. I hope the government will punish those who are involved in such crimes. //////We do not know why Suranjit Sengupta is being called a 'minister without portfolio'. Should not the government give him a portfolio as he is so vocal on various important issues? We see him regularly speaking and sometimes more than other ministers and even more than Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The saying goes, "Raja joto boley, parishodgon boley tar shotogoon".//////Our beloved writer Humayun Ahmed breathed his last in a New York hospital on July 19, after a prolonged fight against cancer. His untimely and abrupt demise came as a terrible shock to the entire nation. He had to stay in a foreign country and spend a big amount of money for the treatment of the deadly disease. During his last days, he expressed his desire to establish a cancer hospital in Bangladesh so that our people need not go outside the country for highly expensive cancer treatment. To materialise his dream, we can establish a cancer hospital in his memory. The hospital may be named as 'Humayun Ahmed Cancer Hospital' and established preferably at or near Nuhash Polli in Gazipur.//////I wonder if any of your readers, sir, can help me to understand the way the minds work of those responsible for Planning Permission in Gulshan//////On 1st August I was amazed at how D. Jones highlighted the traffic situation in our country. Kudos to him for taking such interest in a mess that we have created. I am humbled by this man's effort (owing to the fact that he has actually taken the time emailing various organisations about the matter!). I have something positive that I want to let him know. //////Every day I have to travel to the southern parts of Chittagong. The buses which we use are local buses-- rundown vehicles that somehow hurtle to the destination. As it is the rainy season it often rains in the morning. When it rains, the window at the front of the bus looks hazy. In most cases, the windshield wipers of the local buses do not work. As a result, we can hardly make out the vehicles that are coming from the opposite direction. How does the driver finds his way is a matter of speculation. Needless to say, riding in those buses isa risky business.//////Syria's President Bashar al-Assad yesterday won a pledge of support from regional ally Iran as his forces tried to choke off rebels in the northern city of Aleppo.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton yesterday said that the world needs to decide how to end the conflict in Syria and start planning for a political transition in Damascus.//////US President Barack Obama said "soul searching" was needed on how to reduce violence in America after the killings, and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was "deeply shocked and saddened."//////Saudi Arabia accused authorities in Buddhist-majority Myanmar on Monday of "ethnic cleansing" against the Muslim Rohingya minority in the west of the country, state media reported on Tuesday.//////The Pakistan government has decided to file petitions in the supreme court seeking a review of the annulment of a new law aimed at preventing the premier's disqualification and another order on reopening graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari. //////A Nato soldier killed in Afghanistan yesterday by men in Afghan army uniforms was an American, a US defense official said, after Nato officials in Kabul announced an allied casualty.//////India's ruling UPA candidate Hamid Ansari was elected as India's vice president for an unprecedented second successive term as he defeated BJP nominee Jaswant Singh by an emphatic margin in the elections held yesterday.//////Police on Monday probed the white power ties of the former US soldier who gunned down six people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.//////Four more persons fell victim to the fresh wave of violence in lower Assam districts, triggering protest by locals who blocked National Highway 31 at Beltoli on the Kokrajhar-Dhubri border yesterday.//////Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been named chairman of a new parliamentary committee that is to monitor and help implement the rule of law under the country's new government.//////Egypt's army vowed Monday to "avenge" the killing of 16 troops by gunmen near the Israeli border and President Mohamed Morsi won US backing as he ordered his security forces to take full control of the Sinai.//////Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti won a confidence vote yesterday on a bill to cut spending by an extra 4.5 billion euros (3.57 billion pounds) this year in order to rein in the deficit and delay a planned increase in sales tax.//////A 26-year-old woman immolated herself yesterday in a Tibetan-populated region of northwest China after chanting slogans calling for the return of the Dalai Lama, the Free Tibet campaign group said.//////A New Zealand volcano suddenly erupted after lying dormant for more than a century, spewing an ash plume that disrupted flights and closed highways, officials said yesterday.//////A mosque burned to the ground in the midwestern United States on Monday, in what worshippers suspect was a hate attack, less than a day after a deadly shooting at a Sikh temple.//////Marking the 37th martyrdom of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and National Mourning Day, Bangladesh Agricultural University organised a ten-day photo exhibition at BAU Central Library auditorium on August 6. //////Nrityanchal's much acclaimed dance drama Rai-Krishna Padabali will be staged at Mayapur, Krishnanagar of Paschimbanga, India on August 10.

The latest production is historic -- Rudro Robi O Jallianwala Bagh. The play premiered at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, on August 5. Written by Manzur-e-Mawla, the play has been directed by Ataur Rahman.//////Bangla-desh's villages need to be saved from development. There must be laws, those which civilised societies observe everywhere, that will ensure that no individual or group will mar the traditional structure of the village through steps that are a clear extension of lopsided urban planning. In simple words, the villages of Bangladesh, historically the underpinning of our heritage, a spur to its societal, philosophical and literary expression, must be preserved. And that can be done through keeping every negative developmental initiative at bay.//////Time heals, but, regrettably, rather more so in proverbs than in politics. Time is rarely on the side of governments in desperate need of it. When the ship of state begins to leak, time, being a rascal, punctures a few extra holes in the hull. Any pragmatic captain knows that a limping ship must return to port or sink. But political captains tend to be counterintuitive. Loath to surrender control of the steering wheel, they head straight for icebergs in the hope that some miracle will save the crew and passengers.//////During the past two decades, Bangladesh accepted and sheltered more than 300,000 Rohingya refugees, who not only stayed back but also put heavy economic and social burden on the world's most densely-populated nation. //////The Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad has taken a serious beating in recent days on just about all fronts, from the defections of military top brass and diplomats, to the assassination of at least three of the president's inner circle.//////On October 31, 2011, with the birth of Oishee at 12:01 am in Bangladesh, UNFPA and government of Bangladesh celebrated the arrival of the 7 billionth global citizen on the planet earth. As of June 26, 2012 the world human population is estimated to be 7.022 billion by the United States Census Bureau, and over 7 billion by the United Nations. The population is expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the year 2040 and 2050. In fact, the world's population grows at a near-record pace, with a population equal to New York City's added every month, and equal to Germany's added every year. //////
