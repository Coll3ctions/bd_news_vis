This is a new spin on old-school slapstick, with the hurt being felt more on a mental level than a physical one, but it works, nonetheless. //////Shariful Islam, from Barokhada, Kushtia, is a folk music instruments player who initially started his profession as a carpenter but later switched onto the artistry of making ektara, dotara, sarinda and dugi-tabla.

It is good to see that we have developed a lot in terms of enrolment in primary education but it is also true that now is the time to see to what extent the students in the government primary schools are getting quality education and to what extent they are getting access to, and opportunity for, higher education and job market. //////1923//////The British Mandate for Palestine takes effect, creating Mandatory Palestine.//////Are the top government officials, specially the public representatives and public servants, all aware of the significance and importance of the four rivers around the mega city Dhaka? Do they have any long-term plans to save these rivers from still unabated encroachment and pollution? Yes should be the answer in both the cases. For this is what is supposed to be satisfactory to the people, who want to know that the people's government is not turning a blind eye to the issue. //////At the very beginning of the month (September 1) we also observed the International Vulture Awareness Day, along with others across the world. But to what effectiveness, is yet to be judged. The vulture is a big size bird of prey and also referred to as important scavenger.

But at present, it is not seen usually in locality dump sites with the exception of the zoo and some remote parts of the country. Vulture is a strong-bird that feeds on carrion. They have broad wings, riding on which they soar high while looking down for carrion. They have no feathers on head or neck, for which they look bit ugly, but are very gentle and simply harmless.//////I was glad that I could finally pack everything and get on the plane. The month was hectic as I had to finish all my courses' lesson plans a month early so that I can go to Bangalore (or at present Bangaluru) to attend the Inter-Asia Cultural Society (IACS) Summer School on Cultural Studies. It is amazing how the same country can have so many variations in their weather at the same time. As I stopped at Kolkata airport, it was hot and humid. But when I reached Bangaluru airport, I saw people wearing light jumpers and it was pretty cold as if early winter had set in.//////When I was young, my mother advised me a million times to paint and do other extracurricular activities in order to enrich my personality. I had tried too, a million times. Nothing interested me. I was coerced to join a painting class near my house but the austerity of the circles and straight lines were the biggest turn-off . The kaleidoscope of the monotony coalesced with the dark age that these art schools bear. So yes, I found a more compact reason to not paint. //////Heart disease only affects male, older and rich populations  these are the popular myths and still prevailing in many parts of the world including Bangladesh. In fact, women are as vulnerable as men and it is the number one killer of women. However, their risks are largely underestimated and as a result they are under-prevented and bear the brunt of the disease.//////Emergency contraception, or post-coital contraception, refers to methods of contraception that can be used to prevent pregnancy in the first few days after intercourse.

And that despite the fact that his era of heroism, on celluloid of course, is long past. But there is that certain addiction we all suffer from, at certain points of our life or for an entire lifetime. For people of my generation, Dilip Kumar belongs properly to the era of our fathers. That is easy to follow, seeing that he was born in 1922 and grows into an increasingly ripe age. These days one does not quite see him as one used to. But that inimitable charm, the memory of the impeccable Urdu with which he regaled us both in the movies and outside, the manliness he symbolized before his screen women --- all of these have remained firmly implanted in our minds.//////Samuel Beckett is the literary equivalent of an Olympic gymnast. His words and sentences flip, roll, and jump about constantly. While this may leave you dazed and confused at first, the technicality and proficiency with which he carries out his exercise leaves you dumbfounded and amazed. This level of ingenuity is best experienced in his novels, the second of which is //////. It is Beckett's most conventional novel till date, though you shouldn't hold that against this brilliant piece of work.////// The earliest of memories of taking up books to read come with picking up those Reader's Digest monthly magazines. At first I used to read the humour sections and feel myself doubling up with ripples of laughter. And then I started turning to the other pages and became an addicted fan of the magazine. Once you get into the habit of reading them they become irresistible! You request the hawker to deliver it to you every month or else run to the nearest bookstall in the first days of the month for your copy. Your mind is restless until you can open the new copy and delve inside those rich and memorable writings. //////
