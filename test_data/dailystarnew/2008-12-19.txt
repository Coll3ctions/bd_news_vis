The leaders of the most affluent countries of the world, the G20 as they call it, failed to reach a constructive and effective conclusion regarding this significantly devastating effect. But what can we do as mere residents of this planet to save it from the disastrous future that lay ahead?

With public interest so high, it's easier predicting a blockbuster general election on 29th December if everything goes as planned.

So it is irrational to ask for such favour as each country adopts polices suitable for its interests. Ironically, our Trade Policy suits the other country.//////Science teaches us how to understand the world by reasoning and asking questions.
