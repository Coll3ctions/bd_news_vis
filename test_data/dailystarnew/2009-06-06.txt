It is a strange mix of the negative and the positive. Set against the backdrop of a change in the demand pattern brought on by the global financial meltdown and a high cost of doing business, the garments sector is on the one hand confronted with a buyer pressure to reduce prices and on the other blessed by a set of new buyers' leaning towards Bangladeshi RMG products. //////DEATHS in the so-called crossfire have, unfortunately, become news once again. The Daily Star editorial of May 31, has been quite critical of the foreign minister's comment that the culture of crossfire killing cannot come to an end overnight. While concerned citizens and rights bodies may take serious exception to the minister's observation, particularly in view of her recent assurances about putting an effective stop to custodial killing at international forum, the reality on ground lends credence to the minister's premonition, howsoever retrograde that may sound.//////PAKISTAN'S campaign to rid the scenic Swat valley, Buner and the surrounding areas of Islamist fighters has added another chapter to the continuing saga of their commitment to tackle the crisis of fundamentalism.

Multiple names; two faiths; two mediums of creative expression - painting and writing, the latter in two languages and several genres; many interests; many controversies. Her name will long resonate in our consciousness, thanks to her bold assertiveness, whether in confessional verse or self-revelatory prose. //////It was built up as an afternoon of literary Davids from Pakistan, writers who had emerged relatively new on the horizon of South Asian English fiction and were fast beginning to catch up with the entrenched Goliaths of India. Pakistan appears often in the global media for issues ranging from its institutionalised support of violence to its undisputed talent in terms of both cricket and corruption, and yet, here they were veiling the violence with an artistic cover. So, what were the new Pakistani literati really like, I thought, as I navigated the swell of the great unwashed over the Bank Holiday at Regent's Street. //////On 30th May Dhaka Club played grand host to a book launch in its Hamidur Rahman Sinha Lounge.

Why not leave me alone, critics,//////friends, visiting cousins, everyone of you? Let me speak//////in any language I like.

I was child and later they said, I grew,//////for, I became tall, my limbs swelled and one or two places//////sprouted hair. When I asked for love, not knowing what else//////to ask for, he drew a youth of sixteen into his//////bedroom and shut the door. He did not beat me but my sad//////woman-body felt so beaten. The weight of my breasts and//////womb crushed me. I shrank pitifully. Then I wore a shirt//////and a black sarong, cut my hair short and ignored all of//////this womanliness.

In fact, a member of the parliament, who is also a former career diplomat, has responded to these appointments in the media as if they have been announced already.//////US President Barack Obama has offered the beginning of a new engagement to the US' traditional enemies, exemplified by its seriousness towards Iran. Even though Obama has declared his opposition to the Iranian nuclear programme, like the Bush administration, he has also indicated a more pliable approach to it. Obama has appealed to the leaders of Iran and expressed his administration's commitment "to pursue constructive ties between the US, Iran and the international community."//////AS travelogues go, ////// is rather humdrum. As a book that highlights the importance of archives to a nation or country, however, Sharif uddin Ahmed's work carries some weight, an aspect that should have a far greater impact on the people and government of Bangladesh than its contents in one hundred pages and small change. According to The New American Desk Encyclopedia, archives, which are documents of a public body preserved in an organized manner, began in 1789 with the French Archives Nationales as the systematic collection and supervision by a central government agency. Quoting the director general of the Malaysian National Archives, Ahmed brings out the significance of archives to a society: Archives are not only important for heritage preservation but also as means of transparency in a government. They can be the reference to our past strengths and weaknesses, and guide us to move forward. However, the author laments, there is little public awareness in Bangladesh about the important role that archives can play in a country's development.//////It's a beautiful book--- in shape and size with a cover picture of the Pukhtun Badshah Ghaffar Khan, a map of 17 agencies--- Chitral, Dir, Kohistan, Swat, Manshere, Abbotabad, Mohmand, Malakand, Mardan, Peshawar, Khyber, Khurram, Kohat, North Wazirstan, South Wazirstan, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan and states or agencies of the North West Frontier. //////Archaeology is related to the renovation, resurrection and reconstruction of non-documented and extinct history of ancient men through the analysis of their material remains conveying their cultural tradition, often hidden within ancient mounds. ////// is a biography of Sister Subbalakshmi, a very admirable Indian social reformer who brought about an unimaginable transformation in the lives of South Indian child widows.//////
