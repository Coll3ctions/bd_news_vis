Gabriel Gonzalez Videla's oppressive rule compels the master of allegory to take refuge in a villa owned by Italian historian Edwin Cerio in Capri, fictionalized by Antonio Skarmeta in his 'Ardent Patience.' The film revolves around a postman who is assigned with the onus of delivering billets-doux of the passionately overwhelmed discoverers (mostly female) of metaphorical pronouncements to the intractable activist involved in coping with the human condition. His repeated interactions with the maestro take impersonal courses until one day the delivery man chances upon the biggest metaphor of his life in a literal damsel. The punctuated breaths of the lovelorn punctuate the new-found terrain of emotional exuberance before the commander of amorous poetics. Neruda, the pseudonymous composer, despite initial hesitation embarks on a journey of winning Troy for the beloved of his self-assured apprentice. He is at the helm, weaving strings of cloaked expressions for the sake of his disciples' amorous entanglements. The resemblance of smiles to the wings of the butterfly is brought forth as an initial demonstration of emotion in the postman's life.//////
