However, because of the time constraints we feel that it will be difficult for the parties to attain full democratisation of their existing set-ups before the next general election.//////Finance and Planning Adviser Mirza Azizul Islam has observed that although there is no shortage of food, several quarters are trying to create panic about it. We accept his spirit but would like to emphasise the need for avoiding complacency. //////If failure is the pillar of success, success is also the pillar of failure. Alexander the Great conquered the world at 26 and he was never defeated in a war. But he lost his friends, antagonised his own wife and may have been victim of a conspiracy leading to his death, although recorded history says he died in a weakened condition suffering from fever. //////It was an unusual sight; there was something almost surreal about it. A man who has plunged the Middle East and the neighbouring countries into complete chaos and shown his unmitigated contempt for the suffering of the Palestinian people for the last seven years appeared on November 27 at the Memorial Hall of the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and expressed his sudden enthusiasm for the creation of a Palestinian state. //////Chittagong and Khulna dominated while Rajshahi conceded a good position yesterday on the third day of the 9th National Cricket League sixth-round matches across the country.//////The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) will have to rely on only the three-match Abahani-Mohamme-dan football series to raise fund for the cyclone-affected people after its plan to stage a concert for the same cause was not approved.//////Fast bowler Umar Gul will return home after failing to recover from a back injury, adding to Pakistan's fitness problems on the eve of the crucial second Test against India here on Thursday.//////Police closed their investigation into the death of Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer on Wednesday after an 11-member inquest jury handed down an open verdict in the case.//////Shoaib Akhtar, the Pakistan fast bowler, has been discharged from a private hospital after recovering from a fever and chest infection on Wednesday evening.//////Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) was approved last night as a full member of Federation of International Cricketers' Association (FICA).//////England's cricket Test series in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite two deadly bomb attacks blamed on Tamil Tiger rebels that killed at least 19 people, officials said Thursday.//////India's Test captain Anil Kumble supported Gary Kirsten's candidature as national coach to succeed Greg Chappell on Thursday.//////Chelsea and AC Milan became the latest teams to seal their places in the Champions League knockout stage after the penultimate batch of group matches on Wednesday. //////Avram Grant admitted that it will difficult to cope without the strike power of Didier Drogba after the Ivorian's double on Wednesday night helped Chelsea progress to the knockout stage of the Champions League. //////Werder Bremen upset nine-time titleholders Real Madrid 3-2 to leave Champions League Group C too close to call with one match remaining. //////Five men including Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp and a Serbian tycoon have been released on bail after being arrested by detectives probing alleged corruption in English football. //////Saudi Arabia captain Yasser Al Qahtani, the newly-crowned Asian Player of the Year, could be training with Chelsea as part of the award.//////Galatasaray and Turkey striker Hakan Sukur has been told that he is surplus to requirements at the Istanbul club. //////In-form Aston Villa ran riot in Blackburn on Wednesday night with a resounding 4-0 victory at Ewood Park which moved them up to sixth in the Premier League. //////Louis van Gaal has reiterated his desire to become the new England manager and pointed Wednesday to a release clause in his contract as coach of AZ Alkmaar should the FA come knocking. //////The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) on Wednesday gave their full backing to national coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, congratulating the Brazilian for leading them to a fourth consecutive European championship finals. //////Away supporters have been barred from the potentially volatile Sicilian derby between Catania and Palermo this weekend. //////Walk into the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Panchkula and you'd think a rock concert is about to hit town.

As I type this, scientists are expressing their consensus and mutual concerns about global warming. Bangladesh will be one of the first countries to be affected by the predicted rise of the sea level. However, this country's population density will work like a catalyst to already present sufferings if weather pattern takes a drastic turn. NGOs and many other derivative organisations of UN have been running family development projects in Bangladesh for a while and the long standing slogan for family planning has been Boys or Girls: Two Children Are Enough. Now I think it's about time we changed that number two ONE. My reasoning is simple and is based on strategic common sense. During any natural disasters, one has to provide extra logistics for the safety of the children. Of course, readers will find my argument crude, materialistic and devoid of any spiritual value. But survival requires cold logic. //////The reality of prices spiralling up and up is exceeding the limits of tolerance and patience. With no end in sight, it has proved false the age-old belief that all things that go up must come down. It seems that price escalation has reached levels beyond mortal's control; and only Allah knows when the end will be reached! Market mechanism misunderstood and mismanaged by drives and dictates has set the chain reaction and price overheat which is now beyond help and control. Cunning businessmen may have lost percentages of profits; but are more than recompensed it by margins on volume turnover with much shorter cash flow cycles! A very costly experience for the few, but with many unfortunate sufferers, who are the vast majority of fixed income middle class!//////The USA has been trying to sidetrack world attention from the horrors of its disastrous terror wars in the Middle East and, with the help of several other nations in the West and East, its horrible oppression of Muslims worldwide. It has now found a lame excuse in Pakistan. They say democracy must return to Pakistan and emergency should end there. The USA shamelessly squanders the resources of Afghanistan and Iraq and incites turmoil in Pakistan by making loud speeches about democracy which it does not respect in any measure. The self-centered politicians of Pakistan have been looking up to Washington to ask President Gen. Musharraf to quit and leave the chair for them to play the musical chairs game and plunder the resources according to their whims and fancies. //////Kindly allow me to ventilate my views on the above subject.//////The Nov. 15 cyclone destroyed acres of paddy, ruined the shrimp farms- (the second largest foreign currency earner).//////Parents are paying Vat with monthly tuition fees and annual fees since July 2007 to the English medium schools. I am surprised as I am not sure why should we pay it. Managers of the English medium schools usually charge high fees from the students and have good profits from this business. Parents are paying the tuition fees for their children as there is no alternative in our country. As no rules and regulations exist for the English medium school, they are charging whatever they like and the number of students in a class is often very high. Even there is no rule as to how many students will be in a class for a teacher. //////Let us put an end to the sufferings of the unwanted Biharis in camps all over Bangladesh. Enough is enough regarding repatriation of the Biharis. Now everybody is aware that Pakistan is never going to take them. Look at the present situation of Pakistan? I earnestly request the present caretaker government to find a solution for the Biharis. Save our environment from permanent pollution in and around the camps. The drug dealers, women traffickers are all there. It is a safe heaven for them. Give them notice to leave the camp before 31 December 2007. //////The present move of the caretaker government to update the voter list is commendable. But still there are some deficiencies. There have been a few complaints from the people of Chittagong as their names were not enlisted because they are "Non-Bengali Bangladeshis". My point is that they are Bangladeshi by birth and have the right to become the citizens of Bangladesh.//////The BNP is the largest political party in Bangladesh for a long time. Most of their top political leaders are in jail. We agree with the government that we need to reform the political culture and modus operandi of the major parties. //////Petty thievery, snatching, taking away by force mostly by heroin addicts have increased beyond anybody's control in greater Dhanmondi area. During a doa mehfil in my Dhanmondi residence on the occasion of my father's death anniversary, many who attended became victims of car accessory thefts, missing headlights and also loss of mobile phones sets. Stealing of manhole covers in and out of the house also took place. //////Prof. Yunus has correctly identified the malady of old stereotyped approach of World Bank lending portfolio, which is not an effective tool for poverty alleviation, needed by countries like Bangladesh.//////The politicians, who are clamouring for trial of war criminals and debarring religion-based politics, are themselves guilty of such crimes. //////What is life ? I wanted to get a unique definition of life from different persons like day-labourers, rickshaw-pullers, friends, colleagues, students, teachers, celebrities, domestic helps, high officials etc. Every person puzzled me. I am not satisfied with their definitions!//////The judiciary is independent now from the executive fetters of the state. We laud the present CTG for their stupendous success in segregating the judiciary which was a long cherished demand of the countrymen.//////It is about time that the BTTB starts providing broadband lines to its subscribers. The BTTB has the infrastructure and network to provide broadband service in all metropolitan cities in the country. In the developed countries telephone companies are providing high-tech services like broadband to subscribers and have enhanced their source of revenue. I wonder why the BTTB is lagging behind. Is it because they are not aware of broadband service or lack of interest, or is it due to bureaucratic tangles? //////Suddenly, the Law Adviser has raised the issue relating to the tenure of the caretaker government. It is well understood that the CTG might hand over power to the elected government in January 2009. Of course, the CTG should in the meantime make the reference to the Supreme Court regarding the changes in the constitutional provision( 58C) relating to its tenure.//////I am a professor of Bangladesh Open University; my elder brother who retired from Bangladesh Shipping Corporation 10 years back has a very special treasure in his collection: the complete set of pictures of the 1969 Ekushey February art exhibition drawn by Arts College students of East Pakistan Students' Union.//////You may have come across the news of two highly educated sisters living in Mirpur. One of them is a doctor and the one an engineer. They don't want to go outside. They don't trust anybody. They just want to confine themselves to their house and separate themselves from the rest of the world. It's a kind of disease that they have been suffering from. It's a matter of concern that the number of such patients is increasing gradually. As it's a mental disease, at the primary stage sometimes it is ignored. //////I am a general citizen of Bangladesh now staying in Sweden for my research work. I want to draw your attention to corruption in Bangladesh. I guess it's impossible to eliminate corruption, since our government policy is to force people to be corrupt! But please don't get me wrong! May be it feels strange to you as the government is always against corruption. //////Philippine troops stormed a Manila hotel in a flurry of gunfire and tear gas yesterday, forcing the surrender of a band of renegade soldiers who were demanding that President Gloria Arroyo step down. //////Afghan and international forces pounded an area of southern Afghanistan overnight, killing around 30 Taliban and capturing 12 others, police said yesterday. //////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said Wednesday that this week's US-hosted peace conference put back "on track" prospects for an independent Palestinian state after a seven-year hiatus. //////A shell aimed at Islamic militants in northern Pakistan killed 11 civilians, while a roadside bomb killed five soldiers in another troubled region near the Afghan border, officials said Thursday. //////EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana will cast final judgement today on whether Iran might be willing to suspend sensitive nuclear activities, with new UN sanctions seeming all but inevitable. //////The parties of Pakistani opposition leaders Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif dismissed Pervez Musharraf's swearing in as a civilian president Thursday as too little, too late. //////Australia's prime minister-elect Kevin Rudd unveiled his cabinet Thursday, prioritising education, industrial relations and the environment in a break with conservative predecessor John Howard's legacy. //////Ten security men and a driver were killed in India on Thursday when their vehicle drove over a land mine planted by suspected Maoists, police said. //////Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt walked out of a prison in western India Thursday after being granted bail on a six-year sentence for possessing illegal weapons, witnesses said. //////Four Hamas activists died late Wednesday in an Israeli air raid and another attack in the Islamist-run Gaza Strip, a Palestinian security source said. //////Nearly 6,000 Sunni Arab residents joined a security pact with American forces Wednesday in what US officers described as a critical step in plugging the remaining escape routes for extremists flushed from former strongholds. //////Former chess champion turned Kremlin critic Garry Kasparov was freed from jail yesterday and warned that Russia was sliding toward dictatorship under President Vladimir Putin. //////More than 81,000 Indians have been deported from Gulf states so far this year for visa and other offences, a minister said yesterday. //////Tanvir Mokammel's soul-searching and poignant 90-minute documentary The Promised Land (Shopnobhumi) had its press show at the Central Public Library Auditorium on November 28. In the documentary the filmmaker looks back to 1947, when the Partition of India took place, which, in Mokammel's opinion was a great tragedy as a lot of people suffered, and yet solved nobody's problem.//////He made two single-episode TV plays and a tele-film on the popular fictional character ////// -- both earning admiration from the audience. His work ////// was screened at the recent 'South Asian Film Festival'. He is an active member of the theatre troupe Prachyanat. In an interview with //////, Animesh Aich talks about his works, theatre and his aspirations. //////The 'Rash Mela' of Dinajpur, a festival of the Hindu Community dating back to five hundred years, began at the Kantanagar Temple premises in Kaharol upazila, Dinajpur on the full-moon night of November 23.//////The premier show of tele-film ////// was held at the Central Public Library auditorium recently. The film is an initiative to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS and the screening was sponsored by UNAIDS in collaboration with Grameenphone.//////An Iranian government decision to forbid the second printing of a Persian translation of Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel has spurred interest in the book, booksellers said last week.//////Weekly magazine programme ////// is aired every Saturday at 5:30pm on ATN Bangla. //////Written and directed by Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, drama serial 420 will be aired at 9:35pm on Channel i tonight. //////The burden of my argument is that whatever arrangements for reform and institutional change are underway, whether to deal with corruption, reform the regulatory system, or establish a workable system of local government, will have to eventually be implemented by the next elected government. The attempt to rebuild the authority and integrity of the Election Commission, the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Public Service Commission, the University Grants Commission are all commendable achievements of the CTG. But all these institutional interventions will again have to be consensually sustained by the next elected parliament. Not only will the reforms have to be politically supported by the next government, they will have to be immunised from legal challenge so that the constitutionality of both the CTG as well its specific reforms will have to be protected.//////Ms. Bose also paints a picture of the Pakistan military as a disciplined force that spared women and children. Citing her field research she writes: "Bangladeshi participants and eyewitnesses described battles, raids, massacres and executions, but told me that women were not harmed by the army in these events except by chance, such as in crossfire. The pattern that emerged from these incidents was that the Pakistan army targeted adult males while sparing women and children."//////Draw-cards aside, the tourism industry needs to create and aggressively market new products that focus solely on the expatriate market, as there are a tremendous number of expatriates who rarely leave Dhaka, and so their perception of Bangladesh is based solely on their impressions of the capital city. Not only is this a serious and grave error, these are the impressions that expatriates take to other countries around the world. //////Social collaboration is different from political collaboration. While social acts may be sourced in local conditions and not directly linked with state policies, political collaboration is primarily an act of upholding the state. This involves political constructs like parties applying political policies to strengthen the state. //////The elites like to think illiterate people in rural Pakistan are ignorant and always vote for thugs. But if you go to rural Pakistan, you will be amazed to see the political sense people have there. When I was in college, I used to think (reading The Dawn newspaper) that the only problem in Pakistan is with literacy. The uneducated people do not understand who is good for them. But when I actually started campaigning in the election and went to the rural areas, I discovered that even the political awareness among the children in rural areas is often more than adults in urban areas. //////Human generated changes in the global climate are widely accepted by scientists and policy makers. Bangladesh is very vulnerable to climate changes; may suffer the most severe impacts because it is low-lying densely populated country. With a one meter rise in sea level, one fifth of the nation's land and nearly 15 percent of the population would be threatened by inundation. Whereas its national economy strongly depends on agriculture, its associated landscape management and natural resources are also sensitive to climate change. The climate change threat for Bangladesh is related to development, which causes the most threatening impacts on the natural, social and economic systems of the country. The impact on the Bangladesh economy of climate change would be extremely adverse: an annual loss of $1 billion of GDP by 2010, $5 billion by 2070. //////Are we not a privileged generation to live at a time when we have opportunity to save both our Earth and our world? No generation in the past has enjoyed such an opportunity, since the problems were not there. No generation in the future will enjoy the same opportunity, because if we do not get on top of the problems before they get on top of us, our descendants will have nothing left to do//////This earth serves not only as our habitat but also as our natural heritage because it is passed on from one generation to the next. The next generation of human beings shall inherit this earth in the condition that we leave it. For this reason, it is our prime responsibility and moral duty to keep a hygienic and salutary ambience. Most of us do not realise now the importance of looking after this fragile environment. They take many things from this environment and never think of conserving some of the natural resources we have today. They think that the resources will never run out and continuously draw them from the earth to make their lives easier and more comfortable. //////
