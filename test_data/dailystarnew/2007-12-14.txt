The killers of intellectuals during the Liberation War can be prosecuted on the basis of evidence preserved by the government.

For the people of Bangladesh, no sacrifice can be greater in dimension and more profound in substance than the dignified manner in which some of our best men and women were huddled to their death on the eve of the liberation of the country in December 1971. Indeed, the three million Bengalis who died at the hands of the Pakistan occupation army and its local collaborators in the nine months of a do or die war of liberation have left behind an uplifting message for those of us who survived, and for our children and their children: that freedom which comes at a huge price is freedom that needs constant sustenance and succour for it to continue playing its due role in the welfare of those who mean to benefit from it.//////In this country where the most obvious, sensible and expected gets overridden by governmental expediency, without a blink of an eye, it is the high judiciary that comes to overturn the aberration as a breath of fresh air. It is in this light that we welcome the High Court verdict declaring 'illegal' the appointment of justice MA Aziz as Chief Election Commissioner while he was an incumbent justice of the Supreme Court Appellate Division. That nobody could concurrently hold two constitutional posts was never in doubt and that is why controversy stalked justice MA Aziz from the first day of his assumption of office as CEC bringing down credibility of the EC with it. The pertinent question is he being himself a serving judge with vast experience how could he accept the offer from the government of the day to be the Chief Election Commissioner? //////Another year, another December 14. Once again, we mourn the loss of the intellectuals butchered on that day as well as the hundreds of others who were hunted down, tortured, and killed during the course of the none months long liberation war. And once again, once December 14 is safely behind us, we conveniently forget the martyred intellectuals for another year, and go back to our everyday lives. //////A freedom fighter went to court to bring sedition charges against three men. His lawyer prepared the brief and the judge accepted the case. Then the law minister threw a cold blanket on the entire thing. He rightly pointed out that all along it was flawed by a procedural mistake. Sedition by definition is resistance to the legal authority to disturb the peace or disrupt the government. So, the government alone has the locus standi to incriminate its rebellious citizens. Once again, we have let our conviction for the trial of the war criminals of 1971 slide into confusion.//////Keeping enemy options in mind, I asked Capt. Aftab Qader to put more stress of his defences on the khal. Qader agreed with me and said that he would do so, first thing in the morning. I asked Khalikuzzaman to co-ordinate with Qader to ensure blocking of the river totally. Thirdly, I was completely ignorant regarding the vast areas across the river on to Kasalong hills. //////For the Bangladesh team the first impression of New Zealand has been one of pleasant surprise. Arriving in December with the mind playing all over the prospects of one chilly Kiwi tour it doesn't hurt when you see glorious sunshine and temperature hovering around the 20-degree mark.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan dragged the media in his on-going war against Sports Adviser Tapan Chowdhury when he lodged an official complaint to the chairman of National Sports Council (NSC) yesterday. //////More than any of their achievements, Wednesday night's reception accorded to the athletes of Bangladesh Special Olympics team and their parents was recognition of their courage and sporting spirit.//////England's batsmen shone under pressure to draw the second cricket Test against Sri Lanka here on Thursday and keep their hopes alive in the three-match series.//////If you think the Chappell-Hadlee Series has lost its lustre, think again.

"I never missed."//////England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke held low-key talks with Peter Chingoka, the chairman of Zimbabwe Cricket, in Johannesburg last week where it is reported that discussions took place about forthcoming tours between the two countries and the ICC World Twenty20 scheduled to take place in England in 2009.//////It has been a day of mixed fortunes for Pankaj Singh. At the very moment, perhaps, when the national selectors were discussing his name for the Australia tour, Pankaj was busy battling it out in Jhalawar, trying to secure for Rajasthan their first-ever victory over Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy. Pankaj couldn't save Rajasthan from losing by two runs -- but he did get the selectors' call.//////Gaibandha crushed Kurigram by 96 runs in the national under-14 district youth cricket competition at

be imported for the Sidr-affected people.//////In relation to Mr Moinul Chowdhury's analysis of my previous letter, I feel it is necessary to say a few things. Firstly, I would say that Mr. Chowdhury is not listening to the Law Adviser. He has given all the answers Mr Chowdhury requires. I would also suggest the CTG to take action against the previous ruling parties for not taking any action against the anti-liberation forces. I totally agree with the Law Adviser in saying that no individual has a right to file a case of treason against any citizen of Bangladesh.//////As a Bangladeshi living abroad for years, I feel tremendous pride in the efforts taken by the current rulers of Bangladesh to bring back the remains of one of our valiant sons. Unfortunately, this should have been done years ago by the previous regimes, especially the ones who claim monopoly over the liberation war. However, better late than never.//////Two issues remain to be addressed for successful conclusion of our independence struggle. One issue, the trial of war criminals, has been discussed a lot in recent times. We, as a nation, owe it to the persons who gave their lives to free us, to the children who were denied their parents' love, to the parents whose dreams about their children never materialized, to the mothers and sisters who were violated by the criminals and to our next generation. Another issue is to express our gratitude and recognise persons, who supported and contributed tremendously to our freedom struggle. Of many such people, I will mention two who had enormous contribution in bringing our struggle to the attention of the world. Music maestro Ravi Shankar along with George Harrison of the Beatles had such a tremendous contribution in bringing the tragic Bangladesh situation in front of the western world through CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH in Madison Square Garden, NY on August 1, 1971. We as a nation failed to give them due honour. I feel very sad that we will never be able to show our gratitude to George Harrison as he died in November 2001. His widow recently contributed half a million dollar for the children of Bangladesh and drew world's attention to the recent disaster. I hope it is not too late to honour Ravi Shankar as he is also not in very good health though still performing once or twice a year. It would be a tremendous expression of our gratitude to invite Ravi Shankar and the widow of George Harrison to Bangladesh and honour them, may be on the occasion of our next Independence Day celebrations. //////I would like to share with your readers a poignant moment in my life, one that has left deep scars and now a deeper understanding of 1971. My story should leave no one in doubt (detractors please note) that the struggle in 1971 was indeed a struggle to liberate our soil from colonial forces bent on destroying our Bengali culture and heritage. I was an eyewitness to the horrific manifestations of an ideology, which was racist and violent in nature. It would stop at nothing to perpetuate the communal bias of the Pakistani ruling classes and its armed hordes. It didn't matter that the majority in East Pakistan were Muslims- what really mattered was that the Bengalis must never be allowed to be the managers of the state of Pakistan.//////On a cold rainy Sunday afternoon (9 Dec 2007) we the Bangladeshi expatriates in New Jersey and surrounding areas were presented with an excellent retrospective on the genocide in our Motherland committed by the Pakistani occupation forces and their local Bengalee collaborators in 1971. This seminar and exhibit under the auspices of the Department of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Kean University was largely the work of a few young people of Bangladeshi origin at Kean (who were born at least a generation after 1971) supported by a professor of English, Dr. Bernard Weinstein. The seminar was preceded by a moving exhibit of rare photographs painstakingly collected from scattered sources around the world. This well attended seminar started with a moment of silence for the three million martyrs due to whose sacrifice Bangladesh is now a free country and a short film documenting the history of the Liberation War. It was addressed by Dr. Farahi, President of Kean University, Dr. Rounaq Jahan of Columbia University and a number of scholars, freedom fighters and noted personalities. The highlight of the seminar was a segment consisting of short talks by family members of genocide victims and survivors of the genocide. Every participant at this seminar (who came from various parts of the USA) left the auditorium with a strong feeling that as civilized humans we must make every effort to ensure that a genocide of the likes of what happened in Bangladesh must not be allowed to happen ever again. //////We will never move forward as a nation (even after 36 years) until or unless every single rajakar still living amongst us is brought to justice, including those who until very recently occupied seats of power. I understand that "to forgive is divine" but we do need a fresh start very badly and the only possible way we can continue our journey as a nation is to make these people face the music which they thoroughly deserve. We cannot continually live with this wound in our hearts. The genocide of our people in 1971 is officially ranked second only to the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews during the Second World War. How can we pass another day without batting an eyelid? //////My father SM Momtazur Rahman was brutally killed on 27 November 1971. My mother did not get her husband's body. My mother has passed 36 years since 1971. I was the youngest of her five sons-- one year old at that time. My elder brother was eighteen only. Now he is a professor of sociology at Rajshahi University . After a long time, I am thinking about my helpless father who sacrificed his life for the country silently, vigorously but his name was not enrolled as a freedom fighter in the list of freedom fighters prepared by the government. My father's offence? //////The Afghan army supported by Nato forces killed, wounded or arrested hundreds of rebels when they took back a town that had been occupied by the Taliban for almost a year, the defence ministry said yesterday. //////The UN climate chief warned yesterday that a deadlock between the United States and the European Union over emissions cuts threatened to derail talks aimed at launching negotiations for a new global warming pact. //////Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf is due to lift emergency rule on Saturday, but analysts say the move is unlikely to end the bitter controversies over his changes to the constitution. //////Most Pakistanis want to see President Pervez Musharraf out of power, according to the first poll released since the general declared a state of emergency last month, US media said Thursday. //////Leaders of the 27-nation European Union on Thursday signed a landmark treaty to revitalise decision-making after years of wrangling on how much power they are willing to hand over. //////Five people were killed and four others injured yesterday in a bomb attack on a train in northeastern India claimed by ethnic guerrillas. //////Iran and UN nuclear watchdog officials have ended their latest round of talks in Tehran on the controversial Iranian atomic drive, officials said yesterday. //////Iranian police yesterday killed several members of a Sunni militant armed group said to have been planning foreign-backed attacks in the restive southeast of Iran, state television said. //////Fresh fighting between government forces and Tamil rebels across Sri Lanka's embattled north has left at least 18 dead, the defence ministry said yesterday. //////At least seven people were killed and several others wounded Thursday in two suicide attacks at a military checkpost in restive southwestern Pakistan, officials said. //////At least 13 Somalis died yesterday, including 11 in almost simultaneous mortar blasts, as Mogadishu's civilian population continued to bear the brunt of relentless fighting. //////On the third day (December 12) of the weeklong Victory Day Celebration programme at Liberation War Museum, ////// -- an indigenous performing art form from the northern part of Bangladesh, dance, recitation, rendition of folk and patriotic songs were performed.//////My work is not symbolic.

Following an investigation, a decision was made to put on trial 195 'major war criminals' against whom strong evidence was said to be available.//////The mother of a thief talks big.

Along with the imprint of intelligence on that face there were also a ready smile of kindliness on the lips and a twinkle of good humour in the eyes. He never displayed any indifference to people around him. //////Like the rest of the world, Bangladesh is also seeing significant changes in the climate and feeling its impact in recent years. Changes in rainfall patterns, droughts in rainy seasons, late monsoon, recurring floods and warm winters are all obvious signs of these changes. The impact -- of these changes on the lives of the people and the economy, infrastructures, agriculture and food security are beginning to unfold, it seems, as evidenced by cyclone Sidr. //////Bangladesh is the lowest landmass of the extended Himalayan Drainage Ecosystem or Himalayan River Basin Ecosystem. The history of forestry in Bangladesh is a description of deforestation and degradation. The forests were exploited to supply raw materials for the ship and railway industries of the British colonial rulers (1757-1947) and generate revenue for the West Pakistan rulers (1947-71). In independent Bangladesh degradation continued.//////
