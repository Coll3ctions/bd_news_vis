The total number of the retarded, however, has been estimated by NGOs to be at least 10 percent of the population.//////NEPAL'S monarchy is finally set to make an exit. The decision by the country's major political parties to do away with it, in line with the long-standing demand of the people, most vigorously articulated by Maoists, is a development that cannot but satisfy the Nepalese population and people of the Saarc region as a whole. That sense of satisfaction of course has to do with some recent actions of King Gyanendra himself. Since taking charge of the throne following the murder of his brother, King Birendra and his family, in 2001, Gyanendra has not exactly endeared himself to the people of Nepal. But it was his seizure of absolute power, through which he sought to impose grave restrictions on politics, that proved to be the last straw. In the end, popular discontent made the monarch eat humble pie.//////NOW that the scandal of the stolen artefacts has come to pass, there are some heads which need to roll. Let there be no question here of who is to blame and who ought to be hauled in for questioning. When Adviser Ayub Quadri acknowledged in so many words that he bore responsibility for the theft of the two Vishnu artefacts from the cargo space at the Zia International Airport the other day, he, in effect, admitted before the country that it was a sloppy job that people under his supervision had done.//////AMONG the many dubious ideas that former United States President Ronald Reagan embraced, two were particularly dangerous. The first was that "a limited nuclear war" with the Soviet Union could be fought and won. The second held that the US could reliably secure itself against nuclear weapons by building a Star Wars-style ballistic missile defence (BMD). //////In the wake of Ershad's fall there was growing clamour for civil society, which gradually became louder in those days. Perhaps the bitter memory of protracted military rule, with its concomitant curtailment of basic rights, provided an incentive to civil society messiahs to articulate their demand. Yet, expressions like "civil norm" in our administration, "more civility" in the governance, and a vow for the firm founding of a "civil society" as voiced in some of the civil-military discourses rang an optimistic note for the nation's progress. //////Bangladesh's confidence-boosting victory in the Twenty20 fundraiser against a strong New Zealand XI at Hamilton has given a totally fresh complexion to tomorrow's opening ODI of the three-match series.

sudden, has started walking anti-clockwise. A hawk who never knew anything besides war and war of words suddenly turns into a peace-broker! This move, however, raises some doubts among the critics. Is this a groundwork for initiating another war in the Middle East? Is this the preparation of Israel and the US for the so-called pre-emptive aerial attack on Iran's nuclear sites? The fear remains high. It would be interesting to examine the following issues.//////While the government policy is to maximise the use of CNG for motorised transports like buses, trucks, taxis, auto-rickshaws and private cars, the numbers of CNG filling stations are few and far between. Long queues in filling stations for CNG is a major factor discouraging people from CNG conversion of their vehicles!//////Every Eid brings two types of feelings. The people who are well to do enjoy Eid in a truly festive mood. Preparation for the Eid goes on for a long time. On the other hand a gloomy, dismal situation is seen in the huts of the poor who pass their days throughout the year half fed/unfed. This situation made one of the philanthropists (a retired chairman of a sector corporation) of our village to do something for the poor that would make them enjoy Eid with rich foods like others in the village and thus making them feel that Eid comes to their doors also. With that idea in mind, the above-mentioned benevolent man came in to help the poor of our village, Balia, Hajigonj, on Eid day. The first step was collecting the numbers and names of the poor families of the village and then making packets containing shemai, sugar, milk, fine rice, mugdal, oil and in separate packets saree & lungi. These packets were distributed among the people listed earlier. Holding the packets they went home smiling. //////I am writing with reference to "Guns in America again (and again)," by Prof. Charles R. Larson (Dec, 24). //////I would welcome the Chief Election Commissioner's remark about political party registration. Political leaders talk about democracy but they did not practise it. Intra-party democracy is very important for strengthening the whole process, but it is absent in the parties. ////// The Eid-ul-Azha was celebrated much the same way it is every year. The rich enjoyed every bit of the occasion, while the poor observed the show of pomp.//////The article by your columnist Mr. A.N.M. Nurul Haque "Need for national austerity" was a timely one. //////It is proved that your government is doing a tremendous jobs to uproot corruption, but I would request you to pay a bit more attention to a case named Extortion by unknown phone callers which hasn't been stopped yet. Lots of people like me, who live abroad, are always worried about their families back home, because our families are threatened by the extortionists every day. They know that we are able to give them what they want. But why should we give them the money which we have earned by selling our blood? The question arises, is there anyone to stop them? Yes, the government can do that. But we are unfortunate enough till today as nothing has been done to rein in those hoodlums.//////The news of the haul of 10 truckloads of sophisticated firearms in Chittagong on 2nd April 2004 is still fresh in my mind. This incident had been the talk of the country for many days, I remember. Undoubtedly, this was the biggest arms haul in the history of our country.//////I was spending the summer of 1979 with my sister in Massachusetts for a break from my college.

In this situation the general people are suffering in the morning as well in the evening. //////Much has been said and written about the dilapidated condition of the Habiganj to Hiala and Hiala to Sujatpur road via Ikram, during the last three decades.//////Last week in your op-ed, Ms. Geeta Pasi wrote with the above heading on the commitment of the USA and its people to standing by the people of Bangladesh all the time. It surely is appreciated with the immediate reaction of the USA to send the Marines to assist our hurricane-affected people. The immediate need of those people is always fresh water and we had seen that after the 1991 natural disaster the US marines undertook 'Operation Sea Angel', doing an excellent job delivering purified water, foods and medicines. At that time the Marines did a great job and were highly appreciated although when they first arrived there was a lot of hesitation and suspicion as it is now. I personally feel they should be welcomed (as I did back in 1991) and appreciated for their humanitarian duty but of course it should be all very transparent. //////I have read the very perspicacious writing of the WFP Country Director under the above heading published on 15 December. //////The Tigers' triumph over the Kiwis has once again proved that in the shortest version of the game we really have a chance!//////A campaign has been going on in the country for the past several years to introduce a new type of broadcasting media, which is widely known as community radio, but it has so far met with cold shoulders from policy level people for no justified reason, except only for fear of loosening their grips over local matters and their monstrous power undercut. But it has been proved that there is a lot of central level inadequacy to cope with local matters such as education, natural disaster, cultural life and many other issues. The need for people to share their views and concerns through a local media and policy makers listening to their voices is becoming a crying need. //////Thailand's leading parties wooed possible partners for a coalition government on Monday, a day after allies of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra came out on top in the country's first election since he was ousted in a September 2006 military coup. //////Pope Benedict XVI lamented the "grim sound of arms" in the world's conflict zones Tuesday in a message of peace echoed by other Christian leaders as they celebrated Christmas. //////Sunny conditions on Monday helped road crews deal with the remnants of a blustery snowstorm that blacked out thousands of homes and businesses and was blamed for at least 22 traffic deaths in the upper Midwest. //////Turkish warplanes bombed three villages inside Iraq on Tuesday, targeting rebel bases in the Kurdish province of Dohuk, an official from the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga security force said. //////At least 13 Tamil Tiger rebels were killed on Christmas Eve in heavy clashes with Sri Lankan security forces in northern Sri Lanka, the defence ministry said Tuesday. //////General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who led the coup against Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra last year, vowed Tuesday to press ahead with corruption probes against him even if his allies form the next government. //////Iran plans to build 19 more nuclear power plants and will soon solicit international bids for their construction, a lawmaker said. //////China said yesterday that North Korea was unlikely to meet a year-end deadline to disable and declare all of its nuclear programmes, although the "majority" of work will be finished. //////Afghanistan has ordered a top European Union official and a United Nations staffer to leave the country for threatening national security, government and diplomatic officials said Tuesday. //////Narendra Modi, who led his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a historic third consecutive victory in Gujarat, was on Tuesday sworn in as chief minister for the third time at a grand ceremony here.//////Indian forces killed three suspected Islamic militants holed up in a mosque in Indian-controlled Kashmir, ending a two-day hostage standoff and sparking angry protests that injured dozens of people, police said yesterday. //////China and India wrapped up their first-ever joint military exercises on Tuesday with a drill in which they "wiped out" a group of supposed terrorists along their border, state press reported. //////At least 11 people died and hundreds on a religious pilgrimage were missing after an overcrowded bridge collapsed in western Nepal yesterday, police and officials said. //////The Hamas government has released the former director of Gaza's electric company, officials announced yesterday, six months after arresting him in a crackdown on political rivals in the wake of the Islamic militant group's takeover of the area.//////Fourteen sailors aboard a ship carrying nitric acid were missing Tuesday after their vessel was thought to have sunk in South Korea's southern waters.

Written by Nazneen Rahman, the play is directed by chief cameraman of Channel i, Zubaed Hossain Tufan.//////As we enter the 37th year of our independence, my mind races back to memories both bitter and sweet. I lost a brother, Shaheed Munier Chowdhury, one of the most illustrious sons of the soil, only 48 hours before we gained our independence. Although I feel occasionally bitter and sad, I must say I am no longer haunted by it. After all, 36 years have passed by and I have seen bigger tragedies taking place on this very independent soil. Human rights and justice continue to be accessible to a selected few, and as elusive as ever before to most. Economists are busy producing lofty statistics, whereas the poor continue to struggle for mere survival. //////I often see the phrases "no brokers please" or "brokers not welcome" appearing in certain "for sale" advertisements while browsing the classified section of our local newspapers.

The data within the space contained a brief description of the property, contact information of the seller, an asking price of Tk yyy, and the phrase "no brokers please." //////SAINT Martin has undoubtedly added beauty to tourism in Bangladesh. It has also brought variety in our environmental balance.

In 1999, CMAG suspended Pakistan from the Councils of the Commonwealth, only to re-admit it in 2004 when General Musharraf became a favourite in the so-called "war against terror." From 2004 until only last month, CMAG continued to naively tolerate Mr. Musharraf despite warnings from civil society groups, who, in the end, have been shown to be correct. //////With over 14,000 memorabilia, the Liberation War Museum, country's lone museum focusing on the Liberation War, is unable to display its huge collection due to shortage of space.//////The foundation that offered funds for the planned 10-storey Mathematics Building of Dhaka University has requested the university authorities to find an alternative site instead of the chosen one close to the Central Shaheed Minar.//////Light chill in the air, gentle sunlight in the afternoon and the thin layer of fog at dusk are the evident signs that winter has finally set in. //////Activities of Agyan Party, a gang of criminals who drug people before mugging them, marked an alarming rise in the port city despite tight security measures by the law enforcement agencies during the last few months.//////The army organised a programme titled Mobile blood bank programme at Matiranga Degree College to fight anaemia and malaria that frequently take lives at Matiranga upazila in Chittagong Hill Tracts.//////
