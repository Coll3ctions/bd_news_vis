A few days ago, Dr. Mridul Kanti Chakrabarty, a senior teacher at Dhaka University's department of music and a reputed scholar, allegedly died of negligence at Labaid Hospital. Suffering from dehydration, he was, as reports would have it, made to wait a pretty long time for treatment.

crash. I know Mishuk not only as a colleague for some time as a broadcast journalist, but as one of the talented sons of Shaheed Professor Munier Chowdhury- my dearest teacher of Dhaka University. When I started teaching electronic journalism as a part-time teacher at the Mass Communication and Journalism Department of Dhaka University, I found him as a colleague. Mishuk took the initiative to bring some essential tools, particularly one editing machine and a video camera. However, he left the university to join Ekushey TV, which truly was his field with all his dynamism and great diversity.//////Secondary schools teachers have spacious drawing rooms in their houses to accommodate a big number of students for private coaching. These drawing rooms are usually furnished with high and low benches, a chair and even with a blackboard hanging on the wall! A causal visitor will surely mistake such a drawing room for a classroom of a school! Coaching goes on batch by batch in the morning and after the school hours. The agile teacher cleverly prepares a list of probable questions of the subjects he teaches. He also prepares a list of probable questions of all other major subjects in a close exam-oriented collaboration with his colleagues who are also engaged in similar coaching business! They believe in the philosophy of honest reciprocity for the success of their business! The youngsters are asked only to memorize the answers and they are given cent percent assurance of a smooth class promotion in the most shortcut way! Thus, a solid foundation is being laid for our future rural citizenry!//////Undoubtedly, reckless driving is the main cause of road accidents in our country. Drivers of all types of transports compete for overtaking one another. The drivers enjoy this lethal racing game on city roads and also on highways. Very often we can see in the highways that during overtaking each other, no passage is left in the right side of the road for the vehicles coming from opposite direction. Many head-on collisions between two transports are happening for this reason. Interestingly, some passengers on board encourage the drivers to win the race instead of abstaining them from it.Only mindful and responsible driving can save many lives. If the drivers of all types of vehicles are considerate to their colleagues working in other vehicles, it really can reduce road accidents significantly. //////Some losses can never be compensated. The loss of Abid, a promising singer of our country, is one. Every year accidents happen when tourists visit the Cox's Bazar sea beach. More than fifty people have died in the quicksand of the beach during the last fifteen years. Only 21 coast guards are there to provide security to the visitors. Is it enough to ensure proper safety when accidents are taking place quite frequently? Lack of awareness of the tourists is highly criticized after every accident takes place. But isn't it the duty of the authorities too to make tourists aware?//////Some days ago, a leading daily reported that one of our renowned pharmaceutical companies, Beximco pharma, has achieved the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certificate for maintaining proper quality of medicines and efficiency in dealing with medicine manufacturing. Undoubtedly, it is a great achievement. Such kind of accomplishment will revive the export condition of our drugs to the foreign countries. As drug industry is one of the top rated industries in our country, such accomplishment will speed up the spirit of other sectors to excel in their performance. Hats off to Beximco Pharma!//////I have read with interest the recent article published by the Economist (July 30th August 5th) and find our Government's reaction somewhat exaggerated. The analysis had more to do with India's approach to fast tracking its good neighbourly relations than having a dig at Bangladesh's political situation. For those of us familiar with the Economist, the observations were routine and in line with previous write-ups. To the Government's credit it refrained from making the elementary mistake of deleting sections of the article or, unthinkably, banning the issue. For the depth of its analysis, fluidity of presentation and uncanny knack to predict the future the Economist has come to be a must read for so many government functionaries and policymakers. It spotted Obama way before he became a threat to Hilary and in recent times has heaped praise on the Arab Spring arguing that its inherent democratic strength far outweighs the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism. Following on from its Leader, it criticized India for its over-reliance on the Awami League and shunning meetings with the BNP. For its part the Awami League must therefore demonstrate its maturity in engaging in bi-partisan politics. The Awami League would do well to concentrate on core issues: improving the lot of the poor, drastic steps to improve infrastructure (some achievements like reduction in infant mortality rates and rise in agricultural output are praiseworthy but more needs to be done), seen to be tolerant and ensuring justice on a level playing field. It will then be a matter of time before the Economist says less about this beggar infested city of Dhaka and more about the Emerging Tiger of South Asia. Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful!//////No two people are similar. Foreign Minister Dipu Moni is right that the family of Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia are different in respect of education and lifestyle. The Economist's report did not point to this difference. The recent happenings across the country prove that people are reeling under government's misrule: Innocent students like Kader and Limon are subjected to barbarous treatment at the hands of police who are supposed to protect innocent people. Things have come to such a pass that Government's sweet will rather than the rule of law determines every affair of the state. At the face of such atrocities media from home and abroad are doing their commendable job of warning the government but the government seems to be incorrigible and unheeded to all those calls for justice and respectability. People do not bother whether the 2008 election was masterminded by India, what they want is respectable living in peace and security. People seem to be waiting patiently for the government to be proactive and return to sense.//////Commerce Minister Faruq Khan, on August 4, asked people to eat less in order to avoid problems like adulteration and price hike of food items. It is so preposterous that we do not know whether to laugh or cry. It is the government's duty to rectify these problems. How could commerce minister tell people to cut down on their food intake?//////Transport boss high on mega projects, low on road repair//////Bomb attacks killed 25 people in Afghanistan yesterday, ripping through a minibus packed with civilians and targeting a US-run base in the east bordering Pakistan, officials said.//////Detained Indian anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare has agreed to a police offer which will permit him to go on hunger strike in a park for 15 days, his aide says.//////A case was filed in a Bihar court yesterday against social activists Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal for allegedly insulting the national flag during a reality television show, officials said.//////A spokesman for India's ruling party has suggested the United States might have a role in the wave of anti-corruption protests posing a growing challenge to the government.//////Gunmen killed seven people in southern Israel yesterday in attacks along the Egyptian border and Israel responded with an air strike in the Gaza Strip that killed six Palestinians, including the leaders of a group it blamed for the violence.//////At least 31 people have been killed in 24 hours of political violence in Pakistan's southern city of Karachi.//////US Vice President Joe Biden waxed glowingly about China's vice president yesterday at the start of a five-day visit that will give them some serious bonding time.//////Leaders of Nepal's two largest parties met yesterday but failed to reach agreement on who should lead the next government, officials said.//////British police made a new arrest yesterday in the country's tabloid phone hacking scandal, amid fresh scrutiny of Rupert Murdoch's media empire after newly disclosed documents appeared to contradict testimony his son and top aide gave to UK lawmakers.//////Pakistan's military says it can bring the notorious Haqqani militant network, considered one of the most lethal threats against US-led coalition troops in Afghanistan, to the negotiation table.//////Philippine President Benigno Aquino will visit China this month in an effort to deepen trade ties despite an increasingly bitter row over rival claims to the South China Sea, officials said yesterday.//////Myanmar's new government yesterday called for peace talks with armed separatists along its borders with Thailand and China, the latest in a series of conciliatory gestures towards long-time opponents of the former military regime.//////Russia was attempting to locate its major new telecommunications satellite yesterday just hours after launch in what could be another serious mishap for its space industry.//////Vietnam is battling to control an unusually severe outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease that has killed 81 children this year and infected tens of thousands more, health officials said yesterday.//////Turkish aircraft have attacked 60 sites in northern Iraq used as bases by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in a "successful" operation, military headquarters said in a statement.//////The United Nations food agency called yesterday for long-term aid for farmers in the Horn of Africa, saying constant crises in the region should shame the world.//////India's upper house of parliament impeached a High Court justice on corruption charges yesterday, against a backdrop of mass anti-graft protests across the country.//////Actor-reciter Jayanta Chattopadhyay has known Tareque Masud closely, and worked with him, for nearly three decades. Starting with voice-over for Adam Surat (a documentary on artist SM Sultan -- one of Masud's earliest works), Chattopadhyay acted in Matir Moina, Ontorjatra and Runway. The actor was cast in Kagojer Phool which was to be Masud's next film. Chattopadhyay is clearly one of the few who can provide an in-depth insight into the recently deceased filmmaker's working method. //////Cultural organisations in Dhaka are holding programmes to pay tribute to the recently deceased filmmaker Tareque Masud, cinematographer and CEO of ATN News Mishuk Munier and folk researcher Dr. Mridulkanti Chakrobarty.//////Banglavision will telecast a folk music programme titled Baul Mon on the third day of Eid-ul-Fitr at 5:15pm.

The 45-minute documentary, titled Himalayan Meltdown, has been co-produced by UNDP and Arrowhead Films.//////American politician Robert Kennedy had defined tragedy before he fell prey to one himself in a Los Angeles hotel where an assassin named Sirhan Sirhan shot him to death in 1968. He said tragedy was a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which to live. Little did he know that within three years after his death, a nation would be born to adopt his advice with a reverse twist. It would choose not to learn from its tragedies but to repeat them again and again. //////It was 8am on Saturday, August 6, here in Singapore when news hit the wires that the credit ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, had downgraded the long-term rating of the United States government from AAA to AA+. The press release went on to say that the decision reflected that "the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges." //////Does it have the resonance of a Bengali proverb: When an elephant is stuck in a mud-pool, even a frog flicks a kick at it? Evo Molares, President of Bolivia, a socialist country, back from a recent trip to Beijing has said it, more perhaps in sarcasm than in jest: China would be so powerful economically that it could one day "colonise the USA." A hyperbole, yes; but it is perhaps already nearing that state of affairs, if we can use a figure of speech.//////Let's be absolutely clear from the outset, getting law and order back on the streets of London is the first priority. So getting 10,000 extra police appears to have done this immediately. And as post mortems begin on the possible reasons for eruption of lawlessness on this scale, there is not, and can never be, any justification for human beings threatening and ultimately destroying the lives of those who live beside them, particularly amongst London's varied communities. //////Burgos is a medium-size historical town situated a little over two hundred kilometres north of Madrid, the capital of Spain. The gently rolling hills, known as the Sierra de Atapuerca (Unesco World Heritage Site), lie a few kilometres east of Burgos in the north-eastern corner of the Castilian plateau.//////Bangladesh's first complete mobile financial services provider, bKash Ltd, a BRAC Bank subsidiary, launched its operations on July 21.
