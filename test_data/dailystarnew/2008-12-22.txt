To be specific, she barely escaped death on 21 August, 2004 when 22 people had lost their lives in a grenade attack on an AL political meeting. Even earlier, Huji had reportedly plotted to kill her during her visit to Tungipara. This time around the security and intelligence agencies of the country informed Sheikh Hasina of a possible attack on her life by Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji) and Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). In another report it has been said that a six-member suicide squad of Huji has been trained by foreign experts to eliminate Sheikh Hasina, and that both Huji and JMB have scores to settle with the BNP as well for banning the outfits following the countrywide series bomb blasts in 2005. //////IT is unbelievable but true that the traffic control system and the main aid that is supposed to help in the efficient movement of traffic on the streets of Dhaka, the traffic signals, are really a part of the problem, rather than being a solution. //////EVEN as D-day in the electoral battle approaches, and the nation impatiently awaits its tryst with elusive democracy, we confront, with a measure of trepidation the BNP's bluster of an amorphous conspiracy to skittle the election -- although the party supreme Madam Zia does not elaborate how. //////DURING the sixty hours of unabated terrorism in Mumbai, the one group that was almost as much in demand as security forces was journalists. With media desperate to fill space or time, a journalist could pass off any amount of gibberish as on-the-spot wisdom. //////TALIBAN has blown up over 300 containers and trucks carrying supplies for western troops in Afghanistan.

election.//////Local Awami League (AL) leader Sabber Ahmed died of cardiac arrest immediately after delivering his speech from a stage built for campaigning yesterday. //////Bengalis have always been renowned for their astute political conscience and activism. During the Raj, Bengalis formed the backbone of the political and cultural establishment that led the British to leave the subcontinent. And then came the Pakistan era where politicians like Sher-e-Bangla, Maulana Bhashani, Suhrawardy and the great Bangabandhu had successfully challenged the might of an establishment made up of aristocrats, bureaucrats and a powerful military. The Bengalis founded their own nation as a people's state that enshrined democracy and secularism as fundamental principles. //////14th December is a red-letter day in the history of Bengali nation. Thirty-seven years ago on this very day the Bengali intellectuals were brutally tortured and killed by Al-Badr, Al-Shams killers who were the agents of Pakistani occupation forces. Their barbaric and heinous atrocities are comparable only with the Nazi killing of Jews during the World War II. It is a matter of great regret that these war criminals are not yet tried. It is the unequivocal demand of the people that these anti liberation forces be brought to justice without wasting any time. //////In a study of "The 2008 World Factbook", it has been revealed that the total population of this country is 150,448,339 (July 2007 est.). But it is quite insightful to see that about 63.4 % of this country's total population is in between the age of 15 to 64 years. This larger portion of people could be an asset for this country. But because of unemployment, they are in danger of being a burden on the economy.//////Your staff correspondent's front-page report on Al's manifesto on 12th December appears reasonably pragmatic. However, completing it in their term of office, should they win, seems difficult. And if they are replaced by their arch-enemy BNP, come next election, then even the realistic goal of 5,000MW power by 2011 will disappear. The real life example is there when even their MoU for power plant was summarily cancelled in a very foolish manner, as soon as they were succeeded by the BNP. To top it, after that the BNP could not even add 1MW of power when they were in office.//////Election observers play an important role during election and various parties related to the field are greatly served by it. In this regard, FEMA has always carried out the job sincerely from the very beginning. But unfortunately the EC has banned the organisation from observing the polls, accusing its president of involvement in politics. //////Sound pollution has reached an alarming stage. Experts have warned that excessive noise can lead to deafness and create health problems, which can do irreparable damage to humans.//////The Election Commission appears to be feeble. The simple answer is-- stand on your feet and take a very rational and befitting decision regarding the constituencies where the court decision might jeopardize the election. If I were the chief election commissioner, I would immediately reschedule those elections without disturbing the election of the entire country. This is the most logical and legally acceptable solution under the present circumstances. I hope the Election Commission will take this decision.//////That FEMA has not been allowed to observe the upcoming election really stunned me. The Election Commission has rejected the registration of FEMA on the ground of its president's connection with politics. But it is well known to all that he was associated with politics for a short period of time and resigned from politics more than one and a half year back.//////May I point out that Mr Mohiuddin Ahmed included several inaccuracies in his letter of appreciation to Sayeeda Jagirdar in the letter column of The Daily Star of November 12, 2008.//////India was divided into two separate independent states under the 'Two nations theory i) India for the Hindus and ii) Pakistan for the Muslims.//////We are an overcrowded nation, [and urban society]; therefore it is not unusual that we have surplus 'leaders' -- no unemployment at the top levels of the society. Labelling is no problem these days. There are too many political parties [to have a piece of the pie]: and too many mass media organs [daily newspapers and TV and radio channels]. Why corruption is so popular? The antidote: extremist Muslims, using a wide range of cosmetic effects for social display [dress, mannerism, poise, motivations.....]. //////Mr Obama has been elected (or selected by Pentagon, FBI, Republican -- Democrat highest ups, limited topmost people in the USA) as the 44th president of the USA. It is definitely creditable, especially for a Black to be elected as President of the USA. In fact, it is much more creditable if he has been selected by the tops of the USA as selection is totally on complex hard calculation, and no emotion at all.//////President Bush's final trip to Iraq to say goodbye may not have been fairly the fond farewell he had in mind. Not everyone was greeting Bush as a great knight in shining armour during his secret visit. One Iraqi journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi decided to hurl his shoes at the Decider during a joint press conference Bush was holding with Iraqi Premier Nouri al Maliki. The surprise visit was planned to commemorate a security pact between the U.S. and the Iraqi government. But, at the end of the day, the president wound up having to dodge a pair of shoes thrown at him. This brave journalist has acted on behalf of billions of people worldwide. It is an irony that Bush wanted to leave office with a bang as the liberator of Iraq has to slink into Iraq and hide behind the Green Zone. On top of that he got a sent-off with a shoe!//////It happens during the start of Ramadan and celebration of two Eids. Some people in Bangladesh start fasting two days earlier and celebrate Eid-ul -Fitr and Eid -ul-Azha, as claimed by them, keeping similitude with Saudi Arabia or international moon sighting committee also two days earlier. They have no respect for or faith on our own government decision and moon sighting committee. //////Street violence raged into a third week in Athens as protests sparked by the fatal shooting of a teenager fused with political tension hours from the Greek parliament's budget vote yesterday.//////Israel threatened yesterday to launch a major offensive against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip as violence simmered around the impoverished territory days after the end of a truce with the Islamists.//////Desperate to win new allies ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP-led NDA has resigned to its fate of being 'friendless' in key Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh but is banking on post-poll allies and a new strategy for Uttar Pradesh.//////Tamil Tiger rebels killed 60 Sri Lankan troops advancing toward their de facto capital, a pro-rebel report said, but the government denied yesterday that many soldiers had died.//////Guests trapped in a Mumbai hotel seized by gunmen last month have told the BBC they were given instructions by police that may have led to more people dying.//////The top US military officer said Saturday that the Pentagon could double the number of American forces in Afghanistan by next summer to 60,000 the largest estimate of potential reinforcements ever publicly suggested.//////Saudi Arabia has denied it foiled an al-Qaeda attack on this year's hajj, rejecting a US report that it had advance intelligence of a plot against Mecca pilgrims, a newspaper reported yesterday.//////Belgium's monarch on Saturday held new meetings with political party leaders in a bid to find a transitional government willing to try to lead the country away from a new political crisis.//////Thai Premier Abhisit Vejjajiva's newly unveiled cabinet set to work yesterday on building reconciliation and reviving the economy, despite the threat of protests over some appointments.//////The deposed president of the desert-encircled African nation of Mauritania was set free Sunday after 4 1/2 months under house arrest.//////India is likely to sign a civil nuclear cooperation pact with Kazakhstan next month, to make it the fourth country to sign such an agreement with New Delhi, official sources said.//////Pakistani fighter jets yesterday attacked suspected Taliban and al-Qaeda positions in a lawless tribal area on the border with Afghanistan, killing four militants, an official said.//////Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan have been ranked among the 50 most powerful people in the world by the US-based magazine 'Newsweek' in a list topped by President-elect Barack Obama. //////The death toll from a massive fire that gutted a major shopping mall in the Pakistani garrison city of Rawalpindi has risen to 10, with six others still missing, officials said yesterday.//////The head of the Swedish Academy, which each year awards the prestigious Nobel Literature Prize will step down in June after 10 years in the post, he announced at the body's annual year-end gathering.//////An Iranian diplomat kidnapped last month in Pakistan is alive, Tehran's ambassador to Islamabad was quoted by a newspaper as saying yesterday.//////Twelve staff at a prominent newspaper and magazine publisher were injured on Sunday when they were attacked by dozens of Maoist activists angered by critical coverage, an editor said.//////To reach a wider group of readers and to encourage interaction between little magazine activists, a three-day little magazine fair was held at the Aziz Cooperative Super Market, starting from December 18.

Five promising Tagore and Nazrul singers performed at the function. //////POLLING is not widely conducted in Bangladesh, although conjectures and opinions abound as a national pastime in every nook and corner of the country about the ever-changing election winds. While polls are not crystal balls from which a definitive picture of the ultimate outcome is expected, they can provide better insights than mere speculations if properly conducted. //////POLITICAL thinkers are of the view that the role of women in the 9th parliament will be greater than before. This could be a reality because around 40 women candidates are contesting in the election. Justifying their role in national politics and the decision making process is really a great challenge for the women in Bangladesh. //////ONE multinational bank working in Bangladesh assures the customer by saying that they always respect the local language though they are originated in an alien country. They are doing that because they are operating in different countries and doing business with local people. It means that local values get immense importance in their business strategies. //////ONE of my workmates just became a father. He's in a state of shock.
