As pointed out in national media, never have so many directors been appointed in these banks as has been during the tenure of the present government. The problem is that most of these directors have no inkling as to how a bank operates. Such appointments have opened the flood gates to sanctioning unworthy loans based on political considerations rather than due banking procedures. It is little wonder that most state-owned banks are facing a rating crisis.//////Star Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan was bought for a mammoth 365,000 dollars by Dhaka Gladiators as he hogged the spotlight during the players' auction of the second edition of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) T20.//////The bidding prices of the local players during the auction of the second edition of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), till a certain extent, did overshadow the international players.

December, deeply moved me; for our kindness extended to the mother of a soldier who died fighting for the birth of Bangladesh! I also thank our top authorities for fulfilling the cherished desire of a grieving mother. The writer of the piece has surely earned the heart-felt good wishes and gratitude of the elderly mourning mother who finally got peace of mind, by praying for the salvation of her son's departed soul at Gangasagar, Bangladesh, where Ekka (the Falcon) made the ultimate sacrifice for winning our freedom!//////We are still grieving for those kids who died in the shootout at Sandy Hook Elementary School at Newtown in Connecticut, USA. Adam Lanza nipped 20 innocent lives in their buds and also killed 6 adults including teachers of the school.//////The Tigers played well against the West Indies and they really deserve to be praised for their individual performance. I have always believed that it is from criticism that one always learns more. In the only T20 match played against the West Indies, Bangladesh lost by only 18 runs. First of all, I would like to commend them for how valiantly they chased a steep target set by the West Indians and also the fact that no one threw away their wickets needlessly. Secondly, I think that running between the wickets was very poor. They relied too much on hitting boundaries which were not coming easily; but when it came to running between the wickets, they ran very slowly. They took singles when they could have easily taken 2 or 3 runs if they had run faster. I firmly believe they could easily make 18 more runs if they ran faster. Many of the shots played were fielded near the boundary and there was ample time to take a second run but they did not do so. I feel that an improvement in this sector would enable our players to pile on more runs and have a better-looking scorecard.//////British soldiers were spending Christmas Eve 1914 on a French battlefield during World War I. After four months of fighting, over a million men had perished in the bloody conflict. The bodies of dead soldiers were scattered between the trenches of the opposing armies. It was in the middle of a freezing battlefield in France, that a miracle occurred! British troops watched in amazement as candle-lit trees appeared above the German trenches. From the German parapet, a rich baritone voice had begun to sing a song I remember my German nurse singing to me ... the grave and tender voice rose out of the frozen mist. It was all so strange ... like being in another world, a young British soldier wrote in his diary. Silent Night, Holy Night. All is calm. All is bright. //////When people all over the country were still in shock after the brutal murder of Bishwajit, another drama unfolded. Top terrorist Bikash Kumar Biswas was released from Kashimpur jail under strict secrecy. It has been reported that it was done by a special order from the home ministry. //////It is heartening that prime minister Sheikh Hasina is communicating with the common citizens by sending a short message of greetings on the Victory Day, 2012. In her message, the PM sought continuous cooperation of the people for the betterment of the country and its people. This message of greetings reflects the PM's goodwill which definitely deserves appreciation. Nowadays, many world leaders are communicating with their people using digital facilities (sms, e-mail, etc.) for reducing the gap between government and citizens. I sincerely hope that our esteemed prime minister will work towards resolving the ongoing political crisis for strengthening democracy in Bangladesh.//////The whole world - including all the NGOs, charities and government agencies active in this dear country and millions of Bangladeshis themselves - want Bangladesh to be able to run its own affairs independently. Before I came here, in 1999, I taught schoolchildren about aid to poor countries and helped an international charity by door-to-door collections and by shaking tins outside supermarkets. When 'Bangladesh' is mentioned, hands go into pockets! Hence, the frustration at how responsibility for problems is ignored or avoided by blaming 'conspiracies', 'sabotage' and the 'forces of evil'. Now, it seems the terrible garment factory fire was because FOREIGN CUSTOMERS signed contracts with the owners to produce goods at a price too low for the 'poor owners' to afford the necessary safety requirements! Whose fault was THAT? Now, some countries are being told to change trading arrangements to give greater priority to 'poor Bangladesh' .... Yet the fact is that Bangladesh is rolling in money! The Bangladesh Bank declared that there are 23,212 multi-millionaires in Bangladesh and the National Board of Revenue say that the number of people paying more than 100,000 taka as personal income tax in the 2011-2012 taxation year did not go over a thousand! //////I have deep sympathy for the victims of the school killings in Newtown, Connecticut. However, I feel greater sympathy for those Afghan families that are butchered in silence by American drones. They are not mourned by the world, nor even noticed by the media. Yet their lives are equally valuable. The same blood flows in their veins and the same flesh adorns their skeletons. But to the US, if they are anything at all, they are mere statistics. //////We learnt from a report of this daily recently that leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia urged the garment factory owners, their trade body, the government, the financial institutions and the buyers in the closing ceremony of the Batexpo-2012 to ensure compliance at the factories to keep the sector competitive in the global market. She also added, Not the machines, the workers behind the machines are the lifeline of the sector. Justice cannot be ensured without giving importance to their life, safety and better working conditions. Her comments came in the wake of a deadly fire at Tazreen Fashions that killed at least 112 workers last month.//////Full verdict on 7th amendment released//////Violence in the Syria conflict has become openly sectarian and threatens whole communities, UN investigators reported yesterday following a visit to the region.//////The scandal over the Benghazi attack grew Wednesday as a top State Department official resigned and three others were suspended when a probe uncovered major security failures and mismanagement.//////Despite an outpouring of anger at a student's gang-rape, observers say misogyny remains widespread in India where sex assaults are often dismissed as "teasing" and victims find themselves blamed for attacks.//////Narendra Modi yesterday performed a hat-trick retaining power for the third time in Indian state of Gujarat and propelled himself as a strong contender in the Indian prime ministerial race in 2014 while Congress ousted BJP from office in Himachal Pradesh.//////Israel has approved plans to build 523 homes in the West Bank, Jewish settlers said yesterday, in the first step towards a new settlement "city" that drew furious condemnation from the Palestinians.//////President Barack Obama put ending an "epidemic" of gun violence at the top of his second term agenda Wednesday, denying he was "on vacation" on the issue before last week's school massacre.//////An alliance of Pakistani clerics will hold demonstrations across the country against the killings of polio eradication campaign workers, leaders said yesterday, as the death toll from attacks this week rose to nine.//////The UN tribunal for Rwanda yesterday handed a 35-year jail term to a former minister found guilty of genocide, in the court's final trial ruling.//////Egypt's new public prosecutor yesterday retracted an offer to resign he made on Monday following protests about his appointment, Egyptian media report.//////India yesterday successfully test-fired its indigenously developed nuclear capable Prithvi-II missile with a strike range of 350 km from a test range at Chandipur near.//////Flash floods have killed at least 25 people in Sri Lanka and left more than a quarter of a million marooned in their homes, disaster officials said yesterday.//////A new Facebook page dedicated to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quickly attracting supporters and comments on Wednesday, despite questions about its authenticity.//////President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi has dramatically restructured Yemen's military to curb the influence of those linked to toppled strongman Abdullah Ali Saleh with the strong backing of Yemen's Gulf neighbours.//////The elegant Alif Laila, nicknamed Kumkum, in a maroon Jamdani took the stage with her sitar on the last day of the Bengal ITC-SRA Classical Music Festival in Dhaka.

Truth and falsehood lit up in full glare over the shocking death of a young man who was guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The media insisted that the killers were members of the student wing of the ruling party. The home minister denied, other party leaders protested and the Prime Minister's Office sanctioned that nothing could be farther from the truth. An entire nation watched in dazed stupor as the authorities behaved like an ostrich in their state of denial and buried their heads in the sand.//////On December 16, while we were celebrating the 41st anniversary of our Victory Day, the people of Japan went to the poling booths, voting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) back to power just in three years.//////Incurable cynics and their audience have had enough doom and gloom predic-tions. It maybe difficult for them to see beyond the hovering clouds or a gathering storm. But as a sage said: "What cannot be seen is present." This is true about a whole lot of things happening beyond our horizon of knowledge, or shall we say, a sum-total of news and views coming our way.//////The answer to the question above is both "yes" and "no" for a diabolical problem like climate change. This time also, the Eighteenth Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP18) continued into an extra day. The decreased number of participants shows that COPs are losing the luster and excitement they once enjoyed. The "Doha Climate Gateway," as proudly dubbed at the closing by the Qatari President of the COP, does not seem to befit the pompous structure of the National Convention Center. Four items were key deliverables in Doha -- operationalising the second commitment period (SCP) of the Kyoto Protocol (KP), climate finance, the means to address loss and damage from climate change, and operationalising institutional arrangements like the Standing Committee on Finance and the Green Climate Fund.//////It should perhaps come as no surprise given the skullduggery, brinkmanship, and distrust colouring relations between South Asia's three largest nations -- India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh -- that arguably the greatest proponent of peace and unity among its leaders -- former Indian premier Inderjit Kumar Gujral, who passed away in Haryana on Thursday -- lasted barely a year as prime minister of its most important nation. The end of his premiership in April 1998 was a precursor to the deadly Kargil conflict soon after, when India and Pakistan fought a brief war along the front in Kashmir that both sides claim to have won. In truth, neither side could point to enough tangible, or even intangible, gains that in their sum could be said to constitute a victory.//////Ensuring quality services for safe motherhood was the theme for the Safe Motherhood Day celebrated in 2012.
