Poverty, over-population, over exploitation of scanty natural resources, noxious emissions and toxic effluents from factories and smoke-belching vehicles, coupled with natural disasters, are the major causes of environmental degradation in the country. //////IT sounds almost like a thriller, but with a sad tone. A man thought for quite long to be the oldest living male soul in Japanese capital had suddenly disappeared. The man, 111 years old Sogen Kato, was living in Tokyo's Adachi ward with his relatives and had been drawing pension and other benefits on a regular basis. Moreover, when his wife died in 2004, family pension benefits totaling to more than $100,000 were paid to him.

Inamur Rahim in Friday pyjama/panjabi. His face lights up when he sees me as does mine and we embrace in a bear hug. Capt. Inam is a ship's captain, a Master Mariner who was once a senior bureaucrat with the government. Our acquaintance goes back two and a half decades. He is retired and I know he is financially well off, living in his own nice apartment on the same high rise building where we have also bought commercial space to house our offices, modified to accommodate two bedrooms where we stay while in Chittagong. We both have married daughters and his son has just graduated from a private university in Dhaka; my son graduated in 2007 from University of California, Irvine, and works for Western Digital on an H1B visa that he won in a lottery. Our son married in December 2009 and Capt. Inam is looking for a suitable bride for his son.//////Remember I had said I would get back to you?

He advised people not to be panicked, to report immediately and take immediate treatment if such condition arises further.//////IN recent Washington nuclear security conference, held on April of this year, US President Barack Obama stated that every county in the world should sign the international Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), including Israel. Though Israel has signed the treaty, but its signature has yet to be ratified. Not only this recent remark of Obama, but also experts from both outside and inside Israel stressed that this is the high time for Israel to put an end to its policy of ambiguity and unveil its nuclear activities. //////AT an event in the White House marking the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, President Obama defended the right of the Muslims to build a 13 storey cultural center and a mosque to be named Cordoba House at a stone's throw from Ground Zero. Ever since the news of this project became known, various groups and politicians have vehemently opposed the project. Sarah Palin called the project a stab in the heart of the families of the victims of 9/11. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich called the project an assertion of Islamist triumphalism. One protester's billboard read: Islam builds mosque at site of their conquests.//////Myanmar's military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), recently announced that elections will be held in Myanmar on November 7, 2010. As expected, the announcement has invited speculations (often marred by scepticism) about the motives of the junta. There have also been questions raised about the way elections are going to be held; for instance how democratic, non-partisan and fair or otherwise they will be? The stand taken by countries on this issue is also quite on expected lines. For one, the US State Department and European Union member countries and the United Kingdom have questioned the 'inclusiveness and credibility' of the elections and its entire process, while ASEAN member countries are more or less positive and appreciative of the junta on the issue. //////Everyone should go back to nature every once in a while. For Sourav Mahmud, though, nature is part of the everyday pattern of life. Which is why he moves from one spot in the country to another, to rediscover all those dimensions of nature that have consistently enriched Bangladesh's environment. Mahmud is young. The brutal frankness these days is that you do not expect much of the enterprising from the young, for reasons that have to do with urbanisation, indeed that have to do with the relative ease that has come into the conduct of life through means of technology.//////ONE hears the story of an enchanting land comprising people who are a world unto themselves in terms of ways of living their lives, their demeanour, emotional outbursts, moral standards set by themselves, however wide the deviations might be from the edicts of religion entailing double standards and many others. A reader keeps on peeling off layer after layer of darkness only to discover a nadir of darkness sown in their character as reflected particularly in their private lives unknown to the world outside. One common factor that binds all such people in all such families is that they are all 'obscenely rich'; their men are free to do as they like while women as lesser beings are ruled by them and are the arbiters of their fate. There is dissatisfaction, resentment, fear and sorrow among the womenfolk but all in a hush-hush way. Then the reader is startled coming face to face with a rebel, a belligerent young woman who is determined to fight tooth and nail for her freedom as a human being, knowing full well the price she will have to pay for it. In other words, Amira, the protagonist, later known as Jenna Sorrel in America, risks her life along with her baby son to win freedom. //////"Impatience with theories, ideas --- the entire practice and process of abstract thought --- is perhaps the most common manifestation of anti-intellectualism throughout American popular culture and average Americans' day-to-day lives. Therefore, it should be no surprise when that attitude is found even in magazine coverage of higher education --- the one institution in which Americans have expected (not to say preferred) and perhaps even tolerated this core requirement of intellectual activity. Although these lines are to be found towards the end of an absorbing book, in a chapter (6) pertinently titled Unreflective Instrumentalism, Hedonism, Sexism, and Age Discrimination, they encapsulate the general drift of ////// And the author, while ending the previous chapter (5), entitled Populist Anti-Elitism and Higher Education, bemoans such a state of affairs thus: However, the needs and opportunities in the United States in the areas of arts, sciences, government, journalism, retail politics, and the overall American culture and American society --- even the complexity of day-to-day life for the average citizen --- suggest that more citizens, not fewer, should be learning, and not only a finite amount for a degree, but learning more and more over a longer period of time. Unfortunately, American anti-intellectualism makes the idea of even necessary, let alone optional, lifelong learning a tough sell.//////Swedish linguist Sven Ohman (1936-2008) knew differently, and it would be even harder to imagine why he believed that Noam Chomsky (b. 1928--) has never been a linguist. It is something hard to believe for anyone who is familiar with the name of Chomsky and the reputation it carries. Formerly an Uppsala University professor of linguistics, Sven Ohman in his book, The Essence of Language: A Philosophical Problem, has successfully established his observations and findings denying Chomsky's position as a linguist.//////
