BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia last night said she is ready to sit with Awami League (AL) President Sheikh Hasina and discuss how to promote fair competition in politics and do away with the culture of mudslinging.//////Reunification of splintered BNP and the party's much awaited electoral dialogue with the Election Commission (EC) and the government seem only a matter of time as its standing committee, the highest policymaking forum, meets today under the leadership of its just released Chairperson Khaleda Zia.//////Abdul Jalil was not allowed to be back as Awami League (AL) general secretary due mainly to his fierce criticism of party President Sheikh Hasina in the mercy petition to the caretaker government in July last year, AL sources said.//////Bangladesh Embassy in Riyadh confirmed Saudi Arabia's official ban on issuing visas to Bangladeshis seeking employment in households and in the agricultural sector.//////Eminent educationists say the record growth in percentage of pass and GPA-5 achievers in this year's HSC examinations does not necessarily reflect qualitative improvement of education in the country. //////Aman production in four northern districts may fall 1,33,000 metric tons short of their targets due to floods and waterlogging, officials said.//////Water-borne diseases marked rise in the flood-hit districts as overall flood situation continued to improve yesterday.//////Leaders and activists of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, student wing of BNP, assaulted three journalists and at least 10 students of department of mass communication and journalism of Dhaka University (DU) early yesterday.//////Rajshahi Medical College (RMC) was yesterday declared closed until October 10 following a clash between the activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) on Thursday night.//////Unscrupulous greed of some Patuakhali fishermen for quick bucks is endangering the local people, livestock and aquatic resources as they are using insecticides in the canals of coastal areas for increasing the volume of their catches. //////Former prime minister Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman, now out on bail, reached London for treatment yesterday afternoon. //////Years of neglect has remodelled most the roads of Senpara Parbata in Mirpur Section 10 with huge bumps and potholes, bringing about everyday misery for the residents of the neighbourhood. //////Fazle Hasan Abed, founder and chairperson of Brac, has been selected for this year's David Rockefeller Bridging Leadership Award in recognition of his contribution to addressing poverty and equity.//////Prices of daily essentials did not fall as expected in retail markets in the capital even though prices in wholesale markets are witnessed a sharp drop last week.//////Indian Border Security Force (BSF) shot dead a Bangladeshi cattle trader on Radhanagar border under Patnitala upazila early yesterday.//////Ferry service on Paturia-Daulatdia river route has improved as two more ferries have started operating in the channel.//////The Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) has taken measures to ease sufferings and harassment of homebound passengers at bus and launch terminals in the capital ahead of the Eid.//////Around 1,000 families in Ulon of west Rampura in the capital have been suffering from severe water crisis for over 10 days as the water Dhaka Wasa supplies is very dirty, coloured and stinking.

Nothing could be more positive than a situation where the two major parties, shorn of their party chiefs for so long, can now move definitively forward and work towards a well participated, free and fair election. //////Without perhaps realising it, we are losing our battle with polythene shopping bags. We had discarded it six years ago under a nationwide ban. We carved a good name among the developing countries by the move but now the reputation is wearing thin. The almost ubiquitous reappearance of the non-biodegradable material poses a great threat to environment, particularly by choking the already dysfunctional sewerage system, not to speak of its insidious effect on soil quality and public health.//////A few days ago I met someone who had come to Bangladesh on a brief consultancy assignment. He had been in Dhaka for about a week and was on his way home the next day via Bangkok. I asked him about his impressions about our capital. The question came after his query about the historical past of the city and the current efforts by some institutions to celebrate its 400th anniversary. Being a European by origin, he hesitated at first and then asked me if I would mind some straight comments. I assured him that candour was not a virtue but nevertheless, was welcome as far as I was concerned.//////DO the current developments in the political scene look as though the country is moving ahead along a well-charted way towards reconciliation and a return to democracy? Though some of the roadblocks seem to have been averted, internal strife in the parties and inter-party bickering to gain or retain power circumventing the political and electoral reforms once agreed to in principle, still seem to pose a threat. Mere acquiescence to the adoption of forms of reform rather than its spirit and substance, more as measure of expediency than anything else, cannot help return to desired democracy. For this, a change of heart is required perhaps on the part of both the administration and the political parties. //////IT'S one thing to throw out a bad government it's another to install something better. The caretaker government's attempt to clean up a corrupt political system and adopt economic reforms to help rebuild a ramshackle economy may have failed to a certain extent, but when politicians offer only crowd-pleasing rhetoric instead of sound and proven ideas, the result is not a promise of hope. Unsurprisingly, the caretaker government aroused public expectation of change, but couldn't achieve much. It is always difficult to defeat ghosts of the past. Some sociologists jokingly commented that corruption has entered the DNA of our national culture and has naturally reproduced itself there. Political corruption is widespread throughout the country. Unscrupulous politicians see their main job as to harvesting money.//////Chief selector Rafiqul Alam pointed out some reasons behind Bangladesh's dismal performance in the three-match one-day series against Australia in Darwin. //////The long 13-month wait for the second edition of the professional football league ends today when defending champions Abahani take on Rahmatganj in the opening match of the Citycell B.

Yousuf didn't win; Mahendra Singh Dhoni did. And Dhoni and fellow nominees, Sachin Tendulkar and Nathan Bracken, were named in the ODI Team of the Year, Yousuf wasn't. Yousuf's omission was puzzling not only because he was one of the nominees for the top award, but also one of the prolific run-scorers in the period considered by the ICC.//////Australia on Friday left out all-rounder Andrew Symonds for disciplinary reasons and chose 36-year-old leg-spinner Bryce McGain for next month's four-Test tour of India.//////The ICC decided to continue the trial of umpire referral system, which took place in the recent Sri Lanka-India Test series, to some upcoming series before its actual implementation, it was decided in a meeting.//////Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have pipped Sachin Tendulkar to the ICC ODI Player of the Year award but Adam Gilchrist believes the Little Master is still the best batsman around.//////Virender Sehwag does not hanker after Test captaincy and the swashbuckling opener says as a senior member of the squad, he would keep giving his inputs to whoever leads the side.//////Sadharan Bima beat Matuail Udayan Sangsad by a solitary goal in the Second Division Football League at the Kamalapur Stadium yesterday.//////Robinho is set to make his Premier League debut on Saturday against Chelsea - the club he was set to join until English football's previously unchallenged big-spenders were trumped by Manchester City.//////The Serie A season is only one match old but already football has been pushed onto the back seat and hooligan violence is dominating the headlines in Italy. //////Few foreign footballers have proved as popular in England as Gianfranco Zola.//////Olympic champion Usain Bolt has agreed to go training with Spanish football giants Real Madrid, the Jamaican sprint king revealed on Thursday. //////Luiz Felipe Scolari has suffered his first major setback as Chelsea manager after admitting defeat in his battle to keep long-serving club servant Steve Clarke on his coaching staff.//////Friday's Bundesliga match between Eintracht Frankfurt and Karlsruhe has been postponed because of damage to the pitch caused by a Madonna concert.//////Reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid do not envisage recruiting any new players in the winter transfer window, according to sporting director Pedja Mijatovic.//////Former Danish football great Mikael Laudrup on Friday signed an 18-month contract with Russia's nine-time champions Spartak Moscow, the club's general manager Valery Karpin said.//////Kuruvchi's (Bunyodkor) new Brazilian signing Rivaldo had a dream debut for the AFC Champions League (ACL) quarterfinalists as his brace saw them beat Mashal 2-0 on Thursday. //////China pulled away from its Paralympic rivals Friday as the host nation's medal tally soared over 100, while South African swimming sensation Natalie du Toit grabbed her fourth gold.//////Real Madrid are 40 million euros better off after selling Robinho to Manchester City, but his loss leaves the Spanish champions short of firepower in their quest for a third successive title. //////Bayern Munich coach Jurgen Klinsmann has told restless forward Lukas Podolski his frustrating stay on the bench will continue for the German giants' trip to Cologne on Saturday.//////As Bryce McGain strolled towards Cricket Australia's Melbourne headquarters on Friday it was hard to know who was more excited about his Test call-up, the legspinner himself or his eight-year-old son Liam. McGain was smiling but suitably restrained; Liam was powering along the footpath and replicating his father's legbreak action, with an extra couple of flourishes.//////Pakistan pondered another

Natural and man made calamities take away most of our belongings time and again and put us on the crossroads of life and death. Still, our courageous people resort to struggle for their existence almost barehanded. They don't look for mercy nor do they care for any support. This struggle, which they definitely win, shapes their lives. These victorious people are our inspiration. We fought the liberation war and achieved independence with this motivation and inspiration. In the last 37 years since independence we at times were drowned in deep frustration and at times sparkled with the ray of hope. But our journey never ended. Neither shall it end now. The promised election shall be held by the end of this year. Like all other common people I also hope that the new, honest elected leadership will lead the country towards development through the desired path. Bangladesh shall rise with new dreams, new realities, new thinking and new rhythms, the whole world shall admire a new Bangladesh. But there are some crisis those need immediate attention and any delay in addressing those may retard progress. One such crisis is that of food security.//////Newspaper reports have it that the present Caretaker Government is contemplating to formulate a national integrity strategy that are required to be maintained at different institutions of state organs. Reportedly, experts involved in this venture are already in the process of identifying problems or challenges in the state and non-state institutions, defining goals and devising strategies to achieve those. Such experts have expressed cautious optimism by commenting that the implementation of the said national integrity strategy would depend entirely on the political will of the future governments.//////After the US President George Bush had refused to sign the biodiversity treaty in 1992, the last effort to save the planet from environmental disasters seemed to be on the verge of failure . For the affluent countries like the U.S. the chickens have come home to roost. The U.S. in the last one decade suffered several weather related catastrophes like severe flooding, hurricanes and prolonged hot summer days in some states. After Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans in 2005 and flooded the city for days, Hurricane Gustav with a surge as high as 14 ft accompanied by torrential rain is speeded up to hit Louisiana forcing two million people to flee to safety the other day.//////Marine turtles have been swimming the world's oceans since before the dinosaurs roamed the earth, more than 110 million years ago. Turtles are an important component of the marine ecosystem and serve as indicators of the health of the environment in which they live. Their aesthetic appeal draws conservationists and tourists from around the world to nesting beaches throughout the region, generating income for local communities. In many countries, marine turtles are used for their meat, egg and shell, representing a traditional source of food for human populations. However, these treasures of ancient times are now on the brink of extinction. All seven sea turtle species are globally endangered including the five species that swim in Bangladesh territorial waters and are listed as "threatened" or "endangered" in the IUCN Red Data Book. The proposed revision of Bangladesh Wildlife Preservation (Amendment) Act 1974 has also included the marine turtles in the list of protected species. The species are: Dermochelys coraicea (Leatherback), Chelonia mydas (Green Turtle), Lepidochelys olivacea (Olive Ridley), Eretmochelys imbricata (Hawksbill) and Caretta caretta (Loggerhead).//////Global warning is bearing a global warning for the low-lying sea-facing over populated countries like Bangladesh. This perhaps has made the world community more concerned about than other environmental issue. But it is man who has made it so alarming through his unbridled one-sided development activities without taking the environmental aspects into account over time. ////// edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri. With an introduction by Amiya Dev. Delhi: Chroniclebooks, 2008. 326pp.Rs. 650//////Poetry volumes--especially books and publications of single poets, of new poets--now have become hard to market outside of libraries and literature classes. As editor Jeet Thayil (60 Indian Poets, Penguin India, 2008) observed ruefully in his introduction, unlike Indian novelists, poets receive no advances; their books are usually out of print; even the best known among them have trouble finding publishers and are virtually unknown outside India. He could have been writing--excepting the very select few--about poets in general, anywhere. Poetry published today therefore tend to be anthologies, collections which cover all bases and are geared towards appealing to as broad a range of readers as possible. So it's not surprising to see that this poetry volume by Penguin India is an anthology: there are obviously market calculations that have been made. But let's not quibble: it's a welcome event to see a publisher put money and time into publishing a poetry volume. //////There are certain Indians who make you feel good about being a Bangladeshi, who give you a warm glow that despite all that razzmatazz and heavyweight tiffin boxes and big brains like Amartya, they too produce and consume their quota of trash. Shobhaa De is one of them. She is a writing phenomenon, whose books sell all over India, and in Pakistan too (where all the good and high society people fell over each other to fete her when she did a tour there not so many months back), and bring in a hefty chunk of change for her publishers Penguin India. Since I have never read any of her books, I only had a vague idea that she wrote romance novels. That's going by the perhaps less than solid evidence of having seen her on Zee TV a couple of times flaunting her cheekbones. //////Haste lays waste to everything, including genres and categories, and plays genial host to the printer's devil. In the last issue (September 6) of the Literature Page, 'Lunch' was published as 'Non-Fiction' when it should have gone under 'Short Stories'. //////There are several modern invasive tools cardiologists are using to treat angina (chest pain) including angioplasty (blowing up balloons to expand the artery at sites of block), stenting (insertion of cylindrical wire mesh tube prop open the blocked artery) and bypass surgery (increasingly through very small incisions). But drug therapy may be just as effective to restore blood flow as invasive surgery for stable angina, a new analysis published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests.//////It is said that 'the family that prays together stays together', but we can add 'eating together' is another way to build up and improve family bonds. As well as inviting neighbours, friends and relatives during mealtime has a surprising power. It does not matter what meal you are having! It could be simple fish, vegetables and dhal but it is the simple act of sitting at the same table and eating rice or tea together.//////Having higher vitamin B12 levels may protect against brain shrinkage in elderly people, according to a study published recently.//////Does cancer have an answer? To many people, cancer is a terrifying disease, which they hope not to get, and prefer not to think or talk about. But in reality, cancer is neither uncommon nor is it untreatable. Some types of cancer can be completely cured. With many other types, early diagnosis and proper treatment makes a big difference.//////A cheap, generic drug long used to treat herpes may also help control the AIDS virus, U.S. researchers reported very recently.//////People with diabetes given intensive drug treatment soon after diagnosis are healthier when they grow older, even if they become less rigorous about controlling their blood sugar later on, British researchers expressed.//////With a view to raise awareness and increase level of knowledge about women's common health problems, Singhealth, Singapore's largest group of healthcare institutions and Zonta Club, Dhaka III have jointly organised a seminar at a local hotel in the city, says a press release.//////BANGLADESH is at cross roads; lessons learnt since 1/11 could unite us towards a better future or a failed one if they are ignored. This government came at a time when the BNP and the AL, in pursuing their respective self-interests, had set Bangladesh on course to becoming a failed state. The BNP was scheming to return to power. //////BARELY hundred days are left for the parliament election; the sheen of the CTG is fading as a reminder of its imminent departure. It is a defining moment: how would it like to be judged. The sword of emergency is dangling on our heads. Suggesting the right course when the authority goes wrong is dangerous in an environment of suspended democracy. Yet the country belongs to the people, in the spirit of '71 cowardice must not be cultivated in the face of fear or danger. We are on a cross road, the controversies might endanger the stability of Bangladesh.//////WHEN the history of modern India is written, the nuclear deal with the US in 2008 will be considered at par with India's economic liberalization of 1991. The first liberated India from the self imposed shackles of a socialist economy. The second frees India from the bonds of technological isolation. The process also acknowledged India's emergence as an emerging nation with potential and capabilities. //////Nurjahan Murshid was one of the more articulate political beings in Bangladesh. There was suavity about her, a readiness and an ability to be part of the wider world around her. If cosmopolitanism was the requirement in an era when Bengali politics gradually passed into the hands of the middle class, Murshid demonstrated it in plenty through her view of the issues, indeed of the social canvas which she observed before her and of which she was an integral part. The qualities that defined her in her career --- as a politician, as an editor, as an aesthete --- all come encompassed in these two commemorative volumes on her five years after her death.//////A thing may or may not be beautiful but it certainly is powerful when it speaks the truth. With a clear and loud voice of conscience, it transforms itself into a most reliable and, therefore, a valid document mirror imaging atrocities most barbaric and nefarious. And this exactly is recorded in //////, by Kabir Sumon, formerly known as Sumon Chattopaddhaya. The book is a compilation of only nine not so elaborate write-ups that appeared in three different newspapers of West Bengal over a period of roughly one year.//////On August 17, 1988, a plane carrying President Zia ul-Huq, American ambassador Arnold Raphel, US Brig.

The poems included in the selection are taken from ten books of poetry published over a period of 32 years. //////
