Throughout his life, the 19th century mystic bard searched for answers to questions regarding purpose of life, creation and creator. Lalon's core philosophy is to know the creator through the creations. He also believed that nature could play the most significant role in the quest to know oneself. From this belief, Lalon used to arrange congregations, widely known as 'Shadhu Shongo'. The bard used to invite bauls and mystics to this congregation to share and exchange views. This became a tradition and to this day, Lalon's followers continue arranging such 'Shadhu Shongo' on every full moon night in Kushtia and adjacent areas. A 'Shadhu Shongo' was held on the last full moon [on June 16-17] night at a farm near Lalon's akhra (den) at Chheuria, Kushtia. Followers from different sects joined Lalon devotees at the programme.

It is the beginning, the genesis of her creativity that you go back to. By any measure and in terms of the conservative Muslim social background she was born into, Sufia Kamal would be doing nothing remiss had she opted to lead a nondescript life behind the veil. And yet purdah, she must have reasoned at that early stage of life when impressions begin to shape themselves into a pattern, did not become her. That was boldness, perhaps with a ring of audacity to it, seeing that she came of zamindari stock in Barisal. And zamindars, landlords, were not always the best purveyors of cultural enlightenment. Sufia Kamal was to dig a tunnel out of conformity, a task in which her family pitched in with help. And, then, do not forget that the poet was fortunate in marrying a man, her first husband who was to die young, willing to go out on a limb to have her follow the call of her heart. In the years to follow, it was with the encouragement of her second husband that Sufia Kamal would move on, toward wider expanses of creativity.//////We need to lay out the sequence if we want to assess the consequence.//////Bigger than France, Turkey is a part of Europe and Asia, adjoins oil-rich Iran and sits astride the Dardanelles, through which Black Sea is connected.
