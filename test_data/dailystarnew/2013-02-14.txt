They are our promise of change for the future -- in our laws, our politics, our society and our democracy. //////Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) elements have exposed their rowdy nature by assaulting the newly appointed principal of Barisal BM College Prof Shankar Chandra Dutta on Tuesday. //////Duronto Rajshahi's chances of making it through to the next round suffered a blow after their 33-run defeat to Chittagong Kings at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.
