Reports of an incidence of anthrax in Lakshmipur have also been there. As far as we are aware, no fewer than 520 people all over the country have in the past couple of months been affected by the disease and, we are informed, half of them have already been provided with treatment. There may be a bit of hope here and we might tell ourselves that the disease, contracted through eating meat, especially beef, will soon go away.

If people can pay taxes then why shouldn't the lawmakers pay income tax? Lawmakers are exempted from tax on remuneration and allowances according to the 1973 Members of Parliament (remunerations and allowances) Order. In fact, governance is a matter of setting moral standards for everyone to uphold. It begins at the top. That being the truth, let our MPs correct the situation and convince the people of Bangladesh that lawmakers are not and cannot be above the law. Let them begin paying their dues to the republic. Our members of parliament are already some of the best-paid legislators in the world, a fact that has drawn fire from their constituents who believe they should be paid less. It is totally ridiculous that our MPs go home with huge perks per month while professionals like doctors earn less per month though they work more than 12 hours a day seven days a week! Our MPs? A few hours a week with more perks per day just for showing up! Integrity of MPs should be measured by the same ruler they use for the same country. They really don't care about the welfare of ordinary citizens. There are other more pressing matters we should be attending to like improving infrastructure instead of increasing salaries. Bangladesh's economy is still recovering from the aftermath of a post-election crisis and an ensuing world economic downturn. Yet another drastic pay hike for MPs is the most outrageous, insensitive, immoral and intolerant abuse by Bangladesh's officialdom the country has ever witnessed. //////Almost all the democratic governments and parties select, nurture, groom second and third line of leadership.

Despite the hurricane of protest from those of all religions and none - plus government (e.g. Hilary Clinton) and secular authorities - this misled congregation may, unfortunately, go ahead with this action that has rightly been called 'unnecessary, offensive and dangerous'.//////We see from the news published in your daily that some of those convicted by the court with death by hanging in a murder case and have recently been pardoned by the Honourable President, are coming out from the jail with television antenna and paddle stand fans in hands (DS: 08.09.10). As per the jail code no accused, especially who are under capital punishment, is allowed to bring anything in other than their clothes and essentials. The jail authorities are supposed to ensure the comfort and convenience of the inmates.
