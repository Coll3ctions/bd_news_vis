It is all but clear to us that the reason it had joined, and that too very briefly, the last session of the parliament, was possibly only to prevent their seats being declared vacant. We feel that the party's position is not only irrational, it is impolitic and dysfunctional for democracy, for itself and for the state, and above all, it is a letdown of its supporters who are being kept unrepresented in the parliament for a long time.//////The subsidence of a construction site in the city's Nakhalpara area on Saturday demonstrates once more the near impunity with which some owners of projected new buildings operate. There have been instances in the recent past of buildings collapsing owing to faulty construction, putting lives at risk. And every time such incidents have occurred, there have been fresh calls for inquiries and the need for a strict monitoring and implementation of building codes.

Chemical wastes from dyeing factories, dumping of sewage, etc., are making the water unusable. If we can't stop polluting the river now, it will soon become a dead river.

We, the general people as well as the DCC and other authorities should come forward to save Buriganga.//////In a keynote policy speech last Thursday, President Obama calling for an Israel-Palestine peace deal based on 1967 borders is indeed commendable. If the deal which Obama has outlined in his speech is espoused by both Israel and Palestine this will herald a new era in the Middle East and open the door for peace and stability to both Israel and Palestine state and put an end to age-old hostility between the two nations that cost hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties to both nations. //////Beggars are back on the streets and Dhaka is now once again the dirty, filthy city it was before the ICC World Cup. So do Bengalis exist just to impress foreigners? Don't the people of Bangladesh have any value in the eyes of the government? It goes to show that if the government wants to, it can take the necessary steps to eliminate beggars from the streets and keep the city clean. //////Well-to-do people from Bangladesh travel abroad in quest of better treatment all the year round. I would like to relate a different story contrary to popular belief of availing better treatment abroad.//////The Supreme Court of Bangladesh in a landmark verdict has declared the Article related to the Caretaker Government void and at the same time has allowed the next two Bangladesh general elections to be held under the Caretaker Government. This seems to me a bit self-contradictory. I will explain this in an allegorical form.//////We are really vexed at the comment of Dr. Abdul Quader Khan - the Pakistani nuclear scientist. It is a worthless comment about the emergence of independent Bangladesh. It is also insulting to the freedom fighters of Bangladesh, who made supreme sacrifices for the country. Dr Quader should know that the emergence of Bangladesh was historically inevitable. //////It is heartening to know that rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas proclaimed a landmark, Egyptian-mediated reconciliation pact aimed at ending their bitter four-year rift. This is indeed a pragmatic move towards establishing a peaceful independent home for the Palestinians. It is hoped that in course of implementation of the pact, both the sides will apply their conscience and goodwill to keep their unity unhurt in their greater interest. And I think Israel has nothing to worry about, rather they should welcome the move and help reset peace talk for the good of both Israelis and the Palestinians. //////If you come to Ishwardi Govt College you will still find the windows of the principal's office broken. The Principal's staunch decision to enroll the honours students on the basis of merit made the ruling party student leaders angry and hence the violence. //////One day, I was stuck in a traffic jam for more than four hours. Some hotshot political leader returned from abroad to Bangladesh, and the party members thought it would be a good idea to show their loyalty by bringing out a procession on the main street. I guess they forgot that as a metropolitan city, Dhaka does not have the required 25% road area. As a result, the followers made sure that the arrival of the political leader is etched in our memories forever, as a horrible reminder how 'considerate' our political parties are towards the public. It is high time for them to realize that there is a place and time for everything, and the main streets and roads are for commuting, not processions.//////The retirement age for teachers of government medical colleges is 57 years, but for government university teachers, including teachers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, the retirement age is now 65 years.

The announcement of his resignation followed reports that the president's Thursday speech on the Middle East will, amazingly, say virtually nothing about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.//////A splendid picture, published on 16th May in the pages of a local English daily, depicts the subject of free electricity supply lucidly! It says it all; without writing a single word on the matter! The hanging plug-in boards are there freely available (or is there a hire charge for plugging-in?). It supplies all the electricity you may need! Splendid power supply source indeed! It can be seen by all passers-by; like it was seen and photographed by an inquisitive reporter!//////It is possibly the worst of time for India's Congress-led UPA government which yesterday stepped into its third year of its second successive five-year tenure hemmed by a series of major scams and failure to make much headway on economic reforms in a big way. //////Pakistan's obsession with India that makes it look at its neighbour as an existential threat is a mistake and it would do well to shed this contest mentality, US President Barack Obama has said yesterday.//////Donors in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are sending an estimated $100 million annually to radical Islamic schools in Pakistan that back militancy, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable published yesterday.//////At least 17 people were killed when an express train collided with a crowded jeep which was driving across an unmanned railway crossing in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, police said yesterday.//////Taking stock of the functioning of various departments, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday attacked the Left Front rule in West Bengal, saying "practically no work" has been done.//////Western and Gulf diplomats failed yesterday to persuade Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to sign a deal that would ease him out of power and make him the third Arab leader ousted by popular protests, diplomats said.//////Al-Qaeda's new leader Saif al-Adel has vowed to launch attacks on London to avenge Osama bin Laden's killing by US special forces in his Abbottabad compound in Pakistan.

Unsurprisingly, altercations while charging fares by transport staff from bus passengers often lead to fisticuffs between them. Such scene has become common on the different city bus service routes since May 19, the day the officially announced fair hike took effect. //////When is a man at his most generous? When he wants to forgive himself, of course.//////President Obama has again come out with yet another hot-feeler. The "Arab spring" speech he delivered on May 19 -- viewed by many as a possible breakthrough in the American policy towards the Middle East -- is yet another "strategic" ploy to mask Washington's long-term goals in the region. Think-tanks may initiate a debate on whether it is the "beginning" of a "new end" in the US policy, but Obama's disorientated analysis of the "Arab spring" offered hardly anything substantial. //////Hello, Mr. Investor! Yes, I am talking to you. Right now you might be in front of the DSE or SEC protesting against the very recent price decline in the stock market. Does it really make sense? Should government do anything against short-term price decline? Why are you really wasting your time? Don't spend your time in front of DSE; it wouldn't make much difference in share prices. Spend the same time to do some research about the market. //////It is widely agreed that crises create opportunities of sorts. As the Asia-Pacific region slowly emerges from the recession of 2008 and attempts to cope with the after-effects of a food crisis and natural disasters -- including that which took place in highly-prepared Japan -- governments are looking anew at ways to mitigate the rising insecurity and heightened social risks experienced by millions of people across the region, especially those living in or close to poverty. //////
