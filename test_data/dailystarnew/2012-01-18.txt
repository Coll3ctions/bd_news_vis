But in substance, it has had very little to commend itself for. On the contrary, the outcome merely repeated what the EC had proposed nearly nine months ago as we elaborate below. It's all the more frustrating when clearly an opening was provided through the initiative as this paper had repeatedly commented. //////The recent encroachment of the Gulshan Lake is yet another stark instance of how the capital city's wetlands and canals are facing constant threats from land grabbers. A news item carried in a leading Bengali daily shows that a dam over five bighas has been put up across the lake without any permission from concerned authorities, dividing it in the middle. Worse still, several tin-shed houses have been erected along the dam, that too, by claiming land ownership.

These attendants virtually come to no help to the passengers. //////The older people of the country are being given an allowance of Tk.100 per month by the government. We think the amount is too meagre given the rising prices of the essentials. As the elderly people cannot work and earn like the younger ones, they need the allowance. But this allowance should not be a mere token money. Even though the country is beset with many problems, the government is at least doing something for the welfare of the poor old people. This is a noble initiative on the part of the government, but the said amount is a mere pittance by any standard.//////The Prime Minister has declared that we will keep our coal reserve for the next generation and will now import coal to generate electricity for our use in Bangladesh. Having attended several ministerial and secretarial meetings on coal policy, I have written in your daily that the forces working against coal mining in Bangladesh is more powerful than that of AL, BNP and JP put together. My write-up 'Buried Treasure' published in your Forum's July 2010 issue explains that we do not have to reinvent the wheel, nor is it rocket-science to formulate a simple 'coal policy' and avert the crisis that faces this country. //////The recent victory of the rebel BNP candidate Monirul Haque Sakku in mayoral election of Comilla City Corporation proved once again that people always favour a leader who is dedicated to improve common people's lot. Our political parties must understand the pulse of the common people and they must nominate honest and pro-people leaders who truly represent the parties. They must not choose candidates with dubious characters. Nowadays, the common people have become more conscious. They know they should elect the right candidate. In the recent mayoral elections of Narayanganj and Comilla, people have made it clear. Any kind of manipulation in voting could be disastrous for the government. It would have rekindled the politics of confrontation and distrust. The government and the Election Commission deserve kudos for holding a free and fair election in a peaceful environment. Congrats to the new mayor of Comilla!//////Bangladesh Premier League, which will kick off on February 10, 2012 is going to be the biggest domestic tournament in the history of Bangladesh cricket.

These channels broadcast drama serials, movies, talk shows and many more entertaining programmes. We also have a few channels that are broadcasting only news. However, it is really unfortunate that we do not have any sports channel. We hardly get daily sports updates except in the news. Like other countries, we need our own sports channel. Our national cricket team play international matches regularly. But BTV only broadcasts a few of the matches. Therefore, we need a 24-hour sports channel to meet the demand of the sports lovers. //////It is surprising that four Iranian nuclear scientists were killed in two years. We have learnt from the newspapers that the Iranian official noted that the latest assassination method - magnetic bomb being attached to the target's vehicle and two men on a motorbike doing the job was similar to that used in the killings of three other scientists. //////Despite much criticism about the use of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM), mainly by the opposition party, the Election Commission (EC) has done the job successfully in Comilla City Corporation election. The polling stations were hassle-free. And the final result came out like a magic, within a very short time. Although there is a big risk of election manipulation in case of EVM use, but a strong, unbiased and transparent Election Commission can accomplish this Herculean task.//////The students of class V throughout the country made a very good result in the last Primary Education Terminal Exam. Last year the pass rate was 88.84 per cent. The pass rate rose by 4.92% this year. The overall result of JSC examinations has improved also. But still the dropout rate is a matter of concern. By dint of hard work the students are making satisfactory results. The guardians are also very serious about their children's education. If the situation improves gradually, no student will fail in any public examination in the near future. Now importance should be given to the improvement of the quality of education. Quality should be ensured for the better future of the students and for the betterment of the nation.//////Iran yesterday warned US ally Saudi Arabia to rethink plans to compensate for Iranian oil exports cut by sanctions, and boosted security for its targeted nuclear workers as it dug in under its showdown with the West.//////Energy-hungry India said yesterday it was continuing to buy oil from Iran, despite an intensifying US campaign to smother Tehran's vital oil exports until it abandons its nuclear programme.//////Myanmar has told the military to halt all offensives in ethnic minority conflict zones, a top official said yesterday, as the regime pursues peace deals with guerrillas as part of wider reforms.//////Pakistan's wildcard politician Imran Khan says he is happy to go into opposition if his "tsunami" of popular support fails to bring him a landslide victory at elections now widely expected within months.//////The Indian government yesterday filed a caveat in the Supreme Court against any ex-parte order on the petition filed by Army Chief Gen V K Singh challenging the decision over his date of birth.//////Syrian army defectors urged the UN Security Council to take control of the crisis from an Arab League peace mission it says has failed to halt the regime's deadly crackdown on dissent.//////Republican presidential hopefuls attacked Mitt Romney's record in business and government on Monday and challenged him to release his tax returns, but the front-runner emerged largely unscathed from a South Carolina debate.//////External affairs minister SM Krishna on Monday declined to comment on the turmoil in Pakistan where the Supreme Court issued a contempt notice to Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, saying it is an internal matter of that country.//////Hosni Mubarak was wheeled into court yesterday as his defence began a five-day challenge to calls by the prosecution for the former Egyptian president to be hanged for the deaths of democracy protesters.//////British author Salman Rushdie's planned appearance at a literary festival in India was thrown into doubt yesterday due to security concerns caused by protests from influential Muslim clerics.//////Hopes began to fade for 29 people still unaccounted for from the wreck of a luxury liner off the coast of Italy yesterday as a judge questioned the captain over his role in the disaster.//////Up to 2,900 members of the British army including 400 Gurkhas will lose their jobs along with 1,000 air force personnel in the latest round of defence cuts, the government said yesterday.//////What happens when someone sees himself in the mirror for the first time? -- questioned Russian filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky at the Tareque Masud Master's Class. In the short film Svyato this is what happens. Kossakovsky's two-year-old son is exposed to his own reflection for the first time, since Kossakovsky banned all mirrors at his home, only to capture this very moment on film. It's a magic moment when the child, alternatively shocked and pleased, looks at himself, combing through his hair or hitting the strange person behind the glass wall. It's an unrepeatable moment -- for the filmmaker and the child. //////A two-day classical music festival in Rajshahi ended last Friday.//////The fourth instalment of Hollywood blockbuster Mission Impossible was released on December 21, 2011.

We do not mean to prejudge the course of the trial of those who have been brought into the net of the law and those who might be picked up at a later stage. The good bit in the war crimes story is that every effort has been expended into making sure that the process of the trials meets internationally accepted legal standards, that indeed no questions are raised about the transparency of the trials. Those who have been accused of crimes committed in the course of the War of Liberation must be satisfied that it is justice, not revenge, the state of Bangladesh means to pursue. For those of us who have not forgotten the manner in which the Pakistan army and its local collaborators went about killing, raping and burning, the goal remains an attainment of justice as a means of bringing the past to an end through letting the war criminals know that while they may have got away with their notoriety in the past four decades, history is now about to catch up with them. Finally.//////The death of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, and the ascendance to power of one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, creates some opportunities and potential traps for the administration and senior leaders in the United States -- things they should be sure to say and be sure not to say.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's two-day visit to Tripura on January 11-12 was the first by any prime minister of Bangladesh.

Both, according to the report of International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA and Iran's own assertion, Iran is now enriching uranium to 20% level, way above 3.5% needed for power stations, and closer to weapons grade. //////Every week is seemingly "make or break" week in Pakistan. But last week and the one ahead could be crucial for the democratic process.
