The country is landlocked on three sides, with the Bay of Bengal, which is the gateway for its trades and commerce with the world, to the South.

Already it is protested by various environment related organizations. The Forest Department has also shown its reservation.

According to Beauvoir, the institution of marriage is not based on a 'footing of equality'. Once we accept the basic tenet of inequality on which marriage between man and woman is premised, everything falls into place. There may be some exceptions to this rule, but Beauvoir was not concerned with exceptions. Neither am I. We're here concerned with the typical marriage, where the treatment of the wife as an inferior being who must sacrifice herself for her husband and his children is the rule. Even if the woman receives a dowry or some inheritance she can call her own, she is still enslaved to her husband and his family. In return for her labours, the wife is of course given protection, food and shelter. How is this situation different from glorified slavery? Asks Beauvoir. //////The debate between movie buffs and bookworms is as old as the origin of films. Some say it stems from the eighteenth-century debates between poetry and painting, thus fostering views in which words and pictures are opposed. //////Love between a man and woman is a gift from heaven. Yet this gift is like a delicate thread when shared by two people who are not supposed to be in love. But what can these people do when Cupid has pierced their hearts? Just wishing to be out of love does not make the gift go away. It is not something that you wash away like the wave that wipes away the writing on the sand. Trust and belief in love hold these two people together even when hidden, lurking danger shadows them all the time.//////Ageing is a natural and inevitable process.

If one of those clots breaks free and travels to the lungs which can prove fatal. The findings also show that heavier women are more likely to end up needing surgery.//////The Obama administration pivot to the Pacific, formally announced by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last November and reiterated more recently by the president himself, might appear like a reassertion of America's imperial tendencies just at the time when Washington should be concentrating on the domestic economy. But in fact, the pivot was almost inevitable.//////Nothing perhaps could be more embarrassing for a nation's leader than to represent his country in a forum abroad just after his administration has been decisively defeated in an election at home. An electoral repudiation is an eloquent way of telling the world that a president has lost the right to speak for his people.//////The Indian defense industry is one of the fastest-growing global defense markets. India's defense capital expenditure, which refers to the part of the defense budget that is spent on the acquisition of all types of military hardware and technology, has grown at a CAGR of XX% over the review period. In 2010, India was allocated US$XX billion for defense capital expenditure in the budget. Defense expenditure is expected to record a CAGR of XX% during the forecast period, to reach an annual expenditure of US$XX billion by 2016. This is primarily due to the country's ageing military hardware and technology which is in need of replacing, and demands for defense against domestic insurgencies and hostility from neighboring countries. The strong growth in the industry is attracting foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and leading companies from the domestic private sector to enter the market. //////Abdul Matin's interest in Bangladesh's politics, indeed its overall historical legacy, has endured despite his being away from the country for more than half a century. His links with Bangladesh and its people remain as strong as they were when he made his move to Britain in 1960. Unlike so many others, his curiosity about the country has been a constant, a truth which manifested itself especially well during the War of Liberation in 1971 when he threw himself wholesale into garnering foreign support for the Bengali cause. //////Randall Kennedy is a professor at Harvard Law School, widely regarded as one of the most perceptive and eloquent commentators on racial matters.
