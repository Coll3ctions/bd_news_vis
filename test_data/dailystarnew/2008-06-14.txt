The worrisome aspect is that these killings resulted from petty matters that should have been solved in a more urbane manner. Only the other day two businessmen were killed because of disputes emerging out, ostensibly, of unfulfilled obligation of one party or the other. It seems that resorting to violence and killing have become the preferred arbiter of disputes. //////The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) has talked about freeing the local government system from the direct influence of the Members of Parliaments (MPs). We understand, the main objective behind the move is to allow the system to become autonomous so that it can run its own affairs with greater efficiency. In this regard, a fresh law has already been drafted by the government, which would empower a chairman of the Upazila Parishad to plan and carry out development activities, without looking upto the local MP. It may be mentioned here that earlier the commission on strengthening local government system had recommended for non-interference of the MPs. //////FOR most of us, one of the important tasks after waking up is to reach for the newspaper. To an extent, we have become slaves to this habit. Keeping ourselves informed of what happened yesterday helps us to determine what we will be doing today. In more ways than one, the morning newspaper also guides our thinking on important issues and helps to put things into perspective.//////FOUR years is a long period in government to prove your mettle. A few days ago Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's fourth anniversary in office was celebrated in Delhi, with Congress president Sonia Gandhi hosting a dinner. Public participation was nowhere. Probably, this epitomises the four-year-old rule of Manmohan Singh. //////OFFSHORE banking refers to international banking involving non-residents' foreign currency- denominated assets and liabilities. It covers only non-residents and does not mix with domestic banking. A non-resident is a person, bank or firm who/which resides outside Bangladesh. Non-residents also include Bangladesh nationals who reside abroad. Offshore banking units can carry on their activities of deposit taking from and lending to international enterprises or investors without conflict with the domestic fiscal and monetary policy. In short, offshore banking is international banking kept separate from domestic banking with freedom of functioning.//////While it was all quiet on the Indian front, the Pakistani camp was rather shaken by an embarrassing defeat and its aftermath before revival of the old foes' rivalry on the eve of today's Kitply Cup final at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.//////It did not take Robin Singh too long to remember the last India-Pakistan final in Dhaka.//////A penalty save by Gianluigi Buffon spared Italy a second defeat of Euro 2008 but the world champions' involvement in the tournament was still left hanging by a slender thread after a 1-1 draw with Romania here on Friday.//////Czech Republic coach Karel Bruckner is desperate to avoid an historic penalty shoot-out against Turkey in Sunday's winner-takes-all showdown with a Euro 2008 quarterfinal berth at stake.//////Bangladesh will take on Brunei Darussalam today in their opening Pool A match of the 3rd Men's AHF Cup Hockey tournament in Singapore.//////Pakistan cricket coach Geoff Lawson may have rubbished reports that team was not united but if sources are to be believed all is not well in the Pakistan team and even some players are questioning credentials of Lawson as an international coach.//////A spirited and inform Maldives stand in reigning champions India's way to claim their fourth SAFF Championship title as the two teams meet in the final of the fifth edition of the regional football competition today.//////BKSP shooter Tripti Dutta denied Sabrina Sultana her third gold medal in the 22nd National Shooting Championships yesterday.//////Croatian-born Austrian player of the year Ivica Vastic became the oldest scorer in Euro championships history as he converted an injury-time penalty to give the co-hosts a 1-1 draw with Poland and ironically send his Croatia compatriots into the Euro 2008 quarterfinals.//////Tottenham have picked up a rare diamond who is better than Cristiano Ronaldo, if Croatia coach Slaven Bilic is to be believed.//////Holders Greece and Russia are expected to ring the changes on Saturday in their bid to avoid a dreaded second defeat in a row in Group D at Euro 2008.//////Familiar foes Sweden and Spain meet at Euro 2008 on Saturday with nothing but mutual respect after locking horns in qualifying.//////Euro 2008 briefs on Friday://////SALZBURG: Exasperated by fans relieving themselves anywhere they pleased after having one too many beers, host city Salzburg has installed brighter lightbulbs in streetlamps around the old town fan zone to shine a light on those trespassing supporters.

In 2003, a group of IFA students started exhibiting and selling their artworks at the venue. The area is also widely known as 'Mollah' -- after a tea-stall owned by someone called Mollah. Chhobir Haat is akin to a rural ////// where traders in makeshift stalls or under the open sky offer their goods.

In a country like Bangladesh, where stricter penal laws have to be enacted to curb the terrorist menace and other criminal mischief -- to be enforced by the police not trained to a necessary level -- there is always likelihood of abuse of powers by the police in negation of the individual's rights.//////ILL-conceived policies of the past that still continue have created nightmarish conditions in our cities. Worst affected is the Dhaka city that grapples with oversized population, scanty land space compared to heavy exodus from rural outbacks, noxious emissions and toxic effluents from big and small factories coupled with recurrent thrust of natural disasters like flood, and storms. Compounding the crisis resulting from the deterioration of physical environment is the unceasing wave of terrorism, violence and crime committed in the streets even in broad day light because of lax governance and weak policing.//////DEDICATED planning and timely supports can make Bangladesh food-surplus and ensure food security for its population. This year's net food grain shortage is only 0.1 mil. ton against a total demand of 26 mil. tons (despite 1.8 mil. tons standing crops damage by back-to-back floods and Sidr). Bangladesh produced 24.3 mil. tons of food grains in 1999-2000 matching the requirements of the then 130 mil. population and since then it is on the fringe of self-sufficiency. Presently, Bangladesh has 8.29 mil. ha. of cultivable land and about 145.6 mil. population. Each year, the country is loosing about 1 percent of its cultivable lands to non-agricultural uses while its popualtion is increasing by about 2 mil. A yearly incremental production of 0.35 mil. ton in addition to 2 mil. tons average deficit is required for food grains self-sufficiency. //////It is now effectively not possible to move in Dhaka City. It is now not possible to predict the travel time for distances barely two to three kilometres long. It is now not possible not to be hesitant to venture on to the street, on foot or on a vehicle, private or public.//////In order to solve the transportation problem of Dhaka City, the Strategic Transport Plan (STP) for Dhaka City was initiated in March, 2004 by GOB with the assistance of World Bank, and with Louis Berger Inc. as Principal Consultants and Bangladesh Consultant Ltd. as local partner. In August, 2004 an Advisory Committee comprising of some 32 members from different categories of professionals, engineers, planners, architects, academics and civil servants was appointed to guide and oversee the work of the consultants. The plan (STP) was completed in December, 2005.//////The FNI militias operated from their hideouts at Datule, located north of Kafe. The militias were causing so much of tension and difficulties for the Bangladeshi camps as well as for the Hema refugees that they had to be stopped. A raid on the FNI camp at Datule was ordered from the Sector HQ at Bunia. Bangladeshi troops carried out the operations on the FNI camps and could capture about thirty militias with their weapons and ammunitions. However, most of the militia, about four hundred of them, could escape with their arsenals. They took shelter in the hill of Ndriki, further north.//////In hindsight it seems inevitable that this novel about a Bangladeshi in a United Nations peacekeeping force in Congo would be written. The surprise is, all things considered, how well it has been done.//////Near the end of Hasan Azizul Huq's novel //////, the narrator tries to wrap her mind around the concept of Pakistan.//////I do not write poetry. At grade school, whenever I've tried my hand at poetry and attempted to pass them off as //////, I'd inevitably run into a wall. Later, in high school, I would sometimes struggle for an hour or two over multiple drafts and finish off a few lines thinking they rhymed well, or at least sounded OK to me. Then, when I'd read them aloud to my brothers or a cousin, I would get a reality check. Their silence would signal to me that I needed to work harder on my //////. I remember that one of my early reviewers shared with me the following critique://////Every second, someone in the world needs blood. In every country, surgery, trauma, severe anaemia and complications of pregnancy are among the clinical conditions that demand blood transfusion.//////Tobacco is the only legally available consumer product which kills people when it is used entirely as intended.//////Scientists have worked out how crops such as rice absorb arsenic, a finding that could help prevent people from eating dangerous levels of the poisonous metal.//////There is an extensive network of blood vessels in our body. They fall into two broad categories; arteries and veins. Like any other organ of the body, the blood vessels may also become diseased.//////IBS or Irritable Bowel Syndrome is one of the most common abdominal disorders. This is not actually a disease and called a syndrome primarily because it is a group of symptoms. This is known by a variety of other names like spastic colon, spastic colitis, mucous colitis, nervous diarrhoea or nervous colon.//////IN the traditional sense, diplomacy is political diplomacy. This means that diplomats are primarily engaged in political relations because close or strong political relations lead to relations in other areas including economic and trade. Empirical evidence suggests economic relations are not initiated in a significant way in a political vacuum in which there is a lack of trust.//////THE operation, codenamed Azada Wosa or Be Free in Pashtun, has great tactical importance for the occupation forces. The 2,300 troops of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which only arrived in Afghanistan seven weeks ago to reinforce the NATO-commanded International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), were hurled last week into a major assault on insurgent strongholds near the town of Garmser in Helmand province. The guerillas in that area are mostly supporters of the Taliban Islamic fundamentalist movement, which was overthrown by the 2001 US invasion.//////CELEBRATIONS attending the tenth anniversary of Pokhran II were unsurprisingly muted. This projected India as a responsible nuclear power, while having internal political utility of denying credit to the current opposition party for tests conducted in its earlier tenure at the helm. The commentary attending the anniversary, however, has generally been along two lines. The first is on how nuclearization has contributed to India's security while the second is on how India is lagging behind in relation to its adversaries. Along the latter direction, there is even motivated talk of a 'missile gap' opening up with Pakistan!//////IBM and scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have built the world's fastest supercomputer and will use it to simulate nuclear detonations as a way of assessing the U.S. nuclear stockpile without actually exploding warheads.//////Germany is debating a major increase to its force in Afghanistan, a NATO source said June 9, as pressure mounts on Berlin to play a greater security role in the insurgency-hit country.//////How do you define greatness? And exactly how many fields can a study of greatness cover? The answers to these questions will likely be as intricate as the queries themselves. But when media organisations such as the Bengali Service of the British Broadcasting Service undertake a programme to assess the contributions of Bengali men and women and so arrive at an understanding of what greatness is all about, the effort should be considered rather encouraging. On second thought, however, history is never a matter of individuals coming by popular acclaim. And greatness is not to be assessed through the opinions of radio listeners, for the chances are that a very large number of these listeners are too close to their times to be able to focus on events of the past. And so they are quite likely to miss out on some significant cogs in the wheels of moving time.//////Dr. Ehsan Imdad's work, //////, is a different kind of book for a number of different reasons. First, it addresses a new and more or less neglected area of marketing communication and corporate culture. Second, it attempts to link the two different areas with practical examples. Third, the book contains practical tips to make marketing a rewarding career. Fourth, the author shows with ease and finesse how a rather complex area, live marketing communication, can be made easy to understand. ////// is a novella the reader can complete reading within a short span of time. It is comprised of 115 pages only. And yet the wisdom and the insights that the reader gains from this book can seldom be achieved in a whole lifetime.
