The truth is that since the RTI came into effect, not much of the tangible about its implementation or workability has been observed. What has happened has only been in fits and starts, which is again natural given that there are hardly any institutional arrangements in place for people to derive benefits from the RTI.

Their only motto behind burning national properties was to grab the newspaper headlines and media focus though Islam warrants us to do everything to please Allah who will surely punish those pseudo Islamists who is destroying the very principle in the process of establishing it. So once again it is proved that Jamaat version of Islam is not the true one. It is the Talibani version that is behind all kinds of wanton killing of innocent people and destruction of peaceful life across the globe. So, however hard Jamaat may try to convince the people that they are out to establish Islam, people will not be hoodwinked by it. We Bangladeshis are peace-loving and non-violent. All the saints like Shahjalal, Shahmakhdum and Khan Jahan Ali propagated Islam in this part of the globe by doing welfare activities, both mental and physical. Some of the lakes they dug for pure drinking water, roads for easy communication and mosques and institutions for prayer and propagation of true Islam are still being used, while Jamaat is doing business like others with the huge amount of money they collect from the thousands of their activists. One of their hospitals Ibne Sina is now under scrutiny due to its alleged negligence. Jamaatists must keep in mind that actions speak louder than words. Our beloved Prophet (pbuh) used all his property to save so many people during famine in Mecca. So Allah helped him establish Islam in the most hostile terrain of Arabia. Jamaat is trying for so long but their popularity is dipping day by day, thanks to their motto: ends justify the means.//////An interesting news item, rightfully headlined in the front page of a local English daily, was published on September 24th.

The BNP chief said something about monetary benefits given to the recently retired chief justice of the country. As a humble resident of the country I am of the opinion that the chief justice should declare his assets along with his dependents.
