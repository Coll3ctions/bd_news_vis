letter titled Where has the blue sky gone? by Nur Jahan published last week, I became nostalgic. From then on, I am enmeshed with the song Neel Akasher Nichey Ami Rasta Cholechhi Eka. Peace and tranquility has deserted from Bangladesh. The other day, all national dailies published a report of siphoning of Tk.20, 000/= crores from capital market by vested quarters. Now under these circumstances, what else can one expect to see in the mirror? The mirror can not deceive anybody. In order to see the clear blue sky one has to travel to the North America. In my first ever visit to Houston, I was astonished to see the clear blue sky and for a moment traveled back in time to the sixties of Dhaka that looked like all the goodness leaving forever from life.//////After the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, our government announced that it would send a rescue team and a medical team to assist the Japanese people. Days passed and still nothing happened. Finally, a few days ago the government announced that it was making a symbolic gesture and sending four people with 2,000 blankets, 1000 pairs of gloves and 500 pairs of boots. Certainly, given the vast difference between the resources of Bangladesh and Japan we perhaps cannot make a significant contribution to their recovery efforts. But even then this is a most unsatisfactory gesture on our part. In this time of their greatest difficulty we should have done more than make such a paltry gesture. //////Overwhelming majority of people of our country who belong to middle, low and no-income groups are gasping for survival due to acute price-pressure on essential commodities like cereal, flour, edible oil, pulse etc. Any democratic govt bears constitutional obligation to reach food to every single citizen of the country in the most accessible and affordable manner.

The Bangladesh Post Office issued stamps spelling POISHA correctly. //////France has just enacted a new law banning burqa or hijab wearing by women in public places. This law is particularly aiming at Muslim women only or more precisely on Islamic culture. This is clearly a racial discrimination. We should enact this law not on the basis of religion but on the basis of local culture.//////Political leaders are selected by parties elected by people but these people are always neglected by those leaders. There are hundred of examples of their negligence to the people. Efficiency of our law enforcing agency increase by manifolds when VIPs visit any place. Whatever happens, they have to block roads for free movement of VIPs. This blockage may hamper a student's life, it may even take away life of a patient who needs to reach hospital as early as possible. We, the people suffer from traffic jam, load shedding, water crisis, gas shortage, drainage system, broken roads, waste disposal etc. How they will reduce sufferings of people if they do not suffer from it. Seeing and hearing of their facilities it seems that they are residents of heaven and we are of hell. Alas! If I were a VIP only for a single day.//////Ibrahim Khaled's probe report on share scam has increased public faith in the government. This is completely a new trend. In the past people could only know the formation of committees but their reports never saw lights.

Public never saw probe reports. //////Popular Housing-1 is located at Barabagh, Mirpur-2. There are 40-50 House buildings, most of which are 5 storied. A few thousand people live there. The DCC road condition is very bad. In spite of drawing attention of the DCC no soluble actions have been taken. The residents are now faced with another set of problems. One of these is the bad sewer system. The sewerage pipelines have been broken and disconnected in many parts polluting nearby area badly. Several times the residents complained to DCC authorities, but nothing happened till now to relieve us from this condition. Therefore, on- behalf of residents of Popular Housing-1, I am appealing to concerned authorities to take immediate action to repair these pipes and arrange flashing out of the dirty water //////Nowadays we see that nepotism has turned into a social disease. It is also a national problem. We see that majority public service institutions are polluted by nepotism from top to bottom levels of the society. When one person gets appointment to any important and powerful position, he/she get involved in nepotism. There are many appointment systems run under him/ her. Usually he/she tries to give priority to his/her relatives. Though there are many capable candidates. It is one kind of misuse of power. At this, the capable candidates are encouraged and frustrated. Nepotism creates corruption and stand as an obstacle to the overall development of a country. So I urge all the high officials and VIPs to avoid nepotism. Then our country will move towards development.//////Those familiar with the above caption, knows pretty well where it appears. It is for kind information of those who are not familiar.

The first Bengali government in history, administered by Bengalis and for Bengalis, it took shape in the grey region between the sinister and the illuminating. The sinister was the programmed genocide launched with unprecedented viciousness by the Pakistan occupation army; and the illuminating was the truth that such a brutal assault on human dignity, indeed on the traditions of a people, could not go unchallenged and unbeaten. //////For most of us living in the United States the word "change" has acquired a brand new meaning -- it has almost become the defining element of our daily lives.
