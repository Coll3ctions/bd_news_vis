The murder of a journalist and his wife in Dhaka a few days ago has only confirmed fears that there is a slide where security of life is concerned. We are yet to see the police come up with any clues relating to the killings. Add to these incidents the shooting which left the guard of a residential building in Dhaka's Shyampur badly injured. There is then the killing of a trader in East Rampura. The pattern appears to be distressingly familiar. As if to add to such a feeling, we now have from Bogra the story of a girl studying in class seven falling prey to stalking. By itself stalking is a crime, but what makes this incident worse is that the stalker allegedly tried to take the girl's life by slitting her throat.//////While watching the Tigers train under the magnificent lights of the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday, one thing that struck me most was the participation of injured fast bowler Mashrafe Bin Mortaza in the extensive workouts with the selected fifteen for next month's showpiece event.//////Hasibul Hossain was the country's first bowler capable of achieving genuine pace.

With the BCB President himself making ambiguous comments about the allocations for ministers and MPs, former national players venting their frustrations quite publicly and justifiably with the way they have been treated over the issue of tickets, the situation is hardly encouraging for the tax-paying, sports-loving individual. //////Of late traffic congestion has become an acute problem. The traffic police are introducing new rules frequently for the drivers, but nothing is working. It seems it is not a manageable problem at all. The number of vehicles is not the reason for such traffic jam. I feel it is the traffic management which is at fault. We remember, during the army backed caretaker government the traffic was well managed and there was less traffic jam. This means, people strictly follow the traffic rules under efficient management. In general, Bangladeshis are not a law-abiding nation. Here people get proud in flouting the laws than obeying them.//////Nowadays we see that poly bags are used everywhere. Even if it is banned, thousands of poly bags are made every day. It has serious effects on our environment. On the other hand, a jute bag can replace more than 300 conventional poly bags in its lifetime! It will help our environment a lot! It is economical and durable. Items made from jute fabric include fashion apparel, soft luggage, carpet backing and bags or sacks for packing. //////Even the Honourable Prime Minister at times reluctantly admits the failure of the government to carry out the pledges made to the people on different occasions. On the other hand, the Honourable Home Minister is unwilling to admit that law and order is not well in the country when a daring dacoity was committed at the residence of a treasury bench member of the parliament and her landlord. Thanks heaven that she did not blame it on the opposition. //////The Prime Minister said in a meeting that her government will establish public university in every district. Not very long ago a report was published in a daily that there was shortage of students in Pabna University, established recently. The scenario is almost the same in all the newly established universities. There is not only shortage of students, but also shortage of teachers. Most of the districts have university colleges with shortage of teachers. Many government high schools have no Head teachers, Assistant Head teachers, English, Math and Science teachers. //////The President of the United States of America Barack Obama recited the lyrics of the Beatles' song Let it be in a gospel choir performance. This is for the first time a US President's voice is being incorporated in the Beatles song. The video is now on show on the Web.//////Reading newspaper daily is one of the best ways to keep up to date with the ever advancing world. All the important news and events of the world are brought to our doorstep by the newspapers. But reading newspapers have other benefits as well. Reading English daily can enrich the vocabulary of an individual. //////Teaching is a noble profession. But it is very pathetic to observe that some teachers do not show any instance of nobility. I have witnessed and learned that in many schools and colleges some teachers use slang words if any student does any mistake. If any student makes any fault they also abuse their parents verbally. This is not acceptable. //////I would like to draw attention of the people concerned as to the minimum wage of the probationary journalists. Not all, but most of the newspapers remunerate the probationary journalists at around TK. 3,000- 4,000/-. To my utter surprise, many do not even pay the journalists during the probationary period as I have recently come to know from some of my friends working in the media. Management asks them to work 3-4 months for free and start paying them only upon satisfactory performance at the completion of this period. //////Recently we witnessed another clash between two groups of Chhatra League, this time not in the campus but on the roads (Prothom Alo, 5th January).We have seen the same occurrences throughout the year 2010. Even in last two years we lost some valuable lives in different clashes. But whenever we ask the MPs to ban student politics, they cite the examples of students' role in 1952. We all know that the situation is very different now. //////Our nation will see the beginning of hard bargains with some parties demanding that elected city/town mayors be thrown out, some others wanting plum portfolios and so on. No party is likely to demand efficient, corrupt-free governance. Who are they? Who wants to think about them for the next five years? //////An interesting and detailed essay on the subject on the total number of US military bases was published in a local English daily on 14th January. //////Thousands of people marched through New Delhi and several other Indian cities yesterday to protest against corruption in the country's government and state bodies.//////Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is flying to Haiti to mediate in a political crisis there while other administration officials are keeping watch on violent protests halfway across the world in Egypt.//////About 40,000 people rallied in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore yesterday in the latest protest against proposed reforms of a controversial blasphemy law, police said.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called yesterday for an "orderly transition" in Egypt but stopped short of demanding President Hosni Mubarak step down as protests engulfed his regime.//////Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani yesterday declined to comment on the arrest of a US man who shot dead two men in Lahore, saying the matter was being probed by courts and regional authorities.//////India yesterday sent a passenger plane to Cairo to evacuate Indian citizens from Egypt due to the ongoing unrest, the government in New Delhi said.//////The Dutch government has frozen official contacts with Iran to protest the hanging of a Dutch-Iranian woman, the foreign ministry said.//////Tunisian Islamist leader Rached Ghannouchi returned to his homeland after more than 20 years in exile yesterday, eyeing a political future for his Ennahda movement after the fall of Tunisia's regime.//////Sudanese police beat and arrested students yesterday as protests broke out throughout Khartoum demanding the government resign, inspired by a popular uprising in neighbouring Egypt.//////Birds may be able to 'see' the Earth's electromagnetic field as they fly through the sky, scientists have suggested.//////French President Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday challenged the United Nations to reform its powerful Security Council this year to include one or more permanent African members.//////Iran's parliament yesterday officially endorsed atomic chief Ali Akbar Salehi as the Islamic republic's foreign minister, who told lawmakers the nuclear issue was a key part of foreign policy.//////Malaysia's ruling coalition yesterday comfortably won a key by-election in its traditional stronghold, amid speculation of snap polls later this year.//////Twelve people were killed in a huge fire that razed some 100 houses in a poor residential area in the Philippine capital yesterday, authorities said.//////Flood-shattered Australia braced for further downpours yesterday as two tropical cyclones hammered toward the devastated northeast, threatening further misery for already submerged towns.//////Close to 99 percent of south Sudanese chose to secede from the north in a landmark January 9-15 referendum, according to the first complete preliminary results announced yesterday.//////At least 10 people are reported to have died in a train crash in eastern Germany.//////A group of Somalis suspected of piracy have been flown to South Korea to face possible criminal charges.//////A fire set off a series of explosions at a military arms depot in the city of Maracay yesterday, injuring about 40 people and leading authorities to evacuate the area, an official said.//////Gunmen in southwestern Pakistan attacked three trucks after they returned from delivering supplies to NATO troops in Afghanistan, police said yesterday.//////Oman has dismantled an Emirati spy ring that was targeting the government and the military in the Gulf sultanate, a security official said yesterday.//////A 34-year-old man died after falling off a roller coaster at a popular amusement park in Tokyo yesterday, in the third incident there in three months, officials said.//////"Socrates-er Jobanbondi", "Prakrito Purangana" and "Bhager Manush" were staged on the fifth day (January 29) at the ongoing theatre fest arranged by The Daily Star and Bangladesh Group Theatre Federation (BGTF).

When Bangladesh stood liberated, as a whole, on December 16, 1971, there were yet small pockets where Pakistan's defeated soldiers were putting up last ditch resistance. That resistance would come to an end within days. But there was, unbelievably, one small portion of the country which non-Bengali collaborators of the Pakistan occupation army kept in their grip for a month and a half after liberation. //////
