Actually, these have been a horrific eye-opener to the poor fire safety standards that are built into the high-rise apartment building complexes. Ranging from design deviation through lack of internal fire fighting arrangements including dearth or absence of fire extinguishers and water hydrants that never get supervised to non-compliance with fire drill and awareness requirements, you name it, the gaps in the chain are horrendous. //////BANGLADESH never had real student politics. Instead, what the student community did in 1952, the 1960s, 1971 and 1990 was much bigger, bolder and glorious than real student politics. Though they used different political forums, students united to serve their nation in its most trying moment, for national interest and democratisation. //////FOR months, European politicians have been expressing worries about their sagging economies and the rising euro. They have been calling for a weaker currency to help boost exports. Yet, when in the first week of February 2010, the euro dropped to $1.36 (a significant drop from $1.50 in November, last year) the news was received with concern in Brussels and other European capitals.
