That is the only conclusion that we can draw from the events over the last few days! It appears that political parties are driven by violence to declare their presence.

Often this is done in front of the police but the police never give any objection. This practice is highly dangerous as there is a high risk of collision. I myself had to move out of the way in order to avoid a collision. I urge the authorities to look into the matter and put a stop to this practice for good. //////I wonder if the Padma Bridge enquiry is focussing on the wrong issue, trying to investigate 'corruption' and 'transparency'. As a Principal/Headmistress in Bangladeshi-run English-medium schools for over 7 of my 13 years in this dear country, I know how many Bangladeshis of the middle and upper classes are expert, by the age of about 8, at ensuring that no authority discovers what ACTUALLY happened - or continues to happen, if accused of malpractice! They are likely to improve their techniques as they get older, ensuring that the authority concerned gives up trying to punish them at all as collecting reliable facts is just too much hard work. This gives the naughty ones, at first, the satisfaction of feeling 'clever' and, later, they consider such an achievement is 'normal' for those of their status. Thus, they are outraged if punished and consider that no punishment of such 'harsh' authority is too great. What about changing the issue to one of 'competence'? Surely, the big question is, With or without 'corruption', is the Padma Bridge, likely to be built, according to the specifications, within the given time limit? Thus the condition of funding might be, for instance, to complete, before the end of 2013, both the Dhaka - Chittagong and the Dhaka - Mymensingh highways, according to specifications - not, as someone suggested in one of these cases, by painting the road black to make it look as though it had been surfaced correctly..... This change of focus would surely save an awful lot of time in expensive meetings that go round and round in circles. If those expected to provide this money also specified that the trial of the war criminals should also be completed by the end of 2013 - as a test of 'competence', of course - then any hostility to 'funding by foreigners', might well vanish - amidst cheers from all quarters. //////On 25 March 1971, Pakistan army launched 'Operation Searchlight' with the sinister motive of eliminating the Bengali people. Following Bangabandhu's declaration of independence, spontaneous Bengali resistance started throughout Bangladesh. The then-EPR (East Pakistan Rifles) Major Abu Osman Chowdhury of Chuadanga (Kusthia) revolted against Pakistan army on 26th March. //////It is now about a month I have been working in a gas station at a place called Woodway Dr in Houston, Texas. This gas station has a car workshop as well and is licensed to do vehicle state inspection. One day in the late afternoon, a young man and a lady came in and inquired about how long it would take to do the inspection. The manager said 10 - 15 minutes and wanted to see the vehicle documents which include registration and insurance. Thereafter he went out to see the car to be inspected. After visual inspection, he expressed his inability to do the inspection as three of the four tires were worn out. The young man pleaded earnestly to do the inspection, saying he would replace the tires as soon as possible, but the manager politely refused. He told the man that in order to get the inspection done, he needs to replace the tires first as it is a major safety concern. //////So far the ACC could not find any case of graft in the Padma bridge project.

The authorities and the nobility constantly misused their power, and they did so by subverting the unity of the people. Ivan then gave his startling conclusion. The revolution didn't happen due to inequality of people. It happened because the educated upper classes didn't give spiritual guidance to the uneducated lower classes, which was their duty.//////On November29 , 1947 the second session of the UN General Assembly passed a Resolution -- A/Res/181(II)A -- to create the state of Israel by breaking up Palestine. //////Perhaps, the standard textbooks on forensic science have to be rewritten for Bangladesh.
