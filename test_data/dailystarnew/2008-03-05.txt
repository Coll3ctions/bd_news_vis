After Thursday's launch disaster on the Buriganga, the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority has decided to go once more into enforcing the rules that should apply to normal movement on the rivers. Any enforcement of rules is certainly to be welcomed. But what becomes rather galling for people is stumbling anew on a determination of the authorities to take launch owners and operators to task only after a fresh accident on the rivers. For a few days, there is much emphasis on such river vessels not being allowed to ply without proper documents and the like, which of course is accompanied by images of launches being subjected to rigorous inspection. Such seasonal activities are normal in this country. What is beyond the normal is that these activities invariably whimper into silence, until a new tragedy occurs.//////ANOTHER form of organised extortion is increasingly in evidence going by two front-page stories run in a row by our newspaper in the last couple of days. //////NUR Mohammad could not have been more frank.

When I find a topic of my interest, I read it repeatedly. 'Cross Talk' by Mohammad Badrul Ahsan is such a column which I wait for every Friday. It's my habit to read columns published in national and international dailies, to be aware of what is happening around me and to share how the people are responding to the current issues of the global community. In this regard The Daily Star has created a different taste of reading in me, especially with the trio, Mohammad Zamir, Mohammad Badrul Ahsan and Kazi Anwarul Masud.//////The caretaker government should look at the big picture of where this country is heading. There have been no significant economic developments; in fact, we are cursed with rising prices and various other afflictions at the moment. There is a crackdown on the extremely corrupt officials such as those of Titas Gas. They should be commended for that. However, generally the economy has slowed down. The salaries of government officials need to be raised to a more realistic level, given today's prices. The government would benefit from external professional management consultants who can introduce systems whereby the gas/electricity employees will not be able to breathe without someone knowing about it. They also need to encourage and support business activities and give up the scare tactics which has stunted economic growth. This will lead to more employment and prosperity for the people and more tax for the government to use for projects. If they put their hands up in defeat, apologise and accept that most of the economy is black and work with this fact, rather than fighting it, then the "small" importers can carry out business as before and hopefully bring down the food prices. //////It was a splendid experience for me as a newspaper reader to read the article Philosophy of life, Philosophy for life in your paper's weekly magazine Star Campus on 10 February 2008.

The two parts of the country were united through a direct road and railway link, and the transmission of gas, electricity and tele-communication facilities between the parts became far easier. //////THERE was a time when President George W. Bush couldn't pass up an opportunity to blast North Korea. After 9/11 he labeled it a member of the "Axis of Evil," and later said he "loathed" Kim Jong Il. Yet, in last month's State of the Union, he didn't even mention the renegade state. True, North Korea has modified its behaviour somewhat of late, engaging South Korea in symbolic gestures of reconciliation like opening a rail link. But the real reason for Bush's shift probably lies elsewhere; time is running out on his presidency, and with quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan and the failure to deliver an Arab-Israeli peace deal, his administration is desperate for a foreign-policy triumph. Thus, it is scrambling for a deal with Pyongyang that would dismantle North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for its removal from the State Departments' list of terrorist states.//////SOUTH Africa and Bangladesh are two countries in two continents, having hardly anything in common other than the history of language movement and struggle for independence against the minority ruling class. //////NINETY-ONE YEARS ago yesterday, a woman was elected to Congress in the US, starting an avalanche of assertiveness among members of what we now wouldn't dare call the gentler sex.
