My electricity consumption varies from 300 to 400 units per month depending on circumstances. I do not operate any A/C except normal electrical devices like fans, tube lights/CFL, refrigerator, etc. In January last, I paid an electricity bill of Tk.1, 196/- for 305 units (@Tk.3.92 per unit). But in March, 2012, I received an electric bill amounting Tk.3, 453/- for 406 units (@Tk.8.51 per unit! ) which means an increase of 118% in unit price! The government claims that it has nominally increased electricity price and will increase it further to offset the subsidy! Will you call a 118% increase within two months a nominal increase? Is there nobody to look after such unjust course of arbitrary price increase by BPDB? What role the Energy Regulatory Commission plays by their so-called public hearings? I would like to draw your kind attention to make some investigative reporting on the subject for the benefit of the people of fixed income like me.//////The other day I was reading a medical newsletter wherein it was stated that the number of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ADS) cases among American children is increasing, the ratio being 1 in 88 children.

Excessive exposure to electromagnetic radiation, mercury toxicity, vaccine damage, Vitamin D deficiency are some of the major environmental factors contributing to the development of autism among children. Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) from cell phones, cell towers, Wi-Fi devices and other similar wireless technologies is suspected to be working in conjunction with genetic and environmental factors and causing autism among children.//////Teachers of BUET have been on strike since 7th April boycotting all academic activities. As a result, commencement of the next term is delayed. In the last press conference the teachers' association urged the VC and Pro VC to resign. Political influence on the administration and alteration of results are the major allegations brought against them. In the circumstances, BUET has reached a deadlock, threatening the career of over 5000 students. Though previous academic year started in February, it is doubtful whether the new academic year may start even in May. Last year teachers boycotted classes demanding elevation of retirement age which was followed by students' urge for delaying the exams. This is how education life is prolonged in BUET. SUST has almost completed half of its academic year while BUET students are sitting idle. If this deadlock is allowed to aggravate, thousands of meritorious students will have to pay the price. I respectfully urge the education minister will put his foot down to put an end to the ongoing deadlock.//////It has been published in the DS on 17th April that a few hundred workers of a garment factory gathered on an important road of the city leaving thousands of people stranded during busiest hours of the day.

The government should take stern action against the people responsible for this sort of obstruction to our day-to-day life. The problem was created by the owners of the apparel factories for their non-payment of salaries to the workers.//////I cannot understand why the PCB is insisting on our team's going to Pakistan. They have also threatened us that they will break all ties with Bangladesh if our team don't tour to Pakistan. My question is have they broken ties with all the Test playing nations?

I don't think Pakistan can guarantee 100% safety of our players. Who will take the responsibility if our players are attacked by insurgents and they lose their lives?//////A short write-up and small photograph of the product (echo sheet), were published in a local English daily on 11th. April. This product has the potential to be produced locally and will be a very useful and echo-friendly substitute for plywood as well as plastic sheets! Interestingly, the product was launched in UK in January 2010, and after two years this is the first time that I came across this very interesting product which could be a popular and useful material for our housing, furniture and other sectors!

It chose the rental power station, fuelled by Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), as the model for quick implementation with a good reason. The country's remaining proven gas reserves of 12 TCF (trillion cubic feet) were badly needed for fertiliser production and generation in existing power plants, and there was no ready infrastructure for coal based power generation. Thus, HFO was the only viable option for quickly addressing power shortage. There were two additional advantages in rental power plants. Unlike coal, HFO is readily available fuel on the global spot market and the dispersed, small rental power plants were eminently suited to the country's weak power grid.//////On April 4, ////// reported that two Indian army units, a mechanised infantry formation from Hisar in Haryana and 50 Para Brigade from Agra, made an un-notified movement towards New Delhi on January 16. //////
