His most famous works were dialogues, i.e., they are presented as plays, representing discussions between advocates of two opposing points of view. For example, in 1632 he published Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, in which fictional proponents of the ancient Ptolemaic/Aristotelian theory and the modern Copernican theory present their cases, each trying to win over a third character who represented an unbiased observer. The "modernist" is called Salviati, presumably named after Filipo Salviati, who until his death in 1614 had been a close friend of Galileo's in Florence. The clear-thinking representative of the educated public is called Sagredo, after Galileo's former student Giovanfrancesco Sagredo of Venice, who had died in 1620. The pedantic Aristotelian of the trio is called Simplicio, apparently named after Simplicius, a Greek philosopher of the 6th century AD known for his commentaries on Aristotle.//////Traditional farming methods are crucial for protecting a number of threatened bird species in the developing world, including bustards, cranes, ibises and vultures, a study has found.//////The frigid waters of the Southern Ocean don't slow Antarctic octopuses down, even though their nervous systems are governed by the same genetic instructions as their tropical counterparts.

In his nine scrolls known as The Histories, Herodotus described the conflict between his own people, the Greeks, and the Persian Empire. While telling the story of their own civilization in conflict with another, many people would be inclined to take sides, but Herodotus strove to show each side's perspective in the struggle. In this, he was like the great poet Homer, but Herodotus innovated even further. Homer wrote his epic as if narrated by a goddess; Herodotus spoke with his own voice, and relayed his own experiences and research.//////
