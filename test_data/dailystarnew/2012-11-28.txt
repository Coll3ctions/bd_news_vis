On the day of Ashura this year, the relatives and family members of the victims of two fatal accidents in our country were trying to identify their near and dear ones among the dead.

Maybe, your esteemed daily could help them with internet facilities and a computer to give them wider nationwide connectivity.

For all our vaunted talk of democratic values, we as a people remain fundamentally incapable of stomaching any criticism.//////We highly appreciate the decision of the government that there will be no reservation for lawmakers in private school admission process. On the contrary, 5% quotas for children and grandchildren of freedom fighters have been kept in the amended policy. It is also learnt from newspapers that the officials and employees of the education ministry would have the 2% quota benefit in the said arrangement. Perhaps this could not satisfy the guardians of the admission seeking students. This may tarnish the image of the government. As lawmakers are not going to enjoy this advantage, the employees of the ministry should not be provided with such opportunity. All decisions regarding the admission procedure should be pragmatic. So our humble request to the ministry is to please make a healthy competitive environment in the admission process. Hope the authorities would kindly consider the aspiration of the commoners.//////Children's Day is observed across the world to celebrate childhood and create awareness about children's welfare.

Losing a father or guardian, a number of children have to run their family instead of going to school. Many of them get involved in crimes and anti-social activities. We should extend our helping hands towards them for ensuring a better future for them.//////Here are some comments that came in response to Tuesday's The Daily Star news report headlined Grief-struck//////Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi faced nationwide protests yesterday after digging in his heels over a controversial decree granting him sweeping powers, in the most divisive crisis since he took power in June.//////Is the man who would be king tired of waiting his turn?//////Syrian aircraft attacked towns in the country's north and east and killed at least five people in a strike on an olive oil press as fighting raged in the capital Damascus yesterday, opposition activists said.//////The remains of iconic Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were exhumed yesterday, eight years after his death, with experts set to test for signs that he was poisoned.//////Palestinian diplomats on Monday released a draft resolution on a bid for UN recognition as the United States again warned that a successful vote this week could cost the Palestinians dearly in US aid cash.//////The leader of Nepal's Maoists proposed a new unity government yesterday, offering political rivals the pick of the top cabinet posts in a bid to end a deadlock crippling the restive Himalayan nation.//////Greece won breathing space yesterday with long-frozen eurozone loans to restart from December and a first clear admission that a chunk of the country's debt burden will need to be written off down the line.//////Pakistan's umbrella Taliban faction yesterday claimed responsibility for planting a bomb under the car of a prominent journalist and TV anchorman and threatened a second assassination bid.//////'For standing up to the Taliban, and everything they represent' made Malala Yousafzai, the 15-year-old child activist from Swat Valley, shine on the number 6 spot of the Top 100 Global Thinkers list.//////Vietnamese border guards yesterday said they were refusing to stamp entry visas into controversial new Chinese passports which feature a map of Beijing's claim to almost all of the South China Sea.//////North Korea could carry out a long-range missile test in the next three weeks, with new satellite images showing increased launch site activity, according to satellite operator DigitalGlobe Inc.//////Rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo yesterday said they would withdraw from Goma, a week after their capture of the key eastern city sparked fears of a new war in the volatile region.//////Four more Tibetans have set themselves alight in protest at China's rule, overseas media said yesterday, taking the total to more than 20 this month.//////The UN General Assembly on Monday passed its first resolution condemning female genital mutilation, which opponents say more than 140 million women worldwide have had to endure.//////Bengal ITC-SRA Classical Music Festival is being held in Dhaka this year.

The veteran politician and the veteran journalist have called for politics to be made formalin-free. Which is rather intriguing, considering that of late citizens have been wracked by thoughts of the damage being done to their health by fish and meat and vegetables treated with formalin. Something has indeed emerged from all this concern over how formalin may be pushing all of us to an early grave. In these past few weeks, with quite some degree of fanfare, ministers and other government functionaries have been going around distributing formalin detecting machines to be used in urban markets. Many among us have cheered.//////When Abraham Lincoln was told at the height of the devastating civil war that his most successful general, Ulysses Grant, was drinking too much he wanted to know the brand of Grant's favourite whisky so that he could send his general a few cases.
