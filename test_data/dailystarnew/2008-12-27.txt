However, recent trends, at least for some commodities, appear to be showing the reverse, with food prices increasing faster than incomes. Growing scarcities of water, land and fuel are likely to put increasing pressure on food prices, even without climate change. Additional pressures on these resources due to climate change, the introduction of mitigation practices that have the potential to create land use competition, and the attribution of market value to environmental services to mitigate climate change, also have the potential to cause significant changes in relative prices for different food items and an overall increase in the cost of an average food basket for the consumer.//////Weeks ago I went through the article 'Blazing Dhaka: An urban heat island' written by one of my departmental fellows in The Daily Star. It should undoubtedly be a great concern for the urban experts. The UHI is the worse outcome of urban metabolism process (exchange and transformation of material and energy flow) and is very much explicit in most of the densely built urban environments. But most of the economically developed countries are totally dependent on artificial air cooling system to get rid of the uncomfortable local climatic situation which again discharges waste energy in the atmosphere attributing to the global warming. Dhaka, unless address and takes proper initiatives to attenuate the impact of UHI, the city life will be really very much miserable and not unlikely that the city becomes abandoned while also facing other environmental issues as majority of city dwellers are not so rich to own AC and AC in every house in congested localities simply unbearable environmentally. //////In the hilly hamlet of Hoaikong in southeastern Bangladesh, villagers are used to welcoming new residents on a weekly basis. //////I could clearly see behind our house the ash heap beside which the huge date palm rose up into the sky, and in which the five ////// bird nests swayed in the breeze.

At noon, before we left for our mission, Nawsher Bhai, our group leader, came running to breathlessly inform us, I've got some good news for you fellows. //////After the news reached Calcutta of Dhaka's surrender there began victory celebrations. Thousands of people congregated at Theatre Road (where was housed the Provisional Government of Bangladesh). Spontaneous victory parades and marches came out joyously on roads and streets. Various leading figures and luminaries of West Bengal political parties, cultural and social organizations rushed over to Theatre Road to congratulate the leaders of the Provisional Government. During the whole nine months of the war the area of Theatre Road had been a security zone. Tajuddin's status had been like that of a secret refugee. But with the announcement of the fall of Dhaka, this secretiveness melted away in a flood of joy and celebration. Standing on the upper-storey verandah of the house at No. 8 Theater Road, Syed Nazrul Islam and Tajuddin Ahmed acknowledged the congratulations and gave thanks to a jubilant crowd by waving their hands. Calcutta's journalists and foreign correspondents jammed at Theatre Road. Sunlight sparkled on the whole area: A light that spread throughout the whole world--the joyous news of the liberation of a nation.//////The present volume of ////// began on an interesting note with the lead article by Sanatkumar Saha being on three celebrated English-language novels by Bangladeshis who were deemed by him to be probashis in various degrees: Monica Ali's //////, Abid Ali's Seasonal Adjustments and Tahmima Anam's ////// However, midway through the piece, the reviewer brought in a poetry volume of a Ms. Seema Nusrat Amin, ////// (Dhaka: OUP, 2005), which he then proceeded to discuss in the same terms as the other three. The inclusion of this volume and poet within this particular discussion was incomprehensible--in no way is it comparable with the other three. The sample lines of poetry from the book reinforced the above thought in no small measure: ...you, slim-twigged lavender birch/thrashed but rooted in the yellow sorrow/with you I have passed, these desert stars' harrow.... It immediately and conclusively rendered suspect the reviewer's ability to deliver credible critical assessment of South Asian English fiction.

Ershad knew he did not have the people's support. He looked for political roots, organizing heterogeneous elements willing to collaborate, even patronised a pliant opposition after fortifying power. As a popular move he downsized the districts to subdivisions, created upazillas and had elections. That some people still remember him, and he is a countable political force, is due to his people friendly activities in spite of the convictions and allegations. //////MANY countries around the world today possess or have the means to acquire weapons of mass destruction. They may be nuclear, chemical, biological or other types of weapons, which can be delivered through diversified ways. It is mainly the more powerful and wealthy nations that have such weapons although some poorer nations are also obtaining them. In recent years, there have been several movements and treaties to facilitate control of the flow and deployment of arms, be they landmines, small arms, or weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear weapons though most of these are considered as controversial. Disarmament is now an issue that cannot be found even in a fairy tale now. //////The US President-elect Barrack Obama has promised not only the scrutiny of the national defense strategy but also of some of the leading defense acquisition programmes of the previous regime - programmes that promised to shape the future direction as well the deployment capabilities of the US military over the next two to three decades.//////A test launch of Russia's new Bulava submarine-based intercontinental ballistic missile has failed, which will further delay this effort to revamp Moscow's aging nuclear deterrent.//////An Iranian warship has entered the Gulf of Aden to protect Iranian vessels against pirates off the coast of Somalia, state radio said on Dec. 20.

Iran said last month it was negotiating with pirates who seized a ship it had chartered but that it was ready to use force to free the vessel.//////In //////, Dani Johnson presents a subject matter that is as old as time itself but in a sparklingly refreshing manner. Her overriding message throughout the book is that human life has a definite purpose which a person may not be aware of because oftentimes we tend to live or rather prefer to live in a status quo, but for the realization of which we must seek God, the Supreme, the Ultimate. From her deep conviction, the author avers that in spite of one's having ability, skill and other qualities, one shall not have wholeness of life until and unless one surrenders oneself to Him and puts in efforts to be the best according to His will. The advice 'submit oneself' to God recurs throughout the book and Johnson makes the meaning of the word 'submit' very explicit, that is, to respect and honour. She urges, 'accept instructions from His mouth and lay up His words in your heart.' Then again she adds, 'God doesn't make you submit. He gives you the choice'. And whenever a person chooses to submit to Him, miracles occur in life. She further says that one has to ask for His help and for miracles to happen in one's life, to one's people. The word 'life', according to the author, refers to all areas of life that are physical, mental, emotional, social, relational and, she adds emphatically, financial as well. Her resounding advice is to seek God whole-heartedly and totally unconditionally for all time so that the maxim, "Many are called but few are chosen" flashes incessantly in one's vision and one is ready to be chosen. //////The more one reads the more one is convinced of how less one really knows.
