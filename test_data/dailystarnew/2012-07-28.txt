At 8:12 am on Friday morning, all the bells in England rang. Martin Creed's signature Work Number 1197 rang in the 30th Olympiad to the only city that has so far played host to it thrice. In the evening, another bell rang. This, the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world, part of Danny Boyle's three-hour three-act magnum opus of an opening ceremony kicked off the London 2012 games in style. //////The Detective Branch of police nabbed six people and recovered fake currency amounting to Tk 1 crore from their possessions in separate drives in the capital between Thursday afternoon and early yesterday.//////The World Bank is still not satisfied with Bangladesh's anti-corruption move over the Padma bridge issue despite the resignation of a key minister.//////The power distributors are persuading Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (Berc) to increase bulk and retail electricity tariff by 30 to 35 percent by mid-August to cover their losses.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's remarks on Syed Abul Hossain's resignation have drawn flak from the main opposition BNP as it termed the former communications minister a corrupt and shameless person.//////The constitution does not support Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's remark made in London Thursday that the next general election would be held as per the parliamentary democratic system in other countries.//////Cuba's communist regime marked 59 years Thursday since the launch of the revolution that brought it to power, using the occasion to offer to hold talks with its longtime foe, the United States.//////The price of bottled soybean oil yesterday slid slightly in the city's kitchen markets thanks to an increase in supplies from the major refiners. //////A rickshaw puller died a tragic death yesterday when a fellow rickshaw puller hit him during a punch-up over overtaking on the Dhaka University campus.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said her government was determined to keep the country's electoral process neutral and free from government interference.//////Failing to bring some political parties into the BNP-led alliance, the main opposition party is now trying to persuade them to go for an anti-government movement simultaneously after the Eid-ul-Fitr. //////Being mysteriously silent for years, Rajuk only a couple of months ago passed the issue of controversial allotment of 55 housing plots in Banani to influential BNP people to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).//////Members of Indian Border Security Force (BSF) tortured a Bangladeshi cattle trader to death on Wednesday night and threw his body into the Saniyazan river along Burimari border in Patgram upazila here.//////Police yesterday arrested three leaders of Chhatra League and Jubo League in Tangail on charge of abduction.//////Shift workers are slightly more at risk of having a heart attack or stroke than day workers, research suggests.//////Dhaka Medical College Hospital authorities and journalists yesterday submitted applications to withdraw the four cases filed against each other over Wednesday's incident in which interns assaulted at least eight newsmen. //////The drought in America's breadbasket is intensifying at an unprecedented rate, experts warned Thursday, driving concern food prices could soar if crops in the world's key producer are decimated.//////Pakistan's de facto interior minister, a close aide to President Asif Ali Zardari, was sworn back into parliament yesterday just weeks after being forced to step down over his alleged British citizenship.//////This year is no different from years gone by when the many utility agencies commence their various repairs works that involve digging up roads and leaving them in a state of disrepair after completion of the job at hand. Interestingly, practically all the agencies, whether it be the laying of new water pipes by WASA or the repair of gas lines, work during the rainy season that not only prolongs the particular job at hand but adds to the misery of city dwellers who must travel through sludge or mud ridden roads. The incidents of accidents increase manifold as vehicles get either stuck or overturn as they run over pot holes; while the average pedestrian must count extra pennies and countless hours having to ride rickshaws to get from Point A to B, since roads are inundated by the downpour. //////It is highly disconcerting to learn that 6,000 Machine Readable Passports (MRP) have been stolen from the Agargaon passport office.

The team management expects much of Rohit in the 2015 World Cup and will back him "as much as possible", according to opening batsman Gautam Gambhir. Tiwary is sure to get opportunities, but whether it comes in the next game or the next series, "no one knows," Gambhir said. So basically, Rohit has the faith; Tiwary can keep the bench.//////The French Football Federation says it has banned midfielder Samir Nasri for three matches because of his behaviour toward a journalist at the European Championship.//////Roger Federer insists his Wimbledon triumph should serve as a warning to his Olympic rivals that age won't be a barrier to his dream of winning a gold medal at the All England Club.//////Jamaica's former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell conceded that the London Games probably represents his last chance of erasing previous disappointments in two Olympic finals.//////Jamaican track star Usain Bolt could win four track golds at the Olympics after admitting he may run the 4x400 metres relay.//////Abdul Hamid, noted sports commentator and one of the pioneers in sports journalism in the country, is in a serious condition in a local hospital of the capital. //////Hafizul Islam Chapal maintained his solo lead in the Metropolitan Selection Chess Tournament at the close of the sixth round at the Bangladesh Chess Federation hall room yesterday.//////Pouli Bulbul Club defeated Dashara Nabajagaran Sangsad 1-0 in the opening match of the DFA Cup Football Tournament at //////Bangladesh Football Federation yesterday announced a 32-member preliminary squad for the 2nd SAFF Women's Football Championship which will be held in Sri Lanka from September 7 to 16.//////Star-studded Brazil survived a second-half fightback by Egypt to win their men's Olympic football opener 3-2 in Cardiff on Thursday.//////The eight-day Olympic swimming programme starts with a bang on Saturday with US star Michael Phelps and his arch rival Ryan Lochte on a collision course in the men's 400m individual medley.//////The Olympic torch relay has completed its 70-day tour, the final leg having been finished by royal barge on London's River Thames in front of tens of thousands of enthusiastic spectators.//////Saudi Arabia have complained to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after judo fighter Wojdan Shaherkani was banned from wearing the hijab head scarf during competition.//////The Greek triple jumper expelled from the Olympics for sending a racist tweet about African immigrants and the West Nile virus is speaking out against the decision to ban her from competition in London.//////Defending double sprint champion Usain Bolt will be Jamaica's flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, an official said Thursday.//////If all goes to plan for Great Britain, Mark Cavendish will win his first gold medal of the Games as he crosses the finish line at The Mall in the Men's road race event.

In each of his performance he tells wonderful stories with the help of his graceful body movements. Abhinaya or expressional acting plays a very important role in his style. He states, Dance is a type of acting. It is through these expressions that we can reach the audience and explain the whole theme. That is why perfection during limb movements and facial expressions is significant.//////A report in a daily newspaper informs us that the government has upgraded the post of police inspector to class one from class two, and those of sergeant and sub-inspector to class two from class three. According to one considered view, this up-gradation will have very significant impact on the morale of policemen and thus on the overall law and order administration. One has to wait to see the outcome. There is, however, no denying that the present government has taken a laudable step by fulfilling a long-felt demand of mainstream policing.//////Perhaps the question is not asked as often as it should be because the answer is either unexpected or unwelcome. Does a prime minister become stronger or weaker after re- election? The record, across the world of democracy, is heavily weighted in favour of pessimism. What should be a rejuvenation gradually slips into an unsavoury confusion. The reason lies in the leader rather than the system. The agenda of a first term is driven primarily by the perfectly legitimate ambition to return to office. It, therefore, encourages a practical programme of governance rooted in the public's immediate needs. A second term breeds both exhaustion and complacency: After the high of re-election there seems nowhere to go except downhill. A democracy like America has ended the very concept of a third term; in India, no national government has obtained one after Jawaharlal Nehru, and that was half a century ago.//////I have followed the life and works of Professor Paul Krugman with great admiration. I admire him not because he is a Nobel Prize winner in Economics, nor because of the twenty odd books that he has written on this subject, nor because of his innumerable opinion pieces published in the New York Times.//////The very genesis of Bangladesh occurred from violent and bloody oppression, for which the only means of survival was to meet violence with more violence. But in its infancy, rather than proffering a forgiving hand and choosing to seek justice while retaining a moral high ground, some in the nation resorted to revenge and retribution as detestable as the inhumane slaughter perpetuated by Pakistan. One cannot help but think that the present day propensity to violent retaliation was tragically born in the moments when Bangladesh lost its innocence -- the executions on Dhaka's playing fields set a precedent and a significant minority became prone to resolving internal problems through fights, torture, assassination and murder.//////In the past few weeks, winds of change have appeared to be sweeping across North Korea, a country sealed from the rest of the world.//////1794//////Maximilien Robespierre and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just are executed by guillotine in Paris during the French Revolution.//////A cultural legend breathed his last on Thursday last week. He was our best known writer. He was a phenomenon. He was only sixty three. ////// Talented people do not die like ordinary ones: they mostly die at the height of glory and that has been the case with Humayun, the writer of the people. He could have given us more books, could have made some more films. But would we have liked him to give us one hundred percent and then wither away into old age? That would have been unfortunate. No, he left us unfulfilled and therein lies the charm, the allure. They say, too much of a good thing spoils the magic, and so, believing in that, let's accept one thing: leaving a little early, he fell short of utilising his full potential and possibly an eventual burnout. This present feeling of non-fulfillment has managed to maintain his mystique. Needless to say, without that, a writer is brought down to banality. //////Eleven years ago, one of the literary luminaries of Bangladesh, Ahmed Sofa, died a rather premature death at the age of 58. As we recall him today, one particular characteristic of Sofa instantly creeps into the mind: his contribution to promoting budding talents, mixing with the younger generation and his ability to exhibit a natural affinity with people much younger than he.//////Viral hepatitis kills about one million people every year. In addition, an estimated 500 million people experience chronic illness from their infection with hepatitis. It is a major cause of liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.

In both elections, Freedom and Justice (F & J) Party, an offspring of Muslim Brotherhood, has won victory. Despite overwhelming majority, a big question looms large now-a-days whether Egypt is turning to a theocratic state under the Islamists. Apprehending F & J's religious ideology, the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) dissolved people's assembly on June 15 following a verdict by the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC). After taking oath as the president, Professor Dr. Mohamed Morsi issued a presidential decree annulled SCAF's decision. This power struggle between the elected president and SCAF casts shadow on the emerging democracy of Egypt.//////US secretary of Navy Ray Mabus paid a 'silent' but significant visit to Dhaka. There are two aspects regarding the media attention to this news -- one, this visit got less attention than it actually deserved and then, it got better attention in foreign news agencies than the news agencies of Bangladesh. On the contrary, this visit has a huge significance if we consider the developments that have been taking place in South Asia and in South East Asia for last few months. Almost a month before a news jolted the ministry of foreign affairs in Bangladesh. This news was regarding harbouring of US Seventh Fleet in Chittagong. An Indian news agency claimed that the US had proposed Bangladesh to harbour its Seventh Fleet in Chittagong. But Bangladesh completely refuted the claim. Now, how should this visit be taken in the backdrop of such complex developments?//////Trade analysts are opining that the border trades are increasing worldwide for global repositioning of financial structure and changes in trading system.////// (Honourable Prime Minister) is a collection of four plays by Raahman Chowdhury, which was published by ARIAL in December 2011. All the four plays in this collection were published earlier. ////// was published in 2000 by Protibuddhijeebee Prokashan, ////// in 2004 in the Theatre, a quarterly magazine edited by Ramendu Majumder, ////// in 2011 in the Natun Diganto, a quarterly journal edited by Serajul Islam Choudhury, and ////// in 2011 in Ferari, a bimonthly literary magazine. His plays are political in content and western in form. Raahman Chowdhury believes that there is no great play in the world that is not political. And he admits proudly, 'I do not have the ability to compose plays that do not deal with political and state affairs.' (preface to the book). The political connection in these four plays is not at all remote or hidden. They can rather be categorized as direct political plays. //////Unlike Grisham's many books, A Painted House does not run with crime in focus. Grisham's fans would find a deviation in this story and yet the book is a spellbinder with the saga of the rural South in the US. It is a remarkable family story that explores deep the lives of the cotton planters in the South. Set in the mid fifties of the 19th century it is the story of a boy's journey from innocence to experience. However, the book does hold a touch of mystery that gives the whole story an element of relishing suspense.//////Last year I was taking an interview of Syed Manzoorul Islam, a prolific litterateur of Bangladesh. At one point I questioned him on how he looked at Rabindranath. He said he never compared Tagore with other world litterateurs. And he believes that though Tagore is termed as a world poet, he together with his thoughts is deeply rooted in our soil. It is rare that Tagore leaves his root in any of his literary works. The essence of Syed Islam's saying is truly reflected in the book, ////// (Tagore: Speeches at Home) by Hasan Hafiz. This piece comprises the speeches of Rabindranath Tagore that were rendered at different times in India and Bangladesh. The speeches are mostly concentrated on matters like literature, education, religion, secularism, development of rural life and so on. Hasan Hafiz, a poet of the 1970s, juxtaposes Tagore's diversified thoughts which he has expressed in his speeches, with brilliance and concrete understanding. At the outset the point which Hasan Hafiz grabs from Tagore's vast volume of speeches is Tagore's belief in non-dependence on foreign assistance. In fact, Tagore believes in self-power as well as self-dependence. Tagore delivered some of his more insightful and encouraging speeches at some particular places, namely, Dhaka, Sylhet and Mymensingh. And these speeches rejuvenate the things mentioned in earlier. //////
