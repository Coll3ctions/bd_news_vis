In the conspicuous absence of decisive crime busting operations, criminals are apparently getting more organised, reckless and innovative every day in carrying out activities that range from petty mugging, kidnapping and looting to gunning down of victims. Only the other day, in broad daylight, extortionists gunned down the father-in-law of a garment exporter who had refused to give them money as per their demand.

What startled me was a question of propriety. We have often to grapple with the question because what might be perfectly all right in a particular context could be singularly inappropriate in another. //////THE results of the five-phase national elections in India will be made known from today. Major players have already begun their exercises, covertly or overtly, to form the new government even though they are publicly maintaining their hitherto known postures about their political opponents.

Delay the charge. Today, Tendulkar tried to make a laboratory experiment of it. It was a high-risk approach that was simply enthralling to watch. When is he going to go for it? Surely, he has left it for too late? Tendulkar had squeezed himself and Sanath Jayasuriya in the middle-order as Mumbai had been choking whenever the duo failed at the top.//////If Australia's selectors are chasing Shaun Tait for a recall in September he might be a bit hard to find.

Returning as Brown's Robert Langdon -- Harvard professor, symbologist and accident al hero -- Hanks is occasionally charming, when he is not busy explaining the history of the Roman Catholic Church and/or Western art.

This year it has become the country's most serious crisis, more than ////// From being a necessity, water has now become a luxury. //////IRAN has been in the news for the last few weeks -- particularly so after the recent overture made towards it by the new US administration. US policymakers are taking special interest knowing that Iran's neutrality is crucial not only for continuing stability in Iraq, as the US disengages from that country, but also to contain the deterioration in Afghanistan, a consequence of a resurgent Taleban. The US government has also said that it is going to join the talks between Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Syria and Turkey have also lent their support to bring about a rapprochement between Iran and the USA.//////ALMOST on the Jessore-Narail highway, bordering Narail district, lies the quiet Bhangra village of Jessore Bagharpara upazila.

So far, I have not been a very enthusiastic supporter of his new project, since I am aware that independent booksellers have been fast disappearing from the US map. According to the American Booksellers Association, the number of independent bookstores has plummeted from about 6,000 in the early 1990s to 2,200 today. In the current economic situation, more stores will be closing their doors as they fail to cope with declining readership and the onslaught of the likes of Amazon.com. And even the ones that might survive, such as Barnes & Noble and Borders, will do so only because they are diversifying, have customer loyalty, and are retail chains themselves. The era of the neighbourhood bookshop or the true mom 'n pop bookstore is at an end.//////We were in Sylhet as a part of an office retreat in a job I had some time back. On that particular afternoon there were four of us in the car: our office driver Helal, myself and two of my co-workers, Minhaz and Shafik.

In the last few months, the media has published series of reports and news items, many based on statements of Ministers that would suggest that Bangladesh is in imminent threat from Islamic militancy. At the time the intelligence agencies discovered a huge arsenal of arms and ammunitions in a remote village in Barisal and linked it to a Bangladesh born British national. Some concluded that the Qaumi Madrassas (QM) were hotbeds of Islamic militancy. The WB report contradicts most of these allegations.//////NEWS from Pakistan over the last few months kept getting worse. The threat posed by the Taliban and their Al-Qaeda sponsor have been growing everyday. Vast swath of northern territory in the Federally Administered Tribal Agency (FATA) as well as parts of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) is virtually outside the control of the government. Militant leaders, each with his well-armed militias, have declared their own Emirates. The Taliban incursion into once-peaceful valley of Swat has been particularly brutal; they destroyed hundreds of schools, especially girls' schools. Banks and treasuries have been looted and people terrorized by arbitrary killing, whipping and other cruel punishment. All men have been forced to grow beard and women driven inside the Burqa. Pakistan government's policy of appeasement has only emboldened the militants. Since the joint declaration by President Obama, Zardari and Hamid Karzai on 5 May '09, a renewed offensive started in Swat. But how long the steam will last is a big question. The situation is particularly perilous in view of the nuclear weapons in Pakistan's possession. The West is worried about the disposal of the nuclear weapons if the militants come to power in Islamabad or a right wing coup takes place.//////The US Army general in charge of training and equipping the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) has described the unveiling of President Barak Obama's new Afpak strategy in March as a potential "tipping point" in US and Nato efforts in Afghanistan.//////India successfully launched its first all-weather Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) built imaging satellite on 20 April, which will enable it to closely monitor its restive and porous borders with its neighbours.//////Looking through the prism of life these days, one wonders how far one has strayed from one's roots, become oblivious of the glory that was there in the past that constitutes one's existence. With this feeling and realization that emanates from it when one looks back, one sees trails of stories both elating and saddening that are stashed in every nook and cranny of predominantly rural Bangladesh. One such village lying by the river Gorai in Kushtia is Koya --- an appealing name in itself that moulds an image of a tiny chirping bird in the vision of this reviewer. It takes someone with an immense sense of responsibility and a heart full of passion to weave the things that, although discrete in terms of chronology, are yet arranged into a colourful tapestry. Rakibul Hassan has fulfilled just this task in a masterly way. //////Kabir Chowdhury is perhaps one of the last of our men of letters who have known history as well as have a hand in the making of it. He defies age (he is in his mid eighties) and he continues to make his presence felt when it comes to raising and popularizing issues of public interest. He has taught literature, has had a stint in government; and his has over the years been one of the loudest voices in defence of the demand for a trial of the war criminals in Bangladesh's war of liberation in 1971.////// reminds the reader of an acknowledged truth that as human beings we are always pursuing happiness in life. Betsy, the sixteen year old young woman, is doing just that, pursuing happiness after the death of her mother. Betsy Irving, her teenager brother and her father are left in a house that seems to echo with the memories of her mother with each and every breath. The troubles and grief the family goes through is touching enough to hold the reader glued as if he or she is a part of the Irving family. Most of all the doubts, the confusions of the motherless young girl do not fail to touch parental hearts. It is a touching story of love and loss taking part in Morrisville, New Jersey.//////
