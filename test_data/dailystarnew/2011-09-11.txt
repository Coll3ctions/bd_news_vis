There is that darkness about it, that bizarre undertone, which envelopes it in its many dimensions and reminds us of the ugliness that some people have always descended to in their efforts to stymie the voices of other people. You tend to feel that Hobbes was right, that men are nasty, brutish, short. No matter how much you idealise men and consider humanity to be a sublime instance of Creation, there is something about human behaviour, indeed about human nature, which leaves you questioning the very principle on which life was shaped -- only to be destroyed in bits and pieces, through the sheer malignity of those uncomfortable with the worldview of others. Intolerance, then, has through the rough passages of time laid humanity low, at the many bends of the river.//////
