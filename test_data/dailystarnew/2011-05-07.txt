Both the materials and their condition are important aspect of the environment. Nature can change naturally as considered by paleo-environmental scientists. Climate of the earth changed many times. Extinction of dinosaurs is supposed to linked with change of local climate. That is a different thing. But that due to human intervention environmental conditions are being changed is vital concern for existence of many organisms. //////Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941), the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize, created much enthrallment among the European and American communities after the publication of the ////// (Song Offerings), in November 1912 from the India Society of London. A novelist, short story writer, playwright, composer and essayist, Rabindranath was an educationist, actor and organiser as well. And all these made this myriad-minded literary personality well known across the western zone of the globe. The sharpness of his philosophical height demanded many documents on him which resulted in many biographies of the poet being published, not to mention the memoirs of the bard. //////My first encounter with Rabindranath Tagore was on a cold winter's day in early 1964. He was there as a sketch in pencil, on the mantelpiece of a Bengali home in Quetta. The flowing beard, the penetrating eyes, that sense of gravitas --- all of this came alive in that sketch. I asked the host, a colleague of my father's, who the gentleman was in the sketch. A great man, said he. He is Rabindranath Tagore, a poet. Young as I was, in primary school, I asked no more questions.//////Mothers always put family and children first.

But this relationship couldn't reach its zenith because of consistent ignorance from intellectuals to popular leaders and mass media over the years. In Bangladesh public perceptions are too much influenced by the concept of 'great power' or 'super power'. If Rajapaksa were the premier of any great or super power he could attract huge media coverage. There could have been a buzz for days before his arrival. In Bangladesh a popular mindset works when it comes to India, Pakistan, China or USA. The media jump upon Ministry of Foreign Affairs and intellectuals start to talk in many seminars-forums about upcoming heads of government of the above mentioned countries. This zeal doesn't work for other states like Sri Lanka. What I say is that all these are common popular blunder. When it comes to bilateral relations, it comes with an option to achieve whosoever is in the other side. Eventually we forget that in the negotiation table with great or super power on the other side is not always necessarily helping us to gain; rather we sacrifice our interest. On the contrary, when there is an opposition with equal status then we have greater chance to gain. That's why states like Sri Lanka should get no less attention from our leaders and media.//////Obama and Osama. Two names that will henceforth be coupled. The hunter, Obama, is leader of the most powerful and feared nation on earth.

Most of us also think of the language movement as a quest for national identity. Twenty-first February 1952 stands out as a symbol of both. It speaks for Bengali language and identity. Does it also speak for other languages in the world?//////You could choose to expend this effort: propose in a scholarly undertaking that the security of an ant is a function of human security, send it to UNDP and a host of human security theorists, and the possibility cannot be ruled out that your hypothesis could figure prominently in the glittering array of human security theories and what they entail that have been offered down the years. Or, maybe not! I am being cynical, but, upon going through //////, I am totally bewildered at just how vast a range of topics human security theories cover. Seemingly, almost anything and everything under the sun! Pardon the hyperbole.//////Not all old people could go to the Palm, a retirement home in Tampa, Florida. Those who had saved up for the retirement nest were the lucky ones for it was a special home for the old. And it became even better after Dr. Andy Zorn joined as its director. ////// is the story of the retirement home with its different occupants. It is the story of the old people's joys and sorrows and their hopes and disappointments. It is the story of how the protagonist Dr. Zorn makes the home lovable for everyone; the quiet and subdued ones, the boisterous and noisy ones. It is also a home for the octogenarians who get together to build a wooden airplane. It is the story of old ladies who were glad that a whole battalion of rowdy grandchildren visiting them left at the end of the day. Dr. Zorn was determined to make the old home a success story as he started his work with a team of efficient staff, especially Krenek, the manager who was the backbone of the place and Norse Varney, the nurse who worked miracles with the occupants. //////
