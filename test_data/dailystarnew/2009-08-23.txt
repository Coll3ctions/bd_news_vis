That says something about the stark realities citizens are faced with even as Ramadan begins today. Indeed, every experience of Ramadan for a number of years has been excruciating for people because of the abnormal rise in prices they have been put through due to a mismatch between demand and supply. However, this year the supply side has been stronger and there has been no dearth of commodities in the market. That being the case, why this rise in prices? In the first place, there is the extortion traders are subjected to as they carry their goods to their ultimate destination. In the second, there is the arbitrary fixing of prices by retail shopkeepers. Obviously, these realities raise quite a few serious questions that call for equally serious and effective answers. And they do because at this stage there is hardly any way for anyone to point the way out for citizens.//////IT seems the government is resolute and appears to mean business with its latest initiative to bring order in city traffic. It has decided to drive out road unworthy, unlicensed and old vehicles from the streets. But it is a tall order given their swarming the city after each short-lived, failed attempt to flush them out. //////THE Members of Parliament (MPs) in a democracy are elected mainly for framing laws in parliament as well as bringing the various problems of their constituency to the notice of the government for redress. The problems may relate to the development of the area the MP in question represents or other issues that affects the lives of the electorate. In any advanced democracy such as in the United Kingdom (UK), an MP looks after such problems of the electorate. In this connection, tax related issues, for example, inland revenue, customs, excise, health service, social security issues including pension or insurance, immigration, grants for schools and so on come within the purview of an MP's areas of concern. It is important to note that in all these cases, the problems to be addressed should be within the jurisdiction of the central government, for the MP will not interfere with the issues addressed by the local government. //////THE aggravated tragedy for the Bangladeshi society is that even thirty-four years after the deplorable assassination of the iconic leader of our national emancipation, there are ludicrous and demeaning efforts to compare Bangabandhu with others who perhaps, at best, will find mention in the footnotes of our history.//////THERE is a foolproof way of gauging mainstream America's interest in the rest of the world; through the New York Times crossword puzzle.

India is an older, but static and occasional, story glimpsed occasionally through "Agra," routed either via the Taj Mahal or Slumdog Millionaire.

President Barrack Obama rightly called Yunus, An agent of change. //////Last weekend I paid a visit to a place that represent our glorious history of 1971.The place is Rayerbazar Boddhobhumi, the place where intellectuals were brutally killed in 1971 by coward Pakistani soldiers. To honour the heroes the government has built a memorial on the bank of a river. The shape of the memorial resembles a mountain having a window on chest. With ceramic brick construction, it seems wearing a blood gown. It carries great significance along with its endless beauty. When the sun sets, it seems to see the martyrs through the window.//////The USA and the West always talk about democracy. They more or less practice this theory in their own territory. They even try to teach us democracy when they find any occasion. But do they believe in democracy from their core of mind? They often behave in most undemocratic ways with the underdeveloped countries. //////We have become a rough and rude people. There is impoliteness, harshness, violence and brutality everywhere. A look at our daily life or at any newspaper on any day will confirm this. If we are satisfied with the way we are, there is nothing more to say about it. However, if we feel that we need and want to change our ways, we have to think of the means of bringing about the change. I think our education can and must play a crucial role in this matter.//////Who can tell me how & why the name of the popular centre of meetings & fairs got a new name? Was it necessary at all? Do we not cut a sorry figure to the contributor! It was built by our good friends 'the Chinese' and as I knew so long it was a total package of a gift from one of our best friendly countries and their people. If the ruling govt. wanted to name another landmark after it's founder, no one would have objected. In fact we need several such venues of international standard.//////What is the national priority at this moment? If we go by the political language the 1st point will be poverty elimination, 2nd place will be taken by "Food for all" 3rd will be "education for all, 4th will be housing for all, 5th will be electricity for all etc. But to our surprise, none of the above issues are addressed properly, this is probably due to the fact that after the government took over the responsibility of serving the people (though they say assuming power) the above points are often issued and addressed during seminars and symposiums and most disappointingly at the public meetings. In reality what percentage of the government's success has actually taken place is what we like to know through the media. All the past governments hardly bothered to publish any documents and since a lot is expected from this government due to their huge majority and pre-election commitments, we certainly would like to see a report rather than been informed in public meetings what or how much they have achieved in the last 07 months form their oath taking.//////It is not a matter of preference at all. It is a matter of reality that AH enters from India crossing the western border of our country. I think it is also not a matter of preference, rather it is pragmatic that AH enters Myanmar, the only other common boarder country of Bangladesh. Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand are the member countries of BIMST-EC which has further development plan for AH network.

Firstly, as a north-America resident of Bangladeshi roots I am delighted to hear the news because it can cut my journey by as much as 40%. Secondly as a well-wisher of the ailing carrier, I look forward to this becoming a profitable route. Thirdly, I question why the flight has to make a stop on-route to Dhaka from New York based on both technical and business reasons.//////On last 6 July, the cabinet approved a draft law to ensure security of the family members of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with immediate effect. This step has been rejected by most of the people as two online polls run by newspapers show. The prime minister of Bangladesh gets water tight security ex officio, so there is no need to change or enact any law in this regard. Furthermore, it seems inappropriate when overall public security is creaking .
