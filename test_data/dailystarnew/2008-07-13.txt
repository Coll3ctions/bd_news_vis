In the year and a half gone by, cases have declined from a staggering 35,000 to a mere 4,164. Now that surely looks like progress, brought about of course not through a disposal of cases but by a reduction in the workload relating to investigations. And if indeed the number of cases pending investigation have come down to that level in accordance with standard procedure, the police department deserves to be congratulated. We expect that this kind of performance, based on a proper screening of cases in future, will eventually turn out to be a permanent feature of police administration.//////AS far as population growth is concerned, Bangladesh is not on the right track. The country with a land area of only about 55 thousand square miles is home to nearly 15 crore people. And to refresh our memory, Bangladesh's population was 7.5 crore in 1971. According to standards set by the developed countries, especially those in the west, we are one of the most populous countries in the world. If we take into account the availability of agriculture land, sweet water sources, cattle-head, forests and other natural resources, it will be extremely difficult to accommodate and feed the population if it continues to grow at such a pace, that is doubling in 30 plus years. //////ENERGY is an integral input to modern life. The lack of it could also thwart thumping victories with equal force. The energy crisis all over the world has already demonstrated it. In fact, per capita consumption of energy level would go to explain the level of development of a country. //////THE recent events in South Asia are disturbing. At a time when the Saarc nations are preparing to hold their next summit shortly and the environment ministers of the Saarc member nations just had their meeting at Dhaka in which critical issues of adverse effects of climate change and the need for ensuring food security were discussed, the terrorist attack on the Indian embassy at Kabul followed by Afghan official accusation that Pakistan intelligence agency ISI was involved in the carnage that took the lives of some Indian diplomats and injured many Afghans waiting at the embassy for visa to visit India does not augur well for cementing the bonds of cooperation in the regional organisation. //////THERE were no heated arguments, no throwing up of papers, no walk-out. The Congress tricked the Left parties and held no final meeting of the co-ordination committee. It was here that the ruling Congress was to inform the Left whether it was going ahead with the nuclear deal with the US or not.

It is pathetic and frustrating to discover that within less than 40 years we managed to increase our population by 150 percent, while retaining the position as one of the least developed countries with a poor literacy rate. Did we, as citizens, think about the consequences of this population boom? The present scarcity of food, road space, educational and medical resources and the rising unemployment leading to degradation of law and order situation is caused by the population boom. //////With a heavy heart, I would like to pay the highest tribute to the top commander of the joint Bangladesh and Indian forces of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, Field Marshal (then General and Indian army chief) Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw (1914 - 2008) and all his brave 'boys' (and also the Bangladesh and Indian Navy and Air personnel of '71) for swiftly defeating the organised evil of the Pakistan army in Bangladesh. They acted under the wise leadership of premiers Indira Gandhi (India) and Tajuddin Ahmed (Bangladesh) in a hostile international situation. Shrewd war planning and its execution by Manekshaw's team saved millions of innocent lives from the hands of the Pakistani troops. //////Water logging is a common sight in Dhaka city in the rainy season. And no effective and sustainable measures are ever adopted to prevent it. The situation has become critical. Dhaka is surrounded by various rivers but there is no way to discharge water through the drainage system into the rivers. //////With a deep sense of helplessness and regret, we observe and undergo, on a regular basis, the perils of commuting. Take the bus fare and the new system introduced for the commuters' convenience, for example, in Chittagong. There are as many as four to five bus routes here, but the number of buses operating appears to be extremely inadequate. As a result, along with the new arrangement for buying tickets, passengers have to undergo some unprecedented trouble: a passenger on the route 10, for example, has two or three different bus services available. //////I would like our govt. to carefully understand the following problems they are shortly going to face://////The train has derailed and we have to just place it on the right track. //////A letter from a very distinguished professor in your daily's letter page suggesting use of indigenous knowledge to resolve local problems has drawn my attention and encouraged me to write this letter. I appreciate his suggestions and would like to add my suggestions to be evaluated by the authorities for implementation to resolve the problem of water logging and water shortage in Dhaka city. //////My twin sister and me were going home after attending one of the monotonous classes. Waving goodbye to my classmates, I started my journey home with my dear sister when suddenly something unusual caught my attention. A well-dressed boy was sitting all alone in the footpath holding a packet of white powder. I did not pay much heed to it first, but then the boy took some in his hand, smelled it and then gulped a whole mouthful of it. That's pretty weird because I had never seen such food before, neither did I saw any advertisement of such peculiar food. Out of curiosity, I walked a few steps towards him. GOD BLESS MY SOUL! I MUST BE DREAMING. THAT IS DRUG. He was having it in broad daylight in a public place not bothering to maintain privacy. I was stunned. People walked past him, acting as if he did not exist. I was helpless too. Taking ALLAH'S name I started walking. In the course of my journey, I cursed myself for believing that my country was one of the least developing countries. I was under a deep illusion. Being a spectator of this incident I can surely say without any hesitation that my country BANGLADESH is not only developed but well ahead of others.//////This is a reply to Mr. Aminul Hoque's letter --"Where are those billboards?" (in response to Mr. Zakaria's letter). I am a Muslim and I have always made sure that people from other religions never feel uncomfortable in anyway because of the way I talk about myself. In fact if I am not mistaken that is one of the virtues of Islam - giving everyone their democratic right and space. //////Road shows may bring better opportunities for some of our policymakers and administrators for showing their success in the last 19 months. And it may raise the awareness of the people against corruption.//////Price hike is a common word these days. It is not a problem for the people in the top echelon of society.

I am a student and I know how difficult it is to survive.//////We are quite aware about the chaotic situation in our inter-district communications system. Every year a lot of money is being expended from our national budget for road construction and maintenance. But have we seen any remarkable initiative to ease or lessen traffic congestion ?

Unfortunately, I have never seen any development in this area. All sorts of works were done without any long-term thinking.//////During the rule of Shaesta Khan, Subedar of Bengal (1664-1688), one could purchase 8 maunds (about 300 kilos) of rice at a cost of Tk 1 only, I repeat Tk 1 one only. While commenting on the present market price of rice and other essential commodities which have gone all time high and far beyond the buying capacity of common people, our finance adviser Dr. Mirza Azizul Islam has reminded us that this is not the age of Khans. You better not ask for a better price than what you are enjoying (?) now, Tk 40 a kilo to be specific!//////Every year in the rainy season the roads become death traps. Not even a single road is good for transportation. It is really sad to learn that these roads were made of poor bricks and other substandard construction materials. That's why the streets are easily damaged by rain. We know that every year the government spends a lot of money for road repairing and construction but it is an irony that we don't see any improvement. //////Often my students and others ask me which book or manuals should be used for improving English language proficiency.//////This university is continuously demanding that its VC be appointed from within itself, although this is a relatively new university. I don't find any rationale behind such a demand. //////Now, the government seems to be slightly reluctant about improving the law and order situation. We general people are experiencing incidents like hijacking in the busy roads of the city. The so-called Molom party and Ogyan party are coming into the scene again. The marked criminals are just waiting for the favourable time to start their activities. We don't know why our news media is silent on the incidents happening in the city every day. //////We all know that the train is a cheap and safe mode of transport, or mode of mass communication. But today we can call it cheap, but cannot say that it's safe. A few months ago, I travelled on Intercity Ekota Express and Nil Sagor Express to Dinajpur and Syedpur respectively. But these days I fear to travel on train because of frequent accidents. //////The letter published on July 6 entitled "stray dog" has caught my attention. I would like to convey my thanks to Mr. Hasib for his effort towards saving a stray dog which is generally an unwanted object!//////Your frontpage exposure (July:7) of Jamaat's murky deeds is an eye opener; something beyond belief! They steal from the poor, not taking bribes from the rich as the politicos from the AL and the BNP do.

"He has had more time to study life around him than any other artist of our time. He not only drew and painted but also looked deep into his surroundings, beginning from the British period, to the days of Pakistani rule up till now. He not only touched on romanticism but the reality that was a part of his surrounding -- he touched political and social realities after '71, as much as anything else," he said.//////There are many so-called "elites" in the society who forget their ordinary roots, when climbing the social ladder.

He died without getting any medical care at a hospital, which is one of the premier and largest public hospitals in Bangladesh. Every human being is mortal but everybody wants to see that he or she gets proper medical care and treatment before his departure from this world. //////AS an emerging economic power, India finds that its companies expand into remote territories well in advance of its diplomats or other government agencies. Distant places like the Caribbean are fast becoming a major destination for business and major investments from India, and the competition that pits India against its giant northern neighbour China, too, has spread to the islands. Despite China's growing diplomatic clout, the private nature of India's business expansion may give it an edge. //////Due to traffic congestions and mismanagement buses are getting slower in most of the busy city streets, causing loss of time, energy and money of the passengers.//////Failing to encourage pedestrians to use footbridges, the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) is now thinking about alternatives for crossing the streets at busy traffic points. //////Zia International Airport (ZIA) authorities are finally going to reorganise its premium transportation service for airport passengers. //////
