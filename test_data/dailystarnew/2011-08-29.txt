In fact, the rush commenced days ago, with families streaming out to their villages by train, launches, buses and all other available means of transport. The usual sight of trains being packed to capacity and beyond on such occasions, with hundreds of people precariously riding on the roof, has been there again. A similar picture is to be seen with buses and river vessels. The idea of going home is one that has generally outweighed thoughts of safety.//////The situation in Libya is becoming uncertain by the day, and degenerating into a grave humanitarian crisis with due to shortage of essential supplies like food, water and electricity, particularly in the Tripoli.

The recent global economic crises have once again alerted us to the need to access regional demand to counteract recession in the developed economies. Thankfully, the present government through a bold political initiative has unleashed a new frontier of economic cooperation among Bangladesh, India and other regional countries. However, the current challenge is to give shape to this development opportunity on the ground, remaining mindful of our core national interests. //////India is not willing to pay taxes to Bangladesh for goods' movement from one part of India to another or to a third country through Bangladesh linking the Chittagong and Mongla seaports.//////Bangladesh is going to lose its biggest bargaining tool with India by providing transit facilities cheaply, said opposition leaders and people critical about allowing transit facilities to India. //////Bangladesh will require about Tk 50,000 crore over the next ten years to build infrastructure for transit to India, Nepal and Bhutan through its territory, a subcommittee formed by the government said in a study.//////Transit to India will prove profitable for Bangladesh but the service cannot be started in the next two years for a lack of necessary infrastructure on roads, water and rail routes, said Dr Mohammad Yunus, an expert on transit.//////A national transit agency (NTA) can be formed under a new law to monitor transit operations and work as a coordination cell for all agencies involved in the process, a government sub-committee recommended.//////A subcommittee suggested the government put in place administrative and service charges to allow transit, but not customs duties, in line with the World Trade Organisation rules. //////Bangladesh should look for long-term benefits in providing transit to India, Nepal and Bhutan, instead of focusing on short-term gains for ensuring sustainable economic development of the country, a government panel said in a report.//////Bangladesh should charge a single transit fee calculating all costs associated with transit traffic at border customs stations, a subcommittee formed by the government said in a report. //////Some garment factories in the country have not yet disbursed salaries and bonus to their workers for the upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr, said sector leaders yesterday.//////The new head of the IMF on Saturday called on global policymakers to pursue urgent action, including forcing European banks to bulk up their capital, to prevent a descent into a renewed world recession.//////Warren Buffett showed again that his name and money is enough to give a struggling company instant credibility in the market.

Libya is a resource-rich country with a relatively well-educated citizenry that has demonstrated courage under fire. The country lacks institutions and political experience, but not talent and commitment. The international community should prepare to support Libyan efforts to take charge of the country's destiny once Gaddafi leaves the scene. Rebel fighters danced under fireworks in the heart of Tripoli as they celebrated a stunning advance into the capital, meeting weak resistance from forces loyal to Colonel Gaddafi and claiming that his regime is finished. //////It is customary to fix fitra in terms of staple food of one country. Bangladesh has been created on the basis of our own culture. Our staple food is rice. Every year we see a committee, set for this purpose, fix the rate of fitra in terms of wheat, kismis, khurma, etc., which is not our staple food. And the people whom we usually give fitra are the poorest people of our country. So, I request the people of Bangladesh to give fitra in terms of the price of rice, not in terms of atta or kismis or khurma.//////Manik and Laskar's informative report in detail, headlined in your front page on August 25th, lets the cat out of the bag! Poor Joj Miah! Words fail to describe his misery. However, he is lucky to be alive. The criminal tendencies of BNP are evident in this gruesome public attack on its opposing political party! Their great mastermind, now absconding from the law, must be buzzing the internet, advising Mummy on how Joj Miah can be liquidated! The top CID official mentioned in the first line of your report, and the others in the know, and all others, who used their power and official position in masking the real criminals involved in the mass bombing including the then Home Minister needs to be criminally tried and given maximum punishment, to set an example, the sooner the better!//////The Shipping Minister Shahjahan Khan is annoyed with the media because he thinks media is not representing him correctly about the driving license issue. But he did not deny completely the recommendations made by the Transport Labour Unions to give thousands of people driving licenses without following the proper procedures. If he is the President of the Transport Union Federation, then can he avoid his responsibility with this proposal? Is it ethical for a minister to hold this position of labour union? The Prime Minister has asked all the ministers to submit their property statements. I think she should also ask them to publicly announce if any of them has any connection with any private business or unions, and if yes, then the government should remove them from the ministerial posts. When will we have ministers who have some self dignity to resign whenever there is a public outcry about some misdeeds or inefficiencies concerning their ministries?//////God gave us a land of plenty. Its green luscious landscape is so soothing for our eyes and souls. It is full of beautiful flora and fauna. It is a garden full of birds chirping happily and the children playing joyously. We need not fight the famine as it is seen in the Horn of Africa or the harsh cold of the arctic. Its fertile land grows food and fruits all the year round. But from that time when an ogre came and behaved possessively prohibiting the innocent children to play in that garden and built a wall around the garden to prevent them from entering it, a perpetual winter of death set in. It began with Pilkhana that broke county's defense system, and then the marauding hordes of death attacked the whole body of the country from every direction stabbing our sea and land, bleeding us unconscious so that the monster can rule supreme. I think when this ogre will find his garden barren for long with no flowers blooming and no birds singing, it will relent and bring back the just and the innocent into the garden to bring back life in it. All the ice of deaths and torture then vanish from roads, planes, hills, forests and glades of the garden. Life will then jump up everywhere with air clear of envy, hunger and fear. //////Whenever time permits I watch the most popular Zee Bangla show Mirakkel, Akkel Challenger. It's indeed an entertaining show which makes us relaxed of day's monotony. The presenter of Mirakkel, Meer is an outstanding compere and performer. The judges are very friendly and unbiased. Participation of Bangladeshi performers in Mirakkel has added more Bangalee touch as well as international aroma to the show. Bangladeshi participants together with other participants are performing very well. All of them including the little ones are not only excellent performers but comedy-makers too.//////BNP found new grounds to boycott parliament. Maudud Ahmed has said that the atmosphere has rather worsened than before citing reasons of case against Khaleda Zia and Tareq Zia's indictment in 21st August grenade attack case. The indictment was the result of re-investigation of grenade attack case, and the Anti-Corruption Commission has found hard evidences of Khaleda Zia's involvement in embezzlement of orphanage fund. The law of the land is taking its routine course in both affairs. Instead of boycotting parliament they should fight the legal battle. If they are not guilty, they will come out clean. //////Nowadays it takes around two hours or more if one wants to go to Farmgate or Shahbag from Uttara; from Gazipur it will take a whole day. We, the commuters, have to sit in tedious jam for so long that we forget whether we are going to some place from home or going back home from somewhere. Traffic jam paralyzes us. Especially if one goes to Karwan Bazar area, (near Bashundhara City) his life is finished.//////The condition of the highways throughout the country is in the worst form at present.Dear minister, why don't you do something awesome now which will be hailed by the commuters of the whole country? Did you happen to have a 100/200 km road journey recently to any district? If no, please have a drive to Tangail, my district, only 100 km from Dhaka, and experience the harrowing road journey. While travelling to Tangail, you have to go past EPZ (if you take Savar road) where a number of foreign companies are situated and hundreds of foreigners are plying this dilapidated road risking their lives every day. //////On 16th August 2011, what we saw in the parliament would simply remain memorable for a longer period of time to us and which clearly shows democracy is still there in this country. The whole nation is upset with some ministers and questioning their commitment towards the country. Those ministers not only made the PM upset but also created a big public dissatisfaction. In that session two veterans, Tofael Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta blasted their ministers in front of the PM which showed us that still some care about people. We found the communications minister baffled with this sudden outburst, and luckily the finance minister was not present that day, otherwise he would have gone through heavy criticism. What really upset me were the opposition leaders' comments, stating that Awami League had internal conflicts and they must resign, and they also asked for early election. They should have appreciated these unprecedented activities in that parliament where ministers were rebuked, which people watched live on TV, for not performing their duties properly. Please respect democracy and appreciate things that deserve respect.//////I would like to draw your attention regarding the publication featuring road accidents dated 16/08/2011. No doubt it is high time that we should have road dividers separating our single/ dual carriageways. However, concrete/ steel railing dividers are not sufficient, there should be central reservations or medians in between the dividers with sufficient width (usually less than the width of a lane) for reduction of head-on accidents and dissipating force of impact. If Philippines can have modern highways like the developed nations, why can't we have them?//////At present the government is in trouble for the remarks of different ministers. Irresponsible statements from key ministers are regrettable. Advice like eat less and education is not must for drivers disgusted the general people. They are now expecting appropriate steps from the Prime Minister to resolve the public sufferings. People are also expecting qualified persons as key ministries who will ensure public interest because this government came to power with strong commitments to ensure public welfare. //////Libyan rebels closed in on Muammar Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte from both east and west yesterday, a senior military commander said, as the insurgents also scrambled to get Tripoli back on its feet.//////Syria's ties with the Arab League were thrown into crisis yesterday over a proposed peace plan, as it reformed press laws while activists called a day of prayers for "martyrs" of the anti-regime uprising.//////Hurricane Irene brought international travel chaos Saturday with thousands of flights cancelled, while New York shut down its transport system fearing widespread flooding.//////Heavy rains that caused a dam to overflow in southwestern Nigeria and led to houses being submerged has killed 20 people and displaced thousands, an emergency management agency spokesman said yesterday.//////Israel expects a massive vote for the Palestinians when they seek membership of the United Nations next month, Haaretz newspaper yesterday quoted Israel's UN ambassador as saying.//////More than 10,000 prisoners held by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi have been released since the rebels captured Tripoli, but nearly 50,000 are still missing, a rebel military spokesman said yesterday.//////Super-typhoon Nanmadol killed at least eight people and left flattened bridges and blocked roads in its wake as it moved away from the Philippines and churned towards Taiwan, officials said yesterday.//////The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has hailed the triumph of the common man and the maturity of parliamentary democracy after Indian government agreed to carry out the reform for which Hazare launched his famous hunger strike.//////Bomb and gun attacks across Iraq yesterday killed five people, among them two policemen, and wounded another five, security officials said.//////Seventeen people were killed and 17 others injured when a van carrying migrant workers slammed into a trailer truck parked alongside a north China highway early yesterday, state press reported.//////Senior Maoist party leader Baburam Bhattarai was elected as Nepal's prime minister yesterday in the latest attempt to form a stable government after extended political uncertainty.//////The ruling party's de-facto candidate in Singapore's presidential election scraped to victory after a dramatic recount yesterday and quickly acknowledged that Singaporeans wanted a bigger voice in government.//////Iran yesterday sentenced to death a man accused of playing a key role in the 2010 murder of a top nuclear scientist and of spying for Israel, the official IRNA news agency reported.//////Norwegian police said yesterday they had arrested a man after recovering weapons and explosives at his home, but media reports said they found no immediate link with mass-killer Anders Behring Breivik.//////Artist Abdus Shakoor Shah is widely recognised for folk motifs and visual ballads in his paintings. //////Leading silver screen actress Purnima is now equally prominent on TV.

The ragtag rebel army composed of militias from diverse backgrounds, including Islamists, secularists and soldiers who defected from Gaddafi's army as well as youths, many still in their teens with hardly any training in the art of warfare, are engaged in an uneven fight with a well-equipped professional army of Gaddafi. //////No govt. in India has bent over backwards to please a civil society campaign as much as Dr. Manmohan Singh's in substantially accommodating the Jan Lokpal Bill drafted by a small group, including Anna Hazare, created by an NGO called India Against Corruption (IAC). And no individual act has recently attracted as much support as Mr. Hazare's fast for passing the Bill on terms dictated by him.//////Indo-Bangladesh relations are significant not only because three-quarters of Bangladesh is surrounded by India but also because they have historical significance. Though unequal in size and economy and in most other aspects of development indicators, Bangladesh commands the interest of India because it is equally interested in maintaining smooth relations with Bangladesh for the sake of its national interest. The upcoming visit of Premier Singh confirms that, as the outcome is expected to be very important for both the countries. //////Thousands of grassroots leaders of the then ruling BNP participated in the exchange of views in different areas of the country between February and October in 2005. Many of them spoke about people's sufferings caused by skyrocketing price hike of essentials and shortage of power. They warned that the party would have to face a tough time in the parliamentary elections if the situation did not improve immediately. //////Experts in international relations have failed to come to a consensus on the definition of "foreign policy." The foreign policy of a state usually refers to the general principles by which a state governs its reaction to the international environment. What happens outside the country cannot be tackled by domestic policy. A new kind of policy is needed to deal with problems with other countries. //////
