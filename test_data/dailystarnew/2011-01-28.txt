The minister's denial simply does not tally with the facts. As the human rights body Odhikar puts it, no fewer than 127 individuals lost their lives at the hands of the security forces last year alone. It is therefore surprising, even appalling, that the minister and her deputy have chosen to look away from what the rest of the country has been seeing for a long time. And then the minister contradicts herself when she says that steps are being taken against such occurrences. That is quickly followed by the suggestion that law enforcers can kill in self-defence. To our knowledge, there is as yet not a shred of evidence that those killed in any way attacked or in any way threatened the security forces. No sign has there been of any exchange of fire and not a hint has come of the 'associates' of the murdered men pouncing on the law enforcers.//////This is a poignant story of a helpless schoolgirl of class VIII, who fell victim to sexual assault by her nearly middle-aged neighbour.

We are also given the idea that religion is a personal matter and should not play a part in forming a country's laws. That is not true, as Islam has social and legal components as well, and it is rightly described as 'deen' in the holy Quran, which means 'a way to lead life'. //////I live overseas and travel to Dhaka quite frequently.
