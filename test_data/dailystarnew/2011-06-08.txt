It looks like a battleground.//////The Pakistani and the US authorities are reluctantly claiming the death of militant leader Ilyas Kashmiri for the third time in the last three years, but they still lack the knowledge about his network, aims and the capability of his 313 brigade despite the fact that Kashmiri was actually a genie created by the Pakistani establishment. He served the interest of the US in the 80s and of Pakistan's in the 90s, but today both American and Pakistani security establishments want to celebrate Kashmiri's death based on some confirmation. Pakistani security agencies have arrested a number of people, who were once close to Kashmiri, from different areas but the agencies are not ready to admit that the violation of the article 256 of the constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan by the Pakistani state actually made many people admire Ilyas Kashmiri.//////Limon Hossain, shot and maimed by Rapid Action Battalion, has not been involved in any criminal gang -- stated a government probe report submitted to the home ministry on Monday.//////The government wants to keep the deficit in the next fiscal year's budget within five percent of the GDP. //////Noted artist and one of the pioneers of modern art movement in Bangladesh Mohammad Kibria died at a city hospital yesterday morning. //////Agreements on the Teesta water sharing and border demarcation will be signed during Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Bangladesh well before the end of the year. //////Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina and Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad yesterday agreed that if any party has proposals about what to do with the caretaker government issue, it should be placed in parliament.//////In a rejoinder sent to The Daily Star, Tangail Forest Division termed the June-5 report--52 Mills: Sawing Reserve Forests-- misleading and not based on facts.//////The government yesterday approved four furnace oil-based independent power plants to generate 368 megawatts of electricity.//////The northern Syrian town of Jisr al-Shughour yesterday braced for an assault by the military after the government said 120 security forces personnel had been killed there by "armed gangs".//////BNP Acting Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir yesterday claimed the prime minister herself has blocked the way for holding a political dialogue on caretaker government system.//////A petition was submitted to a Dhaka court yesterday seeking issuance of arrest warrant against Tarique Rahman, senior vice chairman of BNP for not appearing before the court, in a money laundering case.//////Awami League lawmaker of Savar, Murad Jong, eight police personnel and 35 other people were sued yesterday on charge of extortion.//////Armed muggers allegedly made away with Tk 15 lakh from three garment factory employees by shooting at their car in the capital's Segunbagicha yesterday.//////A Sylhet court has set yet another deadline for filing the report of further probe into the killing of former finance minister Shah AMS Kibria and four others. //////Police yesterday detained 10 people suspected of having ties to the al-Qaeda extremist network in southern Turkey, Anatolia news agency reported.//////The intensity with which both the ruling party and the opposition are focused on the caretaker government issue says something about their attitudes to the problem.

It is certainly appreciable that Sheikh Hasina has now assured the opposition that no one-sided solution will be imposed.

The Appellate Division (AD) in its 1981 judgment stated that the Court will refrain from resolving political questions if the same could be done in another way. The leader of the House has breached the norms of parliamentary procedure by declaring the fate of the 13th Amendment on the basis of a judgment which is yet to be published.
