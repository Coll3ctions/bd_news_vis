The reason given out was that cinema halls have remained largely empty with people not very drawn to watching films produced in Bangladesh. In effect, it was to give a spurt to the movie houses in the financial sense that motivated the decision. And then, before citizens had a real chance of assessing the move, the government came in with the news that Indian movies would after all not be allowed back in Bangladesh. //////Holders Abahani extended their amazing unbeaten run in the Citycell Bangladesh League to 30 matches with a thumping 5-1 win over Rahmatganj at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday predicted a keen contest during the upcoming World Twenty20, saying the race for the title was too close to call.//////The interim Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman, Chirayu Amin, has admitted the governing council was "dazzled" by the league's success and overlooked issues, but has promised a clean-up that would assure franchise owners and fans of the IPL's stability and viability.//////Officials of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) yesterday met the high-ups of police seeking their immediate intervention to find out 'the fixed matches' in the ongoing Bangladesh League.//////The second four-day match of the Grameenphone-BCB Academy Cup will start today at the Shahid Chandu Stadium in Bogra.//////Government has finally agreed to allot the Sylhet Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) to Bangladesh Football Federation for five years to run a football academy there.//////Bangladesh Swimming Federation, with financial assistance from Australian Sports Commission, will start a talent-hunt programme in 16 districts on the last week of June.//////Nazrana Khan Eva of Manikganj is now in sole lead with maximum four points after the fourth round games of the Arlin Developer 31st National Women Chess Championship-2010 at Narayanganj Club Auditorium.

But as individuals and as groups of responsible members of society, isn't there a lot that we can actually do, too?//////Ten years ago, world leaders agreed at the UN on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 8 goals to significantly reduce extreme poverty, disease and illiteracy by 2015. World leaders met to take stock of progress at the mid-point. The first nine years have seen some important successes at the aggregate level, 40 million more children are in school, hundreds of millions of people have come out of extreme poverty, some deadly diseases like tuberculosis and measles have been contained, and fewer people are dying from HIV/AIDS. But the UN Secretary General warned that if the world has to meet the MDGs by 2015, the speed of implementation needs to be substantially accelerated. Paradoxically, foreign aid levels have actually fallen in the last four years and some of the richest countries are cutting back even further. It is no surprise then that virtually every leader from a developing country spoke during the summit about rich countries breaking their aid promises to the poor with the consequence being schools and health centres left without staff and equipment.//////The city is not safe at all.

The world is waiting impatiently for the religions 'to get their act together' so that they - and, indeed, all people of goodwill - can discover how to work together for justice and peace in the smallest villages and the highest courts of nations. //////An important and revealing front-page article on the subject was published in a local English daily on 18 April, which should be of interest to the environment protectors and owners of tanneries. It was reported that most tannery owners were reluctant to adopt this safe and interesting new development in leather tanning from BCSIR. The authorities should call the tannery owners and explain the advantages of this process. They should give them a simple and easy written pamphlet; if necessary with sketches, and cost and other savings, explaining and describing the new tanning process.//////Nowadays, drug addiction is one of the main problems of the young generation in this country, especially on university campuses. The availability of drug is increasing day by day which is really worrisome. //////Decay has got the better of the roads at Nikunja-2 in Khilkhet residential area through lack of repair work over the years. Almost all the roads are in bad shape, causing daily sufferings to the residents. Even with a little rain all the roads get clogged with rainwater as it is one of the low land areas in Dhaka city. Of all the shabby roads, many are seen as drains owing to stagnant, smelly, polluted water on the roads, especially in the rainy season. During the rainy season all the roads remain water-logged and roads get muddier and slippery very badly. The most distressful thing is that with the aggravated situation of the roads, many rickshaw pullers show reluctance to pull their rickshaw wading through these rugged roads. Even sometimes many cars get bogged down in the middle of the road because of the holes created there. There are many official and student residents living in this area who are the worst sufferers. Apart from this, we have to wait for a long time to get a rickshaw which is a pretty time consuming and monotonous job. //////In his letter "Indians honoured"( 23 April), Prof. M. Zahidul Haque has appropriately stated that selection of "Jana gana mana..." by the UNESCO as the world's best national anthem is not only an honour for Indians, but for all Bangla speakers of the globe. Prof. Haque has also requested the Indian government to attach more importance to the expansion and learning of Bangla. But how can it be expected that New Delhi would pay heed to his request and act likewise when the Bengalis of West Bengal and the rest of India are themselves working overtime to shed off their Bangaliyana?//////It is really good news for the people who reside in Dhaka. As we see now, living in Dhaka is becoming extremely horrible with traffic jam, population hike, and without electricity. Decentralization is the most fruitful solution that could be done by the government right now in a short period of time. With good long range planning, it could be one of the best decisions that a government could ever take. However, the government should take care of the people who are currently living in that proposed area.//////While the civilized educated people in the world are relentlessly working to invent medicines to cure incurable diseases like cancer, diabetes, liver ailment etc., while some are working to invent instruments like lasers beams and thinnest needles to reduce sufferings from injections for ailing people, while new and new instruments are being invented to contact people from one corner to another of this planet, while people are working to help people to live long with the help of their modern inventions, a certain group of people of the same planet are killing their fellow brethren inside prayer houses, making deadly weapons to throw on others of their own clan, inciting quarrels among themselves, trading on religion, exploiting others in the name of religion. //////Our government's revenue income is small and revenue expenditure is colossal.
