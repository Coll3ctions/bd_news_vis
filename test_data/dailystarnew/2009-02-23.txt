Already we have exported a number of ocean going cargo vessels and orders for more are in the pipeline. To be precise, Bangladesh has $500 million worth of export orders in hand to deliver ships by 2010. It augurs well that contribution by the sector would comprise 3 to 4 percent of GDP by 2015, and that export earning can go up to $2 billion in near future. It will be no mean feat considering the tough competition coming from major shipbuilders of Europe and Asia. Right now, the continued faith of foreign buyers in our ability to deliver only reinforces our confidence that we no more lag behind in heavy industrial production and that our quality matches that of any reputable international manufacturer. Therefore, to stay in the market as an important player, we shall have to modernise and innovate constantly. //////THE report appearing in this newspaper that people are continuing to occupy AGB colony buildings despite the fact that these had been declared dangerous and unfit for living more than five years ago is very disconcerting indeed. In effect more than 100 families are putting their lives at risk every minute of the day in these quarters. Although the authorities have managed to shift the occupants of the other hazardous buildings in the complex, as far as the eight in question, the authorities have done nothing beyond warning the occupants from time to time.//////IT'S like the morning after! It's when the crowds have gone home, the buntings have come down, the litter has been carted away and a political government with heavy mandate is firmly in place. It's a new beginning, new challenge and new hopes -- all rolled into one. //////IT was a fitting occasion for a farewell speech. The setting was a 122-year-old college for boys, established in Lahore at a time when the British intended to rule forever and to use the princes of the Punjab to perpetuate that rule.

This goal has already been diluted by inadvertent slide and confusion between 'Bangla Bhasha' and 'Matri Bhasha'. There is a clear distinction between a 'language or Bhasha' and a tongue or 'Buli'. Bangla Bhasha has a history of at least a thousand years of development behind it. It has an evolved alphabet, grammar, lexicon and literary richness which most mother tongues in the land do not have. But above all it has the singular advantage of being readily understood in any part of our country provided an existing standard, whether written or spoken, is followed.//////Human trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring, or receipt of people for the purposes of slavery, forced labour (including bonded labour or debt bondage), and servitude.

Threats, violence, and economic leverage such as debt bondage can often make victim consent to exploitation.//////Education in the public universities in Bangladesh is turning into a failure: in the world of speed, technology and creativity, students in the universities are stuck with session jams, horrendous politics and worm-eaten notebooks. Politics in the universities should voice the demands of the students; I never heard anybody talking about the filthy toilets of Dhaka University, poor management of the libraries, age-old system of question formation, just to name a few problems. Nobody says 'sorry' for all the 'unavoidable circumstances' to avoid schedule classes. There is never any research to work out how students can get 'in campus jobs' so that they do not have to live a humiliating life. //////Genetic science has a great potential for either serving or degrading humanity. Its proper use requires moral reflection and the establishment of moral limits. Human welfare does not demand that scientists pursue every avenue available.//////Obviously, a huge number of television channels are playing a significant role to convey us the up-to-date information regularly. Their duty is to collect news. To get, find out or even create news they will trail the potential sources, it is usual. But our key chair holders forget that they hold very important posts. They have to take many confidential decisions which will affect the nation. Astonishingly, we notice, after concluding or even before ending the meeting, a member comes out, stands in front of the microphone and spontaneously speak about what had been discussed or decided. You are doing your job. You are not a newsmaker. So, please control yourselves. //////We, the students of Jahangir-nagar University, are greatly shocked at the incident that happened on Monday, 16 February. As an eyewitness to the incident, I still could not believe how a student could beat his student brother in such a merciless way.

So, during the BNP rule and initial period of the caretaker government he reportedly acted as per the directions of the BNP.//////What is a paper currency? It is a mode of exchange, it is a piece of paper with no value of its own. There are many instances of economies of countries collapsing just due to exchange rates of their currencies. //////All the TV channels now telecast several programmes to raise awareness regarding AIDS. It is really a positive scheme. A huge number of people of India, our closest neighbour, are badly affected by this disease. In this situation, our TV channels are playing a vital role and deserve thanks from the citizens of the country. It must also be noted that the hazards of AIDS is comparatively less in our country compared to India.//////All actions and all steps taken by opponents are not anti-state or anti-people.//////I hardly can remember the exact number of students who, nowadays, get GPA 5 in the SSC or even the HSC since the number is too high to remember!//////Your front page report on February 10 from your correspondent at Pabna is terrible. It brings back to me, its similarity to John Galsworthy's play titled "The Price of Coal" which I read way back in 1948. The play depicted the tragic death of miners in underground mine accidents. The incident in Pabna, although no accident, is the loss of five lives and injury to twenty persons over quarrel for crop cutting of lentils! That too from a land that is not owned by any of the two groups in the quarrel, as reported.//////The grand alliance government led by the Awami League has many priorities. But improving law and order must not be ignored. Heinous crimes are on the rise. Hijacking, mugging even killing are going unabated when so called block raids and special drives are on. Both the ministers appear to be too shy to talk about it. This is a very ominous sign for a government, so enthusiastically voted to power. //////With the country needing to find food, water, shelter, energy, timber and medicine for a new mouth every alternate second, our forests and wild landscapes face fresh and bigger threats.//////I was reading one article from your February 13, 2009 edition. In the sports section, there was an article entitled "Messi steals the show" about the France vs Argentina friendly football game. I have noticed statistical errors in it. //////While the slogan Science for all has been appreciated and accepted by most people, and scientific development is going on with the speed of light almost everywhere, the area of scientific ignorance among people of Bangladesh is widening. The situation is worse than even before because the politicians were almost silent as if it is not an important issue. They were more interested in importing science than local creation or innovation. The politicians should not be blamed fully because they became silent observing the previous activities of the responsible scientists in different sectors. It is pertinent to raise an important point here that all sciences are not science and all scientists are not real scientists. The main thing is to give the right person the right responsibilities. Otherwise, he will just pass time and destroy the whole system. //////Pakistani pro-Taliban militants yesterday said they would decide within days whether to call a permanent ceasefire in a wild region near the Afghan border after the government agreed to allow Islamic Sharia law.//////A battle just outside southern Afghanistan's largest city has killed at least six Taliban fighters, while an airstrike against militants elsewhere in the south killed eight, officials said yesterday.//////Pakistan will proceed with its probe into the Mumbai attacks after getting India's response to a set of 30 questions seeking more information on the terror strikes, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said.//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf were close to signing an accord to end the decades-old conflict over Kashmir after three years of secret talks but failed to achieve the vital breakthrough, media reports here said.//////Canadian scientists claim to have solved a major mystery about the origins of life on earth.//////Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, a key ally of the previous Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government, today said his Telugu Desam Party will never help L K Advani become Prime Minister nor support any BJP government at the Centre. //////Electricity Minister Karim Wahid yesterday invited France to help Iraq build a nuclear power plant, three decades after Paris constructed a reactor near Baghdad that was bombed by Israeli warplanes.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has used her maiden overseas mission to launch a celebrity-style campaign to harness new political and popular forces in a bid to restore America's world standing.//////Despite President Barack Obama's moves to ban torture and close Guantanamo Bay, human rights advocates are angry some policies toward "terror" detainees do not depart enough from those of the previous administration.//////A Sunni Muslim MP in Iraq was accused yesterday of involvement in an April 2007 suicide bombing in the parliament canteen that killed eight people including a lawmaker.//////Scientists on Sunday unveiled lab-made human antibodies that can disable several types of influenza, including highly-lethal H5N1 bird flu and the "Spanish Flu" strain that killed tens of millions in 1918.//////Setting the stage for a possible showdown with his former ally, Pakistan's opposition PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has accused President Asif Ali Zardari of trying to get him disqualified from contesting polls through cases in the Supreme Court. //////A gym, barber shop and planters of plastic flowers: Welcome to the gentler face of the infamous Abu Ghraib prison.//////Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi will visit Washington this week for talks with US and Afghan officials on how to combat extremism and militancy in the region, officials said Sunday.//////Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy held a discussion and cultural programme to observe the International Mother Language Day at the National Theatre Stage.

Bangladesh is still not mature enough to start talking about those. We are still trying to bring cable television to the homes of 150 million people. //////PRIVATISATION of state-owned enterprises is an important item on the policy agenda of many countries. This is because of an ideological shift in perception of the role of the state vis--vis the role of the private sector in economic management as well as appreciation of the economic logic buttressed by inefficiency of SOEs.//////MY adult friends can basically be divided into two lots.
