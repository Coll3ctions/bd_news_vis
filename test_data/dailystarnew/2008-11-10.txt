We also read a positive sign in that the exploration rigs from the area have also been withdrawn.//////A roundtable on urban planning in connection with the observance of World Town Planning Day in the capital the other day certainly made the right noises. And those noises were all related to the impediments that have increasingly hampered town planning in this country. Even without formal seminars and discussions being organised to highlight the issue, one surely understands the gravity of the situation. An observation of conditions in Bangladesh, especially Dhaka, is enough to make us realise everything that has been going wrong with town planning. Over the years, owing to a queer sense of commercialisation, residential areas in the city have been falling prey to depredations of various kinds. //////AS her last stint of prime ministership ended after a burlesque of governance, pervading corruption and myriad sleazy activities with regard to public affairs, speculations were rife that Madam Zia would like to call it a day. This was in spite of the fact that our politicians have no tradition of voluntarily quiting the turf unless shown the door and hounded out of office by people's power. Few thought that she would again show her face, smeared with so many slurs, to an alienated people deluded by her perfidious rule. The notion was reinforced gradually with stories made public of pillaging, misfeasance and moral turpitude perpetrated by her sons, relatives and favourites, as well the nefarious role of the so-called Hawa Bhaban mafia.//////SUCH is the grip of neo-liberal or free-market dogma on the minds of its Indian adherents that they deny there's a grim global financial crisis and economic recession. Indeed, some say the collapse of banks and the general economic slowdown in the West represents the birth of a new, vibrant, free-market capitalism. One commentator concedes this is a crisis of neo-liberal globalisation, but asserts this could be globalisation's "finest hour."//////FOR the past few months, not a day went by without the words "Muslim" and "Obama" being mentioned in the same sentence.

I think they don't have the accountability for the tax payers' money they are spending. As if they are serving other countries and cultures, I am afraid. Let me clarify my position. //////A major part of the government's functioning is focused on implementation of its projects. From the yearly revenue collection, expenditure on establishment & operation is met; the amount left is spent on project implementation. Any amount left thereafter goes for reserve. In certain years when revenue collection is not enough, money has to be transferred from the reserve or loan is taken from banks for project implementation.

The article was "Straight Talk: Yes we can" published on 7th November 2008. He mentioned Barack Obama as being a "man of unusual thoughtfulness, judiciousness, and integrity". How has Mr. Sobhan reached this conclusion? Is he caught up with the anti-Bush rhetoric, and Obama-mania? George Bush junior was one the most bloodthirsty president America has had, thus it is not difficult to support Obama. Although this does not imply Obama will be any better.//////At present, the major political parties are on the high way to election. So it's a good sign for us. But we are still in doubt whether the nation will get a team of honest and patriotic and capable leaders through the election. It is uncertain because earlier Bangladesh watched a local government election which frustrated us, as the expected changes in leadership did not take place. The caretaker government also hoped it. But without a change in voters' minds and in the political parties' selection and nomination process, no change was possible. We cannot reach our goal. //////Bangladesh is a densely populated country. More than 80% of its people live in the rural areas. Fuel demand is increasing with the increase of population. But we have not enough reserve fuel for meeting our future requirement. Any increase in oil price significantly increases production and transportation cost and price hike becomes unavoidable. It is therefore argued that poor countries like Bangladesh should explore alternative renewable energy sources that will reduce their dependency on imported oil. Many supporters of bio-fuel believe that it will be a blessing for tropical developing countries like Bangladesh because of our comparative advantages of sun and excellent energy crops.//////We now see light at the end of the tunnel in Bangladesh in general.//////Just after his defeat in the election, Republican candidate John McCain congratulated Mr. Obama in a speech to his supporters gathered on the lawn of Phoenix's luxury Arizona Biltmore Hotel. In this meeting some of his frustrated fans shouted boos and cried "Bullshit!" But Mr. McCain told them firmly "Barack Obama is my president!"//////Dhaka Warriors' success and 3 straight wins will surely make our cricketers more confident in future. Their good performance in ICL will ensure entry of more players from our country in that tournament. And other teams may also hire Bangladeshi cricketers. And all over the world Twenty20 cricket will start to sponsor our cricketers. //////I must protest the letter by Nur Jahan (DS, November 4, 2008) where she states that if Obama is defeated in the election, it will prove that Americans are racists. This kind of thinking is a product of a racist and narrow mindset and makes no logical sense.//////The residents of Shaheenbag, Nakhalpara, Teskonipara and Arjotpara under Tejgaon police station have very little scope to reach some open field to walk. Children are the most deprived group. So, the majority people have to spend their afternoon at home. Their rooftops are the only hope to meet the requirement. Regular exercise through sporting activities is important for both mental and physical growth of children. We think it is their civic right as well. Besides, the rates of diabetes and hypertension are significantly alarming in the city. So, walking is a must for everyone as suggested by the physicians.//////Road traffic accident (RTA) is one of the major causes of death and disability in our context.
