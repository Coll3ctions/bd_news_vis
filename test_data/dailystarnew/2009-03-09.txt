It was rather surprising for the nation to know from Begum Zia the other day that the killers of the BDR officers were foreign spies and hired from outside. Sheikh Hasina has responded by asking Begum Zia that if she has any evidence to back up her point of view she should provide it to the probe bodies now at work on the BDR tragedy. There can be no denying that the killing of the army officers on February 25 has left the nation traumatised and we will all remain in the dark for as long as we are unable to delve into the roots of the conspiracy behind it. The country now expects Begum Zia to respond to the Prime Minister's request and come forward in aiding the process of investigation in any way she can. //////WATER supply situation in the metropolis is beginning to look serious with the advent of summer. Already we have seen angry demonstrations and blocking of roads by disgruntled residents in Mirpur area where water supply has dwindled sharply since February. Similar stories concerning shortage of water in other areas are also being reported in the media. With hot summer days ahead, when demand for water will rise further, it is likely that Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA) might be in for similar demonstrations if the supply situation is not improved soon enough. Although the crisis is seasonal, we seldom plan for it. //////NEVER did we think that we would be haunted with mass graves in independent Bangladesh. Never did we think that we would have to unearth mutilated, bayonet-torn dead bodies. And yet, today, we are assaulted once again by mass graves and the cold-blooded murder of our army officers, their families, and civilians.//////THE bloody mutiny by a section of BDR soldiers, brutally killing more than 75 people including 58 army officers, put Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to a grim test of statesmanship. She has not failed, but has rather shown wisdom, courage and tolerance, which are needed in tackling such critical situations in very trying times.//////Foreign imports will have to shoulder Sheikh Russel's workload if Wajed Gazi's boys want to turn men in this week's mega tournament Super Cup.//////An unbeaten 163 by Sachin Tendulkar led India to a comprehensive 58-run win over New Zealand in the third one-day international here Sunday and ensured they cannot lose the series.//////Phil Hughes became the youngest player in Test history to hit two centuries in a match as Australia pressed home their advantage on the third day of the second Test against South Africa at Kingsmead here on Sunday.//////Monty Panesar gave England a much-needed breakthrough in their bid for a series-levelling win over West Indies, after Paul Collingwood and Matt Prior hit hundreds to bat them into a formidable position in the fifth and final Test on Saturday.//////Real Madrid's run of wins came to an end on Saturday when they were held to a 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu by city rivals Atletico, allowing Barcelona to extend their lead at the top to six points.//////Inter Milan clicked ominously into gear ahead of their Champions League trip to Manchester United with an impressive 2-0 victory at Genoa on Saturday.//////David Beckham on Sunday confirmed a deal has been agreed between AC Milan and Los Angeles Galaxy that enables him to stay in Italy until the end of the season.//////Andrei Voronin's hattrick for Hertha Berlin in a 3-1 victory at Energie Cottbus shot them four points clear in the German League while Bayern Munich cruised up to joint second following a five-goal spree.//////Manchester United's imperious march towards five trophies in a season continued here Saturday as Carlos Tevez scored twice in a 4-0 win over Fulham that saw his side into the FA Cup semifinals.//////World Cup favourites Australia suffered a miserable start to their 2009 campaign when they were beaten by New Zealand in Sydney.//////It generally comes with a stroll of a single to a safe area, say long-on or deep fine-leg. By the time Sachin Tendulkar reaches the non-striker's end, the crowd goes delirious. The helmet comes off, the head tilts up skywards, the back arches a little, the head comes down and looks at the crowd and team-mates in acknowledgment, the fists are pumped, bat in one hand and helmet in the other, and then the head tilts up again. And lo, Tendulkar has reached another hundred. His is a smooth, well-oiled, economical, calculated celebration. The same can easily be said of his centuries. Not the ones Tendulkar the wunderkind used to score, but the ones the master assessor does.//////Arambagh pulled off another draw in the Prime Minister Cup football tournament when they held Pakistan

Eliot.//////We condemn the gruesome killings aimed at destroying our beloved country as an independent nation. We pray to the Almighty Allah for the eternal peace of the departed souls of those military officers.

We all express our heart-felt condolence to the bereaved family members for the sad demise of their beloved and pray to Allah to bless them all with the strength to overcome such irreparable losses. We are saddened, stultified and wordless in the face of such inexplicable act of savagery and demand justice through punishing the culprits and monsters who have stigmatised the history of our nation by killing our unarmed brothers. //////The tragedy that struck on Feb 25 is quite horrendous.//////Hundred plus officers and soldiers have been murdered in Pilkhana. So many lives have been lost under most tragic circumstances. The conspirators have struck at the very root of national security. The highest level of discipline shown by the armed forces especially the Army is praiseworthy. A national disaster has been averted. We salute the Army for demonstrating the highest level of discipline. It will remain as an example to our future generation.//////I am not a politician and not an expert either on poly-tricks to twist certain things in my favour as many of our politicians do or can do, to their advantage. It will not be out place to quote here the late Bhutto of Pakistan. To a question by some press people quoted as asking Bhutto, "Sir, it is said that you tell a bundle of lies, one thing in the morning and the other, just the opposite in the evening, what is your comment?", he was quoted to have replied "I am a politician and that is a great quality of a good politician."//////Combating or curbing terrorism is the desire of every peace-loving citizen, no matter where they live.

The university was closed sine die.//////The new, 'popular' elected political government has some urgent and serious homework for the JS. Discard the Late Latif syndrome.//////The 2009 Parliament of Bangladesh is unique in many ways. Among its many uniqueness one that will top the list is its biggest number of fresh and young members. Analysts across the board are full of praise and hope for this new phenomenon. While doing so they are too reluctant even to examine the risks that are associated with inexperience. Such is the predicament of the so-called "brute" majority. People become hesitant to give free flowing opinions. //////The other day I overheard a story which really upset me. A man was going to get married. All was fine. But after the marriage ceremony was over, the bridegroom found the bride to be squint-eyed. The bridegroom's family had gone to the bride's house twice to see the bride. But they didn't find anything wrong with her then. I couldn't find out actually who cheated whom. Marriage is a divine bond between man and woman. But if it starts with such hypocrisy then what will happen in their lives? My honest request to everybody, if you have any disability please inform it to your to-be partner. //////I would like to draw the government's kind attention to the news report on the above subject published in the 'Daily Prothom Alo' (page no. 24 & 23, dated 25 December '08) and would like to say for your kind consideration that if the proposal for enhancement of retirement age limit as recommended in the Secretariat meeting is not acceptable due to any obvious reason, the problem in question can be easily solved by an alternative method without creating any further complications. In this regard, it may be mentioned that in accordance with the prevailing rules, the employees being appointed at the age of 18 are getting a total service period of (57-18)=39 years and the employees being appointed at the age of 30 are getting a total service period of (57-30)=27 years. Thus the latecomers in service are being deprived of their required service duration. Similarly, those in the freedom fighters' quota being employed in govt. services at the age of 32 are also deprived and they are being compelled to go on retirement before completion of their children's education. So, to remove this disparity including all dissimilarities as stated in the above recommendation, an alternative rule acceptable to all should be introduced by fixing up the total service period on average basis. //////Last Tuesday's attack on Sri Lankan cricket players heralds the spread of Taliban-trained groups into Pakistani heartlands, feel experts.//////Indian activists marked International Women's Day yesterday by protesting over a spate of violent attacks launched on women by religious extremists in the name of "moral policing."//////Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, considered the architect of the 1999 Kargil war, has warned that there could be more such conflicts if the key dispute and sore point Kashmir remains unresolved for long.//////US President Barack Obama said, in an interview published yesterday, that the United States is not winning the war in Afghanistan and hinted at possible talks with moderate elements of the Taliban.//////In a major blow to India's main opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of parliamentary elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Biju Janata Dal (BJD), a regional outfit, severed their 11-year-old alliance in the eastern state of Orissa after failing to reach an accord on seat sharing.//////Pakistani authorities today ordered a judicial inquiry into the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team here though there was no official word on when a special police team investigating the incident would submit its preliminary report. //////A joint Afghan-coalition patrol killed two Afghan policemen who opened fire on their team in northeastern Afghanistan, the coalition said in a statement Sunday.//////The BJP is not the only party facing rough weather ahead of the General Elections.

After electing the members of parliament (MPs) the voters have no idea what is being done by their representatives, so broadcasting activities relating to the Parliament will help people to know about the performance of their elected representatives.//////A quiet revolution has taken place regarding access to economic research, and this revolution is especially important for economists in developing countries such as Bangladesh. Ten years ago, it would have been difficult for a Bangladeshi researcher or policy makers to benefit from easy access to the recent economics literature relevant to his/her job, be it related to monetary policy or the fight against poverty.//////THERE'S something bizarre about road travel in Asia. If you are in a country where people drive in a careful, orderly way, like Japan, cars have a special seatbelt for every bodily protuberance and there's a death penalty for not wearing the lot. //////
