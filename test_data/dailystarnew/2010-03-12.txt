Why such a step has been so long in coming is rather surprising, given that efforts have been underway since 2006 to check the misuse of cell phones, especially in the matter of utilizing them for criminal activity. More worryingly, we fail to understand why the authorities have till now been unable to ensure a foolproof registration of mobile phone users despite the fact that it is not really hard to do the job. In the recent past, much concern has been expressed about the threats that individuals and organizations have been receiving from unscrupulous and nefarious elements. Needless to say, these threats have generally centred around demands for money. These criminal elements have been rather active in trying to extort money through their faceless threats to people and organizations that are generally known to be well off economically.//////Whereas bumper cash crops should put a smile on the face of producers and give a wafting sense of comfort to consumers, they are actually leaving the former accursed and the latter bemoaning predictable loss of relief in prices. The case in point is the abundant availability of potatoes and tomatoes vis--vis our stark incapacity to store or conserve them. In no time, on being hauled from the field, can their freshness evaporate, they wilt and rot before the very eyes of the producers, unless of course these have been promptly stacked and tucked away into the safe temperature of cold stores. //////The first Test of the two-match series between Bangladesh and England gets underway at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium today under scorching heat. The big question is whether Bangladesh can pull off a big surprise against a new-look England in the five-day game? However, it was Bangladesh batsman Rokibul Hasan who hogged the spotlight yesterday. All the interest has centered on the surprise retirement decision of Rokibul as everybody was searching for the real reason behind the mysterious decision.//////A day after shocking the country with his sudden retirement, batsman Rokibul Hasan confirmed that his grievances against the cricket authorities drove him to this end. But he denied that his emotions got the better of him.//////After the episode with the selection of Mashrafe Bin Mortaza only a small intervening period has passed for another incident to rock the Bangladesh cricket team in Rokibul Hasan's sudden retirement, which has left many questions unanswered. //////He was fondly known as Manu Singh to those of us who played alongside him at Azad Boys Club. A gregarious and very cheerful personality, Monawar Hossain Manu was a cricketer par excellence. I remember the matches in which Azad Boys were either playing Abahani or Mohammedan as it was Manu who more often than not either got us crucial breakthroughs or was even instrumental in winning us so many crucial matches with his fastish off breaks. A bowling action that was so reminiscent of a cowboy ready to slap leather as he gave a little hop on one leg before crossing the umpire to hurl those innocuous looking deliveries that so often deceived the batsmen into submission. A quintessential figure was Manu for whom Azad Boys club meant a lot and be in triumph or in defeat Manu was one who always had a good laugh and was always the first one along with his beautiful wife Gajju bhabi to be present at Ashraful bhai's house for some good lively moments during the evenings of the match.//////Brothers Union leapfrogged three places beating strugglers Shuktara Jubo Sangsad by a solitary goal while Muktijoddha Sangsad beat Chittagong Mohammedan 2-1 to dump them to bottom position Bangladesh League yesterday.//////FIDE Master Minhaz Udiin Ahmed Sagar maintained solo lead with 5.5 points at the end of the sixth round of Prime Bank 12th International Rating Chess at the Chess Federation Hall room yesterday.//////Beanibazar SC were handed a TK one lakh for the lapse in organization and discipline that led to unsavoury incidents during a match against Mohammedan SC in the Bangladesh League on Tuesday at the Sylhet Stadium.//////Two-time defending champions Germany stormed into the final of the men's field hockey World Cup with an emphatic 4-1 win over lacklustre England on Thursday.//////The Chappell-Hadlee Trophy has remained in Australian hands after Ricky Ponting and Cameron White led their team to a six-wicket win that secured the series 3-1.

However, this growth has been totally confined to the mobile sector led by five foreign operators owning 51 million subscribers out of a total of 52 million. The remaining one million subscribers belong to the state-owned mobile operator, Teletalk. The PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) sector with a current subscriber base of 1.6 million is still dominated by BTCL owning 1 million and the remaining 0.6 million by the private PSTN operators. The private PSTN operators owned and operated by the local entrepreneurs are plagued by a multiplicity of problems and have not been able to take off as yet. The same is true for the local internet service providers (ISPs).

I am fortunate enough to have seen international cricket in this part of the sub-continent grow from day one when INDIA visited PAKISTAN in 1954-55 and the tour opener was played in Chittagong. Ever since that day, I have lived all these years with cricket in this country and have known most of the players at the national level.//////The city dwellers in Metropolitan Dhaka, especially the middle-income group, find it very difficult to move from one place to another. Private sedan is out of their reach for financial reason. Taxicab service is not easily available and is also very costly. When a family likes to join in a marriage ceremony, it needs a low cost vehicle to go to a community centre. When a patient has to be shifted to a hospital, an affordable baby taxi is needed. If a family wants to go shopping to celebrate a festival, a baby-taxi is required. To appear in a public exam hall, a student needs transport service of a baby-taxi. It is the reality in Dhaka metropolis that affordable transport is not easily available. The baby-taxis that are plying go to garage just in the evening. On the other hand, one cannot move to all desired destinations by available bus service in Dhaka Metropolis. It is very difficult for females to travel by bus owing to limited service, too many passengers and un-civilized behaviour of a section of male passengers. But it is unfortunate that in the past, the governments ignored the acute need of city dwellers. In the name of traffic jam, rickshaws are not allowed on many roads. Then how will the general people move? //////February 25 is an excruciating day.//////Libyan leader Gaddafi has called the Muslims to boycott Switzerland in connection with the recent Swiss vote against the building of minarets that are integral parts of the mosques used by Muslims for praying. This is a direct interference in the right of a community to observe its religious rituals by a country that probably believes in secularism. France has also forbidden veil or hijab, a mandatory dress for Muslim women. What other non-Muslim countries /nations are doing against Islamic faith is well known and being manifested in the form of clash of civilisations. But there is no Muslim country in the world that has put any such prohibition on the religious rituals of any other community living in that country or anywhere else.//////We are watching foreboding black clouds gathering over the horizon, we are afraid that in no time the whole sky will be covered, it is an ominous sign for the country.

In a dispassionate observation, they are too harsh and born out of political vendetta, though the AL has in some sectors glaring failures to draw flake. But BNP leaders have been saying all these in their party office and at other forums without caring a damn for their moral obligation and commitment to the nation. The people, however, well understand their anguish of being out of power but they would not put their hubris aside to soul-search about their misdeeds or follies and frailties.//////Nababganj and Dohar upazilas in Dhaka Sadar Dakkhin (South Dhaka) are only thirty and forty kilometres away from Dhaka, but the people there are left to cry for gas. Keraniganj upazila gets the supply through pipeline from Dhaka city. Even some districts of North Bengal have been brought under gas supply and the Jamuna Bridge has made it possible. It is not understood why such places near Dhaka do not get supply of gas. Will the authorities concerned look into the matter? //////Women who have been trafficked are often vulnerable to being so again. Creating awareness, changing mindsets and removing stigmas towards survivors, is also crucial in preventing the vicious cycle from continuing. While it is sometimes argued that trafficked persons have a better life than their lives of Poverty back home, the fact that they are cheated into this life not knowing what they are in for and then subjected to torture and slavery is what makes trafficking an inhuman crime that must be stopped.//////When we first came to this campus as first year students, the tradition in our campus was to respect our seniors. We didn't want to know who was a political or non-political figure. As a result, our respect was for all seniors and we lived like the members of a family. But at present it is a common phenomenon that a student who comes to this campus looks for the shelter of a political big brother. The political elements also persuade them to get involved with politics for their own stability with the assurance of giving some benefits including accommodation facility in the dorm. Eventually, that innocent student gets involved in politics and respect only the political mentors, not other seniors. //////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////Prospects for indirect peace talks lay in tatters yesterday after the Palestinians said they would not negotiate with Israel unless it reversed plans to build 1,600 settler homes in east Jerusalem.//////Nepal's peace process is at a "very serious point", the United Nations' top political official said yesterday, urging party leaders to act on pledges made at the end of the war.//////A major drive has been launched against Maoist guerrillas in five districts of West Bengal and Jharkhand, and Orissa will soon join the campaign, a senior officer said yesterday.//////Heavy fighting between Somali insurgents and pro-government troops has killed at least 43 people over two days, as African Union peacekeepers used tanks to help the beleaguered government beat back an insurgent attack, officials said yesterday.//////Chief Minister of BJP-ruled Gujarat state Narendra Modi has been summoned by the Indian Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) to appear before it on March 21 in connection with the communal riots that rocked India in 2002.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai said yesterday that Pakistan has an "important" role to play in peace talks with the Taliban, a possible attempt to squash speculation that his government was trying to sideline its neighbour.//////At least 16 suspected Taliban insurgents, including top extremist commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, were reportedly killed in a couple of US drone attacks in North Waziristan.//////Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was ready to consult all parties for a consensus on the women's reservation bill before it is tabled in the Lok Sabha, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said yesterday.//////Not only is Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi effectively barred from upcoming elections, but she will not be allowed to vote and her opposition party's landslide win at the last polls has been formally invalidated, according to new election laws published Thursday.//////The House of Representatives on Wednesday roundly defeated a resolution demanding President Barack Obama withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan, in a key election-year test for his war strategy.//////A British boy who was kidnapped in Pakistan has been rescued and two people have been arrested, media reports said yesterday.//////Separate bomb attacks killed five Afghan civilians, including four children, and a Nato soldier in troubled parts of Afghanistan on Thursday, the military said.//////Gulf states are worried about Iran going nuclear, but equally fret about a dangerous confrontation that could arise from more sanctions and military threats against Tehran, analysts say.//////An Iranian appeals court sentenced a university professor to six years in prison for suspected involvement in the country's post-election turmoil, local media reported yesterday.//////US President Barack Obama joked on Wednesday that half of the 40,000 letters that pour into the White House each day brand him an "idiot."//////History, traditions and heritage of the indigenous communities of the Madhupur Garh region are seemingly under threat.
