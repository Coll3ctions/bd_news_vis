The meeting was organised by the local chapter of Bangladesh-Bharat-Pakistan People's Forum.//////The Director General of Bangladesh Rifles has informed the country that the border force will soon wind up the commercial outlets it has been operating in the capital for the last two years or more. We tend to think that, given the nature of the duties and responsibilities the BDR as a force is expected to carry out, the decision to do away with the eleven BDR shops is a judicious one as it will enable the force to return to the basics upon which it was established originally. One need hardly point out that such business activities on the part of the BDR, ever since they commenced in 2007, have raised eyebrows if not exactly questions, with large numbers of people seeing little reason why a disciplinary force should be engaging itself in business activities like any other commercial venture. Major General Mainul Islam has pretty aptly pointed to the vicious business cycle (his own words) the BDR has become trapped in over the BDR shops scattered across Dhaka.//////I was getting myself into the spirit of Amar Ekushey. Bangalis of the neo-consumerist age, our best stories are coming from colourful ads on TV. I whirled through all the channels, to catch the cream, the best ones on constant repeat. //////THIS is madness -- that's been the refrain on the government's decision to rename the country's major international airport. As the Daily Star editor asks: For God's sake why? Possible answers to Mr. Anam's questions can be found in an earlier article, All in, by Zafar Sobhan, one of his colleagues.

It is Biman's last hope, to take off from a financial mess, and fly smoothly.//////We usually know and believe that doctors take the patients under their wings to cure them. But last Thursday I was thunderstruck by the strange, unexpected and rather rude behaviour of a doctor in Ctg. Govt Medical College Hospital. I went there with my cousin Parul, an emergency patient who was on the verge of death. I entered into the doctors' room and requested a doctor to check up my cousin. The doctor replied, ''The admission file of your patient has not come yet in my hand and so I can't check up your patient.'' After 10 minutes, when the admission file was in the doctor's hand, I again requested the doctor to check up my cousin. That time the doctor angrily said to me, ''Just go outside and I will check up your patient when it will be time.'' Further the doctor told me, ''Don't enter into my room and disturb me.'' This unexpected behaviour drove me up to the wall, but it was a bitter pill to swallow. //////If any one or any group feels that they will achieve a great goal through terrorism, it will be a useless and unproductive effort. Such barbaric inhuman activities will only end in a fiasco. I think, every quarter should perceive the fact that terrorism cannot yield any positive outcome but destruction of lives and properties only contribute to increasing mistrust and hostilities among peoples of different cast and creed. Meanwhile, I would appeal to the Iraqi Muslims to end conflicts within themselves and other communities as Islam strongly pleads for maintaining peace and tranquillity. Let the differences between Muslims be resolved and peace established in Iraq. Meanwhile, I join US secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in condemning the recent series of bombing attacks against Shia pilgrims in Iraq ://////On the eve of visit of our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India and during her presence in New Delhi our attention was drawn to two news items published in some of our national dailies which are epitomised below:-//////Wasa supplies water through one water meter to a building, be it multi-storeyed or single unit and thus consumers are unaware about their individual consumptions. On the other hand, Wasa collects Taka 14 for one cubic meter of water supply for domestic consumers but this rate is Taka 46 in case of commercial consumer for the same one cubic meter water supply and naturally this rate is very, very high comparatively. The Wasa revenue inspectors compel the commercial consumers to induce corruption through underhand dealings. //////According to newspaper report it has been proposed that the Ministry of Civil Aviation & Tourism be renamed in Bengali as the Ministry of Biman & Tourists.//////Re: Daily Star, Page 3, 10th February 2010/The Main Reasons for Border Killings?//////The AL-led grand alliance has come to power with the slogan of Din Bodoler Sanad. As any other community we, indigenous communities, believe that we need changes in our attitudes, behaviours and in our mentality towards others. There is no denying that 45 indigenous communities have been living in Bangladesh for decades. They had a pioneer role in the Anti-British Movement, 1971 Liberation War and other nation building process. //////As our national and majestic animal, Royal Bengal Tiger has its own charm. And we should be lucky to have them in our Sundarbans. But very few people understand the real value of the tigers. They are killing tigers just for entertainment. As there is scarcity of food in the forest, the great cats are bound to come to nearby villages. It is really unwise to kill them.//////In present technological world internet performs a great and important role. It is an easy way to get any kind of information about any subject. But at present there are a lot of websites in internet which contain nude photos and videos. The most dangerous matter is that the young generation, especially, the school and college going students, view all these sites. //////Dhaka is a mega city. Here, going from one place to another has become a big challenge for us, the ordinary and poor people (not for rich and high ranking people who have their own or official car). Going just only from 'Mohakhali' to 'Farmgate' is a 'long-term process'. Previously, there was a 'Volvo' bus which performed a good service. But now there is no Farmgate going bus except local buses which are always overcrowded and risky. //////The tragic death of Abu Bakar has touched the whole nation. His parents sent him to the university to supplement their income being enlightened with education. But instead, he returned to his parents dead. How could Home Minister Sahara Khatun term the death as an "isolated one"? If the death of a university student is a normal incident to her, then who is there in the country to save the brilliant students? //////The heartbreaking death of Hamim Sheikh, the latest victim of reckless driving in the city, has apparently brought out the grim picture of road-hazards that we encounter every day. The distressing demise of the five years old boy of Willes Little Flower School has explicitly underscored the cheapness of human life in a country like Bangladesh. It's a country where in all sectors we have sheer lack of legal standards and effective implementation of law. Astounding facts are now coming out regarding unfit vehicles, fake driving licenses and unbelievable statistics of road accidents in the city. It appears that the relevant authorities that were supposed to take vital steps regarding these irregularities, have been sleeping in seclusion for long. I really don't know what initiatives (if any) our current and previous governments have taken so far to rectify this trend of mismanagement in public transport. I think we certainly have the right to be served well by our elected representatives. //////I fully agree with the suggestions expressed by Mr. Saleh Mohammed Ayub in your column. Construction of more bridges can be taken on the Dhanmondi lake at Road # 3A,4/A which will help a number of vehicles to spill out from the heavy congestions during the school timing. As a matter of fact two years back, we saw a move in this direction and stones and sands were accumulated at the Road # 4/A point of the lake. For some unknown reasons, those stones and bricks were removed presumably at the instruction of some VIPs who did not bother about the convenience of common public. May be their own interest was hampered. One wonders who decided at first to have a bridge on that point and then who decided against it. Shouldn't there be a coordinated effort and planning which is of much public interest? We should also know which are these long hands who can stop such an important public work. Alas! Poor Bangladesh.//////We are really anxious! Around 45 indigenous communities in Bangladesh are really in an endangered situation for the last few decades.

And before you know it the clock strikes 12:00, heralding in Ekushey (21) February. //////The romantic young lyricist Mohammad Rafiquzzaman was in for a surprise when his very first song was chosen for the prestigious E-masher Gaan on Radio.

Only the cold and rich nations participate in these games. And like the ice and snow on which the games are staged, the participants, too, are predominantly lily-white.//////A parliament is a sacred entity. By itself, it represents something that is beyond the ordinary. Like the heart in a human body, it is the most important organ of a well functioning democracy. //////THE best way to manage a controversy is to initiate it. Omar Abdullah was not giving voice to some sudden inner revelation when he suggested that the "boys" who had gone across the Line of Control could be welcomed back, surely as part of some ongoing Indo-Pak deal. Ghulam Nabi Azad's riposte stole opposition space, another clever ploy, if it was prearranged. It might not have been. Azad could have been motivated by legitimate concerns. Home Minister Chidambaram's support to Omar Abdullah, however, confirmed that there had been consultations between the two before Omar broached such a slippery subject.//////
