At least that is what has come out in a discussion meeting on Saturday in Dhaka on good governance organised by SUJON or Citizens for Good Governance.//////Our collective embarrassment cannot possibly get any deeper. The scandal surrounding the appointment of 190 sub-registrars last year reminds us once again of how corruption has systematically been eating away at the vitals of the country. All 190 applicants eventually appointed as sub-registrars, on the ground that they had been freedom fighters in 1971 and had played active roles in the Mujibnagar government, have now shamed us in a manner we could never have imagined. Observe the facts. Altogether 107 of them were below the age of 10 years in 1971 (one was only three!). The others were in their early teens, the oldest among them being 18 during the War of Liberation. The mind-boggling aspect of the situation here is that no one in the administration bothered to go into a bit of mathematics before appointing these individuals, on the basis of forged documents and bribes, to these posts. It has been nearly 40 years since Bangladesh became a free country. Those who took part in the war should logically be in their early 60s, at least, at this stage. Now, did it not occur to the authorities that the physical attributes of these 190 people did not quite match the realities of a war waged and won four decades ago?//////That the UN has dedicated a day to the people's Right to Know is a significant development.

It is a must that the general people of our country become aware of exactly what to do before and during an earthquake. Here are some of the things the experts had to say -//////This letter is prompted by the news in DS, 16 Sept where a parliamentary committee has asked DCC, DMP, BRTA, RAJUK and others to present their plan to curb traffic jams. I can only gape in amazement at the naivety of the Parliamentary Standing Committee.//////Street crimes in the capital and elsewhere have been on the rise. This has been the subject of a report published this week by a local NGO. The report highlights the growing number of street children involved in this activity. There has been a significant rise in the number of street children, particularly in Dhaka, says the report, adding that the reasons for children running away from their homes include domestic violence, sexual abuse and corporal punishment in schools, especially in madrasas. This is an issue that has to be dealt in a proactive manner. It may be noted that street children end up joining gangs which offer them protection in return for working on the streets. The gangs force the children into prostitution and crime. Incidents of petty crime have also risen as children are forced to beg, steal and borrow to retain their gang membership.//////The socio-economic health of greater Mymensingh, in my understanding, was not bad and I should say, it was fair 10/12 years back. As I have seen, during that time village people did not like to go out of village for their livelihood, rather they were satisfied staying in their villages. Personally, I know that some got jobs in the town but after some time they left the jobs and went back to the village and continued there with satisfaction. When people of other districts were seriously trying for jobs in the govt. or private sector in and outside the country, people of greater Mymensingh had been continuing to stay in village. //////I am an ardent fan of Angelina Jolie, a renowned and award winning actress of Hollywood. Right from the Tomb Rider to the recently released Salt, I never missed any of her movies. What amazes me most is her humanitarian attitude. Wherever there is any natural calamity, disaster or manmade crisis; we could see her beside the victims. From Darfur in Africa to the recent flood victims of Pakistan, from Haitian earthquake to the Tsunami mishaps, Angelina Jolie's voice is always within earshot. //////In present state of affairs, journalists are putting their lives on a palm to report news & events, especially TV journalists are working hard in Pakistan, they always rush to the sites, they perform their duties risking their lives. So far many TV and camera journalists have been killed. So I am suggesting that the government of Pakistan declare their performance and profession as a special service to the nation.//////The commercial capital of Bangladesh is Chittagong. For various reasons Chittagong attracts all. Chittagong is surrounded by rivers, hill tracts, and the Bay. //////One of the five pillars of Islam is Zakat. This is a compulsory duty of each rich Muslim fixed by Almighty Allah and if a rich Muslim ignores it, he or she will not be considered a good Muslim. //////A few days ago I went to the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The environment and the people of the hilly areas attracted me. Our neighbour India is branding their country as Incredible India to promote their tourism. But we have not seen any worthwhile initiative from our government in this respect. With the cricket world cup knocking at the door, it is high time for us to brand our country as something special to the visitors to promote our tourism. If we want to do so we should develop our infrastructure in the first place. As security is always an issue for the tourists, we have to make sure that no awkward incidents occur. It is a great pride for us that we will host the world cup matches and we need to make the best use of this opportunity for the greater interest of our economy.//////From September 10 to September 15, 2010, in the span of six days our country has been jolted four times by earthquakes. It is an ominous sign, experts are saying that these small tremors are the warnings of a major earthquake. According to a recent survey, around 250,000 buildings in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet are extremely vulnerable to earthquake.//////As per our constitutional provision, public servants are supposed to work for the people of the republic. But alas! The brilliant officers who enter the service with high hopes and dedication find their long-cherished hopes shattered when they realise that public service has been put in a bizarre form of slavery by stupid bossism rather than given a pro-people shape. Vigour and commitment of young officers droop very fast when they see professional excellence is measured in terms of flattery and political colour. Moreover, subordinates are many times ill-treated if their actions go against the will and interest of their boss, no matter how good their actions are. An efficient, honest and a truly loyal officer if ever dares to show such courage will surely miss good assignments, better posting and dreamt promotion. It happens because there is an archaic and very subjective Annual Confidential Report (ACR) system for evaluation. This faulty ACR is the instrument that helps bosses to enslave their subordinates. I presume public servants do not pronounce the very name of Almighty as many times as they utter the word SIR. Most public servants pass the very first two hours of their office time in flattering their boss with such lofty words and in such a tone that the boss by no way deserves. But ironically, it has been an established culture in public offices. //////Road accident has become a common thing in our country. The drivers are mostly responsible for this. They drive recklessly without being conscious about the lives of the passengers and the pedestrians. Sometimes they have a tendency to overtake other vehicles. Unfortunately, the passengers become the victims of their negligence. Because of these drivers, many people face premature death. //////The statement by the DIG Police of Dhaka Range, to the members of the press, published in most dailies on September 16th, accused some garment manufacturers for criminal intent in not clearing their workers' legitimate dues and festival bonus timely before Eid! This is a matter of shame and outright dishonesty of these criminal minded garment factory owners!//////Energy shortage has become a chronic problem in Bangladesh nowadays. At present, load shedding has become an hour-to-hour phenomenon in many busy cities of Bangladesh. However, it must not be said that the govt. is not trying to solve the present power crisis. But we need to search for more potential sources. As sunlight is a renewable energy resource, it is very feasible to replenish the depleted energy resource with this. In Bangladesh, a company named Grameen Shakti is providing the facility of establishing solar plant mostly in the rural areas. It will be successful if the government shows the attitude to patronise this sector!//////The news carried by The Daily Star and many dailies in Dhaka under similar captions on 16 September 2010 was not a surprise . The people of Bangladesh are used to this type of news in their media. The people of Bangladesh also know it very well that the faces of the godfathers who awarded the contract or preparing for awarding the contract to a blacklisted Firm will never be unveiled in public. //////Eve-teasing has taken a new form. We now have youths stalking women through cell-phones. Fortunately, some service providers have introduced call-block options. I thank them for understanding our plight. However, there is still something to worry about youths are actually indulging in unproductive activities! I don't know whom to blame exactly the movies which promote lewd acts as a way (and a brave one) of winning a girl's heart; the educational institutions which fail to address these issues as they are not a part of syllabus; the ever-pampering guardians who are completely unaware of what mischief their children are brewing or the true friends who distribute the numbers? I dare not blame the government high-ups for these unabated crimes as they are busy building a Digital Bangladesh. On behalf of all women, I wish to give a clear message to these youths, although I wonder if they would leave their cell-phones even for a second to read the newspaper. It's not cool to approach a woman that way and when we say we are not interested, we really mean it unlike what movies have indoctrinated you (that being persistent will melt us). We will be impressed if you, being a real man, utilize your education, time and energy into doing something for the welfare of the country and its citizens. Do you really have time for this when the nation is gripped with the fear of being hit by a catastrophic earthquake? On a lighter note, please give some respite to that poor little device. It may break down owing to your abuse.//////There are still many things in this world which religion as well as firm belief (common sense) can explain well but science cannot.
