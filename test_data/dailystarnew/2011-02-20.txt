The euphoria about the World Cup opener is gone, and all that Bangladesh are left with is the disappointment of an 87-run loss against the might of India. One aspect of yesterday's game that will haunt the home team and its supporters for some time to come is the lapse in judgement in sending India in to bat after winning the toss. Except some flashes with the bat, nothing went right for Shakib Al Hasan's men in the highly anticipated opening match of the ICC Cricket World Cup against favourites India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.//////The government's policy of distributing free textbooks, widening the stipend coverage for students and training teachers seems to be paying off: the dropout rate at the SSC level has come down sharply in last two years.//////Bangladesh may soon gain over 10,000 acres of land from India, as Dhaka and New Delhi prepare to exchange 162 enclaves.//////Following the shootings of February 21, 1952, it became clear that the whole of East Bengal and indeed the entirety of Pakistan were numbed by the tragedy. But the most important lesson emerging from the incidents of the day was that the movement for Bangla as the language of the state had assumed a much bigger dimension than could earlier be conceived of by politicians in the corridors of power. After February 21, events moved with remarkable speed. On April 26, 1952, as Abul Maal Abdul Muhith reports in his State Language Movement in East Bengal 1947-1956, a non-communal organisation going by the name of East Pakistan Students' Union was established. Alongside the emergence of the organisation came the fact of leading progressive Bangali thinkers getting together sometime in the middle of the year to form the Pakistan Shahitya Parishad. //////Thirteen people were killed and 45 others injured in two train-bus collisions in Comilla and Jessore yesterday. //////Two of the Middle East's most entrenched rulers were battling to stay in power yesterday amid reports of dozens of protesters killed in Libya and an offer of talks by Bahrain's king being rebuffed.//////Dreaming of a better future, Momin Bakkar flew to Singapore in June 2008, being completely unaware that the recession-hit economy there had nothing to offer him. //////The chief justice in a full court meeting with High Court judges yesterday discussed proposed amendments to HC rules including provisions for its judges and lawyers over dealing with cases.//////Implementation of the Jatrabari-Gulistan flyover project in the capital is making headway ahead of schedule after despite procedural and physical adversities, say project officials. //////Future climate change could change the profile of tropical forests, with possible consequences for carbon storage and biodiversity, a study says.//////A schoolboy, who was stampeded by a crowd celebrating Cricket World Cup Friday night near the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in the capital's Mirpur, succumbed to his injuries yesterday.//////Four suspected robbers were injured during a gunfight between them and Rapid Action Battalion at Chhotodhali of Companiganj in Noakhali early yesterday.//////Police yesterday recovered decomposed body of a watch-factory employee stuffed inside a carton at Chawkbazar in the capital.//////Coordinated and collaborative efforts are needed to address the common issues of protecting human rights of the South Asian countries, said Dr Mizanur Rahman, chairman of the National Human Rights Commission yesterday.//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday said peace talks with insurgent's group Ulfa has a "good future" and those who are issuing threat against the dialogue were not aware of "ground realities".//////Huge variety of magazines in the Little Magazine Chattar at Amar Ekushey Boi Mela was witnessing a good sale after succeeding to grab attention of readers of all ages. //////Gunmen and suicide bombers dressed as border police killed at least 18 people and wounded more than 70 in an attack on a bank in the main city in Afghanistan's east yesterday, government officials said.//////India charged a well-known Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan currency violations yesterday after he and his entourage were allegedly caught with $124,000 in undeclared cash at New Delhi's airport, reports said.//////Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid urged the United Nations to include Bangla as one of its official languages.//////The anti-dialogue faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa) led by its fugitive commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah has threatened to launch an armed strike against the ruling Congress in the state for splitting the outfit.//////Voices of change continue to be heard in diverse regions of the Middle East. After a truly remarkable bout of change in Tunisia and Egypt, it is by now absolutely clear that Arabs across the region have spontaneously risen in defence of a democracy they have never had over the last many decades. In Bahrain, in Libya, in Jordan, in Yemen, a tidal wave of popular revolt aimed at a liberalization of society through an overthrow of their entrenched ruling classes surges on, cheering votaries of democracy across the world. //////We would like to dwell a little on country Bangladesh and team Bangladesh to make our first point. The country Bangladesh came through with clat and flying colours for the magnificent opening of the World Cup. Then followed the preparations for the opening encounter between India and Bangladesh which impeccably marked the beginning of the World Cup Cricket, 2011. On the match day, traffic and entry into the stadium were managed well with due diligence as inside of the stadium wore a colourful, impressive look.//////There are many theories about the toss but cricket teams usually have two sets of plans to counter its aura. The captain of the weaker side would ideally like to attack with his strength and use that momentum to bring home the win. Through cricket history, the enigma of the toss has on very few occasions been redundant. Some captains even want to lose the damn thing just to avoid the responsibility.//////Virender Sehwag's bat laughed off the big occasion, expectations, threat of an upset and history. The right-hander's 140-ball 175 was testament to his fondness to prove everyone wrong and play according to his own formbook. He made sure he took his revenge on the Tigers after the Port-of-Spain defeat haunted him for the last four years.//////"Today has been declared public holiday, so it's better to stay home than to go to work," were the words from a policeman who was directing traffic movements at Shishu Mela crossing of Shyamoli area in the city yesterday morning.//////Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan stuck by his decision to bowl first despite his side's 87-run defeat against favourites India in the opening match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////The opening ceremonies that precede major sporting events, by their very nature, are usually quite drab affairs. Sport is an arena for thrill underpinned by suspense, the ebb and flow of emotions you are no longer in control of. Au contraire, these lavish opening ceremonies only provide an opportunity for some pomp and pageantry, at best a coming-out party, at worst unnecessary. //////Kumar Sangakkara admitted his knowledge of Canada is confined to ace batsman John Davison, who once scored the fastest World Cup hundred, but that does not bother the Sri Lankan captain.//////Elections to the Sylhet Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) will be held on June 2, the chamber's administrator Md Abul Hasan said.//////Kenya will go into their opening World Cup game against New Zealand drawing confidence from stellar past performances at cricket's showpiece event, captain Jimmy Kamande said Saturday.//////Struggling New Zealand will be keen to resurrect their fortunes and start their World Cup campaign with a victory against underdogs Kenya on Sunday.//////The biggest advantage of watching a game from the stands alongside the faithful and not encased in an air-conditioned press box is that you miss nothing of the buzz, the collective heartbeat of the thousands who are inside the stadium egging on their own to do better and bigger things.//////Australian all-rounder Shane Watson said Saturday he had "big shoes to fill" but vowed to do his best to get his team off to flying starts in their quest for a fourth successive World Cup.//////New Zealand will look to make a fresh start at the World Cup after a harrowing run in recent one-day internationals, skipper Daniel Vettori said Saturday.//////The International Cricket Council's proposal to trim the next World Cup to 10 teams is a step "backward", Zimbabwe batting coach Grant Flower said on Saturday.//////Zimbabwe batting coach Grant Flower said Saturday he is looking forward to a disciplined performance from his spinners in their opening World Cup match against Australia.//////Lyon gave themselves the perfect morale boost for next Tuesday's Champions League home clash with Real Madrid on Friday as they eased to a 4-0 victory over Nancy.//////Holders Chelsea were sent crashing out of the FA Cup here on Saturday after losing a dramatic fourth round replay against Everton 4-3 on penalties.//////Arsene Wenger has demanded his Arsenal side maintain the standards they set in beating Barcelona when they face League One Leyton Orient in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday.//////Four fans were arrested by police on Saturday as Roma 'Ultras' protested against their team's poor recent form.//////Inter Milan coach Leonardo took a swipe Friday at those who questioned the standard of Serie A after defeats for Italian clubs in the Champions League this week.//////Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti defended Gennaro Gattuso on Friday following the AC Milan stalwart's headbutt on Tottenham coach Joe Jordan during the Champions League this week.//////Potato prices have plunged to a four-year low both at retail and grower levels due to an increased supply.//////Garment exports will rise further in coming months, as manufacturers have already bagged bigger orders than before.//////A new government committee has ruled out any need for external experts or consultants for reforms to state-run banks.//////MIDAS Financing Ltd and Management and Resources Development Initiative (MRDI) have distributed eco-friendly ovens among families in Bon Laudob village in the Sundarbans in a bid to help save the ecosystem of the forest.//////Bangladesh Bank is ready to help develop agro-processing industry in the Chittagong Hill Tract (CHT) area for the benefit of the farmers who produce large amount of fruit, vegetables and other perishable goods every year, said Governor Atiur Rahman.//////Hot on the heels of inking a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with Japan, India on Friday signed a similar accord with Malaysia that envisages liberal trade in goods and services and seeks to provide a stable investment regime between the two countries.//////The 19th Chittagong International Trade Fair 2011(CITF) begins today at the Railway Pologround to promote local products in the international market. //////The board of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) postponed its elections for undisclosed reasons, said the board chief yesterday.//////Consumer perception of the word "brand" is usually associated with quality.

A world burdened by inflation in oil, other commodities and food may share his frustration. The president hopes the French and other Europeans will, too.

This means G20 finance ministers may realise little in their discussion on the matter -- even though Sarkozy is right that speculation in commodities is part of the price problem.//////Cricket's popularity in India and the huge revenue it generates is hampering the governing body's efforts to crack down on ambush marketing there, said experts before the World Cup started.//////Corporate Bangladesh is likely to face an acute shortage of mid- and senior-level professionals by 2021 unless immediate steps are taken to nurture and develop its own pool of talent, say management experts.//////Most jobseekers stay uncomfortable while finding out the best way to face an interview board intelligently.

Bangladesh became the 10th member of the elite family of test playing nations in the world. Being a test playing nation was not as easy as it was thought to be. Bangladesh's cricketers had to face many obstacles on their way to achieving test status. Bangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came at the 1979 ICC Trophy in England, leaving the tournament with 2 wins and 2 defeats. Seven years later, on 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played in its first ODI match against Pakistan in the 1986 Asia Cup. Although football was the most popular game here for a long time, cricket gained momentum and soon surpassed football, especially after Bangladesh won the ICC Trophy in Malaysia in 1997. The year 1999 was a historic year for Bangladesh as it played its first World Cup in England. Bangladesh created an enormous upset by beating Pakistan by 62 runs during the 1999 Cricket World Cup in the group match at Northampton. Bangladesh managed 223/9 from 50 overs; in reply Pakistan could only manage 161 due to a few run-outs by wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud and some tight bowling by Khaled Mahmud, who took 3/31 from 10 overs. He was later judged man of the match. Bangladesh also beat Scotland in that tournament, although they did not qualify for the Super Six round due to defeats in three of their five matches. However, the win over Pakistan, who went on to become eventual runners-up to Australia in that World Cup, gave Bangladesh a head start in their quest to become a test playing country. //////Seven

State Minister for Environment & Forest has logically stated that steel importers will be most benefited by harming the ship breaking sector. Interested parties are therefore inciting the environment groups to get after this sector which supplies most of the raw materials for steel rolling industry and steel melting. Ship breaking also employs a sizable number of people, providing them a livelihood. //////In spite of giving repeated commitments, the AL-led government did not take any effective measures for the development of railway sector in its last two years in office. Our policy makers are sitting idly while the neighbouring countries including India are taking various development programmes for improving their railway service, as it is the main dependable means of communication. //////The suggestion of readers of your newspaper in recognising people like Sir Frank Peters for his noble and worthwhile contribution to Bangladesh and bestowing upon him and other foreigners the honorary title of 'Goodwill Ambassador' and 'Friend of Bangladesh' is brilliant! In almost 40 years of successive governments, we have not said 'thanks' to anyone for their good deeds or kind contributions. Hopefully, this will break the cycle, but I doubt it. If we cannot honour and demonstrate our gratitude to the likes of Musa Ibrahim who risked his life and limb scaling Mount Everest and escalated Bangladesh into world news in the most positive way imaginable, I would not be holding my breath awaiting any form of thanks if I were a foreigner. //////Every year 21st February is celebrated in Bangladesh remembering the supreme sacrifices of the language heroes of this country. Today our state language is Bangla. But could we establish Bangla as a mode of communication in all spheres of life? Why can't we use Bangla in all govt. ministries? Bangla is spoken by around 30 million people in the globe. 21st February has been recognised as the International Mother Language Day. But as Bangalee, we don't show due respect to our mother language. //////Awami League has come to power with a landslide victory but so far it could do very little according to its election pledges. Prices of essentials are sky rocketing day by day. Unemployment is a big issue. Electricity and gas crises have become acute. Our government should solve electricity crisis immediately for industrial and agricultural development. Breaking the syndicate is essential to halt the spiralling prices of the essentials.//////Harassing girls or women has become a common matter nowadays which can be regarded as one of the worst social diseases of the country. This leads many girls to take a very hard decision of not going outside their home and ultimately force them to drop out from schools and colleges and sometimes to migrate to other places along with their families. Another big concern is that the girls harassed outside even tend to kill themselves. Though many educational and non-governmental organisations stood by those victim families expressing their concern, protested by forming human chains to make some differences, but these do not seem to be enough to wipe out this social disease. //////Living abroad we dearly love our country and people. But I feel that people back there have lost their hearts. Hena, the 14-year-old girl, who according to the news report was raped by her cousin and was punished to death next day for being raped!! I am sure the fatwabaj definitely had some interest in the matter, as they also lessened the punishment of the rapist who should only be punished for the heinous act. I do not know what is happening in my country. I am frustrated and saddened. //////Our parliament sessions are short and the debates far shorter. Our elected representatives are not passionate men and women, driven to politics by a determination to leave their mark on the world, or at least on those who oppose them. //////I wonder if, on her recent visit to the UK, the Honourable Prime Minister enquired about an odd expression, used in the Mother of Parliaments. As a student of constitutional history, it used to puzzle me - 'the usual channels'. The explanation was given to me eventually, and, coming across it recently, I was struck by its continuing relevance. //////With the onset of the Cricket World Cup season 2011, the sports channels are all abuzz with talk shows and flashbacks to encapsulate the spirit of the occasion. So, yesterday I was watching the semi-final of ICC World Cup 2003 between Australia and Sri Lanka on Neo Cricket. Australia was batting first. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden were hitting all over the park until a ball went up and was caught in the slips. The bowler went up with a Howzzat and so did the other fielders. However, the umpire remained unfazed and signalled a 'Not Out' for Gilchrist. And then to the utter amazement of the commentators, the opposition team, his own teammates and the whole audience present in the stadium, Adam Gilchrist walked out of the crease and started his way back to the pavilion. The case was such that even technology could not have detected that Gilchrist was out and he would have easily got a 'Benefit of Doubt. But Gilchrist showed the courage to stick to what is right in the face of all kinds of temptations. We all might as well take a note of this on the backdrop of the nation striding through rampant corruption prevailing literally everywhere possible. //////Thousands of anti-government protesters have reoccupied their former stronghold in the capital, Manama, after troops and riot police retreated from the Pearl roundabout in the centre of the city.//////The number of people killed in three days of protests in Libya has risen to 84, according to the New York-based group Human Rights Watch.//////One protester was shot dead and five wounded in clashes with Yemeni government supporters near the capital Sanaa's university campus on Saturday, an AFP correspondent reported.//////Developments in the unrest sweeping some other countries://////The US has vetoed an Arab resolution at the UN Security Council condemning Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories as an obstacle to peace.//////In appointing Marc Grossman as the new special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the United States is turning to a consummate diplomat who may change tact in two deeply complex relationships.//////A Pakistani anti-terrorism court has reissued an arrest warrant for former president Pervez Musharraf over the assassination of ex-prime minister Benazir Bhutto, according to a prosecutor.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday that only a political solution will end the war in Afghanistan as she voiced hope for splitting off rank-and-file Taliban from Al-Qaeda extremists.//////The study of birds, bats and flying insects could be transformed by the use of technology designed for tracking storms, researchers say.//////Somali pirates on Friday hijacked a yacht with four Americans on board in the Indian Ocean, a non-governmental organisation monitoring regional maritime activity said.//////Fewer big, predatory fish are swimming in the world's oceans because of overfishing by humans, leaving smaller fish to thrive and double in force over the past 100 years, scientists said Friday.//////Speaking more than one language protects the brain against cognitive decline and makes a person better at multi-tasking, researchers said Friday at a major US science conference.//////In a cold underground bunker once packed with enough dollars to replenish the cash supply in the eastern United States in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack, "Gigi" lies silently near "An American in Paris".//////Sarah Ferguson, the former wife of Britain's Prince Andrew, will not be invited to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April, her spokesman told a newspaper yesterday.//////The enchanting beauty and traditional culture of Bangladesh was the common thread of cultural performances by students from eight English medium schools of Chittagong.
