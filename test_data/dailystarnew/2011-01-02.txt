And it is as good a time as any to look forward to what the nation ought to expect from the government, given its record in the year just gone by. The first point to note is some intrinsic strengths the government possesses, mainly by virtue of its three-fourths majority in parliament, whereby the ruling party can show magnanimity by giving the opposition some space. For its part, the opposition, being a crucial component of democracy, must come to terms with its own responsibilities to its constituents and to the country through opting for active participation in the Jatiyo Sangsad. Reverting to the performance of the government, we are deeply distressed at the cavalier manner in which a number of so-called politically motivated cases have been withdrawn. We believe the law should have been allowed to run its course. Such withdrawals of cases have only raised questions about the future of the rule of law. In addition, there has been a clear degree of politicization of the bureaucracy. Appointments to administrative positions along partisan lines have obviously undermined morale in the civil service, something we should have done without.//////Results of maiden Junior School Certificate and Junior Dakhil Certificate exams are just out combined passing rate being 73.04 percent. Considering the nature of the exams and the sudden challenge upon the students, we should be comfortable with the outcome. To be precise, the pass rate in JSC exams is 71.34 percent and in JDC exam 81.03. It needs to be noted, however, that the passing rate is less than the 92 percent as in primary terminal exams, leaving room for improvement there. The number of schools with cent percent pass rate is 863 while only 2 madrassas got that credit. Boys fared better than the girls. Pass rate among boys is 75.65 while the rate is 70.68 among the girls. Examinees of the Barisal Board achieved the highest passing rate of 81.75 percent.//////The cricket World Cup is still 48 days away and the ticket booths are to be opened this morning, but for the thousands who stood in line in front of different The City Bank branches since yesterday morning, World Cup fever has already caught on.//////The domestic cricket continued to lose its discipline as yet another unsavoury incident marred a Premier League match on Friday.//////Rahmatganj Muslim Friends Society started the Grameenphone Bangladesh League with a 2-1 victory over Arambagh Krira Sangha at the Birshreshtha Mustafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday. A fine volley from youngster Jamal Hossain gave Rahmatganj the lead before their Nigerian recruit Paul McJames Mwachukwu made it 2-0 after the breather. Veteran Liberian striker Benjamin Cooper's last gasp goal was the only consolation for a sorry Arambagh. //////Pakistan cricket chiefs said on Saturday they would allow one-day captain Shahid Afridi and coach Waqar Younis to appear at a hearing into spot-fixing allegations in Doha during the coming week.//////A quadruple from Sohag powered AK International School to a 6-1 victory over Kamuchan Shah High School in a match of the Asian City Dhaka Metropolis School Football Tournament at the Rahmatganj MFS Ground yesterday.

We expect sustained above-trend expansion and forecast global Gross Domestic Produce (GDP) growth of about 3.5 percent in 2011 and 4 percent in 2012. Global growth is rarely uniform, but the current recovery is more uneven across major economies than usual. The developed countries overall should record only modest growth in 2011 because of private sector deleveraging and, in many cases, fiscal consolidation. Divergences are likely to remain acute in the euro-area, with continued above-trend growth in Germany but little or no growth in the periphery countries like Greece and Portugal. The emerging markets in Asia should again outperform the other regions as the expansions in China and India will continue, not only in 2011 but also for many years to come.//////In a dimly lit room at the back of an Afghan house, 21-year-old Zahara is crouched on a plank of wood weaving a large carpet on a loom that she was able to buy using a microfinance loan of $1,100.//////Charlie Raines has resolved to become more Web savvy in the New Year in order to haul in business overseas for his fledgling Florida-based seafood company.//////Facebook stole the thunder from Google this year as the most-visited website in the United States, according to a new study from Internet research firm Experian Hitwise.//////French supermarket giant Carrefour has opened its first cash and carry store in India, hoping the government will soon relax restrictions on foreign investment in its massive retail sector.//////Steel giant ArcelorMittal upped its takeover bid for Baffinland Iron Mines on Friday, valuing the company at about C$550 million ($550 million) as it pursues its undeveloped iron ore deposit in Canada's Arctic.//////Japan's top carrier NTT DoCoMo is to launch a tablet computer running Google software to challenge Apple's hot-selling iPad, a report said Saturday.//////The conglomerate, Sahara India Pariwar, has bought London's luxurious Grosvenor House hotel from state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland for 470 million pounds ($728 million).//////Colombia will sell 10 percent of its shares in Ecuador's state oil firm Ecopetrol, worth some eight billion dollars, to fund its response to a rainy season that killed 303 people and left 2.2 million homeless, an official said Thursday.//////US automakers Ford and Chrysler are recalling tens of thousands of vehicles due to safety problems, the government said Friday.//////US stocks closed mixed Friday in a quiet final session of 2010 as investors looked toward the new year in hopes of building on Wall Street's recent robust gains.//////A bout of profit taking seems likely early next year after the S&P 500 ended its best December in almost two decades, but stocks may have further to run at the start of 2011.////// //////This week trading in the international markets was quite thin, as most traders were away on the year end holidays.

Obviously, the question is does it stand true to what it is intended for? A cursory look at the state of affairs obtaining in developed and developing economies all over the world will provide instant answer. It is apparent that though a good many countries show meteoric G.D.P growth and high rise of income and wealth, yet the fruits of development do not reach equally, or even at all, to all the segments of the population. In fact, the rich and poor divide further widens and the number of poor multiplies. //////An article on the matter was published in a local daily on December 25th. The writer stated that merely restricting private motor cars is not the solution of traffic problems of Dhaka. I agree, and believe that two distinct steps need to be taken to ensure that traffic is streamlined by speed and power. The first step is to segregate traffic by type of drive (powered or manual). Secondly, traffic police must control traffic by slots on time basis, rather than the traffic density in each direction, as they tend to do all the time.//////We do not need the TIB report stating that the people of Bangladesh paid Tk. 9,591 crore bribe between June 2009 and May this year, or the WikiLeaks to assess how mired we are in corruption. People are aware of the ever increasing corruption in all sectors, thanks to the media. //////It is very unfortunate that the Chief Election Commissioner has discouraged the use of national ID card on the plea that it is not hundred percent complete.

I do not know whether she is right or wrong when reportedly 208 people were killed in political violence, 115 in extrajudicial killings, 91 died in police custody, 63 Bangladeshi nationals killed in the border by Indian BSF; when there were 231 incidents of repression of journalists including killing, attack, litigation and arrest; and another 1,790 incidents of rape, in 11 months from January to November 2010.//////Julian Assange has shaken the world by standing against the superpower America and its allies. WikiLeaks has unearthed lots of significant and unknown data about what America and its allies are doing. We know how America has been doing injustice to other countries. They invaded Afghanistan and Iraq to fight against so-called 'terrorism,' but later the world came to know who the real terrorists are. The world also knows what is going on in Israel and Palestine. Now the USA has targeted Iran for developing its nuclear project. It cannot tolerate the rise of others. It always talks about humanity and democracy but does not without practice it.//////These days a person is often considered to be good or bad by his/her profession. If he or she does a government job, most of the people make good comments about him or her. Sometimes I think if a rickshaw puller does not pull his rickshaw, then how will we be able to go to our destination? If all of us do government jobs, then who will do private jobs? //////Morality is the only virtue that makes human race a nation, and even a man great. The international, national, social and family problems that we are facing nowadays are due to lack of morality. All thoughtful people's opinion regarding morality is almost similar. Every religion teaches morality and the believers practice it whole-heartedly. In our society, the best way of teaching morality is to teach religion. The teaching of making a believer is more important than the teaching that makes a person mere educated. //////North Korea began 2011 with calls for improved relations with South Korea after a year of tensions marked by the first deadly attack on a civilian area since the war.//////Egyptian officials now believe that an attack on a church which killed at least 21 worshippers in Alexandria was the work of a suicide bomber.//////Ivory Coast's incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo has rejected a deadline set by his rival for him to stand down, saying the international community is trying to stage a coup against him.//////Several people have been killed by a bomb blast at a bar near a barracks in Nigeria's capital, Abuja.//////Three people were killed yesterday and dozens injured when an aircraft burst into flames before take-off on a runway at an airport in Russia's Far North, officials said.//////A series of tornadoes in the south and mid-western US have killed six people, injured several others and caused power failures for thousands in the region.//////Two US drone attacks have killed at least 11 people in Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal region, local officials say.//////India and Pakistan yesterday exchanged through diplomatic channels the list of each other's nuclear installations and facilities under the bilateral Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against nuclear installations.//////Sri Lanka's government has decided to change the names of all state institutions still bearing the nation's former British colonial name, Ceylon.//////Face-to-face negotiations are still the best path to peace with the Palestinians, an Israeli official said Saturday dismissing calls for a new peace plan as premature.//////A strong earthquake has struck in northern Argentina, but it was not immediately clear if there were any injuries or damage.//////Fifteen people, mostly schoolgirls, were drowned when a school bus was swept off the road by flood waters, Egyptian police say.//////At least 45 people were injured when one passenger train crashed into another in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires.//////Two bomb disposal policemen were killed and nine other people wounded in a blast in the Thai south yesterday after warnings of New Year violence in the restive region, police said.//////A Palestinian woman died overnight after being teargassed by Israeli troops at a West Bank protest, an incident the Palestinian Authority is calling "a war crime."//////Pope Benedict said on Saturday he will host a summit of world religious leaders in the city of Assisi in October to discuss how they can promote world peace.//////Estonia has become the 17th member of the eurozone - the first ex-Soviet state to adopt the EU single currency.//////Yemen's parliament agreed in principle on Saturday to make constitutional amendments that could see President Ali Abdullah Saleh rule for life, and will hold a formal vote on the matter later this year.//////One person was killed, more than 70 injured, and fireworks set on fire dozens of piles of rubbish as the city of Naples rang in the new year.//////People from all walks of life in Rajshahi city swung to the rhythm of folk songs on third and fourth day of the Folk Festival, organised by Rajshahi Theatre.

Something Barack Obama did during his campaign for the United States presidency in 2008 quickly caught on around the world. He promised change if he were elected to the White House. And suddenly other politicians in other countries were picking up the idea, to tell their own people that change was theirs for the asking, only if they voted for those who promised it. That was what the Awami League did in the campaign leading up to the general elections of December 2008. Having gone through the bitter experience of the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government, a period which saw Sheikh Hasina undergo a spell of imprisonment and, before that, a bitter struggle to be let back into the country following a bad move by the authorities to prevent her return from a trip abroad, the Awami League appeared willing and ready to inaugurate a new phase in national politics. Its pledge was one of change. It called the promise "dinbodol-er rajniti" -- the politics of change.//////The young boy diving around in this veritable dustbowl can hardly be eight years old.
