The intriguing matter is that polythene bag is banned in our country. The present caretaker govt, since it took over, has brought many changes or at least tried to do so either by enacting laws or by amending provisions in the existing laws. But it is a matter of regret that they have given a complete blind eye to the violation of an existing law. When the whole world is getting interested in using environment friendly things in everyday life, our country is producing environment destroying polythene. People of our country have a natural tendency to violate laws. So the govt should ensure the enforcement of the laws. We expect our govt will take necessary measures immediately to stop polythene production and sale.//////With all the hoopla of the US election slowly dying down, it is time for the new President Elect to assemble his team and get down to the business of restoring the world economy as well as the American status quo in the world.

A description of the event given by one, Mr. Naseer Ahmad Mughal via a google website posting has been presented below://////A news item that was published in your daily on November 17,2008 with the headline "Harassed, girl takes her life" caught my attention. I was sad and yet angry with the people for whom an innocent girl had to give her precious life. This is not a new story. It is happening in our society often but how long will we keep on seeing these barbaric attitudes of these characterless people? As long as we do not have effective laws in our society these incidents will keep on happening. The girl was an SSC examinee who took her own life when some boys repeatedly teased her. //////Dr. Kamal Hossain, Gono Forum President and an eminent jurist while speaking in a discussion meeting organised by Peoples' Empowerment Trust on 17 November said that the culprits should not be allowed to stage a come back and participate in any election.//////The political parties are now busy selecting the candidates for the upcoming parliamentary & upazila election.

No doubt this is a piece of good news. But the question is who are these honourable judges?

Fine. //////I am writing this letter in reference to the recent report titled  Huge explosive haul after JMB men held on Monday Nov 17 where the JMB members were referred to as Islamic militants. I always wonder from where the word Islamic militants came and what is really meant by Islamic militants or Islamic terrorists . Where in our religion it is mentioned how to be an ISLAMIC militant or how to be an ISLAMIC terrorist? What is the Islamic way to kill people or do harm to others? Living abroad when I open newspapers or listen to the media I feel bad to hear the word Islamic terrorist but at the same time I feel that these people do not know much about this great religion so it is easy for them to label the terrorists as the way they are doing now. Once I had to speak to my child's schoolteacher regarding a handout given at school on 9/11 observance day where a picture showed an airplane being attacked by Islamic terrorists. My little girl questioned me mom who is a Islamic terrorist, Why are they calling this bad people as Islamic terrorists. //////Dowry is a curse of our society. It is destroying the lives of many women.//////BNP led four party took decision to participate in the next national elections, realising the importance of holding the elections on time. //////In recent times, the country has seen an important change that could have a far-reaching effect on the political culture in Bangladesh. The Jamaat-e-Islami has changed their party name and constitution to remain in conformity with the constitution of Bangladesh. Critics have argued that Jamaat has not changed their ideology although in writing they mention about democratic norms. Without arguing about their intention, I think we could at least welcome them for making these changes and hold them accountable if they go against their constitution. In this context, I have some concerns which needs be addressed by the party leaders of Jamaat . I believe the party could gain people's trust if they take necessary steps to show that their deeds reflect their words.//////Hundreds of angry protesters threw rocks at a polling station and clashed with government soldiers in Indian Kashmir on Sunday during the second phase of state elections.//////Helicopter gunships attacked Tamil Tiger rebel positions in northern Sri Lanka as battles shifted onto a key highway leading to the rebels' political capital, the defence ministry said.//////Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday talked tough with the police forces, telling top officers they needed to gather actionable intelligence and act in a manner that does not damage their image among the people.//////Israel's defence establishment in a recommendation paper to be presented to the Cabinet has asked it to make contingency plans to attack Iran, reach a peace agreement with Syria and prevent polls in the Palestinian areas even if Tel Aviv has to confront with the US.//////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said yesterday that he will call snap presidential and parliamentary elections in the New Year if reconciliation talks with the Islamist Hamas movement fail.//////Anti-government protesters said yesterday they were massing activists in the Thai capital for their biggest rally yet in a final showdown with the government, while the military deployed soldiers to deter violence.//////Mutinous soldiers fought their way into the fortified residence of Guinea-Bissau's president in a three-hour gunbattle yesterday but did not hurt the head of state, a top official said.//////A high-level meeting to discuss security in Iraq opened in Damascus on Sunday less than a month after US soldiers raided a Syrian village in a hunt for a "facilitator" of foreign fighters entering Iraq.//////Tension mounted yesterday between pirates holding a Saudi tanker and Islamist fighters threatening to attack them, with a week remaining for the ship's owners to meet a 25-million-dollar ransom demand.//////One day after saying he was waxing "nostalgic" about his eight years in office, US President George W Bush joked Saturday that he faces "forced retirement" when Barack Obama takes over in 59 days.//////The Russian and US leaders put a brave face on their differences at valedictory talks on Saturday, with officials saying Iran and piracy were problems the two sides would continue working on.//////The Iraqi parliament will vote Wednesday on a pact that would allow American troops to stay in Iraq for three more years, but the government's hopes of winning a wide margin of approval to ensure the deal's legitimacy appeared to be fading.//////US President-elect Barack Obama pledged in a telephone conversation with Afghan President Hamid Karzai that fighting terrorism in Afghanistan and the region an apparent reference to Pakistan would be a top priority during his administration, Karzai's office said Sunday.//////US-led forces in Afghanistan said Sunday they had killed an Afghan civilian in a battle that also left two militants dead, as nine Taliban rebels were reported killed in a separate clashes.//////Polls opened across Venezuela Sunday in elections for governors and mayors seen as a popularity test for leftist President Hugo Chavez, one year after the anti-US leader lost a referendum on extending his authority.//////Ibrahim Nasir, credited with ushering in independence to the Maldives as prime minister and then serving as its first president has died, a former government spokesman confirmed.//////At the ten-day studio theatre festival by the troupe Palakar, mostly experimental plays are being staged.
