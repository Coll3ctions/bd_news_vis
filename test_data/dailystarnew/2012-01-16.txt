President Asif Ali Zardari met chief of army staff General Kayani. This was followed by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani having met the army chief and the senior army officers. Clearly, Gilani has come out with an olive branch from what had been only the other day a direct verbal attack on the military that they were interfering in the political affairs of the country.

In my opinion, the most positive event in Bangladesh last year was the victory of Selina Hayat Ivy in Narayanganj City Corporation election and The Daily Star published her picture smiling with a 'V' sign in the front page of 'New Year Special 2012.' This was not an ordinary victory, it reflected the hopes and aspirations of the mass people against all odds and oppressions. She had to fight against a formidable adversary who got the blessing of the ruling party. But people liked Ivy's simple and hard working nature. Above all, she was not involved in corruption. Ivy is an exception. She was elected first when the BNP was in power and now when her own party withdrew their supports from her, she was elected again. Her father was elected in 1974 in a similar way. //////Recently one of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)'s top leaders urged the government to stop the activities of International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). The BNP has made it clear that it stands against the prosecution of crimes against humanity. We cannot betray the ideals and values of our Liberation War. The crimes that were committed in 1971 must be dealt with very sincerely according to the law and this opportunity must not be lost. We are grateful to the government for starting the process. There may be some criticism, but the people of Bangladesh should trust it. //////A report prepared by BNWLA and published in The Daily Star on 9th January 2012 has surprised me. The report was about the safety and security of women in our country. Very truly we can say that proper monitoring by the government agencies and raising awareness among the people will have positive impact. I am confident that those people who are doing the acts of violence are not unaware about it. A group of people are continuing with such acts including torture on domestic helps. Formation of a national commission to protect the rights of women will be of help. We need to realise that all of us have sisters and daughters whom we love very much. Otherwise one day our own sister or daughter may become victim of torture.//////It is a great relief that treatment of heart diseases is now done pretty well here in Dhaka. As we know, a patient with heart pain or heart related complaints is always advised to consult a cardiologist. If after investigations and angiogram, a patient is found to have blocks, one, two or more, the cardiologist is supposed to advise the patient what treatment s/he can undergo within his ability. But our cardiologists outright suggest implantation of 'ring', indicating nothing of the other method which is also widely available and he can follow. The cost of each ring is 1.20 or 1.40 lac and it is alleged that a hefty sum of commission is paid to the cardiologist by the ring-marketing coterie. Usually most of the patients need two rings and with other charges (hospital stay, medicines and cardiologists' fees, etc.) the cost of implantation of two rings come to between Tk. 3.50 and 4.00 lacs. //////According to a report in The Daily Star, BRTA has been gripped with broker activities for decades; due to non-transfer of personnel at regular intervals (the same problem exists in Rajuk & DCC). //////I am a subscriber of state-owned mobile operator, TeleTalk. I thought that it would be cheaper and the service would be much better than other operators, forgetting that for state-owned institutions nothing runs as it should. I bought the SIM with a high price. The call charge of TeleTalk is 1.33 per minute, which is much higher than other operators. It is very disappointing and objectionable. According to a report published in The Daily Star, leading telecom operator GrameenPhone is still ahead with 3.61 crore users whereas Teletalk has only 11.98 lakh subscribers. Teletalk also lost 9,000 connections.//////The timely and bold initiative taken by the US President Barack Obama to finalise Clean Car Standards, that will nearly double fuel efficiency and cut global warming emissions in half for new cars and trucks by 2025 saving consumers' billions at the gas pump, deserves appreciation and support from all the quarters. Automakers, labour leaders, security experts, and consumer groups all support the proposed standards but it's not clear why Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) is on the attack against those working toward a clean car future?//////Fidel Castro's well presented full page article, titled as above, published in the editorial page of a local English daily on 11th January, is a sound scientific analysis of what is happening and the dangerous possible aftermath of the methodology for exploration of methane from underground geological shale structures by the USA. Releasing the trapped methane gas from shale by forced hydraulic fracturing of the underground shale structure is a procedure involving various risks, as described in Castro's article. This procedure uses 'benzene' and 'toluene' to be injected mixed with water for the hydraulic fracture of the shale structure and releases water contaminated with carcinogenic benzene and toluene in the water bodies. //////In Chittagong Polo Ground Begum Zia announced that Moinuddin- Fakhruddin caretaker government was unconstitutional. In the past she said several times that the said government was illegal and that she would try the advisers if she comes to power.

And Zubair Ahmed, a fourth year student of the English department, had to pay in blood for the factional war that erupted between the two groups of pro-government student bodies, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) on January 8. //////The much-married diva Elizabeth Taylor had an unanswerable riposte for a pesky reporter after one of her husbands, Mike Todd, went up to the Great Hollywood in the Sky. "Mike's dead," she said, "what do you want me to do, sleep alone?" Elizabeth Taylor should be formally recognised as the defining icon of contemporary Indian politics. True love has its limits. Romance is nice, but not essential to fill a bed.//////
