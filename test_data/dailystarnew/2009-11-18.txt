No one who believes in democracy wishes to see such pandemonium get the better of an established political party. In the interest of healthy politics in Bangladesh, we expect the BNP to tide over its difficulties and truly emerge as a vibrant and cohesive organization. Its troubles, let us note, should not be a cause for satisfaction on the part of other parties because the pains the BNP is passing through have to do with the bad tradition of nurturing unruly elements and feuds within a party. Such a tendency is to be discerned in varying degrees among other political parties as well. All other parties may, therefore, desist from the temptation of feeling happy at the BNP's discomfiture and indeed hope that such disturbances are defused within the party before long.//////The world summit on food security held in Rome in the prelude to the high-profile Copenhagen global climate conference has proved to be long on expression of concerns but short on commitments. That is how generally the outcome has been described by the rather discerning western media.//////WE as a people are going through a most exciting phase in our collective life.

It has enough scope for both vertical and horizontal expansion in terms of economic return and social benefits. Leather making is capital-intensive, with labour costs in the region of 10 percent to 15 percent. A tanner has limited opportunities to isolate any high labour cost and shift it to a low-cost area. European and North American tanners and manufactures have introduced computerisation and robotics to reduce the labour input, rationalise selection and production control, and improve effluent quality and discharge volumes. //////Commonwealth gold medallist shooter Asif Hossain Khan is soul-searching after a poor performance in the South Asian Games' preparation that eventually forced him out of the Asian Air Gun Championship squad. //////Kalabagan Krira Chakra maintained their impressive run in the Premier Division Cricket League when they handed a 175-run defeat to BKSP at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium yesterday. //////The IPL has initiated steps to ensure that all cricketers who have been contracted by its franchises are available to play for the entire season from next year, except those with international commitments.

Thanks to the reporter and The Daily Star for unfurling the story on the poaching, though partial, yet. (The Daily Star: 04.11.09)//////The government has rightly decided to introduce trade union in the garment industry to safeguard the interests of garment workers, especially female workers. Starting in the late 70s, the garment industry has now become the major contributor to foreign exchange earning of the country. It is the most important task of the government to maintain a healthy environment in the industry, so that smooth running of the industry is not hampered. //////Bangladesh is a developing country with a huge potential. But, we are still lagging behind in many aspects. We don't have a sound transportation system yet. Most of the roads and highways need to be modernized and a robust expansion programme should be undertaken to expand those facilities to new areas. Proper transportation infrastructure is a pre-requisite for the mobilization of resources throughout the country and to achieve cost effectiveness. Movement of various industrial commodities, agricultural products as industry input, perishable goods etc. from one place to another quickly, will reduce various uncertainties and market imperfections. If a stress free human mobilization can be ensured among various places, it will reduce extra pressure on urbanization which we are observing in the large cities in our country at the moment. This will only be possible if a properly planned, consolidated transportation infrastructure is ensured. It will be possible by gradually developing the roads and highways, expanding and linking them to various economic centres with a modern fragmentation that will provide the speed that is needed to achieve a higher level of productivity and efficiency for various economic activities.//////Perhaps talking about biodiversity or wildlife protection and conservation is against the present-day politics and those who speak about it are also on the wrong side of politics. The reason is 'CHANGE' - change in politics, change in time (DST), change in office time, change in the season (winter is approaching), change in wind direction and finally the most important 'CLIMATE CHANGE'. Climate change has earned so much fame that for anything good or bad, the admiration or the criticism - IT IS CLIMATE CHANGE.//////The incident that occurred at Nippon Garment Industries Ltd. in Tongi takes us back to the lane of memories. How many times will we passively or reluctantly watch on the TV screen or read the news articles about such horrible incidents? Questions may arise about the desired role of BGMEA regarding the monitoring function of garment industries. It may also seem that either the government is reluctant to tackle such occurrences or its hands are tied. But the victims are always the poorest people who lose their lives. Have we ever thought that these garment workers' hands bring foreign exchange to our national economy? //////On Friday last, in a religious programme of a television channel a madrasa educated Moulana was discussing some religious matters. At one stage, he shifted to the newly formulated education policy and gave a calumnious explanation of secular education. He even professed that the country will face heavenly 'Gazab' if such educational policies are implemented. Other channels also telecast equally motivated views on various topics. Most of such talks are personal/political/debatable views intended to lead or mislead the general people. The authorities, both private and government, may look into the matter. //////I think it is known to many that Cryonics is an organization seeking to provide immortality to its investors. The way the fortunate people are seeking to prevent death contravenes principles of Islam. If Cryonics opens an office here, there won't be any dearth of finance as there are many willing and capable people in Bangladesh.//////The way we are now grabbing the nature is not a good sign. Having seen the news of grabbing the beach, I felt pity for the people as one day they will suffer for this. //////On the night of the 27 October as we were returning from a family dinner through Gulshan Avenue North, our loaded car suddenly flew in the air and fell heavily and before we got over the jolt it happened again. It gave us such a nasty shock. Fortunately, the axle was not broken but the shock absorbers were damaged.//////I have never really understood why there are certain roads in Dhaka that have been designated as "VIP roads". Ministers and other senior government officials supposedly travel by these roads a lot, hence the name. Isn't the concept of having such "VIP" roads in itself rather elitist? I admit, rickshaws do create a lot of chaos on the roads but for a rather significant portion of the country's population, they are the only (affordable) means of transportation for short distances. What, then, is the logic behind banning those vehicles on such roads? If the government and officials that we elect are supposed to ensure that all citizens are treated equally, why are they preventing citizens who can't afford other sources of transportation from travelling on such roads? When the plight of the majority is being ignored, there is something very wrong with the system. //////We got the delectable information that after winning the Oscar the producer of the film `Slumdog Millionaire' Mr. Danny Boyle arranged a trust fund for the poor children performers and their family to secure their future, a beautiful house to live in outside of the stinking slum, to bear expenses for schooling and provided some other facilities. //////Congratulations for introducing the Science and Life page from November 3. This will hopefully increase the general awareness and knowledge of many readers; more so for students who will go through the page.//////I came across a letter from Mr. Sikander Ahmed in The Daily Star's To The Editor Column. His letter was nice reading apart from him being at loggerheads with Mr. Rahat of Malibagh on the rickshaw issue. It appears that he is extremely disappointed at Mr. Rahat for advocating banning of rickshaws in Dhaka main streets. I would like to request Mr. Sikander not to take things personally and try to understand the problem and react accordingly. In an example in one of his earlier letters he had stated that a fasting person would have to walk if there is no rickshaw. Really this cannot be a strong argument. In the old days there were no rickshaw here or elsewhere and not every Muslim had a horse or a camel but that did not stop them from fasting or crossing the desert during the month of fasting. Sure it was tough for them but they adapted and managed. The truth of the matter is that when a facility is not available people learn to adapt. Certainly, we are adapting to spiral price hike, poor law and order situation, intolerable traffic jam, global warming, etc., etc. We can complain about all we want but at the end we have to adapt because things won't change overnight. //////Change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future----- J.F Kennedy.//////The Awami League has started the name game again. When they were in power last time, many institutions' names which had been in use for a long, long time, were changed to the names of their liking in the last few months. They are on it again.//////Two major political parties are increasingly becoming agitated against each other. The simple issue is whether we want "Mujib's Bangladesh " or 'Zia's Bangladesh" Although many political pundits would not like my simplification of the fact of political culture in Bangladesh, like any other event in history , Mujib fell and Zia rose as the ruler of Bangladesh. Both of them have left enough dedicated soldiers to fight their way for political power and rule over Bangladesh. We are simply following the path of the Mughal Empire's history in undivided India. Both the parties have successfully befooled the people through political propaganda. The media is their best projector and supporter.//////Iran vowed to continue enriching uranium despite a wrist slap by the UN nuclear watchdog, as US President Barack Obama warned of "consequences" yesterday if Tehran refused to come clean on its atomic programme.//////World leaders at a United Nations summit have drawn criticism for not signing on to a declaration aimed at eradicating hunger by the year 2025.//////War-torn nations remain the world's most corrupt, Transparency International (TI) has said.//////Seven Papua New Guineans adrift in the Pacific Ocean for more than two months have been rescued but two have since died, the captain of the vessel which picked them up said yesterday.//////China has become one of a handful of nations to own one of the top five supercomputers in the world.//////A landslide in northern China has killed 23 people, all migrant workers at a nearby coal mine or members of their families, state media report.//////California Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped in on US troops in Iraq on Monday, thanking them for the sacrifices they and their families are making.//////The European Union has said proposals by the Palestinians to try to have the UN recognise an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza are "premature".//////News photos of President Barack Obama bowing to Japan's emperor have incensed critics in Washington, who said the US leader should stand tall when representing America overseas.//////A weeks-long standoff by Sri Lankan asylum seekers who have refused to leave an Australian customs ship in Indonesia is set to end after the migrants agreed to disembark, an official said Tuesday.//////Suspected separatists blew up a fuel-laden train in India's restive northeast, causing a giant inferno that took 12 hours to control, police said yesterday.//////Attacks that have continued across Pakistani towns and cities are being blamed on Tehreek e-Taliban, Pakistan's Taliban.

We believe that unless these reserve pile ups are purposefully managed, inflation will be inescapable as the economy begins its full rally to a recovery. //////THE government has finally announced the much-awaited new national pay scale for the public servants considering the need for reasonable pay hike and enhancement of job benefits for them. Of course, a 52% increase, on average, of the basic pay in the seventh national pay scale is certain to maximise satisfaction of the service holders in general. Better late than never. The significance of awarding pay hike to the public employees lies in the fact that job-holders in the middle and fixed income deciles have been badly hit by inflation and depreciation of the national currency.//////THE Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that her government planned to construct elevated and underground railways, flyovers, orbital waterways and circular roads around the capital to ease traffic congestion and solve the transport problem.//////
