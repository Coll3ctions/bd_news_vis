Imagine being subject to humiliation and harassment by your own countrymen. Yes, this is a situation our migrant workers have to face on a daily basis. My heart fills with sadness, and mostly anger, every time I witness how we, as a nation, treat migrant workers with such contempt in our airports. Our workers are made to wait for hours in long immigration queues and repeatedly harassed by airport authorities. We laugh and sneer at them when they ask for help. We look down on the very people we share the same flight with. How many of us are aware of the fact that these are the very same people who are one of the biggest contributors to our national economy?//////World temperature is rising gradually. Bangladesh is considered one of the most vulnerable countries in the face of climate change. To keep the environmental balance, a country should have 25% forest of its total land. 100 years ago, we had 30% forest but due to cutting trees indiscriminately, we have only around 10% forest now!//////A private British space company has announced that it would fly three people to the moon a year.

A person will have to buy a ticket at 100 million to be a tourist of the moon. //////The World Bank's decision to withdraw funding for the Padma Bridge is not as much an indictment of the Awami League government as it is of a system of fool's gold. The same would have happened in a BNP administration. We may have fine sounding organisations like the ACC and the NHRC, but the fact remains that those are little more, in practice, than toothless advisory panels made of tired ex-bureaucrats too scared to say a peep about government ministers and ruling party functionaries of the day. Until the day that an ACC prosecutes a cabinet member of the incumbent political administration or the NHRC hauls into court human rights violators belonging to the affiliated bodies of a ruling party, the only people who will believe these to be credible organisations will be the professional attendees of the numerous seminars in the various posh hotels in Dhaka who have been talking for forty years and will do so for forty more.//////Our poultry sector is now struggling hard for survival. There are various reasons behind this crisis. Lack of proper and effective management, inadequate knowledge, ineffective vaccinations, banning import from India, oil price hikes etc are some of the reasons.

The government should introduce vaccines and other facilities such as poultry insurance, bank loans with lower interest rates, and tax exemption for poultry feed for ensuring smooth operation of the industry.//////With reference to the editorial entitled No 'surprise' from Quadeer, please published in The Daily Star on July 03, 2012, the Honourable Communications Minister admits his mistake for using the word 'surprise.' His explanation goes as below.//////On June 30, 2012 the breaking news in the electronic media that "World Bank cancelling its loan for Padma bridge" came as a shock to us and we felt deeply ashamed. The government is fully responsible for losing the 1.2 billion credit for the Padma bridge project because it did not pay heed to the World Bank's repeated warning that they had proof about corruption in the bidding process, in which high level government officials were involved. The name of the former communications minister Syed Abul Hossain came to the forefront. The government then removed him from his post and gave him another portfolio. The government should have done a thorough investigation about Syed Abul Hossain and others who were involved in the scam and taken proper action against them. But it did not hesitate to degrade the country to save a few people.//////Presently some people in power and some service oriented organisations developed a norm of announcing (without appreciating the real situation) that they would accomplish some goal or fix certain disorder within 48 hours! But in almost all the cases no fruitful results could be seen even after passing of so many 48-hours.//////On 26th June 2012 most of the dailies carried two important news with big headlines. The headlines were: "More than 1.22 lac loan defaulters in the country" and "Government's proposal to hike electricity prices very soon." Let me give an example of one unintentional loan defaulter whose name might have already been included in the 1.22 lac list. A friend of mine, an experienced businessman, established a textile manufacturing unit about a year back with bank loan. He imported sophisticated textile machinery by opening L/C from abroad. The time between L/C opening date and trial production was more than one year because of delay in getting electricity connection, setting up of machinery etc. By the time he completed setting up the machines at the factory, he failed to pay more than six instalments and became a defaulter according to BB rules. His company became disqualified for getting any further support. //////The US-Pakistani relationship remains challenging for both despite the reopening of Pakistani land routes to resupply US troops in Afghanistan, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said yesterday.//////Major donors yesterday pledged to give Afghanistan $16 billion in development aid through 2015 as they try to prevent it from sliding back into chaos when foreign troops leave, but demanded reforms to fight widespread corruption.//////India's External Affairs Minister SM Krishna met his Pakistani counterpart Hina Rabbani Khar yesterday during which he strongly raised the issue of anti-India activities being carried out from the Pakistani soil, maintaining that New Delhi has given additional concrete evidence of the same.//////Vote-counting was under way in Libya yesterday, after the country held its first free national election for 60 years.//////Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has long been lauded for his pivotal role in liberalising the Indian economy, has been dubbed as an underachiever by a top US magazine which says he appears unwilling to stick his neck out on reforms that will put the country back on growth path.//////The government of Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras faced a confidence vote yesterday, capping three days of often heated debate over how the country can emerge from crisis and satisfy EU-IMF lenders.//////Egypt's new President Mohamed Morsi yesterday issued a decree annulling the Supreme Court's dissolution of the Islamist-dominated parliament, the official MENA news agency reported.//////East Timor's Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao is set for a new term of coalition government after his party won parliamentary elections - but without an overall majority.//////Padatik-Bangladesh arranged a programme featuring music and recitation at The Daily Star Centre in Dhaka on July 7.

Zoellick's stand on the Padma bridge loan. That means defunding of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) was not a personal decision of Mr. Zoellick's as it seemed to some in the government. //////Many in the West believe that Russia's support for Syria stems from Moscow's desire to profit from selling arms to Bashar al-Assad's government and maintain its naval facility at the Syrian port of Tartus. But these speculations are superficial and misguided. The real reason that Russia is resisting strong international action against the Assad regime is that it fears the spread of Islamic radicalism and the erosion of its superpower status in a world where Western nations are increasingly undertaking unilateral military interventions.//////
