An award is meant to grant recognition that is merited by a deserving person. But, sometimes, like target practice, it hits a few and misses others. People who get awards don't always deserve.

The party should look into the applications with utmost care and then decide whom to nominate. //////I am unhappy to learn that the Indian High Commission's visa office is going to be shifted to Road 7 of Banani residential area.

There's a saying that goes, "Baro mash-e tero parban" (thirteen festivals in twelve months). And that's fine. We do need festivals, just as our festivals need us. Certain traditions and cultural practices indigenous to Bengal that are, or at some point were, on the verge of extinction certainly need exposure in the form of festivals. But there are times when our affinity towards festivals step outside the boundaries of oft-naive, giddy display of excess and manifest crass, obnoxious impropriety. //////Two ivory tusks, dating back to the 16th century, have been found at the Mong Raja's residence under Manikchhari upazila in the hill district Khagrachhari. //////The entertaining family game show "Ghorey Bairey" will be aired today at 2:40pm on Banglavision.

And just as when the nation was feeling elated, now that an elected government was at last in charge, the mutiny was a rude awakening to the fact that not everything is well in this land of ours.//////IN order to develop a comprehensive decentralisation strategy for Bangladesh, one must first look at the country's ability to fund a reform program that can attain a sustainable outcome. So much money has gone down the drain in the name of decentralisation, Gram Sarkar under Zia (1980) and Khaleda Zia (2003), and Upazila under Ershad (1982), that Bangladesh is not prepared to see it again. //////DID you know the world nearly ended last week?
