After all, South Asia remains poor, and they, collectively, are loaded. According to a 2009 estimate, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and Nepalis living abroad were worth $1 trillion, with another guess the following year suggesting that non-resident Indians own a further $500m-worth of gold, property and art. The hope has long been that the South Asian diaspora might do for the region back home what the overseas Chinese did for China and pour in investment to fuel rapid growth. A first-ever South Asian Diaspora Convention held this week in Singapore had an even more ambitious aim: to use overseas South Asians to foster regional economic integration.//////Get out of the way:

Both print and electronic media are trying to draw the attention of the government to take immediate action against such harmful activities going on in broad daylight. But none of the ministries concerned is taking any effective measure to stop this (except some eyewash). Reports have so far revealed that in most of the cases people of the government parties (both previous and present) are involved with such heinous activities. That is why after the independence we had ministers of AL, BNP and JP, but we did not have a minister of Bangladesh. They helped the corrupt and so-called powerful people but not the common people. //////People of our country are suffering a chronic price rise of the essential commodities. The price of rice has gone up and also we will have shortage of sugar, oil, and other commodities in the coming Ramadan days. The same will happen in the case of vegetables. The government is trying to achieve a name in the global scenario, but in fact it is forgetting its role in the country. They could not control the price hike in the last one year. The government says it will monitor the market during Ramadan, but people's speculation is that this move will fail badly as happened in the past years. At the same time, the bus fare, rickshaw fare- all are increasing very rapidly. How will common people survive?//////Road accidents occur almost every day. The strange thing is that most of the accidents occur due to the carelessness of the drivers. They try to drive the vehicles at their sweet will violating the traffic rules. In most of the cases, the drivers manage to jump out of the vehicles sensing the imminent danger and flee away without thinking of the passengers. //////It was to our Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) that Allah said, //////Three bomb blasts went off within 11 minutes at Zaveri Bazar, Kabutarkhana, and Opera House of Mumbai on 13th July. Mumbai faced another bloody day that killed 21 persons and injured 141 others. It is completely a failure of the intelligence and a huge success of the terrorists. The relation between Mumbai police and the underworld is an open secret now. If the terrorists and criminals work in joint venture, then how could the public live safely? This will affect the relation between India and Pakistan and South Asian political stability will be hampered.//////Nowadays, the most pathetic situation the BCS cadres face is becoming an OSD, which happens with the change of the political regime, as still now neutral civil administration system could not be established due to political interference. Consequently, career of many brilliant officers are being hampered and we noticed that some OSD officers even committed suicide being insulted with this status, though they served the nation for a long time. In fact, political affiliation is the prime cause for this situation because the political govt. always wants to politicize the total administration. According to the experts, impartial and neutral civil administration is indispensable for the continuous development of a country while the label of OSD on the BCS cadres bar the propagation of development. Considering the bright prospect and future of the country, political govt. should stop this harsh step with a view to punishing the civil servants. We, the people of all walks of life, want to see a better Bangladesh through the active participation of all BCS cadres.//////Sir Frank Peters' very frank opinion on the matter published in the pages of some local English dailies on July 16th gave an interesting suggestion, which has escaped most of us. We are forced to bear the uncalled for misery at the whims of political parties unnecessarily!//////After the controversial presidential clemency of ABM Biplob, son of an AL leader, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina openly defended the move saying that the convict was a political victim of BNP-Jamaat coalition. //////It is very saddening that we are still long way off establishing the supremacy of rule of law which is the panacea for our ills. Most students opt for administrative positions in the BCS examination not because they want to serve the country but because those positions will give them all that we wish for as respectable citizens-security, honor and immunity from punishment for corruption and crime. Our society has fetish for pomp and power. The cold war between DCs and SPs is the result of that sentiment created by unbridled undue wielding of power. During the UP election presiding officers had to sit for the double training program -- one led by Dcs and other by SPs. As a presiding officer I had to suffer the heavy-handedness on the part of the policemen that was allotted for me. Policemen's interference in my conduction of election got on my nerve but I bore it patiently thinking that my protest would aggravate the situation; my honor and position would then grovel under the boot. I know a long standing humiliation has taken away my capacity to boldly straddle the world like a horse but I feel emboldened seeing the weak and unconscious raise their heads all around me. Wait, we are coming to correct the wrong! //////A few months back, all of a sudden in a fine morning, DMP prevented all rickshaws plying from Malibag intersection to Segun Bagicha area saying that this was a VIP road. In protest of that order, people instantly brought out a violent procession and vandalized many vehicles. Then DMP authority said, "Actually, police was rehearsing how to ease the traffic congestion." But then again, on July 20, 2011 DMP police repeated the same thing ignoring the sufferings of women, children, aged and ailing people. As a regular office goer I witnessed these sufferings and altercations with traffic police. Moreover, Ramadan is coming; even for a healthy fasting person it is tiresome to return home on foot in summer afternoons. I urge upon the DMP authorities to find out an alternative to mitigate the sufferings of the people of these areas.//////A British judge formally opened an inquiry yesterday into the phone-hacking scandal that has rocked the country, saying the first public hearings will be in September and will focus on media ethics.//////The board of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB met yesterday with the status of chairman James Murdoch on the agenda amid questions over his role in the phone-hacking scandal at his father's empire.//////Libyan rebels seized the town of Al-Ghazaya near the Tunisian border yesterday as part of a pre-Ramadan offensive aimed at unseating strongman Moamer Gaddafi, an AFP correspondent said.//////Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik will not be brought to trial before next year, the country's top prosecutor said yesterday, ruling out the laying of formal charges until at least January.//////Visiting Pakistan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar yesterday paid obeisance at the dargah of famous Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya here and prayed for peace between the two countries.//////Nafissatou Diallo, who accuses French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her when she went to clean his hotel room, said yesterday she is traumatised.//////Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday called on the army and ethnic insurgents to end a decades-long civil conflict in her first direct letter to the country's new president.//////A suicide bomber yesterday struck an Iraqi bank in Saddam Hussein's hometown where policemen were picking up their paychecks, killing 12 and wounding 30 people, officials said.//////Heavy fighting broke out yesterday in the Somali capital Mogadishu as government forces backed by African Union troops launched an assault on an insurgent stronghold, officials and witnesses said.//////Serious flaws in a signalling system caused a fatal collision on China's high-speed rail network, officials say.//////Libya's rebel National Transitional Council has nominated Mahmud Nacua as its ambassador to London, a council official said yesterday after Britain recognised the group as the country's sole government.//////Taliban bomb and gun attacks on an official's compound and a militia base in the southern Afghan province of Uruzgan killed 21 people yesterday, including a local BBC reporter.//////South Sudan became the 54th member of the African Union (AU) after it received a majority vote from member states, including one from Sudan, the Pan-African bloc said yesterday.//////August 1 marks the 40th anniversary of a pair of historic benefit concerts that the late George Harrison staged with a little help from some very famous friends.//////Hanif Sanket's popular show Ityadi is reputed for being shot at sites of immense cultural, traditional, mythical and historical significance.

A forgiving man has forgiven now because he has also forgiven before. A lot of people may be upset with him, but I think I understand the man. He has seen too much death in his life.

Then, of course, ageing has its daily dalliance with death. //////The military relationship between the United States and China is one of the world's most important. And yet, clouded by some misunderstanding and suspicion, it remains among the most challenging. There are issues on which we disagree and are tempted to confront each other. But there are crucial areas where our interests coincide, on which we must work together. //////The greatest denial that citizens are having to suffer is that of purposeful, pro-people, intelligent and farsighted political leadership.
