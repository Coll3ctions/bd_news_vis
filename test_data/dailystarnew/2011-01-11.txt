Congruent with other developed and developing countries in the world, measuring up to the increasing energy needs are central not only to our future economic growth but also to the socio-political stability. Within the framing narrative of depleting resources, including coal and natural gas, sustainable development in Bangladesh is contingent upon our ability to tap into alternative and renewable resources ranging from wind and solar power to biomass, fuel cell technologies and nuclear power before the rhetoric of action fizzles out and turns out to be too little too late. Although any quick fix for this holy grail is nowhere in the offing, Cost-Benefit (CB) as well as Political, Economic, Socio-Cultural and Technological (PEST) analyses should be our effective tools to set the short and long term strategies in order to achieve the target of 14,000 megawatt by 2020.

Zero watts is actually not zero, but refers to the minimum wattage. The inaccurate electric meters of the early days could not measure such a negligible amount of consumption as during those days, the watt hour meter had a rotating disc and when all the other lights were switched off, the disc would have only minimum rotation, which would not record even a 10W consumption. This led to the origin of the term 'zero-watt', though it is incorrect. Nowadays, electric meters can record even electricity used as indicators in switches.//////
