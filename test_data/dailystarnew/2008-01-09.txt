With six months remaining for all the field work to be wrapped up, it all appears feasible on the part of the Election Commission to move ahead with the scheduled general elections later this year. By June this year, therefore, the nation can look forward to a full-fledged enrolment of voters, a fact that cannot but please everyone.

We will do all we can not to remember the bizarre moment when the entrepreneur-adviser told us that the government had really nothing to do about prices, that indeed it was all a fait accompli no one could roll back. But forgiveness? That is an entirely different proposition altogether. //////National elections are again scheduled for February 18. How will 40 years old PPP fare in them? Many think that love and admiration for Benazir Bhutto have been heightened by her tragic death. This may have strengthened the Bhutto mystique.

Some others are less sanguine.//////When we gained our independence over 36 years ago I was overjoyed.

If Cricket Australia cares a fig for the tattered reputation of our national team in our national sport, it will not for a moment longer tolerate the sort of arrogant and abrasive conduct seen from the captain and his senior players over the past few days. Beyond comparison it was the ugliest performance put up by an Australian side for 20 years. The only surprising part of it is that the Indians have not packed their bags and gone home. There is no justice for them in this country, nor any manners.//////The Indian cricketers, especially the seniors, are said to be deeply dissatisfied with the manner in which Mike Procter handled the ICC hearing and with the official document on it that followed.

remarkable and an eventful one for all of us. We have seen the fall of many corrupt politicians who literally destroyed the very institutions they represented. Even though it's hard to believe for the common people that these politicians are now languishing in jail for their misdeeds, nevertheless deep from our hearts, we always prayed for something like this to happen. Kudos to this caretaker government for taking this bold initiative & thus giving us something to cheer about! Our patriotic armed forces once again played an effective role in safeguarding our democracy and so we were able to avoid a civil war like situation. They were able to stop the anarchy which plagued our economy and day to day life.//////Recently, the cyclone Sidr ravaged our country, especially the south-western region with heavy loss of lives --more than three thousand. Obviously, we were introduced with the natural calamities such as flood, tidal surge, cyclone, drought etc from time immemorial. Many dreadful and devastating tidal bulges hit this delta with great force and caused a lot of suffering to the people, particularly the poor coastal community. We have to take preparatory measurers, both short and long term, to diminish the loss. The destruction was minimised due to the presence of the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. //////An easy, fast & affordable transport system is vital for present day life in Bangladesh. Indeed, despite thirty-six years of independence, we miserably failed to attain the goal even in the capital city, Dhaka. We observed with pleasure that a few hundred buses were introduced in the last couple of years to transport commuters within Dhaka city areas. Hundreds of buses have also been introduced from Dhaka city to adjoining districts to establish links between Dhaka-Narayanganj, Dhaka-Narshingdi, Dhaka-Munshiganj, Dhaka-Savar, Dhaka-Manikganj, Dhaka-Mawa, Dhaka-Gazipur and so on. Significant numbers of commuters have been enjoying this transport facility every day. Even then, most of the city dwellers cannot go to their every desired destination within the city by existing bus routes. The minority rich who have their own cars or cars from their employers can move to their desired destinations. But majority of the inhabitants face enormous problems in moving from one place to another because the main roads in the city do not allow fossil fuel free rickshaw plying. And the number of auto-rickshaws plying in the city is very insignificant compared to the number of commuters. Taxi-cabs are hardly seen in the road at the time of need.//////Barack Obama , shocked everyone with his victory in the Iowa caucuses. And people were further shocked to see Hilary Clinton standing third. But then again John Edwards, despite securing second spot (due to votes from middle-aged , blue collar supporters) is unlikely to provide much competition in New Hampshire on Tuesday and the race is likely to be between Obama and Hilary. Obama has won because this time around a lot of young voters came to vote ( twice the number who came in 2004) and four in every ten first-time voters voted for Obama. In addition, the independent voters along with a small band of Republicans also voted for him. In other words this victory also reflects that people in Iowa wanted "change" and that Obama's theory of "hope" inspired the young voters.//////Much to my grief, I write through your daily to let the people of Bangladesh know that my fight or the freedom of Bangladesh was in vain.//////Foreign remittance is increasing day by day. It is one of the major sources of our foreign currency earning. It's playing a vital role in our economy as well as GDP growth. As a key resource of our economy, banks as well as our central bank should take care of the customer service needed by those sending money from abroad. It is very poor at present. //////It is unfortunate that the BNP has fallen into the trap set by an internal feud.//////The growing public demand from all quarters for trial of war criminals in Bangladesh has finally yielded some positive results. The present government has decided to enact some laws which would prohibit the razakars or war criminals from contesting the national elections. One of the Election Commissioners conveyed this good news in his recent press briefing. He further said that the EC's new law would bar the razakars who were proven to be so.//////It was a vivacious conference organised by Scholar Bangla and attended by 1000 expatriate Bangladeshis being called by the CA with a view to helping the country to become a middle-income state by 2021 with their long term contributions. From State Senator to scientist, many prominent NRBs participated in the conference and exchanged views with locals over specific issues like education, health, infrastructure, energy, etc in light of their expertise. //////The disgraced politicians of the country are once again clamouring for lifting of emergency imposed earlier to save the country from destruction. The intention of the politicians is obvious which is to draw the country back to 1/11 situation and thereafter to fish in the troubled water. We have seen the activities of these politicians in the last thirty seven years and therefore are fully aware of their sinister motives. At present the process of holding an impartial election is on and nothing should be done which may encourage the interested quarters to disrupt the process. The government has time and again announced that emergency would be lifted at opportune moment to pave the way for holding the election scheduled to be held by the later part of 2008. There is no reason whatsoever to doubt the intention of the government for timely holding of the election announced earlier.//////Since September 11, 2001, the world seems to be a chaotic place to live in. A particular group of the enemies of Islam is trying to destroy the true image of this great religion and establish their so-called freedom to people system of society. According to these extremists, their freedom to people system of society is such where women will be kept at home doing only house-hold chores, where there will be no education for women, where education regarding science and technology will be considered as Satan's work, where committing suicide will be the only way to eliminate their rivals, where torturing, beheading and killing those who resist their freedom will be a daily activity. //////Advisers to the present government, especially Law and Information Advisor Barrister Mainul Hosen, very often warn that they would not let the country go back to the situation that existed before 11 January 2007. I think none of the conscious people would disagree with them in principle.//////In the NRB conference 2007 the President of US-Bangladesh Advisory Council Sabbir Ahmed said, At present there are 400,000 vacant posts for nurses in the US, and Bangladesh can export skilled human resources against those posts. I could not agree more. I believe that management and entrepreneurs in that sector should pay serious attention to this matter.//////The European Union on Monday called on the Sri Lankan government to offer "substantive devolution" to Tamil rebels as fierce fighting, renewed since Colombo scrapped a ceasefire, claimed more victims. //////US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned Tehran in an interview published yesterday that it should cease its "provocations" after Iranian vessels confronted US warships in the Gulf. //////Democrat Barack Obama was poised to deal a second crushing blow to Hillary Clinton's White House hopes Tuesday and boost his quest to become the first black US president as New Hampshire voted in key presidential primaries. //////Pakistan must do more to ensure "credible" elections next month, including freeing all political detainees and lifting remaining media curbs, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Monday. //////The wife of Thailand's ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra returned yesterday to defend herself in court against charges of corruption, as her husband insisted on their innocence. //////Israeli and Palestinian leaders were meeting yesterday to try to revitalise their hobbled peace negotiations on the eve of US President George W Bush's regional tour. //////Sri Lanka's Supreme Court slapped restrictions on search and arrests by security forces on Monday amid mounting international concern over the country's human rights record. //////Opposition leader Raila Odinga said yesterday he was prepared to meet President Mwai Kibaki to resolve Kenya's political deadlock but only if the African Union chief acted as mediator. //////Benazir Bhutto's husband has attacked Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf for saying the opposition leader was to blame for her own assassination by poking her head out of her car sunroof. //////It will take 50 years or more for Southeast Asian nations to more closely resemble the European Union including the easing of border controls, according to Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew. //////A powerful tribal chief yesterday warned Al-Qaeda-linked militants to leave a Pakistani border district after the death of eight members of his clan supporting peace efforts in the troubled region. //////A young man admitted in court here yesterday planning to travel to Pakistan to carry out unspecified acts of terorrism, aiming to "kill many." //////French President Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday said his romance with Carla Bruni was "serious" and hinted that he was ready to marry the Italian former supermodel. //////Arab League chief Amr Moussa arrives in Beirut today on a delicate mission to try to push Lebanon's rival political leaders to accept a plan aimed at ending the country's constitutional crisis. //////World University of Bangladesh (WUB) recently organised a talk on 'Assisting Bangladeshi students in their pursuit of higher education in the USA' by Dr M Masoom Ali, George and Frances Ball Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Ballstate University, USA. //////At least eight people froze to death in the heaviest snowfalls to have hit Iran in years, with several areas brought to a virtual standstill and 20 towns suffering cuts in gas supplies, officials said yesterday. //////At least 19 people have been killed and hundreds more are stranded or missing after heavy snowfalls hit Afghanistan, an official said yesterday. //////Greenpeace yesterday called on the Indian government to set mandatory fuel efficiency standards for cars, warning vehicle emissions will contribute significantly to climate change. //////Calling for urgent reform of the United Nations, President Nicolas Sarkozy pledged yesterday to help Brazil, Germany, India, Japan and a major African country join the UN Security Council as permanent members. //////The group of over-fifties artists, which includes Nasreen Begum, Jamal Ahmed, Kuhu and others, are having their vibrant display of paintings, sculpture pieces and prints with a gusto. Many of them are now absorbed in commercial art out of compulsion to make a living which free-lancing does not always permit. But they have all been working on fine arts, off and on, and after decades they got together like some merry reunion calling themselves 10+2 souls in the current exhibition at Shilpangan.//////Eden Girls College arranged a Pitha festival yesterday at its premises.

And in reality, too, the trend has its own history tracing back more than half a century. Bangladeshis have been venturing around the world since the 1950s, when the first group of expatriate Bengalis settled in England and gradually expanded their own world by taking their family members and close relatives. //////The year 2008 brings no good news for the people of Bangladesh. On the very first day of the year, the price of rice went up by Taka 5 a kilo. The prediction is that, rice, now selling at Taka 32-40 a kilo (up by 67 percent in the last one year), is going to be even costlier in the days ahead because of sharp decline in production of rice at home and abroad and increase of price in the international market.//////In the press conference at which the 19-year-old son of Benazir Bhutto was crowned co-head of the Pakistan Peoples Party, one note was striking. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's brief comments began with a pledge to "stand as a symbol of federation." His words were carefully chosen. Pakistan's deepest cleavage is not between religious extremism and liberalism, nor even dictatorship and democracy. It is between the country's various regions. And in this regard, Pakistan is part of a growing phenomenon -- the persistence and growing strength of sub-national groups. With the end of the battle of ideologies --communism, socialism, liberalism -- human beings' oldest identities have moved to the core of politics. It is why people vote and what they will die for.//////My grandson's paternal ancestors came//////From the biggest sub-district in Bangladesh.//////My grandson is born in the biggest state of the U.S.A.//////Before he is one year and six months old//////He plays lasso-lasso with a rope, thread or an wire//////And dons a tilted sombrero on his head.//////When my grandson was born//////We wanted to put a drop of honey in its mouth//////But the American doctor//////Said: "No. Not within one year.//////We said: "In our country we pour a drop of honey//////In the mouth of the newborn baby//////Hoping that it to be a sweet-tongued baby.//////The doctor said in a supercilious manner://////"Why then you Bangladeshis do not bother//////To be a little kinder to each other.//////Alas!
