The purpose of hartal should be to ensure people's interest through its proper and peaceful use. Calling hartal without any logical reason is undemocratic and unacceptable. In our country hartal is called not for the betterment of the people, rather it is used by the politicians to gain personal benefits. The government should perform its duty well so that the opposition parties fail to call any hartal on any illogical ground. We expect that our government would refrain from dealing with questionable national issues and think about the consequences of their action. The opposition parties should also avoid anarchy and vandalism in the name of observing hartal. The government and the opposition should work hand in hand to restore true democracy in our country.//////Bangladesh is now sitting on a population bomb! It is a time bomb which may explode anytime! Signs are conspicuous. A gigantic population of 160 million is jam-packed in a very small area with a population density of nearly 1200 per sq km. The consequence is disastrous. Half of the population is starving. Cultivable land is dwindling. Prices of essentials are soaring up. Supply is always falling short of demand. Ever-growing hungry population has been eating up all our development efforts! Nearly a quarter of the population is living in the slums. An endless flow of rural people is overcrowding the towns and cities for food. Law and order is breaking down. //////In recent times, a series of mass protests are gripping notably UK, Spain, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Israel, India and numerous other countries around the world.//////It has been observed that most of the trucks and buses plying Dhaka streets, highways and other towns of Bangladesh use hydraulic horns constantly.

Even the Americans get worried and frustrated when they visit currency exchange dealers in Japan, Australia, Singapore and Thailand, because they receive fewer notes in exchange for their renowned currency. But why is this currency becoming weaker? Is it not possible to check inflation in the United States, the most powerful country in the world?//////The fuel price is increasing day by day. And we have to buy every commodity at a high price as the price of every item is related to the price of fuel.

The roads and highways are attractive, in a negative way, to some of the political masters. The IWT sector (in this deltaic region) has not achieved the priority it deserves. Our ports are being expanded too slowly (now that the transit issue is 'on').//////How helpless we are before the hidden and sudden disasters-- both natural and man-made! A bolt of thunder shakes our hearts, a disease suddenly takes away our ease and ultimately drags us to the dark grave, the wall of water powered by quake plays with our lives and dwellings as if we are toys at the hands of nature. The molten lava put a hard layer of death over the lavish lives of Pompeii, then in our time fire lapped up the lives of 3 thousand people at the twin tower, and the resultant violence engulfed millions of lives and properties worth trillions of dollars. Caught unaware, people are dying on land, water and air. Sudden deaths give them no time to repent. But what is most surprising to me is that life goes on. Here it may seem the sun is setting but there it is rising. The zeal for life is indomitable. It seems nothing can tear us from its amorous grip. A short while ago, we were running for life and uttering the name of the Creator but now we are again in the lap of seductive world. Again we indulge in age-old rivalries and political wrangling. Have we no time to ponder our ephemeral pomp and power? Cannot we sit together and hammer our differences out to build a peaceful and prosperous society? It is high time we responded to our conscience and come clean before the cataclysm overpowers us. //////We are shocked at the outcome of the long awaited visit of Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh to Dhaka. Isn't it strange and funny that instead of signing Teesta water sharing treaty, which is a matter of life and death for millions of Bangladeshi people, a MoU on conservation of Royal Bengal Tigers has been signed? The political leaders and bureaucrats of both India and Bangladesh need to improve their efficiency, morality, vision and sincerity.
