It is evident from the nomenclature of numerous institutions, roads etc. which were named after the British queens or governor-generals. The pronunciation of Bangla words by the British tormented us during the colonial rule. It is a matter of regret that we still pronounce Bangla words erroneously and impudently like the British. We still write the word "Bangla" in a weird spelling, 'Bengali'. Although it was quite late, our parliament, by the eighth amendment of the constitution in 1988, amended and recognised the spelling of "Bangla" in a deserved manner. Yet many Bangladeshi writers and even some government offices make the mistake of writing "Bangla" as "Bengali". We should enhance the dignity of our beloved Bangla language by spelling it as "Bangla," not "Bengali". //////Our country is facing so many problems but instead of improving the condition which is clearly worsening every day (disappearance of people, communication hassle, deteriorating law and order, to name a few) the government is busy with unimportant issues. None of the banks gave loan to the poor people before Dr. Yunus. Dr. Yunus saved the poor people from the so-called "Mohajon", who used to take 150 to 200% interest. Interest rate of many microcredit providers including some government organisations is significantly higher than that of Grameen Bank. The money taken as interest is being used to make Grameen Bank sustainable so that it can continue to help the helpless. Moreover, Grameen Bank is giving loan to the poor students with which many students are studying. It is also providing interest-free loan to thousands of beggars. People all over the world are getting benefit from microcredit introduced Grameen Bank. If Grameen Bank had not brought any benefit to the people, it would have failed long time ago. All the corruption cases against the politicians of the government party have been dismissed without any proper investigation whereas Dr. Yunus welcomed investigation of corruption charges against him. Subsequently he was proved innocent. But now the government has taken a vow to malign Professor Yunus. The government is planning to take over the Grameen Bank and make it a state enterprise. The result will be that the AL politicians' own people will be appointed in key positions and the profit coming from it will be shared by them. I foresee that this is going to happen to Grameen Bank. It will be a business enterprise of AL politicians and this will be done before the next election. In this way, by endangering the livelihood of 8.4 million poor women, this government is going to be the worst enemy of the poor in the history of Bangladesh.//////June 5 is World Environment Day. In Bangladesh it was observed as we are very expert in observing days on many issues. Seminars, rallies, talk shows were held, the Ministry of Environment and Forest and the Department of Environment organised programmes: holding colourful banners and umbrellas and wearing caps, the participants took out processions. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, President Zillur Rahman gave messages on the occasion. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina planted a sapling and asked everyone to do so, saying that trees are very important to living a healthy life and it plays an important role to combat climate change. //////Few readers may have gone through the AFP news release, published on 1st.June by a local English daily. It is a significant event initiating the breakthrough for the up and coming fuel-less aircraft that will crisscross our skies in the future! It will herald the solar-powered airlines of tomorrow!//////Finance minister encouraged the black money owners to invest in the national economy like in the past. It has become a culture of our country. Doesn't it mean: "Earn black money and take the chance of whitening it?" Thus the fields of corruption will be fertile in the coming days and our country will turn into a black hole.//////The headline of The Daily Star of 21 May was about the involvement of Tarique in August 21 grenade attack. It is really shocking to see that the leaders of one party are trying to eliminate the leaders of another major political party of the country only to have absolute authority in politics. BNP was in power for several terms and their track records don't show anything much good. None of the governments is absolutely successful in promoting the interest of the country and keep pace with the rest of the world to make the life of the people better. But it can in no way be accepted that a party should be trying to eliminate another. But unfortunately, there were several attacks on Sheikh Hasina in different places of the country including the big attempt in Kotalipara and Bangabandhu Avenue. If Tarique's involvement is proved in this case, he should be brought to justice so that no politician in the future dares to attack his opponent. Many politicians have been killed and many have been abducted since the independence of our beloved motherland. If the big leaders are not safe in this country, where will we common people go?//////Merchant banks play a vital role in maintaining and restoring the stability of the stock market. Especially in a stock market like ours, their transparent and accountable participation is expected. Their designated duties include issue management, underwriting and signing due diligence certificates keeping to moral principles. Recently, they have allegedly been deviating from their key duties. Violation of rules by them would cast a negative impact on the capital market. Merchant banks should come up with research-based services for the clients so that the stability is restored. They have an important role in increasing the investors' participation through Initial Public Offering (IPO). //////A few days ago I travelled from Chittagong to Dhaka by train. On the way, to my horror, I found that sand/earth being extracted from a canal using extractor, and the place of extraction is extremely near to the pillars of the railway bridge over the canal. The bridge is the one next to the Gomoti bridge towards Dhaka. The extracted sand/earth is being used for earth filling in the existing railway line to lay a new track. Extracting sand/earth from so near to the railway bridge will put that bridge in danger of collapsing. I would like to draw the attention of the authorities to this matter. //////Instead of doing what Barrister Nazmul Huda has done, he could perhaps play the role of an icebreaker for resolving the present political crisis.

The talk encompassed the art and politics of South Asia in the mid-twentieth century, covering mainly the late-colonial and early-post-colonial decades of the 1920s-1950s. Reviewing both iconic painters like Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose and Jamini Roy, and the less celebrated ones, like Communist Party artists from this period, such as Chittaprosad and Somnath Hore, the talk sought to draw out the various dimensions of the 'political' that could be identified in art practice from this period. The talk focused on some of the ways in which political imagery was created, projected and circulated. On the aesthetics and politics of nationalist and socialist iconography from these decades, the talk dwelt on modes of reading twentieth century modernism in South Asia, keeping in mind current debates around 'non-western' modernisms or 'alternative geographies' of modernism. //////After an eight-year hiatus, Sajed Fatemi has released his second solo album, Ferari Jonaki under the banner of Laser Vision.

It is not only that owners of the undisclosed money (euphemism for ill-gotten money whether received through legal or illegal transactions) shall enjoy all the impunity, while the noose will be further tightened around the honest taxpayers' necks, by way of raising the payable amount of minimum tax from Tk.2,000 to Tk.3,000 without at the same time increasing the threshold of the taxable income of individuals from the previous ceiling at Tk.1.8 lakh. From the next FY, they will also have to pay tax even for talking on their mobile phones. //////With each passing day, the noose around the neck of the euro zone grows tighter, with no indication that European leaders share any coherent vision for avoiding the hangman.//////
