Benazir wanted to bridge the Muslim world with the West. That was her greatest dream. Can her wish become a reality? The answer is 'yes'. Days before her death, the first woman prime minister of a Muslim country, finalised the manuscript of her new book Reconciliation: Islam, Democracy and the West.//////Detained Awami League (AL) General Secretary Abdul Jalil was shown arrested yesterday in connection with a case filed for amassing illegal wealth and giving false assets statement to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).//////The Election Commission (EC) sees state of emergency as a "barrier" to holding election as its Commissioner Sohul Hussain yesterday said it is not possible to hold the polls keeping the emergency in force.//////The Indian customs authorities yesterday started to allow consignments of rice export to Bangladesh at previous rate of $ 425 per ton saying that the old rate would be applicable only to the Letters of Credit (LC) opened before December 27.//////Five pirates were killed and two others injured in a gunfight between Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and the pirates in the Sundarbans in Shyamnagar upazila of the district yesterday. //////Law and Information Adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein yesterday said the state of emergency persists as the caretaker government wants to establish rule of law and safeguard the nation from political anarchy.//////After scrutinising all the documents and evidence, counsels of detained former premier Sheikh Hasina yesterday told court that they would come up with a petition on Sunday seeking her discharge from the Tk 3 crore extortion case against her, and the court fixed the day for hearing. //////"Negligence" of the hospital authorities led to the death of 47-day-old baby Afia at Labaid Specialised Hospital on December 27, alleged the child's parents yesterday.//////Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) Maj Shamsul Haider Siddique yesterday said there is no way to send detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina abroad for treatment under the jail code but they would form a medical board for her with specialists.//////As cracks developed in a four-storey building at the city's Ganaktuli sweeper colony, all the 40 families residing in the building vacated it last night. //////Awami League (AL) yesterday reiterated its call to the caretaker government to hold dialogues with the political parties to find a solution to the prevailing political deadlock in the country.//////Two more prosecution witnesses gave their statements yesterday in one of the two cases filed against four Dhaka University teachers and 15 students for allegedly breaking the emergency power rules in August last year.//////A Dhaka court yesterday placed detained Abbas Ali and Mohammad Nasir, alleged ringleaders of a smuggling gang of Zia International Airport, on a three-day remand in the case filed in connection with the theft of two Vishnu statuettes.//////The Ministry of Information has undertaken a fortnight-long programme to mark the completion of one year of the current caretaker government through its different departments and agencies, officials said yesterday.//////Pakistan and India yesterday exchanged lists of their nuclear sites under an agreement between the South Asian rivals to swap such information annually on New Year's Day, the foreign ministry said. //////Prices of all varieties of rice have soared taking up a huge portion of consumer budget with its diminishing purchasing power, as it is. Of particular ordeal is the price of coarse rice consumed by lower income groups forming a vast majority of the people. The low quality rice is selling at Tk 32 per kg and likely to rise to Tk 35 per kg.//////Bhutan has lately been making history. When its people went to the polls the other day to elect a national council, it was a sign of how meaningfully the kingdom means to align itself with the rest of the world and carve a new niche for itself in the global community. Indeed, it is to the credit of the former king, Jigme Singye Wangchuk, that Bhutan's people find themselves on the threshold of a new era. Without any prompting and absolutely on his own, he sent out the message that Bhutan needed to change. And change was to come through people being given the right to vote for their representatives in the national council as well as the national assembly. Moreover, by abdicating in favour of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk, the king established a rare precedent of a monarch voluntarily walking away from power and glory.//////Political dynasties make a mockery of democracy. And they do that through keeping power, or the possibility of arriving at it, limited to a self-chosen few. You might now want to explore the issue a little deeper. You can do that easily through observing the way matters have lately been shaping up in Pakistan. A nineteen year old young man has just been imposed on the Pakistan People's Party as its new chairman. His father, notorious for all the charges of corruption levelled against him not only in Pakistan but in Switzerland as well, will be the party's co-chairman for as long as the son does not finish his education at Oxford and return home to take charge of the organisation. It all reminds you of the old days when monarchies were the rule rather than the exception, when kings too young to exercise authority were guided by regents until they reached the first rung of adulthood. So what we now have in Pakistan, following the tragic end of Benazir Bhutto, is a very young king named Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who will for quite some years be in the shadow of a regent called Asif Ali Zardari. //////It appears Benazir Bhutto fell to an assassin's bullets and/or the bomb blast meant for her. Passing away of a charismatic leader is always tragic, and an unwelcome surprise. It always leaves behind a trail of bitterness. Even so, this was exceptionally so. What the country has to grapple with is its consequences, that may become trends. //////If you want to understand Pakistan today, try and imagine this scenario in India. It is 1984, Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale escapes during Operation Bluestar and disappears into an inaccessible range of the Himachal Himalayas. The Indian armed forces cannot find him; although Delhi will never admit it, Bluestar is a failure. The militants, operating under the command of General Shabeg, regroup, their loyalty to the ideological leadership of Bhindranwale reinforced by success in battle. Anger against Bluestar arouses the Sikh peasantry to the kind of fury and passion it displayed during Banda Bahadur's war against the Mughals. The young take up militancy in self-generating numbers, making casualties irrelevant to the insurgency. Bhindranwale remains in regular touch with the insurgents, who now have safe sanctuary in certain gurudwaras, since the Indian government is hesitant to invade sacred space after the counter-productive calamity of Bluestar.//////For the past one year Javed Omar Belim made the headlines for somehow convincing the selectors that he still fits in the one-day side of the Tigers albeit the general sentiment was that his style rather suited the longer version of the game most.//////Sydney, by all accounts a city bubbling with life, has recently been associated with the dead Test. Visiting teams usually come here for the final Test, with the series gone. Don Bradman has a stand named after him in the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), as do other legends like Bill O'Reilly and Monty Noble, but there is reason enough to build a new one named Pride. Normally that's the only thing left to play for once the teams land here.//////Without putting too fine a point on it, West Indies' 128-run victory in Port Elizabeth was one of the major surprises of 2007. They hadn't won a Test for 19 months and, more significantly, had beaten major opposition away from home only once since the turn of the millennium. Now the question is whether they can continue to turn the tables on South Africa in the New Year Test in Cape Town and complete a series triumph no one really thought was possible.//////Bangladesh under-19 cricketers made a bright start in the triangular one-day series when they handed a two-wicket defeat to their South African counterparts at the Sinovich Park in Pretoria yesterday.//////An emergency general meeting will be called soon to solve the current crisis in the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF).//////The Protiti Pharmaceutical Club Cup Football Tournament has been deferred by another week due to the ongoing renovation work of the turf of the Bangabandhu National Stadium.//////Wasim Jaffer, whose technique has been found wanting in Australian conditions, needs to sit out in the Sydney Test.//////Ricky Ponting believes he can overcome the persistent threat of Harbhajan Singh despite falling early to the off-spinner in the second innings in Melbourne.

I shivered when I found the breaking news of her death in The Daily Star's website early in the evening of Thursday. Like hundreds more in her country, she too fell victim to an unkind bomber.

Terrorism has engulfed Pakistan like a cancer and in the end Bhutto had to pay with her life for keeping Pakistani democracy up. //////Having come back from Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world, I have been able to understand that we, unscrupulous and unwise guys, need not worry about this world heritage, rather it would come back to normal stage if we do not do any serious damage.

This issue needs mass awareness and campaign to make Internet a commodity for the public and businesses in Bangladesh. Internet is the most important component of this highly interconnected world. It is like blessings from the Almighty to countries like us, which can catalyze our developments and export growth in this global knowledge economy. As the BASIS President aptly put High Internet Pricing is seriously holding back our ICT exports growth in Bangladesh. //////This is the first time that we found someone in power in Bangladesh taking responsibility for something they were directly or indirectly accountable for. //////At the moment 55% of the government jobs are reserved on quota which is very inconvenient for the general students. After working so hard, they finish their education to get a job. As the government jobs are more reliable, every student tries his best to get one. But a lot of them fail to get it because of the 55% quota system. On the other hand, the government is also losing the service of the best students. Moreover, some quarters are resorting to corruption by manipulating the quota system. //////I am writing with reference Post Breakfast article: "Will the EU ever have a common foreign policy?" by Muhammad Zamir (Dec. 20).//////I have read an article on Bali conference.

My name is Dipterocarpus  reads a sign attached to a sapling, one of many such signs installed by the Institute of Forestry at Chittagong University (IFCU) as part of local tree familiarisation initiative under a United Nations FAO project during 1986-1990. Sure enough, crowds gathered around the trees and saplings adorned with newly installed rectangular name tags, beaming with curiosity, or at times bursting into unrelenting giggles and laughter. The project was a success opined Dr. Zabella, a visiting FAO professor that targeted non-forestry community to familiarize tree species on campus.//////Our main transports are vehicles like bus, rickshaw, cab etc. Though some metropolitan areas have recently been cleared of rickshaw to avoid traffic jam, but still there are a large number of rickshaws in the streets.//////It has become a common sight in our roads --people driving with one hand in the steering of the car and the other one holding a mobile phone which is without any doubt a dangerous thing to do while you are driving, especially in the busy roads of Dhaka. It has become a trend these days to drive your car while using mobile phones.//////The truism history repeats itself applies to those who ignore the lessons of the past and insist on forging ahead, committing the same mistakes, and experiencing the same results. It is hoped that city authorities will learn from the mistakes of the Mirpur Road demonstration project and try to assign due importance to fuel-free transport. Given the small modal share of automobiles and the many problems they cause, there should be no provision for creating more auto-only roads within urban areas, and all existing auto-only roads should be converted into mixed-use roads by properly integrating public transit, FFT and fuel-dependent transport (FDT). If the Mirpur Road project is indeed a demonstrationin a sense an experimentthen clearly the lessons should be carefully learned before proceeding with transport planning. In this case, the lessons are startlingly clear, and point in a very different direction from that of current transport planning in Dhaka.//////An outspoken ethnic Tamil opposition MP was shot dead during a New Year service at a Hindu temple in the Sri Lankan capital yesterday, the third assassination of a minority legislator in two years. //////EU monitors cast doubts Tuesday on the results of Kenya's disputed presidential vote, stepping up the pressure on re-elected President Mwai Kibaki as his country reels from violence that has claimed nearly 260 lives. //////Benazir Bhutto was slain just hours before she was to go public with "proof" that Pakistani intelligence and electoral officials were planning to rig polls, an official from her party said Tuesday. //////The United States provided a steady stream of intelligence to Benazir Bhutto about threats against her before the former Pakistani prime minister was assassinated and advised her aides on how to boost security, although key suggestions appear to have gone unheeded, US officials said Monday. //////Two assailants with guns and grenades ambushed a police recruitment centre in northern India early yesterday in an attack that killed seven police officers and a civilian, a police official said. //////A US diplomat died yesterday after a pre-dawn shooting attack in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, which also killed an embassy driver, officials said. //////Congress president Sonia Gandhi has been admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital following an attack of asthma, where her condition is stated to be stable, a very informed source said. //////Japan's population fell by 16,000 in 2007, a government survey said yesterday, renewing fears of a demographic crisis with a smaller working population forced to support a mass of pensioners. //////Japan took over the presidency of the Group of Eight club of the world's leading economies yesterday, with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda vowing to put a focus on climate change and environmental issues. //////Militants abducted four Pakistani paramilitary soldiers in a tribal area yesterday in the first such incident since the death of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, officials said. //////At least 16 Taliban rebels including a suspected would-be suicide bomber were killed in US-led and Afghan operations across insurgency-plagued Afghanistan, officials said yesterday. //////Foreign journalists are facing official interference while reporting in China, despite Olympic-related rules aimed at allowing greater press freedoms, an international media group said yesterday. //////Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda yesterday renewed his pledge to resume a naval mission supporting the US-led "war on terror." //////Iran hanged two convicted drug traffickers in the southeastern city of Zahedan, a newspaper reported yesterday, bringing the number of executions for 2007 to at least 297. //////North Korea vowed yesterday in a New Year policy message to strengthen its military and its economy in 2008 but made no mention of its failure to meet a year-end denuclearisation deadline. //////The slump in 'Dhaliwood', the Dhaka-based mainstream film industry, seems to have improved in the year 2007. //////Life has had its pitfalls and Himalayan peaks for Rukhsana Hasib, now an expatriate entrepreneur in the US.
