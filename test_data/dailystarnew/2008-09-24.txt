ahead of the scheduled end of his tenure in October 2010. //////We welcome the council of advisers' giving final approval to the Right to Information Ordinance 2008 and commend the government for this action. Now, we believe, it is important that as soon as the ordinance is promulgated through presidential assent, instructions must go out to all ministries, directorates, departments, corporations and outlying offices for getting ready and set to provide information to the public on demand. To this end, government offices must be prepared, equipped and trained to cater to demands for information that are bound to arise in consequence of the law.

It is also crucially important that a level of receptivity to requests for information be built into the system by undertaking motivational activities aimed at changing the mindset of government functionaries. //////The admission of the IGP that the police is a 'weak force' is only an authentic statement of fact. Come as the comments do, from the chief of a force that has as its major responsibility the maintenance of law and order and internal security, the frustration is understandable and justified. It underscores the need to effect police reform urgently.//////THERE are a good number of reasons why the Representation of People Ordinance can turn out to be a good thing after all.

It does not. //////THE devastating attack on the Marriott hotel in Islamabad is a poignant reminder of the serious challenge the Pakistan government faces in the war on terror. The challenge is certainly staggering, and more complicated than merely viewing it as the consequence of the government's failure to go all-out against the terrorists.

Despite having enormous potential, South Asia is in an economically disadvantageous position, compared to other regional blocs. This is further aggravated by related bottlenecks that exist within the public administration, particularly the customs. Lack of adequate infrastructure at ports, complex rules and regulations concerning international trade, ambiguities related to customs valuation and tariff classification, pervasiveness of corruption among a section of customs personnel, inefficiency of government bureaucracy, and lack of cooperation among the various government agencies pose serious threat to the region's external sector performance. Raising effectiveness of trade facilitation measures within the Saarc region is crucial to supporting global integration of Saarc countries and promote their trade and commerce. Such an endeavour will largely depend on adopting and implementing a number of measures including the following. The Saarc Secretariat could play a key role in it.//////Dhaka stocks gained yesterday, powered mainly by bank shares.//////The dollar rose against the euro and yen on Tuesday as traders awaited more

same subject) after reading the news item captioned Sexual Harassment at JU: Make probe report public, published in your daily on September 17, 2008. This also has got to do with Ms. Nasrin Pervin's letter published on September 12, 2008 on sexual harassment in educational institutions. What is remarkable about the letter is, she specifically cited the name of a department and claimed that one of her close friends was the victim of her teacher's constant insistence to get into such a relationship. Thus the authenticity of her narrative cannot be disregarded.//////Last year, we came to know that to provide vegetable etc at reasonable prices some vegetable markets at various locations of Dhaka city would be opened and these would be managed by the BDR. The vegetable prices will be fair, as vegetables producers will directly sell their products from these markets. //////At its peak, the Soviet Union was a formidable military power, but it was a Third World nation with missiles. The Soviet economy was simply not working. Without competition, most state-owned factories were producing shoddy products which no one wanted. Soviet agriculture was in a terrible state. Soviet Republic of Ukraine was once the bread-basket of Europe before collectivisation. But under the Soviet rule, it became a net importer. //////1/11 had rescued the nation from a 'civil war' and a catastrophe, at a juncture when time was rapidly running out at the irresponsible stance of both the major political parties of our country.//////Our society is intertwined like other developing countries with progressive ideas for ensuring peace, progress and prosperity. //////Almost all of us learnt in school --Always tell the truth. Since then, the more we can grasp the meaning of the truth, the more we comprehend the risks involved in telling the truth at the wrong time and wrong place! I browsed the encyclopaedia to know why telling truth doesn't do justice to us.//////The posh residential area Gulshan has become a busy commercial hub of the city, it has gradually lost its residential character. As a result, a huge number of multinational and national corporate houses set up their multistoried offices in Gulshan. Most of the offices are on the Gulshan Avenue and nearly every one of them has no parking space. Let me tell you the story, starting from the shooting club point, in front of the club a bank has its head office without any parking space and some steps ahead a mobile company recently started their new corporate office and that creates chaotic traffic jam as lots of cars are parked on the street, none of the law enforcers are saying anything to them. Now come to Gulshan-1 intersection where a shopping mall is situated and cars are parked in front of the mall. These generate huge traffic jam as the left side of the intersection goes to the car owners. The on-duty policemen are helpless and cannot go against the lawbreakers as they are more powerful. //////The government should ban smoking completely because it causes serious health problem. It not only harms smokers but non-smokers are also affected by it. Though the govt. earns hefty revenue from the tobacco industry it should ban marketing of tobacco & related products. Non-smokers should not suffer for the fancy of smoking cigarettes by others. //////Being students of Dhaka University, we are subjected to undemocratic, asocial and uncivilised conducts by the so called student leaders, either from the JCD or the BCL. They try to dominate and force the general students into subjugation, which of course is not acceptable.//////In one way, I do feel that they are defectors and, on the other hand, I feel good that at least some new cricketers will get the opportunity to play for the national team. The BCB should learn how other countries deal with this kind of situation and how their players respect rules of their cricket board. Look at countries like England and Australia.//////I have gone through the letter "BNP government in disguise" of 10 September'08 issue written by Abdul Moyeen. I read this letter attentively - and it was hard to believe it! In fact, I was doubtful whether it was seriously stated or not. However, if we see the last couple of days' developments between the government and the BNP, it seems the writer was right! It also appears the BNP has already gained or healed its wounds! Who worked behind it or who helped it really? There are three major driving forces - government, opposition and BNP itself.//////There is an aeronautical college operating in Uttara. While they are imparting diploma level courses, taught by diploma holder teachers, but they claim to offer the students a British degree in Aeronautical Engineering. Do they have any workshop, aircraft engine, component, tools, labs etc? //////In my letter to the editor of The Daily Star dated Aug 24, 2008 I stated, It will appear to any casual observer that in Bangladeshi politics the leaders do not have supporters or followers. They have slaves. These slaves blindly support their respective leaders, even if such leaders are grossly wrong, corrupt and unpatriotic. Two most recent incidents further substantiate my statement. In one incident the standing committee of a major party sat in a formal meeting with its chief in the chair who was released from the prison on the preceding day. //////The education ministry is planning to draft a resolution regarding admission into higher seats of learning, it's considering cancellation of admission tests and introducing admission based on students' GPAs achieved in HSC & SSC exams. Already admission into colleges is GPA based. And we know what a mess it has created! In this case it can somehow be tolerated but in case of admission into universities, medical colleges it should better be aborted for the sake of quality education. Getting good grades, especially in public exams, is not that difficult now, given the present system. //////Why shouldn't issuance of prior visa be done away with between Bangladesh and India and also among the Saarc countries?
