Even a cursory glance at the figures relating to women's advancement in the past two decades will testify to this truth. And yet the fact that a whole lot of distance yet needs to be covered by Bangladesh's women as well as women in other regions of Asia was highlighted once more at a discussion organized by Asian University for Women (AUW) on Friday. The plain fact is that there needs to be more investment in women's education and training regarding the varied regions of life and experience. Interestingly, the meeting at AUW, which has just seen Mrs. Cherie Blair stepping in as its chancellor, brought together a number of eminent figures from around Asia and elsewhere to focus on this very issue. The results, we are happy to note, appear rather encouraging.//////In what appears to be a disquieting eruption of violence in Rangamati between Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti (PCJSS) and United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF), altogether seven persons died of gun wounds. Judging by the witness accounts and local administration's version, it was the outcome of a turf war to extend two feuding parties' area of influence. The common aim seems to be collection of tolls; in other words, it is put down by the local authorities to a motive for extortion. This rakes up the memory of the days of insurgency when fugitive tribal groups used to thrive on toll collection. But the people of CHT have come a long distance away from those nightmarish days by virtue of a peace accord.//////Brothers Union notched up their first win of the Grameenphone Bangladesh League as they handed a 2-0 defeat to Mohammedan Sporting Club at the Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) celebrated the country's one decade in Test cricket with a colourful function at the Army Stadium yesterday.//////World number one Rafael Nadal progressed to the fourth round at the Australian Open as expected but Australian teen Bernard Tomic announced himself as a player of the future on Saturday.//////Coach Mohammad Salahuddin has tendered his resignation to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) yesterday to take up a new job in Malaysia.//////Barisal Abahani crushed Mukul Fauj of Pirojpur by 200 runs in their opening match of the Inter-District Club Cup cricket tournament in Patuakhali yesterday.//////Stamford University lifted the ULAB Cup trophy for the first time after they beat State University of Bangladesh by 31 runs in the final at the ULAB cricket ground yesterday.//////A five-wicket haul for Tim Southee and a blistering 55 by Jesse Ryder saw New Zealand shatter an 11-match losing streak in style with a nine-wicket win over Pakistan in their one-day match Saturday.//////Favourite Kim Clijsters subdued a battling Alize Cornet to reach the Australian Open last 16 Saturday, as Andy Murray and Robin Soderling remained in impeccable form.//////Virat Kohli struck a sparkling 87 not out and had a hand in three dismissals but couldn't stop South Africa from winning the fourth one-day international against India at St George's Park on Friday.//////"Vamos!" shouted the Indian doubles player.

Unfortunately, their contributions were overlooked. Among the participants, Mamtaj Begum (Kalyany Roy Choudhury, b.1930) - the then Headmistress of Narayanganj Morgan Girls' School - demonstrated extraordinary courage. In Narayanganj, she organised one of the largest women's demonstration in protest of the killings of 21st and 22nd February (1952) in Dhaka. She was immediately jailed, condemned and dubbed as a 'communist'. Strength of her character was tested when jailed Mumtaj Begum refused to sign the 'mercy petition' (admitting her mistake) prepared by the Pakistan government. She spent over a year in jail. Due to the dirty tricks of the then government she ultimately lost her job and family. Away from family, friends and the loved ones, Mamtaj Begum died in Armanitola, Dhaka in 1967. //////12th January is celebrated as University Day in Jahangirnagar University, as the university was established on this day 40 years ago. //////There have been many talk-shows, seminars, expert opinions on traffic jam of the capital city Dhaka and the traffic management has been taking numerous steps and measures and doing different experiments to solve the problem but with no success. We listen about big plans of elevated express ways, underground metro rails etc., but in reality it is hard to believe that these plans can ever be materialised by this poor nation having massive corruption in all sectors, from judiciary to education. //////The Sylhet valley is formed by a beautiful pair of rivers named Surma and Kushiara, both of which are fed by innumerable hill streams from the north and the south. //////An informative and interesting front page lead report on the matter was published by a local financial daily on 4th January. It only indicates that instead of paying due taxes on premium income, insurance companies avoid it, to sweeten the palm of the insurers, and possibly themselves too, through clever play of financial figures and supporting paper, making their black deed white! Instead insurance company authorities show it as fictitious costs, and create a 'slush fund', and to satiate the insurer's greed, you pay more and more illegal commission on premiums, beyond the limit set for it!//////I read it in a few English dailies on 6th January issued by PID of our Ministry of Information, with three lead articles. The first one on the left; written by Syed Abul Hossain and translated by Sahana Akhtar, had grammatical mistakes, both in the 'heading' and the 'sub-heading' too! The heading stated "The Communication Infrastructure is being Changed." Here the definite article "The" was totally superfluous before the expression "Communication Infrastructure" which is a collective noun here. The sub-heading was totally confusing, grammar wise. It was: "Changes will there be in Bangladesh"! Was it not totally confusing? It really takes the cake! What was in the mind of the translator? Did she just substitute suitable (?) English words for 'Bangla' as set in the 'Bangla' expression? I just cannot fathom the reason for this 'original' mistake! //////The article entitled Health care in slums: No strategy works published in The Daily Star on 31st December 2010, is an immature research in health care. Although at present Bangladesh don't have any prudent health policy, government and private health care facilities are accessible from rural to urban area either in the form of primary health care or primary to tertiary care. Important aspects are public awareness and education. //////I was quite surprised to read the list of the corrupt in the TIB Survey. Not the ones named, but the undoubted 'champion' who once again got away unscathed. This department of the government operates far from the capital, has the largest area under its control and has institutionalised and refined the art of corruption. Yes, it is the Forest Dept. //////Agriculture together with livestock, fisheries and forestry is a rapidly flourishing potential economic sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE government has attached priority to invest more in the agriculture sector with a view to increasing food production. In the recent days massive agricultural development has put 723738 hectares of barren land under the plough. Greening the country with planting trees is also going on in full swing. Agriculture is being done in green house and in absence of enough water for irrigation hydroponics technique has been adopted to produce vegetables. In fact, UAE has so far achieved a remarkable progress towards modernising its agriculture as reflects in the saying of Late President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan They used to say agriculture has no future, but with God's blessing and our determination we have succeeded in transforming the desert into a green land.//////Md. Asadullah Khan has aptly stated: We have borrowed the gloss, but not the ability to fight a crisis [The Looming Threat of AIDS, published in The Daily Star on 11th December, 2010]. Undoubtedly, the government's pledge to build a digital nation is a commendable one, but I wonder if it is prepared to tackle cyber crime. Fake accounts on social networking sites, uploading inappropriate materials and hacking are already prevalent in this country. Higher levels of cyber crimes can easily creep in. It is very disturbing if hackers gain access to private information and send obnoxious or misleading mails to contacts. //////It is very sad to say that taxicabs are being used to snatch vanity bags or luggage from the passengers of rickshaws. One of our neighbour had this bad experience. She and her relative were going by a rickshaw and she was aware that her vanity bag might be snatched. So, she held her bag strongly. But a taxicab followed them and a man in the cab snatched away her bag. As she was holding her bag strongly, she fell on the street and broke one of her ankles. She was admitted to a hospital for 2 weeks.

That is good news for anyone who believes in a people's inalienable right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. One of these days, assuming that the Khartoum-based regime of Omar el-Bashir does nothing to thwart the results of the recent referendum on a partition of Sudan into a northern, Muslim-based and a southern Christian and animist-dominated states, there will soon be a new government in Juba. And that is as it should be, seeing that the people of South Sudan have for decades paid a high price in defence of their rights. President Bashir has promised to respect the results of the referendum. It will now be the responsibility of the United Nations, symbolising global conscience as it does, to hold the Sudanese leader to his word.//////MY brother from New York phoned me on the first day of 2011 to wish me a happy new year. //////In the article "A S Mahmud: A Tribute" by Syed Munir Khasru, printed in this page on January 22, Mr. A S Mahmud was inadvertently designated as Managing Editor of Mediaworld.
