Our response is plain, simple and without ambiguity. We believe that if there is yellow journalism in certain instances and if the government means to act against it, there are sufficient existing mechanisms to do it. A new law cannot be the answer to the problem. It will only become a problem by itself. The answer lies in empowering Press Council and allow it to do its job professionally and independently. Certainly there could be news reports which might be false or designed to malign individuals, groups and the government. But those reports can be dealt with by the Press Council once strong measures are in place to ensure the absolute independence of the body. We suggest that an independent Press Council is the appropriate body to deal with all matters regarding allegations of bad or motivated journalism. It must be provided with adequate funds, manpower, indeed infrastructure in order to function without fetters of any kind. That is what the government should do and not formulate any new law.//////Eighty-nine years ago on July 01, 1921 the Dhaka University was founded fulfilling the long cherished dream of the then population of East Bengal. The idea of establishing a university for the relatively unserved section of the Bengalees living in the eastern part of greater Bengal came to the mind of the imperial rulers after a deputation of high ranking Muslim leaders, including Sir Nawab Khwaja Salimullah, Khan Bahadur Chowdhury Kazimuddin Ahmed Siddiky, Nawab Syed Nawab Ali Choudhury and A. K. Fazlul Huq, met Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy of India, on January 31, 1912 and expressed their fears that the annulment (of Partition of Bengal) would retard the educational progress of their community. This highest seat of learning in this agricultural hinterland of greater Bengal, in course of time, truly became the centre of intellectual excellence as well as that of political thinking and movement. //////Brazil, without suspended Ramires and injured Elano, face the Netherlands here on Friday for the fourth time at a World Cup in what promises to be an explosive quarterfinal.//////Brazil coach Dunga may have a hard time selecting his midfield for the quarterfinal against the Netherlands at the World Cup on Friday because of injuries and a suspension.//////Pele, who earlier during the World Cup finals said that Maradona had only taken the Argentina coaching job because he needed the money, said Maradona's previous troubles - which included treatment for a cocaine addiction - could only have a bad effect on the team. //////Defending champion Serena Williams reached her third successive Wimbledon final after seeing off a challenge from the gritty Czech Petra Kvitova 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 on Thursday.//////For a team that was supposed to flounder in the first round and that has come under attack for its reliance on style over substance, Dunga's boys from Brazil aren't doing too badly.//////Port Elizabeth has put a 'no room at the inn' sign up as Brazilian and Dutch fans invade this sleepy Eastern Cape city for Friday's mouthwatering World Cup quarterfinal.//////Netherlands winger Eljero Elia believes his side have yet to hit top form in South Africa and is in bullish mood ahead of Friday's quarterfinal with Brazil in Port Elizabeth.//////Wesley Sneijder has dismissed suggestions that a rift has developed between himself and Netherlands teammate Robin van Persie.//////One-time football power Uruguay are on the verge of their first World Cup semifinal appearance in 40 years with African hope Ghana blocking their way at Soccer City here on Friday.//////World Cup boss Danny Jordaan said Thursday that Ghana carried the continent's hopes as it aimed to become the first African team in the semifinals, in the first tournament on African soil.//////Germany must beware of Argentina's attempts to provoke them during Saturday's World Cup quarterfinal, German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger said on Wednesday. //////Diego Maradona thought Thomas Mueller was a ballboy when they first met, a demeaning snub which has fired-up the German star to plot Argentina's downfall in Saturday's World Cup quarterfinal.//////When the Uruguayan squad left their hotel in Kimberley to head for the World Cup quarterfinal with Ghana in Johannesburg, staff and guards at the gate bid them farewell singing "Shosholoza". //////Ghana legend Abedi Pele has backed the Black Stars to beat Uruguay in Friday's World Cup quarter-final and ride the wave of continental support all the way to the final in Soccer City on July 11. //////North Koreans risk being sent to the coal mines while Nigeria get slapped with a two-year ban from international football.//////The overall attendance at the World Cup could be the highest since the tournament was held in the United States 16 years ago, organisers said on Thursday.//////Fulham boss Roy Hodgson was named on Thursday as the new manager of Liverpool, signing a three-year contract on Merseyside, the Premier League club said.//////An African nation could win the World Cup in the future if the game continues on the right path, Brazil's World Cup-winning captain Cafu said on Thursday.//////Juventus continued the club's rebuilding for the new Italian season on Thursday by completing big-money deals for Bari centre-back Leonardo Bonucci and Catania midfielder Jorge Martinez. //////FIFA's reluctance to use technology to avoid refereeing errors has been grist to the mill of newspaper cartoonists.

''A rivalry between the two groups had been prevailing for long over a piece of land,'' the OC added.//////A 50 mw private rental power plant went into operation here on experimental basis on Wednesday.

Villagers said, a gang of 10/15 armed robbers entered the house of Sabur Mondal of the village at about 2:45am.

The games may be forgotten in the days to come; but the Vuvuzela will remain-- the popular and ever-present symbol of the games in South Africa! Viva-la Vuvuzela!//////June 19 was the birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi, a living legend. Her birthday was observed all over the world with tremendous enthusiasm. The whole world loves her. But where is she? She is under house arrest. //////The whole country has worn a festive look with colours of Brazil, Argentina and other favourite football playing nations flying on rooftops, bamboo poles, huts, shops and even vehicles. T shirts and stickers of those flags are selling like hot cakes. Youngsters have shown their loyalty to the favourite nations by vandalizing vehicles on their failure to watch the games because of load shedding. Some BUET students blew their future for WC by making the authorities close down the highest seat of education in our country. My wife won't watch any Bangladeshi programmes on TV. She prefers refined acting in refined Bengali of West Bengal to Bangladeshi low comic drama serials in local dialects. Should I blame my wife? Should I point finger to the youngsters for their showing emotional attachment to the countries that have made neatness and transparency their guiding principle? So to make our youngsters proud of our flag that we achieved in return of blood and tears, first we have to ensure good governance characterized by benevolence, austerity, honesty, accountability and diligence on the part of every citizen.//////Jute, the golden fibre of Bangladesh, once again makes presence in the media as its genetic coding has been decoded by a Bangladeshi scientist in collaboration with other aiding agencies. Being a deltaic country, Bangladesh has to face a number of natural disasters round the year. The avaricious activities of humans on environment also add a new dimension to such kind of calamities. Farmers are keeping themselves away from cultivating jute. Moreover, the malpractice of jute collection through local agent for government factories at lower rates has worsened the situation to some extent. Though we are the second largest producer of this fibre after India, the present situation is not encouraging at all.//////We have bigger problems in the country. So let us not just irritate the football enthusiasts by criticising them pointlessly. During the World Cup season people of different cultures become one. It's a phenomenon, not that we can have such phenomenon every day! It brings us all together in a global festival. We dance, sing the same song. At this point of time, there is no difference. //////The buses in Dhaka city are a great menace. //////The other day I was passing through the Mohakhali flyover. Traffic was terrible! Vehicles were bumper to bumper. On my left was a heavily loaded mini truck. What caught my attention was the way goods were tied up to the body. It was so carelessly tied up that it seemed it might fall down any time and cause an accident. I was thinking what if the goods fell down on a car! I asked the driver why he tied the goods that way. He reluctantly said, It's perfectly alright. It will never fall down. I asked what if it fell down. He said, Then it would be an accident. And nobody has control on accident. Then I told him I had taken a photo of his truck. He grinned and said, I don't care at all. //////With reference to the editorial published on your newspaper on June 13, 2010 entitled Vat proposal on private universities be withdrawn, I would like to thank you on behalf of students and guardians, for your positive perception on this issue and producing the write-up. //////BUET, the highest seat of technical education in the country, was closed sine die on such a trifling issue that we cannot but feel worried. It appears that junior students thrashed up their seniors to close the university to facilitate viewing World Cup football matches. Nothing can be more shameful for this traditional institute. The authorities should take tough actions against the rogue students to keep the BUET image high. //////This is the recent news that the nationalised banks i.e. Sonali Bank Limited, Janata Bank Limited & the Agrani Bank Limited, including Bangladesh Bank, are going to have a separate pay scale. Already, the banks have submitted their proposed pay structure to the Ministry of Finance. I think that this a very good & effective step of the nationalised banks, because the private bank pay structure is much higher than the nationalised banks. There should be a balance. Our neighbouring countries like India, Pakistan & Sri Lanka have separate pay scales for the nationalised banks. //////The housing ministry had called a meeting to discuss about the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) of Rajuk with Rehab and Bangladesh Land Developers Association (BLDA). In this meeting, the state minister of housing faced an impolite behaviour of a businessman.//////All the countries in the world have made our country a dumping ground of old cars which they do not want to keep in their own country. You must impose immediate ban on the import of used cars.//////The present capacity of the running power stations in Sylhet zone is about 500 MW including 15 &3 years rental and small IPP. These plants are run by gas and gas is also available there. The present peak hour power demand of Sylhet zone is about 250 MW. The balance 250 MW cannot fully be dispatched to other areas where there is shortage of generation due to limitation of transmission facility. As a result, the Sylhet zone remains surplus in generation and suffers no load shedding. //////It seems that the AL is ruining itself. The party has lost focus in every field after the huge election victory. This is characterized by ://////The 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata described health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Health is a fundamental human right. Attainment of the highest possible level of health is a very important world-wide social goal. By 2000, everyone should enjoy a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. Achieving this aim would necessitate financial and community expansion. But primary healthcare, based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families, was supposed to be key to attaining the target. By 2000, there were significant health improvements, with increases in life expectancy in 163 of 184 countries for which data are available (between 1975 and 1995). Expenditure on health has also risen, with global spending on health accounting for approximately 8 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP). However, there are massive disparities in the health status of rich and poor countries and the goal of health for all has clearly not been met. //////We the city dwellers travel by bus. It is part of our daily life. Bus is our essential mode of transport as it is the cheapest one. However, day by day buses are getting overcrowded and noisy. The situation has been worsening fast. I need to travel by bus from Kakrail to Baridhara to attend my office. The drivers and helpers not trained properly. //////Recently, a woman reportedly committed suicide in the city's Jurain area with two of her young children. It's really regrettable that some children are not safe even in the custody of their parents. I think marital conflicts of adults must not victimize children. The entire incident represents the sickness of the insensitive grown-ups that children endure in our society. I can understand that the woman had to bear the intolerable traumas of a broken relationship and she had to put up with the alleged abuse by her husband and in-laws. I really sympathize with her for her ordeals. However, that doesn't make her awful act of persuading her own children to commit suicide justifiable. She should have had some compassion for her children. She shouldn't have made them the victims of her own misfortune and emotional turmoil. Instead, if she had raised her children with resilience, someday her children might have proven to be her ultimate strength in life. //////If humans want something, they will do anything to get it, it's human nature. It's the same with alcohol---some people drink because they say that some drinks are good for health and some people drink for pleasure. It is a sad fact that an estimated 6.6million children under the age of 18 live in households with at least one alcoholic parent. As a result our future generation will repeat the same thing as we always follow our parents.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////A protest shutdown has paralysed normal life for a fourth successive day in Indian-administered Kashmir.//////US General David Petraeus, the new Afghan war commander, pledged yesterday to give his forces the firepower to fight the Taliban but insisted that sparing civilian lives remained his priority.//////Nepal's communist former rebels reached out to other political parties yesterday to form a new coalition government, a day after the prime minister resigned following months of sometimes-violent protests.//////The European Commission on Wednesday rejected Sri Lankan accusations that a letter it sent urging the south Asian country to comply with conditions tied to a trade concession agreement was politically motivated.//////The Taliban in Afghanistan have told the BBC that there is no question of their entering into any kind of negotiations with Nato forces.//////Pakistani authorities now believe a dangerous new militant group, out to avenge a deadly army assault on a mosque in Islamabad three years ago, has carried out several major bombings in the capital previously blamed on the Taliban.//////Incessant monsoon rains have triggered major flooding in northeastern India, submerging hundreds of villages and forcing thousands of people to abandon their homes in search of higher ground, say officials and aid workers.//////The Lahore High Court (LHC) has dismissed a petition against US drone attacks in Pakistan, which had asked for a ban on them in the absence of an "agreement or treaty" by the government over the attacks.//////Former Pakistan law minister Sher Afgan Niazi has said that a member of parliament holding a fake degree not only faces disqualification, but is also liable to be awarded 80 lashes under the Islamic law for lying.//////Children as young as five years old are being used by the Taliban to lay bombs and carry weapons in Afghanistan, a media report said.//////There is no reason for the Sri Lankan government's angry reaction to the formation of a UN advisory panel on possible war crimes at the end of Sri Lanka's war against rebels, the UN chief said on Wednesday.//////Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai has agreed to send some military officers to Pakistan for training.//////If you have cash to spare in Gaza, you can treat your children to new varieties of chocolate Israel has just let in for the first time in a few years, or splash out on new tableware it allowed into the territory this week.//////Israel says it has held its first high-level meeting with Turkey since the latest row between the former allies over Israel's killing of Turkish activists on an aid-ship heading for Gaza.//////The Palestinian president has given a rare interview to Israeli media in an apparent effort to counter the claims in some circles that Israel has no partner for peace talks.//////The UN nuclear agency said yesterday its top inspector Olli Heinonen, head of investigations into Iran and Syria, has resigned for personal reasons after nearly 30 years at the Vienna-based organization.//////From medicine to musical instruments, from fashion and beauty products to delicacies, wildlife items in trade must be properly regulated to ensure the continued survival of animals and plants in the wild. //////Chancellor Angela Merkel's candidate was elected German president Wednesday in a lacklustre victory that took an embarrassing three rounds of voting and dashed hopes of a strong show of support from her governing coalition.//////A war crimes court has ruled that model Naomi Campbell can be called to testify in a case against former Liberian President Charles Taylor.//////Police in the US are reopening an investigation into allegations that former Vice-President Al Gore made unwanted sexual advances to a woman at a hotel in 2006.//////'Bot-Tola' is a new theatre group. Some say it is a splinter group of an established theatre company. I don't know if it is or not. And I don't care. It's the quality of work that speaks for the group. Very often it has been seen that the so-called splinter group supersedes the 'original' in terms of artistic excellence. Our theatre arena is replete with such examples. Bot-Tola (under the banyan tree) is a familiar Bangla expression that goes beyond what it literally means. It transcends the literal meaning, and connotes a shadow, a refuge, an assurance that gives people hope, security and, more importantly, courage. Watching the group perform at the Oxford International School, I thought that they really lived up to the connotation fully in their maiden production of Khona. //////It had better be the last. How did M. Night Shyamalan go from being touted as heir apparent to Hitchcock and Spielberg (often by himself) after his trend-setting 1999 jack-in-the-box thriller The Sixth Sense to the writer-director of the murky, shapeless, retro-fitted, 3-D bomb The Last Airbender?//////Actress Joya Ahsan enjoys playing diverse roles. Most of her characters are unique and attract much attention from the viewers. Recently, she enacted the role of a jatra dancer in the much acclaimed play Panjabiwala.//////With the onset of World Cup Football, in Bangladesh we are clearly divided into two groups supporters of Brazil and Argentina. We hoist flags of both the countries, though we don't belong to those countries. According to the constitution, however, we cannot hoist the flags of any other country without hoisting our National Flag.//////Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts organised a press conference on the occasion of a solo painting exhibition of Rezaun Nabi on July 1 at the Bengal's caf. The exhibition begins today at the Bengal Gallery in Dhanmondi.//////The latest instalment of the musical soiree Praner Khela was held on June 30 at the Bengal Shilpalaya, in Dhanmondi, Dhaka. Noted adhunik singer Shammi Akhtar and emerging Nazrul Sangeet artiste Shahid Kabir Palash (L) performed songs at the programme.//////How is it that hartals are even legal? I have had enough of hearing the tedious and tendentious argument that the right to hartal, like the right to free speech and free assembly, is a democratic right.//////THERE may be a thousand reasons why the formative years may play a role in the molding of a killer, but not as many reasons to explain what may play a role in the making of a victim. That contradiction became even more poignant when a boy and his younger sister joined their mother to take their own lives in this city. But as icing on that horror cake came the news of another gruesome death.
