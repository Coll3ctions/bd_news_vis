election knocking at the door, political parties are yet to unravel their plans and programmes for serving the people. Completely oblivious to and unrepentant about what they had done to derail democracy they seem to be unprepared to address the problems of the day. To say the least, they made a farce of governance and rule of law, and concomitantly the nation was subjected to political, ethical and moral erosion of massive magnitude. The real issues facing the nation were subsumed in endless confrontation and battles of attrition between major political parties. But there is no sign that they have become wiser. On the contrary, today they make attempts to create new issues and talk about political movement as if living in the past. //////THE nation observes today the 33rd anniversary of the assassination of four national leaders in Dhaka central jail.

Quamruzzaman -- who provided singular and determined leadership to the armed struggle for liberation through forming the provisional Bangladesh government in Mujibnagar in 1971 should have met such a tragic end in the land that is part of the legacy they have shaped for us. It is also a matter of shame that they were all killed in the secure confines of jail, where they had been lodged after the violent coup d'etat of August 15, 1971. This morning, as on any other morning, we pay our silent, sincere tribute to these sons of the soil.//////WITH the countdown to the election for our ninth parliament having almost begun, an inauspicious wave of restlessness is sweeping across the country.

Every major poll indicates Obama's victory, with some polls showing a seemingly insurmountable double- digit lead. The key factor is that swing states like Colorado, Ohio, and Florida, all with large electoral votes and having voted Republican in the previous two elections, seem to be swinging in Obama's favour. //////THE sound of a stereotype crumbling travels deep into the individual psyche and the collective consciousness. The two largest democracies, India and America, comparable in size, demographics and ethnic tensions, have both heard such a rumble in the last few days. The trigger in both cases might have been the relentless pressure that elections bear upon social relationships, the amoral quest for power that brings subterranean flows to a boil.//////Indian skipper Anil Kumble announced Sunday he was retiring from Test cricket with immediate effect, bringing down the curtain on a glorious international career.//////Muktijoddha Sangsad earned their first point in the Citycell B.

But they amount to little more than band-aids applied to the gaping holes created or at least exposed by the crisis, and such band-aid solutions are clearly inadequate to prevent the next crisis. And in the wake of a crisis of this magnitude, we can no longer say that the financial system basically works, as long as we apply some regulatory tweaking. We may need to rethink the entire global financial architecture - literally, from its foundations to its roof - to prevent financial turbulence from wreaking such havoc on the world in future. Indeed, President Bush recently invited the G20 to a summit on November 15 to discuss the crisis, and some have argued that this meeting should consider reforming that global architecture.

She told the doctor about the severe and unbearable pain in her molar tooth. The doctor examined the tooth for a couple of minutes or so and finally gave the prescription. He told that he had to remove that tooth at once which simply scared my aunt horribly. To add more to her fears he said that if it was not removed as soon as possible the other teeth might need to be removed as well. After reaching home, my mother tried her best to console her but all her attempts went futile. She suggested that we consult another doctor before taking any hasty decisions but my aunt was stubborn. Next day she had her operation. All went well for three days. On the fourth day her tooth started paining. When it was unbearable, my mother and me took her to another hospital. After examining for half an hour or so, the doctor asked the reason for removing the tooth. We explained to him. After taking some tests he told us that the tooth for which she was suffering was left untouched. Giving a sigh he told us that THE DOCTOR HAD REMOVED ONE OF HER GOOD TEETH!
