The role of institutions like the army and its auxiliaries like the BDR and the Ansars have returned in full force, making everyone anxious to understand what they mean in terms of law and order stability and the character of the state institutions that house such forces. //////It was appalling to witness the fast swinging of the "sentiment pendulum" during the course of the BDR mutiny. When the first news of the mutiny broke, the sentiment pendulum decisively swung towards the mutineers, partly owing to their socio-economic background but mainly due to the stories of deprivation they managed to deliver to the public. //////There is very little that one can add, at least nothing very insightful, to what has already been said and written on the BDR massacre. The opposition political parties have given their verdict on whom they think is responsible for it. And the AL has come out with theories of its own, courtesy the daily comments on the investigation by the minister for commerce. However, there are differing views on several important aspect of the matter in the Grand Alliance, particularly between the AL and its major component the JP, principally on how the matter should have been handled. //////The emerging conventional wisdom at the time of writing is that the events were premeditated, and not spontaneous. If this view is true, then it is important to scrutinise the rank and file of the BDR. Failure to do this means we run the risk of a rebel soldier killing an Indian officer during a flag meeting. The repercussions of such an incident could be far reaching indeed. And even if nothing like that happens, it seems difficult to ask a 25 year-old captain to command a BDR platoon in the remote border areas. It is no surprise then that officers are yet to join their men at camps. //////The weather was getting hotter, the days steadily getting longer, yet there was still so much to do for the wedding.//////(////// from Sector 6 wrote this letter to his mother Rafia Khatun on 16 July 1971. At that time he was on the Indian border near Panchagarh, Bangladesh.)//////I accidentally came across this book on wines written by an Indian in a Kolkata bookshop, and then found to my surprise that it has actually been well received in the country. Magandeep Singh, a sommelier who's a consultant with hotels and restaurants, writes with humour and a light touch. In his introduction he confesses that he was not a 'wine man' to begin with, but persistence, curiousity and patience in the quest to understand what it was about wine that was so mesmerizing paid off at the end. The book is arranged in fourteen easy-to-read chapters, and clues in South Asians starting to develop a taste for wine, or even ones who have been regularly drinking it without knowing much about it, about the fine art that lies behind selecting, palates, varieties, vintages, reds, whites, tasting, storing (the chapter is titled 'zen and the art of storing wine'), and even ways to handle the stress of surveying snooty wine lists. And much more. White wines, for example, should be served about one-third of the glass (never more!), and reds about two-thirds. Why? So that each sip is at the right temperature! Pour too much and halfway through the wine starts to taste awful. For South Asians well, for a transplanted one like me, however, the most interesting and informative parts are the chapters that deal with which wines to serve with Indian food whites, a floral Chenin Blanc goes best with saag-palak, while the tandoori preparations need full-bodied reds with oak aging. There is also a chapter on Indian wines ('the desi shelf'), a field which, though still a toddler is apparently now starting to spread wings with French (who else!) help, away from the traditional popular sparkling wines into a wider range: cabernets and sauvignon blancs, and where the Dindori Reserve Shiraz from the Sula Vineyards actually receives a high rating from Singh.//////Wars, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, disease outbreaks, famine, radiological incidents and chemical spills  all are emergencies that, invariably, impact heavily on public health. Internal emergencies in health facilities  such as fires and loss of power or water  can damage buildings and equipment and affect staff and patients.

He has been recognised as an emerging young leader for interventional cardiology by The Cardiovascular Research Institute at Washington Hospital Center.//////BDR Mutiny (or 2/25) created strategic implications of unimaginable consequences both within and without the country. Friends and enemies, far and near, are watching our actions and utterances and devising their own strategies to keep the fallout of 2/25 from reaching their own doorsteps. 2/25 has caused multidirectional alarms in regional and concerned capitals. Our government and opposition are further complicating the matter by trying to answer the unanswerable hypothetically, thus creating insurmountable confusions, which compels all seeking answers to go astray and haywire. //////THE BDR carnage has left a scar on the face of the nation that will take a long time to fade off. At the same time, the country's image has taken a battering that will further debilitate its efforts to expand her interests in the international environment that is crucial to her existence and her future. The carnage has been covered by the international media in the context of the abhorrent nature of the atrocities committed. It has also reflected upon our inability in dealing with it in a manner that would help the nation recover from the shame the carnage has given us. //////OBAMA is the first African-American US President and also the first to inherit 3  warsone volcanic (economy), two hot (Iraq and Afghanistan) and  simmering (Mexico). //////SAARC, a manifestation of regionalism, emerged in an institutional form on 8 December 1985 as another effort at attaining regional cooperation, this time in South Asia. In Shah Muhammad Ikhtiar Jahan Kabir's view, SAARC has been contributing to the regionalism in South Asia as an institution, as a process and a spirit. However, further down the book, the author declares: The SAARC Charter remains a non-starter from the very beginning to guide the regional process. The contradiction in the two observations should not escape the reader, and there are several in Regionalism in South Asia: A Critique of the Functionalist Approach. They mar the quality of a serious undertaking, which purports to address the question of whether the ongoing process of cooperation in South Asia is on the right track; and if it is not, then to explore alternatives or remedies.//////Xinran, with the manuscript of ////// in a bag is physically assaulted while on her way home from teaching an evening class at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. When the policeman arrives at the scene he asks her why she has risked her life fighting over a bag. Xinran, trembling and in a state of shock, says, 'It had my book in it.' The policeman then asks, 'Is a book more important than your life?' And Xinran thinks that in many ways life is more important than a book. 'But in so many ways my book was my life.'//////Syed Shamsul Haq is unquestionably a pre-eminent intellectual personality in Bangladesh.

Taking into account commuting time, overtime, thinking about our jobs and worrying over work, we spend increasingly more of our waking hours in the office, on the road, behind the desk than we do at home.
