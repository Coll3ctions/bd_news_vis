The programme was organised in memory of language martyred Rafique Uddin Ahmed.//////At present we all are victims of adulterated food. After the biggest supermarkets have been penalised for storing adulterated food items, we are quite at a loss whom to trust. I read in The Daily Star and many other newspapers and saw on the TV channels how BSTI and City Corporation seized adulterated foods but I never saw any reports on how the sellers are getting these harmful chemicals. If the authorities are so concerned about the health of the general people, why don't they ban the use of these chemicals? Every citizen has the right to eat fresh food. The government should now look for the root of the problem before we are destroyed by these chemicals.//////It is rather shocking to see scores of people sitting, lying on the bare floor of Kamalapur Railway Station in an effort to obtain a ticket to reach them to their destinations during ensuing Eid holidays. People back at home have become familiar with these situations, so they do not have the feeling of remorse. It is something unthinkable here in the United States. People usually come across such a situation only when disaster strikes.//////We have learnt from the media that British Prime Minister David Cameron has urged international action to tackle malnutrition across the globe. Taking advantage of the large number of foreign officials gathered in London for the Olympic Games, Prime Minister Cameron has called on world powers to save 25 million children from stunted growth over the next four years. //////In Bangladesh, beggars are here, beggars are there and beggars are everywhere". But beggars were not born as beggars. Circumstances in life pushed them to the streets. They are citizens of Bangladesh and have every right to live a decent life. It is the duty of the government to eliminate the beggars by rehabilitating them. A few months back, the ministry of social affairs took steps to rehabilitate the beggars by providing them with rickshaws, rickshaw vans, sewing machines etc. This was a noble decision. I asked many people who were begging in the streets whether they heard about the step taken by our government to rehabilitate them and in reply some told me that these were bogus, others never heard of it and a few of them told me that they visited the venue for help but were driven away by police. Nobody could tell me what the NGOs responsible for taking care of the poor are doing. I understand that lots of money is being donated by rich countries for the poor in Bangladesh and wealthy people at home also donate in Zakat fund. But why then there are people still begging on the streets? //////In most foreign countries, rocks, stones, pebbles and sufficient quantity of bitumen are used for durable and strong roads. On the contrary, we use ordinary bricks, cheap brick chips and small quantity of bitumen for building and repairing roads and streets. As a result, those are damaged within 3-6 months causing a huge loss to the public exchequer and suffering of the people.//////Once it was alleged that 22 families owned the whole country. Bad governance and corruption continued with succeeding governments, each of whom added a zero to the 22 (220, then 2,200 ---). Then there was a bloody war through which the then-Eastern Wing won independence. In the newly independent country the tradition continued. Whether despotic or pseudo-democratic, the zeros continued to be added as relatives, cronies, henchmen, camp-followers etc swelled.//////Adulteration of fish, foods and fruits is a growing concern among the Bangladeshis. In a report and at a roundtable discussion, both published in your newspaper recently, nothing came out about the steps or action to take or about amendment in the relevant law to be made for punishing the people behind the crime. It's already late to save our future generation. Nowadays cancer is attacking young children too. Adulterated food is everywhere. I am just wondering why the authorities concerned are silent, even after seeing the daily reports in newspapers and other media. //////Being a journalist is not one of those easy jobs and not everyone can be a journalist. Journalists all over the world deserve to be recognised for all their hard work round the clock. They are the true unsung heroes who are quietly working behind the curtains. But unfortunately they are also the ones who have to pay the price for unravelling all those illegal activities in the underworld. They are the class of people in our society who are dedicated to their work and are always busy bringing facts about our society to the surface. However, not everybody thinks like this and so they cannot accept facts. Recently many incidents took place where journalists were attacked due to their bold writing which irked various interest groups. Despite the displeasure of some vested quarters, journalists are still devoted to their work. Hats off to all those journalists.//////The world community piled the pressure on Syria Thursday to end 17 months of bloodshed as the top world Muslim body OIC suspended Syria , saying it can no longer accept a regime that "massacres its people and even traditional ally China told Damascus to rapidly implement a ceasefire.//////A Nato Black Hawk helicopter came down in southern Afghanistan yesterday, killing seven American soldiers and four Afghans, the military said, as Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility.//////Singapore yesterday angrily accused Washington of "double standards" on human rights after a US State Department annual report criticised the city-state's tough internal-security laws.//////A wave of attacks across Iraq yesterday killed at least 22 people, officials said, amid warnings of a potential escalation in violence at the end of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.//////Ecuador granted political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange yesterday, setting up a diplomatic confrontation with Britain, which angrily insisted it would extradite him to Sweden.//////Rioters blocked the road to Beirut airport, as dozens of Syrians were kidnapped and their shops vandalised in violence Wednesday that triggered orders from Gulf nations for citizens to leave Lebanon immediately.//////It was the trauma of seeing Israeli troops raze homes in the Bedouin community where she lives that inspired 14-year-old Salha Hamadin to write an award-winning fairy tale.//////Israel yesterday wound up nationwide testing of an SMS warning system against missile attack, sending texts to mobile phones in Jerusalem and other parts of the country, a military spokeswoman said.//////Gunmen pulled 20 Shia Muslims from a bus and killed them at point blank range in Pakistan yesterday, the third such incident in six months, officials said.//////A key member of the Taliban has called for an end to the 10-year war in Afghanistan and for peace talks, demanding prisoner releases and an end to sanctions on rebel leaders to quicken the process.//////A flight test of an experimental unmanned vehicle designed to fly at hypersonic speeds has ended in failure, the US Air Force said Wednesday.//////More than 60 people died this week when a quarry collapsed in an abandoned mine in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Radio Okapi reported late Wednesday.//////The southwestern US state of Texas is battling an outbreak of the West Nile virus, with 17 deaths blamed on the mosquito-borne disease, authorities said Wednesday.//////Thailand yesterday said talks were under way with members of insurgent groups in the south of the country, where thousands of people have been killed since 2004 in violence blamed on Muslim separatists.//////Andy Coulson, the former media chief of British Prime Minister David Cameron, appeared in court yesterday charged with phone hacking while he was editor of Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid.//////Japan was readying to deport 14 people it arrested after pro-China activists landed on a disputed island, reports said yesterday, in what was being seen as an attempt to defuse a growing row.//////A Bahrain court yesterday sentenced prominent Shia rights activist Nabeel Rajab to three years in prison over "unauthorised" protests against the Sunni Al-Khalifa monarchy, a lawyer said.//////I plan to spend Eid in Dhaka.

I lost my father this year and this will be the first Eid without him. His memories will surely flood me on Eid day. If he were alive, he would've given me his blessings on Eid. Maybe he will bless me from afar this year. //////Today marks the 6th death anniversary of the pre-eminent poet Shamsur Rahman. Rahman was noted as an urban poet, columnist and journalist.

Before the film, Masud made several documentaries including Adam Surat and Muktir Gaan.//////The police commissioner of Dhaka gave a prognosis of growing crime rate in the city, when last week he told us on a television show it was nothing but a matter of perception. This is exactly what painkillers do when we take them to reduce our pains. This is what anesthesia does when patients are cut up on operation tables. This is also what addicts do when they drink or smoke intoxicants to overcome their frustrations in life. At times the best way to forget pain is to numb your feelings. What you don't feel doesn't exist. //////Movements against corruption have been, of late, successful in India. They have brought the scourge of dishonesty before the public. That both movements, one led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and the other by yoga guru Baba Ramdev were non-violent is a tribute to those who guided the movements and the thousands of people who participated in them. But both have failed to move the government. In fact, the Manmohan Singh government has become more adamant, more intractable and involved in corruption which is seething the system.//////Ershad's trip to India is being viewed in New Delhi with considerable political and diplomatic significance, an impression one gathers from media reports in the neighbouring country.//////Bangladesh is a least developed country (LDC) with consistent economic growth over the years. About a half of the total population lives under the poverty line and its annual per capita income is around $ 848. Bangladesh has maintained, since the fiscal year 1999 till date, annual average growth rate of more than 5.7%, which falls in the range for an LDC. In order to advance reduction with the aim of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) economic growth, social development and governance are the key areas, and it is also necessary to include human security. Poverty is an extremely important challenge in today's world. Bangladesh is one of the largest LDCs in Asia and still needs to improve several socio-development indicators.//////The recent decision of the health ministry not to hold any admission tests for MBBS and BDS courses in medical and dental colleges, both private and public, has sparked widespread protests by the admission seekers across the country. While the authorities have dismissed these protests as manipulations of the coaching centres and argue that the new enrolment process will be fairer as it will allow the top graders to qualify without any hassle for the medical professions, the scrapping of this age-old practice is not without significant ramifications for the quality of the intake, and ultimately the future, of the already struggling health sector in Bangladesh. //////Kaspersky Lab recently announced the discovery of Gauss, a new malware.//////Samsung on Wednesday unveiled a Galaxy Note tablet designed to make a more personal connection with users and aiming to knock Apple's iPad off its market throne.//////Asus has unveiled two new products, an all in one touchscreen desktop PC and a motherboard, in the local market.//////Samsung has recently launched a line of smart TVs from its D series in Bangladesh.//////Adobe is pulling its Flash Player plug-in from Android's Google Play store.//////The US Agency for International Development (USAID), US government's principal development agency, has been spreading important health messages to expectant and new mothers across Bangladesh via mobile phones. //////Oracle recently organised a workshop on 'Data Centre Optimisation' in the capital. //////
