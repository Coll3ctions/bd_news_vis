And they did so in the full knowledge that theirs was a death that would only harden the resolve of the entire Bengali nation in its struggle to be heard and to be accorded a place of dignity in the structure of the state. In other words, the struggle for Bangla in Pakistan was but the first manifestation of the general feeling in us that if we meant to live and thrive in self-esteem, we would need to keep eternal vigilance and thwart all the insidious moves that would be made to undermine our cultural heritage, indeed our historical calling as a society.//////The ministries of commerce and environment and the Department of Explosives are the operative authorities which share the responsibilities in varying degree of saving the ship breaking yard workers from health hazards and the surrounding environs from pollution. But it seems there is little coordination in the way they operate or at worst, they are working at cross-purposes. //////This will be the 58th occasion on which Bengalees everywhere will observe February 21 as the immortal Language Martyrs' Day. The movement that the students of Dhaka University and other educational institutions launched, in defiance of the draconian laws imposed by the then-Pakistani rulers to press home their demands to establish the status of Bengali as the state language, have all found their due place in the pages of history. We are all proud that the day has, by now, earned global recognition as the International Mother Language Day. //////MORE than a decade ago, the 30th session of the Unesco General Conference unanimously adopted a resolution tabled by Bangladesh and cosponsored by 28 countries, proclaiming February 21 as International Mother Language day. It is a matter of pride and glory for the nation that our immortal "Amar Ekushey" is now also observed all over the world.

The site is entitled ekusherboi.com.. From this site any visitor can search for a book by title or writer's name and get all information about the book. Latest news and pictures of events are uploaded into the site immediately. //////We see here a biased treatment. When the Shibir leader Nomani was killed the government did not launch any combing operation to arrest the BCL culprits. But now when a BCL leader is killed the government with its combined power of police and party men are killing Shibir men and vandalizing their offices. //////It is encouraging to learn through the Press that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has recently launched its solar energy programme with a view to stabilising future power and water supplies in the country. Fortunately, the kingdom is naturally blessed with year-round sunshine to harness solar energy.//////It is getting clearer every day that the two mainstream political parties are locked in mudslinging and spreading rumours never supported by facts.//////In rising to the challenge today, the path we follow must necessarily be a different one. Besides boosting investment in garments, we need to make more efficient use of manpower, chemical inputs and natural resources, and focus more on the needs of small stakeholders. The Textile and garments sectors achieved foreign currency investment to the tune of $ 126.36 million in 2008 and also more than that in 2009. But there is lack of discipline among the workers. They are not happy with the treatment meted out to them by the management. //////Traffic jam is one of the most awe-inspiring problems of Dhaka City. The situation is deteriorating day by day. Nowadays we have to spend 2-3 hours to travel two kilometres.

A few days ago Mr Chisti of Lalmatia had voiced something similar and I have already sent off the rebuttal to DS. If that letter is printed before this, Mr Rahat should find most of the answers, if at all he is looking for an answer for our jams. Also he can refer to my summary of the findings of the authoritative BUET/JICA Traffic Workshop, and Transparency Int. article Facts and Figures already printed in the DS.//////When Mahatma Gandhi launched his non-violent movement to end the British colonial rule in India, he made it clear why he rejected all calls for leading a violent freedom struggle: "If Indians take up guns to kill the British, given India's great religious and ethnic divisions, they would still be using the same guns to kill each other long after the British had gone. If India makes violence her creed, I will not care to live in India."//////With due respect to the valiant martyrs of the '52 Language Movement, I strongly feel that the venue of the Ekushey Boi Mela should be shifted to Agargaon at the site of trade fair. The bookstalls as well as the number of visitors have multiplied manifold. There is a mad rush almost every day. The calm, serene ambience usually associated with the Boi Mela is absolutely lacking. //////Did you know that the Nicaragua-El Salvador war, in which 20,000 people were killed, started over a football game? In fact, Ernest Hemingway, the world famous writer, who spent so much of his time in Latin America and Spain, said you could eliminate most Latin American wars and their causes by simply banning football or soccer. Those games get them so worked up into a frenzy against each other that nothing but a total all-out war can truly satisfy the spirit of it.//////The DS carried a news report on the performance of ministers. I think it is good to have some routine and regular reporting on half yearly basis. A group of different media experts can be pulled together for the purpose. Media's perception should cover the performance of the ministers and members of the parliament, both treasury and opposition. The only aspect I would ask for inclusion is popular perception, positive or negative, in the media study report.//////The victor in Sunday's Super Bowl was not limited to the New Orleans Saints but to life thanks to the game's pro-life TV advertisement featuring Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow of the Florida Gators. It is both refreshing and encouraging to see top athletes living up to their great responsibility of being authentic role models for the many young people who look up to them.//////Road accidents have become a common phenomenon nowadays. Despite the government's relentless efforts to bring back traffic congestion under control, there is no improvement in the situation. A few months back, the government had introduced automated-traffic signalling.

That was what my wife Zakia and I were told a decade ago by some English ladies and gentlemen once they discovered that we were conversing in our own language. The place was London, the occasion a reception in the Houses of Parliament. It was a compliment that left us pleased. And since that moment, every time I have heard anyone speak good, pure Bengali, I have in a dispassionate way noted the melody that comes with it. //////EVERY year we religiously observe Ekushey February, but we may not be aware of its history and significance. We do not follow the ideals for which students gave their blood to establish Bangla as the official language, in turn, establishing Bengali nationalism. Its main purpose was establishing Bangla in every sphere of our lives.//////AFTER writing five novels in English, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, the Nigerian writer, started writing in his own language, Gikuyu. In rejecting English he said: "The bullet was the means of physical subjugation" and "language was the means of spiritual subjugation." Much earlier, Michael Modhusudhon Datta, abandoning his "captive lady" English, wrote in Bangla, and recorded his feelings about this transition in a poem, //////, where he rues the fact that out of greed for others' assets he had neglected the gems of his own language. //////
