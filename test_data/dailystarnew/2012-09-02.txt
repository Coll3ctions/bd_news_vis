Not because I am opposed to public worship per se, but because, for me, religion is truly a personal affair to be confined to the private space of the worshipper. Frankly, my past experiences in attending Muslim religious gatherings have not been all too positive. Two things seem to dominate these occasions. First, the sermons are often overwrought and focus mainly on rituals. Secondly, some "holier than thou" individuals assume self-imposed monitoring roles, which entail criticism of superficial aspects of the worshippers like posture, clothes, strands of hair peeking out of the head covering etc. Sadly, all this religious rhetoric has little to do with one's spiritual evolution! //////
