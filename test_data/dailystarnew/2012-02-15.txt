The day the politicians will finally realise this, will that be the day this nation will begin to move forward? When the ruling party creates problems, it is no better than the opposition. I still remember, in 1996 when BNP refused to step down and transfer power to a caretaker government, Awami League (the then opposition) called continuous hartals until the then ruling party stepped down.
