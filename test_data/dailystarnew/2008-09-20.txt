This is one occasion when many families leave Dhaka to be with the near ones at their ancestral homes. As a result, with the news of advance selling of tickets going around, travellers have begun to queue up at Kamalapur and other railway stations for tickets since 5 in the morning. It only speaks of the urgency of reaching home in time. //////THERE are three sectors in the Bangladesh economy which have prospered over the years -- readymade garments, the providing of employment opportunities to Bangladeshis abroad and pisciculture and shrimp farming aimed for export. The success in these sectors has had little to do with the government. The drive and the movement forward came from entrepreneurs from the private sector. These sectors are now contributing approximately US dollar 17.8 billion in foreign exchange every year to our country. They are keeping the country afloat and have also been the force behind the creation of employment opportunities for millions of people. The RMG sector in particular, has been the source of employment for nearly two million women. That in turn has indirectly helped in gender empowerment, female literacy, better nutrition and family planning.//////MANGLED bodies, wounded people and fear-stricken faces -- every bomb blast, anywhere, leaves this image in its wake. Recent serial blasts at Delhi were no different. What is different is that this blast confirms the existence of Islamist terrorism in India. //////IT is encouraging that the present caretaker government has attached highest budget to agricultural sector. It is a correct assessment and realization that if we can bring a breakthrough in agriculture then only the country can stand on a strong footing.

More important, if our food front cracks up everything else will crack up too.//////Abahani put their wretched start in the Citycell B.

We have the most exceptional winning rate and the most impressive losing rate too. And our aim in the match is also exceptional. Any other Test playing team tries to win the match but we try to play out 50 overs and score past 200. Where this amount of exceptional matters are happening so simply an exceptional mass resignation is very easily committed. Now we should not cry anymore for these player. Because they were not real match-winners. I think it is a better move for our cricket.

It would appear that the culpability of politicians warrant a different standard. Has this difference occurred because thinking Bangladeshis have not given generously and unsparingly of themselves and their talents to the nation whenever the occasion demanded -- most particularly in defence of the rights and liberties of the common man -- so that the well-springs of democracy may remain undefiled?//////Bangladesh's young population (under 25) that mounts up to 50 percent of its total population is a vast untapped wealth that could be turned into the most effective and potential manpower of the country. Born mostly of poor parents, the male children supplement the poor parents' meager income, while many of the female children work as domestic helps and the unfortunate of them are either engaged inside the country in anti-social works or trafficked outside the country to work as sex workers. Even after the promulgation of child-labour ordinance, a good many of the male children labour in factories and fields until affected by diseases while working with toxic chemicals in some of these factories. //////Many of us rushed to the Jahangirnagar University on Tuesday to join a human chain of teachers and students in a bid to stop its administration fell several hundred trees of the campus.

However, between these two defined areas lie many market places and growth centres which do not fall within either category and are therefore escaping the eyes of the development planners. //////Across the modern world, landscape ecology is beginning to provide a scientific basis for landscape and natural resource planning and management. Landscape ecology is the study of the interactions between the temporal and spatial aspects of various components of landscape; these components include Abiotic (water, nutrients, energy flow etc), Biotic (flora and fauna) as well as manmade Cultural (urban infrastructures, recreational facilities etc) components therefore landscape ecology addresses the ecological processes affected by the spatial structure of a large area intervened by human activities or natural system. Since there is a wide scope of anthropogenic intervention, the landscape ecology is subjected to planning i.e. sustainable planning. //////Solid waste generation in huge amount is key feature of modern industrial and urban economic system where increasing the production is a prime goal. Waste management is the mechanism of collection, transport, processing, recycling or disposal of waste materials and is generally undertaken to reduce their effect on health, aesthetics or amenity. Waste management practices differ for developed and developing nations, for urban and rural areas, and for residential and industrial generators. Management for non-hazardous residential and institutional waste in metropolitan areas is usually the responsibility of local government authorities, while management for non-hazardous commercial and industrial waste is usually the responsibility of the generator.//////The banyan tree isn't there any more.

Along with mentioned sectors, different issues have come into the discussion but all were not included or prioritised accordingly during the recent process of updating NHP by current caretaker government.//////A vaccine that offers protection from the Human papillomavirus (HPV) that is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. Here is experts insight into this revolutionary cervical cancer vaccine.//////Women with inadequately treated asthma during pregnancy are at increased risk for premature delivery, according to a new study.//////Kidney transplantation means replacement of a diseased or missing kidney or failed kidney with a healthy kidney from another person, called donor. It is an operation also known as renal transplant (renal is another word for kidney). People who receive a transplant must take medication and be monitored by a physician who specialises in kidney disease, known as Nephrologist.//////It may be possible to be both fat and healthy, researchers reported recently. At least half of overweight adults, and close to a third of obese men and women, have normal blood pressure, cholesterol and other measures of heart health. And being lean does not necessarily protect people, either.//////Breakfast is a very important meal. When we are sleeping, we are also fasting for an average of about eight hours, so it is essential to break this fast. Although people who skip breakfast catch up on their energy requirements later in the day, they are unlikely to get all the vitamins and minerals that a simple breakfast can provide. Try porridge with honey for a wholesome but filling meal. Or you can go for Oats, or if you are running out of time you can try ready-to-eat fortified breakfast cereals.//////Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, a world leader in diabetes care has been ranked in the top ten for Worlds Best Corporate Reputations, says a press release.//////THE cross border ground attack from Afghanistan into Pakistan's tribal North West on September 3rd by helicopters involving commandos of the US Special Operations Forces to hunt down Taliban and Al Qaeda in their sanctuaries without Pakistan Government's knowledge has placed US-Pakistan coalition to fight terror under serious stress. It came three days before Asif Ali Zardari was elected President and was the main subject at his first press conference where journalists cornered him for his innocuous reaction on the attack. The US attack could not have come at a worse moment for Zardari who has a tainted image and little political experience and badly needs to create an image that he is not a US lapdog. It was left to General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, Chief of Army Staff to take the strongest stand against the US action, calling it a threat to Pakistan's sovereignty that would be met at any cost.//////THE 21st century arrived only eight years ago. There is no zero sum game in global power. If one rises the other falls.//////Washington had confessed that there was nothing like al Qaeda or WMD in Iraq during Saddam's time: occupation has invited Al Qaeda for a killing feast. Seven years of pounding on possible and suspected Al Qaeda connections has led to nowhere. The elusive Bin Laden and his terror outfit are still expanding from their hideouts. 'Either with us or against us' had forced Pakistan to be a reluctant partner and anti-American feeling is intense among the people of Pakistan today. Frequent bombing from North Africa to Philippine, in Europe and elsewhere tell, Bush doctrine is neither working in the front nor taking the people along. There should be a search for a new strategy that will keep people engaged not by force or threat but by shared values and gains. The new doctrine must make nations partners, not the collaborators of the strategy. //////Autobiographies are mostly written by people in powerful positions either to defend themselves from criticism or misconceptions about their work while in power, or to elucidate some good work not adequately appreciated or slurred over. Here, however, is an autobiography written by an astute, efficient and honest civil service officer, who at one time had been Principal Secretary in the powerful Prime Minister's Office (PMO), attached to two great slain Prime Ministers, Indira and her son Rajiv Gandhi. //////Overall development of a country cannot take place without the participation of its female work force. At a time when climate change and the role of forestation are the top agenda for nations across the globe, we cannot overlook the role of women in social forestry. Tahsina Akhter comprehends the dire need of national economic development by means of taking up the issue of poverty alleviation and the role of women in social forestry. This book delves deep into the issue, examining the role of social forestry in reducing the poverty of women in the rural areas of the country.//////A bookmark that I have states, Never judge a book by its movie. I think it is particularly apt for Bapsi Sidhwa's novel Water as it is based on the movie. Movies are based on books but this one's the other way round. The author was asked to write the novel in ninety days to coincide with the release of the movie. The story is dated 1938, with Gandhi's Ahimsa movement gathering momentum.//////Civil society. The term has now been around for a few decades, largely since the 1980s. Some sociologists and political scientists coined the term here in Bangladesh. The thought of civil society mainly originated, however, in the eighteenth century in Western Europe. But why and wherefore civil society in Bangladesh? //////
