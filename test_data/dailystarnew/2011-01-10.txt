Add to the gruesome murder of the boy (he was subjected to dunking in a bucket of water only because he saw his father being attacked by local criminals) the murder of a trader in Kamrangirchar. The body of the trader was found hanging from a ceiling fan. A few days ago, the decomposing corpse of a pesh imam was discovered in the city, with as yet no clear clue as to who was behind his murder. As a matter of fact, hardly a day goes by when some murder or the other is not committed in the nation's capital. //////In what appears to be breaking a gridlock in terms of local industries tiding over energy crisis on their own, the government has withdrawn import duty on furnace oil. This is a substantial incentive because it meant waiver on 37.5 percent levy on import. Given that paucity of gas has affected power generation that is critically dependent on this hydrocarbon, liberalising import of furnace oil or Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) looked somewhat unavoidable. More so, in a context where no one knows when government would be in a position to supply gas with appropriate pressure to industries to run their boilers and generators.//////Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan stressed upon the need for a spin bowling coach in the team, especially with the World Cup less than two months away, though head coach Jamie Siddons felt that there should be a limit to the number of coaches a team can have.////// How did it feel when you heard that you would play the 1999 World Cup? //////It was once a dry, hard as rock outfield, complementing the bouncy matting wicket fitted on its grassless face.

The new foreign currency exchange policy introduced by our government is very effective, but not in the case of students.//////The media is regularly flooded with news of fires in factories located in high-rise buildings. Why this is allowed? It is not the norm in the industrialised countries. Besides, factories are set up in the residential areas of municipalities, where factory buildings do not exist.

Given the fact that the existing supply of natural gas in the pipelines is tapering off fast and that we are yet to command the technology and financial resources to access the untapped reserves of gas in the offshore areas, the spectre of energy crunch will continue to loom large on the horizon. Are we really aware of the danger facing us? //////There was a sadness that enveloped him in the midst of that cheering crowd. As the truck carrying him and a whole phalanx of politicians and student leaders inched its way out of the old airport in Tejgaon, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman seemed tired after all those months in solitary confinement in Pakistan. More than that, he was clearly overwhelmed by the ecstatic manner in which his people, the newly freed Bengalis of his Bangladesh, were welcoming him home. It could have been a scene out of an epic tale. It could have been an image shaped by the imagination. It was neither of those. It was truly happening before us. We had watched history being made in Bangladesh in the nine agonising months of Pakistani repression. And here, right before us, stood the man whose inspirational leadership had finally thrown open the doors of freedom for us.//////
