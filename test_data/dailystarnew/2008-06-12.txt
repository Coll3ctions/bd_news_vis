We hope that she will now be provided with adequate medical treatment abroad for her health-related problems.

We remember too the fact that she was denied bail by the courts and so was compelled to remain a prisoner. //////THE finance and planning adviser's proposal to clamp a 25 percent import duty on pictorials and drawing books for English medium schools is not based on sound logic. First, the very thought that such imported books have contents that run counter to our social and cultural values is, we believe, erroneous or at best short-sighted. The standard English books are used worldwide as study material and don't contain anything that might be treated as objectionable. If the decision makers really found something against our mores, or not appropriate in our social context, they should have pinpointed it. Exchanging views with all the stakeholders, that is, the teachers, academicians, parents, importers etc was also necessary before putting an additional financial burden on the students and the parents.//////IN her June 2 court appearance, instead of making statements about her corruption related charges, Khaleda Zia gave a political speech in noticeable violation of court proceedings -- a maneuver that would be tantamount to "contempt of court" in US courts. //////WHILE Burma counts the cost of the deadly Cyclone Nargis, and international aid agencies struggle to get relief supplies to more than two million victims left homeless, time is running out for the country's rice farmers if they are to plant their new crops before the end if the main growing season.

extent and sometimes creating misunderstanding among the rival countries. Technology has paved the way for watching things much more closely and clearly. Umpire's wrong decision makes them unpopular and controversial. A few years ago, the use of technology in cricket became a controversial issue. But what the cricket world has seen since then is more shocking and embarrassing. Watching your favourite team losing terribly because of umpire's 'wrong decision' is painful. My question to those who are against the use of technology is, if technology can be used in certain cases such as detecting the ball whether it crossed the boundary or not or confirming a doubtful catch or run out etc, why can't it be used for deciding LBW or an edge of the bat or such other questionable/confusing matters? //////Why Pakistan and Bangladesh (former East Pakistan) are unstable politically, even after decades of experimentation? The backgrounds are different.//////Eco-management means the development and exploitation of natural resources in a sustainable way which is environment friendly. Change and development are essential to human progress, and exploiting nature in this process is not a new phenomenon. In this march of progress, we have overexploited nature and caused harm to its environmental quality. However, we actually realized the problem only during the last fifty years when it started to be grave and there was a hue and cry throughout the globe. That there is a link between development and environmental issues was first raised in Stockholm Congress in 1972 and then at Rio Conference in 1992 and Rio+10 in 2002 as a global forum and it has been realized that development is also possible by making peace with nature. This has been termed as sustainable development. It needs a point of balance whereby the present need may be met without jeopardizing the environmental quality of nature for future generation. //////ABMS Zahur is factually behind the times when he writes (5 June, Point Counterpoint) : "However, even now a majority of the stranded Biharis would like to be repatriated to Pakistan because of cultural affinity with Pakistanis, separated families, and lack of educational facilities, employment and civic amenities that are available to regular citizens in Bangladesh."//////It is mentioned in Article 96 of the constitution that a judge cannot be removed by the president without the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council. But, by means of interpretation of Article 97, the president has the power to remove the Chief Justice without any recommendation of the council. According to Article 97, if the president is satisfied that the Chief Justice is, on account of absence, illness, or any other cause, unable to perform the functions of his office then the president shall appoint a new Chief Justice. In this provision, by the term any other cause there is the reservation of power of the president to remove the Chief Justice. //////The main cause of the high rates of road accidents leading to huge loss of lives and properties is the violation of traffic rules and lack of enforcement of speed limits. Some of the drivers are crazy about overtaking one another at high speed. Bigger vehicles dominate the roads, while smaller ones are compelled to yield to their whims. //////In the past, we had to select a candidate whom we didn't want to select. They were nominated by those corrupt political parties . There was no option to refuse those candidates. //////Refer to the letter Save Bangladeshis in Bahrain by Mohd Mafiz dated 4th June. It is heart breaking to hear such news from a Middle Eastern country where most of the hard working expatriate Bangladeshis live. I have seen how Bangladeshis are treated by the Bahrainis-- 95-98% of the Bangladeshi population in Bahrain are labourers. Most of the Bengalis are inhumanly treated by Bahrainis. They treat them like slaves. But we Bangladeshis just keep ourselves quiet thinking about the families.//////Just as I was getting ready to rebut your editorial entitled Regulate the Number of Rickshaws DS 22/5/08, I was overjoyed to read Prof Nasreen Khundker's excellent letter in DS 30/5/08.

It is has been prepared by a caretaker government (CTG) for a full financial year from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 (FY09). But this CTG will be in office for only half the life of the budget it has prepared.
