An atmosphere should be created so that open discussion can take place at all tiers of society, including at the family level. //////Parvez Musharraf has finally hung his military uniform to add a civilian touch to his second term in office as the president of an embattled Pakistan. Discernibly it was a move to appease his opponents at home and abroad, while he maintained his political power. Musharraf gave an emotion-charged speech after taking oath when he vowed general elections on January 8 and lifting of emergency on December 16. But the international community did not perhaps fail to notice that underneath his civilian clothes he remained as rhetorical as before, all the time refusing to acknowledge the slogans and clashes on the streets of Pakistan. In a brazen show of self-importance, he called his standing down from the army top post and taking oath as the civilian president as a milestone in Pakistan's transition to democracy. He went on to boast that the January elections would go ahead come hail or high water. //////In the Bangla calendar, 'Aghrayan' is a month we wait for. It heralds the season of harvesting. Optimism and happiness is reflected in the many rituals associated with the festival of 'Nabanno'. It is a time of joy not only in the villages but also in the urban areas.//////We always find that international communities, including Bangladeshis living abroad, donate generously whenever a mega-disaster hits Bangladesh. According to recent reports, around $550 million have been pledged by donor nations, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. However, even after one week since the cyclone Sidr hit Bangladesh, millions of people in the remote areas had received little or no relief at all. Roads and ferry ghats were damaged by the cyclone. The only mode of immediate and fast relief delivery to these remote areas is helicopters. Bangladesh Armed Forces do an excellent job as first responders to this kind of disasters. Our soldiers and officers are a dedicated and competent lot, but their mission is often hobbled by lack of sufficient logistical support -- most importantly an adequate number of helicopters for fast delivery of relief goods to the remote and disconnected areas.//////Yet another November 4, the date to commemorate the adoption of our constitution just went by unnoticed, uncelebrated. However much it cuts across the political divide as a statement of enduring values of the constitution, we patently failed to dedicate this date as Constitution Day for the last thirty-six years of our nationhood. It is a pity to find this date disappear from the consciousness and conspicuously missing in the array of our designated national dates. Our inadequacy to comprehend the significance of this date in our civil life refrained us from according it a national status like most other nations. (In US Constitution Day is an official holiday). Beyond our commitment to republicanism, the exigency of the Constitution Day is vividly underlined when viewed against our national track record defiled by military take-overs and one-party rule, ironically imposed by an elected government, a classic example in the realm of our constitutional history.//////Chittagong completed a seven-wicket victory over Barisal in the sixth round while the other two matches petered out to draws on the final day of the 9th National Cricket League four-dayers across the country yesterday.//////Wasim Jaffer closed in on his second double-century as India exposed Pakistan's bowling limitations to reach a healthy 352-3 on the opening day of the second Test here on Friday.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club's first of two charity matches ended in a draw when the Dhaka giants shared a goalless 60 minutes with Sylhet XI at the Sylhet Stadium yesterday. //////Tamim Iqbal will not play the three remaining one-day matches for Bangladesh Under-19s in Pakistan as he returned home yesterday to join the national camp for the New Zealand tour.//////Sri Lanka will not be sidetracked by the record feats of Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidaran when the first Test against England starts on Saturday, captain Mahela Jayawardene said.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has roped in government cellular phone operator Teletalk as the title sponsor of the three-match charity series for the cyclone victims.//////M Asafuddowlah won two swimming events in the veteran group swimming competition on the opening day of the Dhaka Sports Carnival at the Uttara Club Swimming pool. //////Exactly four years and four days after they had last beaten a major Test-playing team, Zimbabwe turned the clock back at the same venue, and against the same opposition. What must have seemed like a gentle start to their African tour turned into a nightmare for West Indies, as Zimbabwe pulled the rug from under their feet during a stunning 31-run win in the first ODI of the five-match series in Harare. The match was set up by a spirited batting performance, which gave them a challenging total of 274, before the bowlers stifled the runs so effectively that West Indies fell short despite Shivnarine Chanderpaul's unbeaten 127.//////Shaun Pollock made a battling half-century as South Africa recovered from a poor start in the second one-day international against New Zealand at St George's Park Friday.//////The changed nature of the pitch from green to barren brown has forced England to delay naming their team for the first Test against Sri Lanka starting on Saturday.//////Until Friday, Muttiah Muralidaran was a peripheral presence on England's tour of Sri Lanka. He popped up briefly at the Nondescripts ground on Sunday to grab a sneak preview of his opponents, but by and large he's been keeping a low profile, recovering from a tough tour to Australia and leaving others to speculate about the unique challenge that he poses. But there's no hiding from the hype any longer.//////Leading Australian players want the annual home triangular cricket one-day series dumped from their playing schedule, reports said Friday.//////Chandigarh Lions, lead by former New Zealand star Chris Cairns, emerged victorious in the first match of the Indian Cricket League at Panchkula yesterday.//////Sri Lanka bowler Chaminda Vaas will retire in 2008.//////Mohammad Yousuf, the Pakistan batsman who recently pulled out of the Indian Cricket League (ICL), is set to face an arbitration hearing in Mumbai on December 15.

The government also gave a nod to the Export Development Strategy Paper (EDSP) for the same term. The Finance adviser is quite optimistic that the new policy will facilitate rapid import of essential commodities and thus help keep the price level stable. However, maintaining a single digit inflation level will likely be a major challenge for the government in the coming days. On the other hand, further liberalisation of import policy, along with a few other measures suggested here, may be needed to boost export growth.//////With special interests in Japanese brands, quality conscious consumers yesterday thronged Japan Trade Fair 2007 at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. //////India has announced a third package of sops in less than a year for exporters in textiles, leather, handicraft and marine products sectors hit hard by sharp appreciation of the national currency Rupee. //////The International Monetary Fund urged Sri Lanka on Friday to adopt tough measures to cut subsidies, especially on fuel, in order to salvage the economy. //////India has surpassed China for the first time as the most attractive long-term manufacturing base for Japanese companies, which are particularly keen on the auto sector, a survey said Friday. //////Oil prices fell Friday on expectations that Opec will increase output next week and on fading concerns of a supply disruption from a U.S. pipeline fire.//////Japan's Sharp Corp. announced Thursday a 200-million-dollar investment in solar cells as manufacturers compete for a slice of the burgeoning market for alternative energy products. //////The United States announced Thursday that China has agreed to eliminate a dozen WTO-banned subsidies that have given Chinese exports a broad, unfair trade advantage. //////India's blistering economic growth is expected to show a slowdown when second-quarter GDP data is released Friday, with tighter monetary policy dampening consumer spending, analysts say. //////European Union and Traidcraft have teamed up to provide small and mid-level farm producers at village level with business and price information to help them grow businesses.//////The head of the World Trade Organisation said on Friday he hoped to finally secure a deal in the Doha round of international trade talks by the end of 2008, some four years later than initially scheduled. //////Canada and Russia agreed Thursday to expand economic cooperation in areas of agriculture, fisheries, nuclear power and trade financing, officials said. //////The number of jobless in Germany has dipped to the lowest level since 1992, data released Thursday showed, due to the rebound of Europe's biggest economy and the impact of unpopular labour market reforms. //////The US dollar/BDT market softened a little this week and the BDT gained some ground against the USD.

Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/Aids infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific held in Colombo, on August 19-23, 2007.

Having an uncle or aunt - first or second - in Calcutta (Kolkata) was not something worthy of mentioning boastfully, while having them in New Delhi or Bombay (Mumbai) might cause someone's eyebrows to be raised high. But the best was having one in London. So my paternal aunt, at her crooked age, in Delhi, my maternal uncle, senior in age, in Mumbai now, and today's Mama, some three years older to my mother, were like people from fairy tales. Mama is seventy five now, and I then felt unworthy at not having had a chance to meet him.//////So Norman Mailer is dead, giving up the ghost on November 10 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.

Institutionally, it is about two thousand years old, but out of institution, it is as old as Egyptian and Mesopotamian traditions and older than the Greek and Roman ones. Daoism developed through a natural course of events from the practices of life of the common people. So it is naturalistic and simplistic in its outlook, which reflects the profound human aspirations in a balance of pragmatism and spiritualism. Daoism has incorporated all the essential elements of traditional cultures of China deep-rooted in its soil patterning localised socio-psychological traits. That is why it is said, If you want to know China you must know Daoism.//////Mumtaz Renu Farook Uz Zaman's writings and thoughts are based on the human touch, indeed based on truth, purity, beauty and the divine touch of love.

More credit goes to him as he has done that difficult job particularly on the school of Greek philosophy.//////Lonely Planet is a name of the biggest institution in the world travel industry.
