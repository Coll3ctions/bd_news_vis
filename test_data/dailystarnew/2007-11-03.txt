By all means, this is a historic beginning of an arduous task and it has to be further accomplished to perfection by the future governments. //////The National Institute of Trauma and Orthopaedics, known as the Pongu Hospital, is the largest of its kind in the country. Physiotherapy is one of the key elements of services provided at the institute. Whereas the two regular physiotherapists currently working at the hospital are of the opinion that with the number of patients arriving on a daily basis, the hospital needs as many as 50 therapists, it is shocking to find that acute dearth of physiotherapists remains at the hospital. One only has to mark the statement by Kazi Humayun Kabir, Professor and course coordinator: if a patient gets proper physiotherapy then the possibility of full recovery in most cases is 80 to 90 percent -- so vital is the health service that this hospital can provide. //////Contradictory signals and diverse reports continue to create headlines on a regular basis about the state of health of the Bangladesh economy. To say the least, it has been a mixed bag.//////It was a long march, all right. But there were no clenched fists, no display of weapons, not even loud slogans. It was not like the long march in China to conquer the country for communism. It was a peaceful demonstration of some 28,000 landless from different parts of India. They had waited quietly in their villages and forests for a peaceful solution to their deprivation. //////The Bangladesh bureaucracy is linked to the administrative reforms in India between 1919 and 1947. The India Act of 1919 defined the responsibility of provinces and introduced the rudiments of responsible government into its administration. The provinces got full autonomy only under the Government of India Act 1935 which made provincial legislature wholly elected and transfer responsibility to council of ministers accountable to legislatures.//////Barisal's left-arm pacer Sajidul Islam took advantage of overcast conditions to the maximum to rattle Dhaka on the first day of the third-round four-dayers of the 9th National Cricket League at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday.//////Switzerland's Martina Hingis announced her retirement from tennis here on Thursday after admitting she is under investigation for a positive test for cocaine.//////Martina Hingis, the world's youngest ever women's number one tennis player, ended her career after a successful comeback on a sour note when she admitted testing postive for cocaine.//////Left-handed batsman Salman Butt hit form with a sparkling half-century as Pakistan warmed up for the one-day international series against India with a six-wicket win over a local side here Friday.//////Bangladesh clinched the kabaddi bronze medal in the Asian Indoor Games, according to a message from Bangladesh Kabaddi Federation (BKF).//////Sri Lanka fought back after an early innings collapse to claim four Queensland wickets on an eventful opening day of their three-day tour match at Allan Border Field here Friday.//////India's cricket manager Lalchand Rajput feels the absence of Pakistan pace spearhead Mohammad Asif would not make much of a difference to the one-day series, which is likely to see a tough contest.//////Shoaib Akhtar's erratic temperament has often come as embarrassment to Pakistan but captain Shoaib Malik and coach Geoff Lawson on Thursday threw their weight behind the enigmatic speedster and hoped the pacer to fire on all cylinders in the cricket series against India.//////When a champion stumbles, you offer a comforting arm on the shoulder, not a thump on the back.

By the time they were in their thirties, they were already well-known men whose reputation for political sagacity came to be known and felt in the hamlets and villages of Bengal. By their early fifties, they were dead. They who once constructed history were simply done to death in a ruthless betrayal of history. In Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmad, M. Mansoor Ali and A.H.M. Quamruzzaman came embodied the thought of politics being a vehicle that could only advance the cause of a people. These men, close to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and therefore the repository of his confidence, took up the cause of a people in grave peril and caused them to create and sustain belief in themselves. The struggle, they argued, was all. For it was struggle that led to great attainments.//////In the history of independent Bangladesh, November 3 is a black day, commemorating the killing in Dhaka Central Jail of four national leaders who were key personalities in executing our national liberation. So we mourn today their sad demise and register a strong protest against such heinous act for the 32nd time. //////While terrorists are lying low for the present, maybe for tactical reasons, the threat of terrorism to our admittedly pluralist society has by no means decreased. Realists continue to impress upon the imperative of devising an all-pervasive counter-terrorism strategy for tackling the menace. A non-government think-tank has in the recent past prepared a counter-terrorism strategy after considerable deliberations, and has drawn the attention of appropriate quarters for embarking upon the required course of action.//////The recent crackdown on drug barons in the most posh area of the city with huge seizure of about 130,000 yaba tablets, beginning with the arrest of four kids belonging to some very affluent families in the city, has exposed the ugly side of wealth and power acquired in the past days of the political government. //////Let's say you are surfing the net on your PC or writing something using MS Word. The only software that your PC is running is the browser and the office application along with some operating system processes. The rest of the computing power of your PC is just sitting idle. Now think of a solution: your family members or office colleagues could make use of that vast unused computing power of your machine without interrupting your work an iota. //////The term "printer" usually brings to mind a bulky device that rests on our desk. Printer manufacturers have now developed cost-effective, lightweight and easily moveable printers for home users. This advancement, however, is not smart enough for portable devices -- smart phone, PDA and the like. //////Google Inc. is setting up a distribution network for social networking applications, adding a new twist in the Internet search leader's brewing rivalry with rapidly maturing startup Facebook Inc.//////In the nascent stage of its history, Ri Pnar, or the Jaintia Hills as it is known today, was only a disorganized cluster of villages without a ////// (1) or //////(2). Each village kept to itself under its own administrators -- elders and headmen -- and consulted each other only in matters of trade. At that time there lived, in a hamlet called Umwi, a certain farmer known as Woh Ryndih, a man alone, spending most of his time toiling in his field from morning till night. Like all other men in the hamlet, however, he was very fond of hunting and fishing and often indulged himself in these pastimes whenever the opportunity presented itself.//////On 25th October the newly instituted 2007 Man Asian Literary Prize Shortlist was announced. Five authors out of a previous long list of 23 made the cut:////// (translation by Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih with illustrations by Pankaj Thapa); Delhi: Penguin India; 2007.//////When the literary editor of ////// suggested that I write about my 'research pains' experienced in the pursuit of my PhD, my response was 'let me endure the pain in its entirety.' Then I remembered the hardworking new-man Lopahkin from Chekhov's ////// who jibed at 'the perpetual student,' Trofimov, saying: Pushing fifty, still a student, eh? Trofimov was not fifty. Neither am I! But we share the plight (albeit delight) of being 'perpetual students.' I suppose it is hard for many pragmatic minds and brisk businessmen to understand the pleasure of this type of pain. After all, the rationality that informs the pain/pleasure principle is based on irrationality. So be warned, these are going to be fragmentary thoughts, splintered from a brain preoccupied with polishing a dissertation and preparing to defend it.//////You reeled me close to you once//////To youth's arced flame//////Then flung me to the winds.//////I float on air, and laugh  a spring breeze//////You pulled me back on an invisible string, then let go//////Oh God how you toyed with me//////You voyager of my depths!//////Kite strings cross-cutting each other//////Snapped me free from the spool//////Liberated and carefree, doubts gone//////On tornado-typhoon-cloud-lightning winds//////I drift and drift...//////Seeing me sail by neighbourhood boys//////Gather on rooftops-fields-lanes//////To pluck me if they can...//////Since George W. Bush came to power in 2001, the relationship between Iran and the United States have plummeted to a new low. On January 29, 2002, President Bush gave his Axis of evil' speech, describing Iran along with North Korea and Saddam Hussein of Iraq as an axis of evil and warning that the proliferation of long-range missiles developed by these countries were of great danger to the US and that it constituted terrorism. The speech caused outrage in Iran and was condemned by both reformists and conservatives.//////The political parties should thank the Election Commission for persistently prodding the government to allow some sort of dialogue. As the country is yet to recover from repeated natural calamities, underperforming economy and restive campus, one must appreciate that it is a bold decision to allow indoor political parley. If politicians could trust and respect each other and follow the rules, there would have been no need for restrictions, much less for reforms. The institution of the caretaker government (CTG) is unique in a sense that it is an acceptance of unreliability of politicians by themselves. Without being cynical one must concede that the CTG is the outcome of failed politics. Call for reforms is not a political issue but moral challenge to the nation; B. A. Choudhury is right to demand a national government and a decade to weed out the dirty culture: but he also knows the old faces are no more acceptable to the people.//////A joint exercise between US Marines and the Bangladesh Air force (BAF) commenced from Wednesday last and continued for a week. This is by far, the largest joint exercise with US defence forces since starting of such operations in 1990. The exercise will provide valuable training for aircrew and maintenance personnel. Such operation will enable the US Marines and BAF participants to sharpen air combat skills, improve procedures for sustained operations, as well as promote closer relations and enhance interoperability. It complements a number of other exchanges and exercises intended to develop closer defense ties between the US and Bangladesh. One of the aims of this type of operations is to optimize and develop necessary standardized procedures for the interoperability - that is to say, the possibility for common, trouble free deployment.//////The fourth edition of ////// is made up of two distinct parts: the original text, made up of seven chapters, and an addendum, consisting of the remaining three. Although the author informs us that it is revised and enlarged, the reader could only be sure about the expanded portion, but not about exactly where the revision has taken place. The introduction to the latest edition offers no clue, although it does say that it contains new chapters on the various global, regional and national developments that have occurred since the 1970's. //////The war of 1971 remains a point of reference for Bengalis, especially those with first hand experience of the conflict as it built up and then moved towards a denouement. With men like Khalilur Rahman, the War of Liberation was at once a distant affair, fundamentally because they were away in West Pakistan when the Pakistan army launched its genocide in occupied Bangladesh in March. And yet there was a closeness, in spirit and temperament at least, where comprehending the issues involved was concerned. Rahman was a senior Bengali officer, a brigadier, in the Pakistan army and stationed in West Pakistan at the time. It certainly was not the best of times or the best of places for any Bengali to be in. Like Rahman, there were hundreds of other Bengali officers and sepoys stuck in a place from where all the salvoes were being fired at their compatriots in occupied Bangladesh. And then there were the thousands of civilian officials, employees and their families stranded in what was definitely hostile territory for Bengalis. Briefly, West Pakistan after March 1971 was a place where Bengalis were treated with open disdain and, almost always, as traitors to the country Jinnah had built in 1947.//////Vikram Chandra's massive novel (as long as Tolstoy's War and Peace) is not only an extraordinary narrative but also a brilliant commentary on India's underworld of crime and international intrigue, mostly during the past dozen yearsin short, unforgettable. If you pick up the book, you'd better be prepared for a long haulnot simply reading for a couple of nights. Fortunately, given its length and the dozens of significant characters, Chandra has provided a "Dramatis Personae" at the beginning, which you can flip back to and use to place a character into context.//////They stood facing each other, looking into each other's eyes. The eyes held still, they seemed to forget even to blink. They saw beyond the eyes, they recognised each other as the ideal soulmates meant to be together on the wheel of eternity. They had a vision of a long winding road on which they were walking, hand in hand, walking towards a bright light; the light of a new life. //////This happens to be a highly readable book from one who has been closely involved with Bangladesh's economic planning in the country's early stages. Indeed, Islam was one of the leading proponents of economic autonomy for East Pakistan in the 1960s. That background should be good enough for readers to get their hands on the work.//////
