This renewed attention of the central bank towards this mostly labour-intensive sector will help stimulate the sector better and create employment. //////THE emphasis that has been placed of late on improving traffic conditions in the city is surely welcome. It is a sign of how seriously the authorities, especially those in the traffic police department, are looking at the problem. And now that they have come up with plans for a three-lane based movement of vehicular traffic, all we can say is that we as citizens desperately hope the measure yields results. Indeed, that there should be different lanes on the roads is a given anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, in our instance, the idea of lanes, despite being there all the time, has not quite worked owing to a multiplicity of reasons. Such a condition cannot any more be permitted to continue, for reasons that should be obvious.//////ONE with nine zeroes on the right looks quite tidy as a figure, but it gives an uneasy feeling when FAO says that the number of hungry people in the world has reached a historic high of more than one billion.

In terms of population, Bangladesh is the 7th largest country in the world whereas in terms of GDP (PPT, Per Capita Income Parity) its position in the world is 196. About 45% of the population lives below the poverty line and each year natural calamities like devastating flood, cyclone, drought, etc. push millions of people below the poverty line. A big percentage of its 70.86 million labour is either unemployed or nominally employed. Under such a grim socio-economic condition what is the impact of remittances on the socio-economic development of Bangladesh?//////I found a big difference between the perceptions in India and Pakistan on the anniversary of 26/11, the terror attack on Mumbai. India reconstructed the 60-hour tragedy and vowed not to "tolerate" any such act in the future. Pakistan said that it had expressed its horror adequately in the past and that by dwelling on it India was avoiding a composite dialogue. And there was a string of familiar accusations and counter-accusations.

We will talk about the freeways, new roads, subways, metros, circular rails, waterways and other lollipops WHEN THEY ARE A REALITY, not before. //////I am glad Tony Blair did not get the job. He had alienated a lot of British Muslims by the invasion of Iraq on falsified intelligence report and Labour lost the Tower Hamlets constituency (last Labour MP, Oona King) to George Galloway's Respect Party.

This is a lingo that American teenagers use to express their sense of frustration, however the adults use it too, when they do not or can not make a sense of complicated or semi complicated issues. Most of the time Bangladeshis' frustration would be expressed as the country is screwed up, I don't give a damn, let them do whatever they want, Allah is displeased with us etc. Almost all the comments would send a signal of learned helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, irritability.//////The recent verdict is a milestone in our history. But why not revive the Zia murder case ? //////Commonwealth Scholarship is perhaps now the only important and prestigious scholarship available to our young scholars.

The outcome differs in no substantive manner from the previous rounds. Perhaps Barcelona witnessed the highest number of non-papers, which are in-session documents issued informally. The decision to carry some of these non-papers to Copenhagen for consideration, without adopting any substantive decision is symptomatic of lack of any progress. The expectation is a new deal, particularly on mitigating climate change. Judging by the outcomes of the eight negotiations since adoption of the Bali Action Plan in December 2007, the prospect looks bleak. //////THERE was a fundamental decency in Nurul Islam. And it was there because of the dignity, the sense of self-esteem, which defined his personality. He was a politician in the very real sense of the meaning, which is as much as to say that he was a reminder of the values we once lived by. As one of the foremost of spokesmen for the toiling classes, he was second to none. There was the authoritative about him. There was nothing of the authoritarian you could spot in his long career in the political circuit. He was a bold individual to whom the idea of power was essentially the idea of trust. Politics, in that very broad way of looking at it, was a responsibility that brought the state and its citizens together, through the formulation of social welfare programmes and then pushing them on to fulfillment. It was never about seeking or winning office.//////Cisco, one of the leading networking, communi cations techno logy and services companies in the world, seeks to strengthen its foothold in Bangladesh. //////Computer businessmen of Bangladesh tend to call it a 'Year of Notebook' with growing popularity of the small computers.
