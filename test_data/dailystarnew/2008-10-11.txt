Sarkar's lucidly-paced piece fills in many of the gaps of Haque's life--the writer grew reclusive and tired of Dhaka literary life in the last twenty years of his life and his life became shrouded in the mystique of authorial silence. Rafiq Kaiser elucidates the author's fondness for characters who were lumpen, rootless and of what used to be called the 'lower orders,' while Enam examines the modern element in his fiction. A previously unpublished short story by Mahmudul Haque, ////// ('Shelter') has also found its welcome way in the short story section, which also contains an alluring contribution (//////') by Papri Rahman, whose use of 'vernacular' language and raw-earthy idioms is striking.

It is coordinated by International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) under the VISION 2020 global initiative. This year's WSD was on October 9 and it focuses on the ageing eye, and vision impairment in older people. The headline of the theme "Eyes on the future" and strap line "fighting vision impairment in later life" recognises  in a world where populations are ageing and individuals are living longer, blindness from chronic conditions are also on the rise. By 2025, there will be twice as many as older people worldwide as there were in 2000.//////There are many reasons why hundreds of thousands of people across the country become blind. The unfortunate tale is that the majority of them suffer from either preventable or easily curable blindness. Proper intervention or surgery can help them to regain the precious gift of sight.

Bhutto should know it for with his own political career, he has established this truth. Even after his death, his name lives, carried by his daughter Benazir and now her husband who has become Pakistan's President based on the legacy of Bhutto. Two military dictators have failed to wipe out the legacy.//////INDIAN diplomacy has displayed maturity and has acted in accordance with the economic aspirations of the country. This becomes evident upon a careful analysis of the following myths and realities that surround our 'strategic concerns.'//////Serajul Islam Choudhury was one of the luckier ones in 1971. Or was he? He moved from place to place, from one home to another, in the knowledge that the Pakistan army would not let him out of its sights. He could have done the easy thing, something that quite a few expected him to do. Syed Sajjad Hussain and Syed Ali Ashraf, both of whom had preceded him in teaching and both of whom had feelings distinctly kindly toward him, offered him teaching positions in West Pakistan. The idea was simple: Pakistan's military establishment needed proof that Choudhury was loyal to the state, that indeed he had nothing in common with the rebels who had opted to wage war for an independent Bangladesh.//////Poor people around the world have the same tale to tell, the tale of poverty. The poor can be poor to a level when they cannot get any poorer. This is a tale of such a family, a family that is torn between its wants and abilities.
