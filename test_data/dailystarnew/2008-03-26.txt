on this day, the call went out to the people of Bangladesh and to the outside world that this nation had opted for freedom. Even as the Pakistan occupation army went about its genocide in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country, the Bengali nation could envision that there was light at the end of the tunnel for them. It was surely a long tunnel and as yet there was little to show that freedom would come any time soon. But that the Bengali political leadership had taken a decisive step in guiding the nation towards freedom boosted the collective morale of seventy five million Bengalis and conveyed to them a sure sense that the attainment of freedom was but a question of time.//////WHEN during the last fifteen years MPs belonging to different political parties could not reach consensus in matters of national interest, here they are united now in defence of a material gain.

He entered with the stage set for heroism and sparkled briefly as New Zealand began their long and unlikely trek towards salvation.

He does not have the capacity to control his temper. What a shame! I am a cricket lover from the very early days of Pakistan, and used to follow cricket on radio and TV and also attended matches in the field at home and occasionally abroad. I can definitely place myself with the cricket fans of today. They are enjoying endless opportunities to watch cricket all over the world and almost all the year round. These fans are lifeblood of our cricket They support the good performance and look critically at bad performance of the team and individual players. This is a normal pattern of relation between the players and the fans. I strongly feel that the players who showed bad temper and manner in public should get punishment from the appropriate cricket authorities as provided in their laws.//////I would like to thank The Daily Star for printing a photo of pedestrians crossing the street (March 24, 2008, Star City) right under the new foot overbridge at Bangla Motor. This is a picture that can be seen anywhere in the capital where there is a foot overbridge. Traffic police, though present, act like helpless spectators. This increases the death/injury risk to the pedestrians, causes disruption of the traffic flow and also add to the pollution as the engines have to run longer than necessary. Thus, the final impact comes on the fragile economy which has to bear the burden of all the associated additional costs.//////About a week back we were suddenly stuck to a big headline carried in almost all the dailies of the country. The meaning of the headlines was the same, but some looked at first sight extremely worrisome. //////We are facing the serious problem of pollution because of the large-scale industries and the negligence of people.

All our plans and programmes are for the development of the urban areas.//////There are thousands of passengers travelling from Sylhet to the Middle East and London. Many a time they do not get tickets at the time they want to fly. Moreover, the present fares of Biman and other airlines are too high. Recently, the Civil Aviation Department accorded permission to a foreign airline to operate cheap flights from Chittagong to the Middle East which has proved to be highly successful. There is no reason why the same type of flights should not be operated from Sylhet to the Middle East. Apart from being convenient to passengers, this will boost manpower export.//////Nowadays, my mom seems to suffer from constant headache and grumpiness. Why? Well, it's not actually easy being in her shoes and run around with me to the coaching centres each and every day. Also that includes having to stand in the middle of the road for like hours and shouting, "Aye CNG! Dhanmondi sathas number road jabe?". It's unbelievable how I have to get out of my house each day almost one and a half hour early to reach the coaching centre due to the traffic jams that increases the time of the route by twenty to thirty minutes and bless the "CNG-wallas" who refuse to go wherever you ask them to. //////I was there on 7 March, 1971 in the Race Course Ground. As a young medical student of Dhaka Medical College, I went there to hear (frankly)as to what would be the future course of events, I wanted to know, if I could finish the first professional MBBS exams that were postponed after March 1. I had a dream like all middle class young men to have a prosperous future, but by the time I heard him out, all dreams were overtaken by only one dream, that is to fight for a free, democratic, and exploitation free Bangladesh. With that end in my mind, I later traced my way like millions of my countrymen to freedom struggle.//////Pakistan's new government will review the country's role in the US-led "war on terror," former Pakistani premier Nawaz Sharif said yesterday after holding talks with a top American envoy. //////At least 13 Tamil Tiger rebels were killed in fresh fighting in northern Sri Lanka as government warplanes bombed a suspected rebel arms dump, the defence ministry said Tuesday. //////The first parliamentary election in the history of the last independent Himalayan kingdom, Bhutan, produced a landslide with voters decisively rejecting the party led by the king's uncle.//////Iraq's radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr yesterday threatened a countrywide campaign of civil revolt as security forces battled his militiamen in the southern city of Basra. //////The Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to constitute a special team headed by former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director RK Raghavan to probe 10 crucial cases of 2002 communal carnage in Gujarat.//////Faced with the dramatically spiralling costs of wheat, rice and corn, the World Food Programme has made an unprecedented appeal for at least $500m (250m) to help it continue supplying food aid to 73 million needy people this year.//////Makhdoom Amin Fahim, senior vice chairman of the PPP, stepped down as the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD) chairman on Monday.//////Sitting at the Bengal Gallery and reminiscing over the Liberation War days, veteran artist Qayyum Chowdhury recounts his participation in 1971 with the activists from the then Art College -- with Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin and Quamrul Hassan. He takes pride in his paintings and brush and pen sketches that he made after 1971 delineating the freedom fighters and the portraits of the tortured and abused. He brought in the river and the boats too in the backdrop, at times, clinging to his penchant for the idyllic. However, the focus of his artwork on canvas and paper were the bold and driven freedom fighters -- both men and women.//////Kazi Arif needs no introduction. A distinguished recitor, TV show presenter and also an architect by profession, he was a freedom fighter in the Liberation War. On the occasion of the Independence Day, Arif shared his memories of the war with The Daily Star. Young, bold and resolute to free the country, he enlisted into the league of soldiers ready to take on the opponent; prepared to make necessary sacrifices. //////Banglavision will air the special play Fera tonight at 8:25 pm.
