As they regain freedom, self respect and dignity, we shared their every step as we were there. Obviously our events of 1971 are (were) far deeper and bigger to be comparable. However, closer to the present events in Egypt was our victory over autocracy in 1990 that saw the end of another army man's rule. Like Mubarak, Ershad had robbed us of freedom and of dignity, but fortunately did not (better still, could not) rule for 30 years.//////Egypt's new military leadership yesterday vowed to pave the way for democracy and abide by international treaties as the hopeful country celebrated victory on the day after Hosni Mubarak's overthrow.//////A parliamentary body's decision to introduce a bill to reinstate the constitution's articles repealed or altered by the first military regime has raised questions about execution of the two-decade old Supreme Court verdict on the eighth amendment. //////The World Cup is now all but underway, with the first batch of warm-up matches completed yesterday across the three host nations -- Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka.//////The seasons circle the earth. Something of a spring is to be deciphered in their orbit, for that is one way of observing their graces, their movements, as they add substance to life on this planet, indeed to the concept of time and space. And that precisely is what you notice this morning on your doorsteps. There is a sudden profusion of colours around you, that timeless scented presence of flowers in a season redolent of the floral and therefore the melodious.

The fall of Hosni Mubarak eighteen days after Egyptians began to come together on January 25 to bring his regime down is remarkable not just for the people of Egypt but also for the region as a whole. Rare has been the instance of people rising in revolt against entrenched regimes. With both Tunisians and Egyptians now having proved the determination with which they can do away with governments that do not fulfill their expectations, it is clear that a new era of popular participation in the politics of the Middle East is at hand. //////Conditions of most of the public hospitals in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country are far from satisfactory.

Von Braun was the leader of the rocket team which developed the V2 ballistic missile for the Nazis during World War II. In 1960 Von Braun by then in the US, received the mandate to build the giant Saturn 5 rockets. So he became the chief architect of the Saturn 5 launch vehicle, the super booster that would propel Americans to the Moon.

For doing this all that is needed is intention and sincerity. It is evidenced from the actions of all successive governments that it is neither interested nor sincere in solving the problems the nation is facing. For example, let us take a look at the name change game of the party in power. What purpose will it serve the people at large? The answer is nothing.//////Thanks to our Finance Minister for his timely intervention to quell the capital market which has been going through a rough-and-tumbled weather due to massive slides in the prices of almost all shares. The minister came up with proposals on how to bring reforms and revitalise the market and safeguard the interest and confidence of the investors. We earnestly hope that his concrete and meaningful suggestions will help to alleviate the hitherto dwindling market and bring stability and confidence, especially amongst the retail investors. His package of reforms is indeed laudable provided those are implemented immediately and monitored correctly on a regular basis. His scraping of book building systems for the time being is also a good step which has been until now manipulated by a few companies. //////When Bangladesh was world champion as the most corrupt society for several years in succession, there was hardly any ripple and hue and cry.

I appreciate the attached tag with the news which read It seems that the Pakistani authorities have taken lessons from history!//////Internationally famous person Dr. Yunus is facing false cases one after another. If a person like him is the victim of false cases, imagine the condition of the common people. I have seen criminals are using court to punish the innocent people and I think everybody of the society share my experience. If people working in our judiciary want to improve its image they should come up with agenda aiming to stop false cases. Responsibility of judiciary is to help the helpless people, but unfortunately, helpless people of our country are the victims of our judiciary. For example, thousands of farmers of our country lost their lands to the land-grabbers and developers and our government, politicians and intellectuals have been watching this crime for decades. Poor farmers cannot raise their voice because land grabbers and developers can easily put them in jail by filing false cases. Rape victims and acid victims hardly get justice in this country because criminals are usually rich (financially) and can hire famous and efficient lawyers. //////The questions on the editorial page of DS on 27 Jan 2011 have prompted this letter.//////The world has to pay attention to its troubles and the plight of the poor when the poor finally rebel.

We know a lot of companies have sprung up in our country within a very short period of time. It is needless to quote those companies' names that have been alluring the literate, half-literate and illiterate persons. They seduce people to invest and in return offer more than double of the real amount.

In arts and literature, particularly in music, stars have a completely different significance altogether. Stars witness romance blossoming; under their twinkling gaze, lovers take vows to remain together forever. When those promises are broken, unrequited love becomes ballads -- often a broken heart's musical grievances to stars, for they had seen it all. Heartbreak aside, flickering stars could remind one of the glimmer in the beloved's eyes.//////Noted singer-musician //////Spain recognises Portugal as an independent nation.//////Last week, three unrelated events worldwide drew our attention.

However, as in the past, the present MPS also leaves many questions unanswered. This article seeks to raise some of them with a view to drawing BB's attention in drafting future statements.//////Dictators are a curious breed. When they seize power, they have little time or patience to remember the fate that might have befallen autocrats in earlier times and in other countries. Of course, some men, like Hosni Mubarak, do not come by power through seizing it but by being placed there through constitutional means. //////MR friend stanley is the richest guy in the world.
