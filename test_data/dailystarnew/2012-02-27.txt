The very attitude of the prime minister to the opposition party is very negative which is quite contrary to the democratic norms.

Forget about cheap and irresponsible election slogans like "ten taka rice per seer" or "job for every house" etc, we are observing that they are bringing up controversial issues one after another like elections under government in power, dividing Dhaka city in two parts and so on with an evil design to stick to the power and creating an environment of instability, chaos and confusion.
