Only a few months ago, a group of influential and powerful elements had as many as 15,000 keora and bain trees cut down in the Sitakunda region. They simply walked off with the loot. Now comes news of the same region falling under new depredations. On Sunday night, about 5,000 trees were felled across a half kilometer area of the forest belt at Sonachhari coast. The obviously sinister intentions of those behind the deed can be noticed from the fact that the whole exercise was initiated and completed during the night, the better not to have the authorities know about the act. And by the time the robbery was detected, the damage had been done. Although a handful of people linked to the quarters involved in the act were arrested, one can hardly say it helped matters any.//////OUR highways continue to be death traps. The figure of people killed while traveling during the recent Eid holiday is fairly representative of what happens on such occasions every year.

Generally, they use formal languages and manners in case of communicating in the university arena. Recently, I had an opportunity to be part of a picnic of private university students where the scope of flexible interaction was comparatively high. Our young generation obtained the opportunity to present themselves in their own character. I was also interesting to know their taste of 'smart' music, languages, gestures, postures and facial expressions. Time and technology have changed them. //////Transparency International (TI) is an international non-governmental organisation fighting corruption and trying to raise public awareness on the issue.

It seems that the authorities are at a loss as to what to do. Although Chittagong is much better than Dhaka in this regard, still during rush hours, the jam takes a serious turn. Indiscriminate parking of rickshaws and other vehicles, mushroom growth of coaching centres and kindergartens and narrow roads, and construction of many multi storied buildings are contributing to gigantic traffic jam in the city. Besides, ever-increasing roadside tea-stalls and hawkers are also a major factor in increasing traffic jam in the city. //////It is observed that all entry points of Chittagong town are always burdened with traffic jam. It gets worse on the eve of weekends, holidays and opening days. Recently "Colonel Hat", the entry point from rest of the country, is experiencing long jam daily. The biggest annoyance at this point is caused by town service buses, human haulers and tempos as they keep waiting on road for passengers blocking 3/4th portion of the road for long, as if they do not care anyone on earth and the long queue behind them due to their blockade does not matter much. The second point is that rickshaws come from the wrong direction to cross the main road. There is a market named "Colonel Hat" for daily essentials and people ride rickshaws to enter and exit from wrong sides and to cross the road. Another reason is using the road as parking slot by three wheeler autos, rickshaws, trucks etc.//////The man who expects comfort in this life must be born deaf, dumb & blind -- Turkish proverb. All citizens if born as stated above there would be no need for any civic amenities. But very few are so. The rest of the people can hear, talk & see & hence this write-up.

Now I am worried about getting back my deposit money since I did not get the plot. I sent US dollar 2000 with the application and as I am in the US, it's not easy for me to obtain refund application form from Dhaka. Although Rajuk is claiming that the refund application can be downloaded from their website, the truth is you can only download refund application for the Purbachal project and Rajuk has not posted refund application for Uttara project in their website. I am pretty sure they are not even aware of it. I have tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with Rajuk officials via email, but has not received any response so far.//////Human beings cannot be judged from the external aspect of geographical territory, colour, language, race, generation and wealth.

He further said that he would allow computers inside parliament soon after providing computers among the members. These are necessary steps towards making a Digital Parliament. We observe that while passing any bill in parliament, the Speaker asks parliament members, Jara eai prostaber pokhe assen tara 'Ha' balun. A chorus sound 'Ha'comes from the floor. Again Speaker asks,Jara eai prostaber be-pokhe assen tara 'Na' balun. Again in a chorus sound 'Na, louder or feeble comes out from the floor. After hearing the sound the Speaker declares three times  'Ha'/'Na'joye jukta hoyeche. Thus the bill is passed. The process does not appear to be in line with the road map of digital Bangladesh. Can't the process of passing bill in parliament be digitalized? In the electronic display board votes of parliament members can be displayed with the summery result and be recorded and saved. By viewing the electronic display board, visible to the television viewers also, the Speaker will declare whether the bill is passed or not. Thus, in the road map of Digital Bangladesh, the Digital Parliament can well start functioning in advance of time schedule.//////It seems that people owning motor vehicles have to give some cash in the form of bribe just to avoid the stress and hassle of handing over their vehicles to law enforcement personnel.//////We will be celebrating our 38th Victory Day on 16th December, 2009.
