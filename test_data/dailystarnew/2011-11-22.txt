Time was when Bangladesh was home to as many as 7,500 varieties of rice, proof of which comes through the preservation of these varieties at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute as also at the Gene Bank of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. To put it more simply, these varieties of our staple food, known by their poetically fragrant names of Banshphul, Laxmibilash, Dudhbinni, Radhakrishna, Chinisagar and many others, are, for the most part, exhibits that hark back to a more glorious time in our history. But time, again, has its own ways of dealing with nature, indeed with life itself. //////Delawar Hossain Sayedee along with other collaborators kept a Hindu girl confined to her father's house at Parerhat in Pirojpur and raped her day after day during the Liberation War, the International Crimes Tribunal was told yesterday.//////India is doing its best to track down two fugitive killers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and extradite them to Bangladesh, Indian Home Secretary RK Singh said yesterday after two days of talks in New Delhi with his Bangladesh counterpart.//////The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday recommended that the government increase fuel and power prices, as pressure subsidy is eating up the social and development expenditure. //////Posing as law enforcers, different gangs continue to mug people in the capital as the authorities are yet to find effective ways to prevent such crimes. //////The National Board of Revenue (NBR) yesterday asked people to invest black money in stocks without fear, in an effort to boost the crisis-ridden capital market. //////The High Court yesterday declared illegal the military-backed caretaker government's decision to allocate Dhaka Club a piece of land of Suhrawardy Udyan for a golf course.//////A worker of a Sitakunda ship-breaking yard in Chittagong died yesterday morning after falling into a 50-feet elevator shaft of a scrap ship.

But that does in no way allow us to bask in complacency because like it or not, in spite of the religious and social mores that exercise certain restraint on people's behaviour in our country, existence of other causative factors makes most people above a certain age potentially susceptible to the disease. //////The case of a teacher indiscriminately beating 37 students of Class 6 at a school in Rampura is appalling. While this particular case has made headlines, corporal punishment remains a common practice at schools and madrasahs in Bangladesh, with hundreds of students being subjected to it every year. This is despite a High Court ban on corporal punishment at educational institutions last year and a rule earlier this year declaring corporal punishment as constituting a clear violation of children's fundamental rights to life, liberty and freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The HC last year also asked the government to show cause why its failure to prevent such incidents -- including through the framing of laws and guidelines; investigate such allegations; and prosecute and punish the perpetrators, should not be deemed a violation of rights guaranteed under the Constitution. //////Bangladesh take on Sri Lanka today in a crucial play-off match of the ICC Women's World

It seems that these treatise began as notes on (or summaries of) Aristotle's lectures at the Lyceum in Athens. He continued to edit and revise them throughout his life, as his views evolved, but never brought them to a state of completion for publication. Subsequently they were edited and organized into "books" by his students, and then the whole corpus was transmitted through a series of transcribers, translators, and commentators.//////Bigfoot researcher and biologist John Bindernagel claims his research group has found evidence that the Yeti (a Russian "cousin" of the American Bigfoot) not only exists, but builds nests and shelters by twisting tree branches together.//////Scientists are reporting development and successful initial testing of the first practical "smart" material that may supply the missing link in efforts to use in medicine a form of light that can penetrate four inches into the human body.

He wrapped a wooden rowboat tightly in waterproofed leather and had air tubes with floats to the surface to provide oxygen.
