Kalinga forest and the conjoined Rema forest covering an area of about 1,795 hectares form the biggest tree-cover after the Sundarbans. But Kalinga forest today has been reduced to a pathetic silhouette of its former beauty. And it is beyond comprehension that what poachers could not do in last ten years, they have done it in just one year! //////TRUTH and justice prevailed on 19 November, 2009.

After extending their first innings to 264, thanks largely to Kamran Akmal's enterprising 70, the bowlers immediately got down to business, exploiting the conditions and the huge flaws in the techniques of the New Zealand batsmen, bundling them out for 99 and taking their overall lead to 229 by stumps.//////Dwayne Bravo's third Test century ensured a healthy total for West Indies but their fighting efforts were overshadowed by a controversial umpiring review that ended Shivnarine Chanderpaul's push for a hundred.

Such is the amazing work of e-mails! Meanwhile, the instructions that accompanied the write-up in case it was to be acknowledged, was to use a pen name reflecting my desire to be anonymous. Then one day, to my utter dismay, so to speak, while thumbing through the pages of the newspaper on the net, there it wasmy verses and my name staring right back at me! My first venture in creative writing and I had no clue it was accepted. So, I decided to deal directly with Mr. Z, and hence the discourse began. My first e-note to Mr. Z with introduction, thanks and another poem attachment: //////Khadija Shahjahan should have lived long, for there was a poetic soul in her. The heart breaks when poets die. When I first met her at the offices of the Morning Sun sometime in the later part of 1990, she spoke to me about her daughter Mithun's poetry she wanted published in the newspaper. Khadija was smart, beautiful with that charming smile lighting up her features and spoke well. I suggested that she go into writing too, for it was obvious she had ideas she could disseminate to people. She said she had arrived from Britain and would be staying with her children, a son and a daughter, in Bangladesh for sometime. She said she would like to keep in touch with me. I gave her my telephone number and was pleasantly surprised when she called a few days later to let me know she had indeed written a small article for the Morning Sun. I asked her to have it sent to me. She brought it over herself.//////On a lazy fall evening last week, the song Bhalobashi, bhalobashi, ey shurey kachey durey.. came floating down while I was fiddling with my TV clicker and switched to a Bengali channel. A very familiar Tagore song for me, rendered over the ages by various artistes, Indrani, Bonnya, Sadi, you name it. What captured my attention this time were the last four lines of the lyrics: //////Let him forget, in a million famines//////I shall not forget, I shall not forget ever//////When suddenly the doors of the closed room are wide open//////The maddening wind blows//////The gloomy sky fills with bride-seeing golden light//////Or when sends calls to the forests//////The first shower of monsoon//////And the suddenly raised fragrance////// of maiden Shambar comes from the grass roots//////And the village of the Shabars in the dale //////Becomes hazy on the cloudy days//////December 1, 2009 was marked as the 21st anniversary of World AIDS Day.

But it is not just about what we eat too much of. It is also about the foods we should learn to add to our table every day.//////PRIME Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to the United States was the first such visit by a Head of State/Government under the Obama administration. The hosts used this point in the media to single out the visit as a special one. Likewise, the state banquet given to the Indian Prime Minister, where over 300 guests were invited, was also mentioned in the media in great details to underscore the care and the attention that the hosts have taken to make the visit remarkable. The President's choice of words to praise India and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made it obvious that he was also trying to underscore the visit as more than an important one. He referred to the usual pitch that marks such visits between the two countries; theirs being the two largest democracies in the world. This time, the fact that both Obama and Manmohan Singh have only recently assumed office (Manmohan Singh for a new term) and would have a long time to implement agreements reached between the two countries was added to the usual pitch to underscore the visit's importance.//////IRAN has ignored the UN Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions over its refusal to suspend enrichment in exchange for trade benefits, or grant unfettered IAEA inspections meant to verify it has no clandestine nuclear arms programme.//////AFGHANISTAN president Hamid Karzai is faced with a great challenge in tackling the myriad problems of his country after he was sworn in as the president for the second term following a controversial election. He has come under mounting pressure from the Western nations and the United Nations to free his administration from massive corruption and other vice in one hand and bring stability in the war-torn nation on the other. Hamid Karzai wants more troops to fight the Taliban, who are now more active in some parts of the country. And President Obama has complied by promising an additional 30000 troops. The crucial question is will Karzai be able to deliver what is expected from him? //////"'The gods created man,' said Srikanda Stpathy, 'but here we are so blessed that we - simple men as we are - help to create the gods.' This is how one of the stories in William Dalrymple's latest book ////// begins. This seeming contradiction plays through most of the nine stories in the book: a nun who sweeps the steps before her with a peacock fan when she walks so as not to inadvertently step on any living creature, ritually starves herself to death; a dalit untouchable not allowed to use the water of the very well he helps to dig, is revered as a god for three months of the year and illiterate villagers who are still the guardians of an entire oral culture, able to recite a 4,000 line epic by heart. //////Edward Kennedy's death a few months ago was cause for the celebration, in a manner of speaking, of a dynasty that yet exercises a hold on the public imagination. It does not really matter that the dynasty, as it used to be, does not happen to be there any more. That the mystique of the Kennedys has become frayed over the years is no more in question. But, again, there is that certain reawakening of sensibilities, of memories, every time the Kennedys are mentioned. That explains the grandeur of Edward Kennedy's funeral. The fact that he was the only Kennedy brother to survive to ripe old age (he was seventy seven when he passed on) did little to stop the flow of a revival of popular interest in the clan. The Obamas and the Clintons and the Bushes and the Carters made sure, through their presence at Kennedy's memorial services in Boston, that the clan was remembered.//////
