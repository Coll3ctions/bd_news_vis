I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments of the Court, and personally believe that the military has absolutely no right to usurp political power and impose its arbitrary rule on the people. The Court's stern admonishment to previous military regimes, and its acknowledgement that some of the decisions and undertakings of those governments may be liable to criminal prosecution, should send a clear cautionary warning to future military authorities who may covet state power. In this regard, the intentions of the Court are commendable, and its posture laudatory. But, the situation becomes a bit problematic if one considers its implications. It may be entirely possible to argue that these judgments, by blurring the distinction between the political and the constitutional, indicate a judicial over-reach of rather spectacular proportions that may, ultimately, jeopardize the very democratic and constitutional principles it seeks to protect. //////Ihave written previously in The Daily Star, and addressed number of seminars and gave TV interviews pleading the case for the recognition of Kosovo by Bangladesh based fundamentally on our national interest and ideals of our liberation war. Regrettably, this has not yet been done due to objections raised by Belgrade supported by a number of countries including Russia. //////Tiger, symbol of the beast and beauty, is a threatened species worldwide. Recent estimate shows that tigers only occupy 7% of their historic Asian range and about 4000 are left in the wild (Dinerstein et al. 2007). Aside from this alarming tiger status worldwide, Bangladesh possesses a relatively good number of them, mostly concentrated in the Sundarbans. Joint India and Bangladesh tiger census-2004 (using pugmark counting) estimated that there are 419 (121 male and 298 female) tigers in Bangladesh Sundarbans. The number may vary, as many scientists are sceptical about the accuracy of pugmark counting. However, it is beyond doubt that the size of the tiger population in the Bangladesh Sundarbans would be between 300-500. Being the biggest member of the cat family the Bengal tiger is popularly known as Royal Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) for its unique hunting behaviour and spectacular physical appearance. //////The mean temperature of the world has been rising, snow in the hemisphere and even on mount Everest is melting, sea level is rising, salt water intrusion is reducing the availability of fresh water, coastal region is facing more and frequent cyclones and storm surges.

It is his birthday, she tells me. Yes, I remember. I remember too the chaos in which this pre-eminent of composers was buried by his friends. He died young and poor, almost bereft of everything beautiful that life could offer him. Having spent a lifetime, albeit a brief one, showering happiness on the world through his music, it was his fate to be thrown hastily into his grave because a storm threatened to disrupt the last rites. You could say his remains were swiftly deposited in the grave, in unseemly manner. And then his friends moved off.//////Looking at the azure-whitish canvas of the skies heralding the season of autumn, one feels crispness in the air subduing the wetness of monsoon, sunlight staying young more or less for the whole day. Then there appears, rather unconsciously in her, an assemblage of emotions evoking the past, relating to the present and looking forward to the future. Not that they all appear at one and the same time, but in the cubicles of her heart they take their turn, oftentimes overlapping. As she ponders, one thing becomes obvious to her --- that in this mental state of hers, she feels a strong desire to hear some sounds, some voices, some music emanating from nature, some others from human voices. She is afraid that since her auditory sense is deprived of much of its yearnings, those in the passage of time could be obliterated. //////Mamma said you would be my God//////Or at least the next best thing.//////When Daddy gave away my hand//////I was led to believe never to miss him.//////Everyone assured how you would be//////A friend and just like a brother to me//////I could share the laughter and loss//////As if you are not the dignified boss.//////These days, the most common reason to seek medical advice is fever.

Political parties have been given time till the end of the month to submit their list of candidates. Earlier, the military regime had tactfully ensured that Nobel Laureate Aung Saan Suu Kyi was kept out of the contest by extending her house arrest till November 2010. To the regime's satisfaction, the extension led Aung's National Democratic League (NLD) to decide against registering for the elections that resulted in the party being banned. The NLD opted against registering to give the international community the clear message that the next elections would be anything but a new strategy to entrench the power of the military.//////WHILST war is not likely in the foreseeable future, the likelihood of its occurrence further down the line has increased in the light of Admiral Mullen's statement.//////WASHINGTON: The US government slapped sanctions on four people and eight organizations accused of aiding North Korea's government through illicit trade, the Treasury Department said.//////I had earlier posted an item about my meeting with Amartya Sen on Facebook. After all, for the past six to seven years of my life I have revered Sen's philosophical ideologies in the manner of a devout one. I also realized that in Bangladesh very few professors actually make excerpts of Sen's writings compulsory, which is a sad occurrence. Within the past year I was lucky enough to be able to meet with Amartya Sen thrice: at a conference, at a discussion and signing of his new book, ////// and at a dinner where I was honoured to be able to hold a long discussion with him. Here I will draw on my understanding of him and his subject to give a brief review of his book, //////THIS book is a real page-turner. You flip open to the first page and at once you fall in love with the protagonists Marilee Roe James and Tate Briggs Holloway. Both are kind, polite and hardworking folks. In fact, the reasons to like them could go a long way. They have just announced their engagement in the local newspaper, The Valentine Voice. Tate is the editor of the newspaper and Marilee the associate editor. The coming wedding is the big bang for the neighbours who have known them for years. Both Tate and Marilee are taking second chances with married life and are looking forward to being happy. They are in anticipation of the one in a thousand chance that life is giving them. They are two love-hearts caught in the quiet life of a small town in Oklahoma, USA.//////FOR much of his journalistic career, Edgar Snow was shunned by mainstream America. The reason was simple. He had befriended the Chinese communists long before Mao and his men made their way to power in Peking and had indeed afterward continued his association with them. This was the era of the Cold War; and with Joseph McCarthy in mad pursuit of what he called communists and communist sympathisers in the United States, it was only natural that Snow would come under suspicion. The writer could not, of course, be nailed. But the hostility prevailed, all the way up to his death in February 1972. In one of the great ironies of history, the very communists Snow had eulogised over the years in works such as the one under review were now the same communists Richard Nixon was meeting in Peking. //////IN Mehrdad Baladi's disturbing novel, Houri, there's a brief moment at the beginning that is emblematic of much of the subsequent story. As the narrator returns to his native Iran and the airplane enters Iranian airspace, Flight attendants hurried to remove wine and whisky from trays. Men rushed to rinse the stink of alcohol from their breath. Women donned dark hejabs to hide their hair and curves, scrubbed makeup from their faces. Passengers were bracing for an inquisition, or something worse. Even from thousands of feet above, and an hour before the plane landed, I caught a sense of the intolerant terrain waiting below.//////
