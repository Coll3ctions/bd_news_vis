The news came to us as a shock. It was hard to believe that Jagjit is no more and we would no longer enjoy his enthralling ghazals with his heavenly voice. With his death, not only India, but the whole subcontinent has lost an outstanding music personality. His contribution to the music world is immense and so the loss is irreparable. Despite his death, his presence among the music lovers of this subcontinent as elsewhere will remain ever resplendent through his songs. Myself an ardent admirer of Jagjit Singh, I used to listen to his ghazals frequently. One of his Bengali songs Beshi kuchu asha kora bhul, Bujhlam ami eto dine is one of my favorite numbers. //////Reference my previous letter on the new Battery Operated Rickshaws, I have the following further observations://////While we are complaining of electricity shortage in our country, the drought and famine in Somalia have killed more than 29,000 children under the age of 5 in 90 days in southern Somalia alone, according to U.S. estimates. The UN says 640,000 Somali children are acutely malnourished, suggesting the death toll of small children will rise! As many as 750,000 people could die as Somalia's drought worsens in the coming months, the UN has warned, declaring a famine in new areas. Somalia is crying! The kids of that country don't want to have an expensive video game nor do they want a nice dressthey only want food! They only want to live! They only want to smile! But the UN's Food Security and Nutrition Analysis unit (FSNAU) has some bad news for them. They say 'In total, 4 million people are in crisis in Somalia, with 750,000 people at risk of death in the coming four months in the absence of adequate response'. As a kid myself, I feel very sorry for the Somali kids whose lives are now in danger. May Allah help them. I pray and hope Somalia will survive the disaster!//////How moving was the letter of young Shafeen Mahmood (Class 1X) titled Young generation need guidance published in this column on October 12, 2011! Typical of young people everywhere, he is crying out to be given 'the basics of life'. They are told they are the 'future' and that they must study but no one tells them how to live! Their 'treats' are fast food and a visit to the shopping mall but where are the playgrounds and trees to climb? Television is useless. They know that life is more than 'getting good grades' and using the Internet. Where, he demands, is 'guidance'? I hear him asking us, Where is 'North' and the moral compass so I have something to make my own decisions with?//////The Daily Star carried an advertisement from the Bangladesh Cricket Board - inviting EOIs for a sports-based television channel. It seems strange that a board that is yet to rise to its primary responsibilities (and beyond structural politicization) - is venturing into a commercial media business. It's not even clear if there has been a feasibility study to establish the financial viability of such a channel. Given the proliferation of TV channels in the country - most with dreadfully-low levels of viewership, proving 'viability' of a sports-channel should be the first objective. In the face of impending financial challenges, such ambitious projects should be carefully scrutinized and shared with private and public stakeholders. //////Education is one of our fundamental rights recognized by our constitution. But it is still a matter of great regret that we have completely failed to ensure the quality of our education in most of our educational institutions. What lie behind our deteriorating quality of education are the illegal interference of politics and unethical practice of favour giving by the authority, in the recruitment policy in particular. In many institutions, the illiterate persons head the authority. Sometimes the managing committees are constituted of persons whose educational qualifications are below the SSC level. Recently, we have come to know from the report of a national newspaper that the chief of the college committee was the night guard of a bank. So it becomes a matter of great concern when the authority evaluates an educational institution as part of their business project. An illiterate businessman can be a patron, but he can never be the head of an educational institution. Only a qualified and educated governing body can determine, manage and frame a fair recruitment policy for the welfare of an educational institution.//////The other day while watching a documentary on the facebook about the massacre of unarmed civilian population of Dhaka, the then capital of East Pakistan, made by a British journalist, then a resident of Hotel Sheraton, made me feel sorry about the plight of the helpless people and also about the beautiful Dhaka lost for ever.//////As my grandfather lives in Birisiri, I often go there to visit the village. Whenever I go there, I enjoy the beautiful and eye-catching scenery of century-old rain trees standing beside a road in Birisiri. But I am really shocked to hear that those century-old rain trees are being cut down ignoring a high court order. Reportedly, these rain trees were planted by GBC (Garo Baptist Convention). Without their permission some so-called political leaders are chopping down the trees in the name of road development. Yes, the road is dilapidated and needs to be developed further but I can not find here any reason behind the felling of trees. I urge the authorities concerned to take necessary steps as soon as possible to stop the cutting of trees and let the trees live for centuries.//////There is scarcity of public carriers in the capital. The scene showing thousands of black heads waiting to get a chance to get into a bus, which is very common all day long and even at midnight, at Jatrabari, Janapath intersection (Syedabad), Gulistan, Paltan, Shahbagh, Karwan Bazar, Farmgate, Newmarket and many other points of Dhaka city, supports the statement. Traffic jam and huge quantity of dust are the added miseries. What are our policymakers thinking about the matter? Are they aware about it? Do our politicians have any concern for bringing comfort to people's life?//////Polythene bags were banned by the previous government. A law has also been passed for preventing the environment degrading polybags. Unfortunately, like many other laws, this law also could not see the light of implementation. Polythene has a very adverse impact on bio-diversity and the environment.

So, our sincere request to the law-enforcement agencies and officials of the Department of Environment (DoE), please play your role in stopping the use of this hazardous substance.//////Afghan security forces and their Nato allies have launched a new push against the al-Qaeda-linked Haqqani network along the troubled Pakistani border, senior defence officials said yesterday.//////Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit yesterday arrived back in Israel following his release from five years' captivity, as part of a prisoner exchange deal.//////International mediators will meet separately with Israeli and Palestinian officials on October 26 in Jerusalem to try to revive direct peace talks that fell apart more than a year ago, the United States said on Monday.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed Libyan forces who ousted Muammar Gaddafi and vowed support for a democratic transition, on a surprise visit to Tripoli yesterday.//////Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin laid out the case for his return to the Kremlin on Monday and suggested President Dmitry Medvedev's role in any future government was not yet a done deal.//////Heavy rains pounded Central America yesterday, where more than 80 people have died in mudslides and flooding over the past week as swollen rivers destroyed bridges and submerged roads.//////Syrian troops on Tuesday mounted the fiercest raids in the Damascus region of their seven-month crackdown on dissent, a human rights group said, as neighbouring Turkey welcomed opposition leaders for their first formal talks.//////Plugging gadgets into a socket in the wall, or loading them with batteries - or maybe even unfurling a solar panel - is how most of us think of getting electricity.

America's Republican presidential hopefuls assail protesters for being "jealous" and "anti-capitalist." Bankers in Wall Street and Europe say the financial institutions that the protesters regard as plunderers are not responsible for their plight. Some have branded the grassroots movement as being anti-success. It could be a label that would silence the protests as only the rant of unmotivated and unfocused people -- yes, putatively the jealous.//////The interaction between the people of Bangladesh and China, which are only about 300 km. apart, dates back centuries. They celebrated 36 years of establishment of diplomatic ties on October 4, this year. //////In recent years, there has been an increased interest in regional economic integration in South Asia.
