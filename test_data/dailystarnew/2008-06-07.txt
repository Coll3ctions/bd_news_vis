Local artist of the district, Hosne Zaman inaugurated the programme. //////THE historic Six-Point Demand or the Six-Point Formula has been widely credited as the "charter of freedom" in Bangladesh's struggle for self-determination from Pakistan's domination. Indeed, the six-point movement in 1966 was the turning point in our quest for independence. On June 7 in 1966 the Awami League called a countrywide hartal in the then East Pakistan to press home the six-point demands. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with many others was arrested. Since then 7th June is observed as the historic six-point day.//////Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the then General Secretary of the East Pakistan Awami League (EPAL), had personally submitted the six-point program to the subject-matter committee of the All-Party Meeting of the opposition political parties of the then Pakistan in Lahore on February 5, 1966.

Wildlife researcher Dr. Raghu Chundawat commented in a BBC interview and the producer of the BBC film the Ganges Dan Rees also wrote letters to The Daily Star. I thank all for their interest and comments and I will try to discuss about the responses which are relevant to many of my comments and quotes. //////One Thursday, the weekend I usually long for, when I was readying myself for a family get-together, my cell phone vibrated. It was Fazal, who had been my classmate at Dhaka University in the early eighties and who had been a frequent visitor to my house in Libya when we were there as expatriates. He said that he was dying to see me and would like to come over with his family that evening. Since we were supposed to go out, my wife Sufia had already changed into something formal. As I put off our visit, she changed out again back to the casual blue sari she had been wearing. Even though there were no visible signs of reaction, I could sense a touch of resentment in her as she said: You could say that we had a party. Why do we have to compromise always? Why?//////Dinesh Chandra Sen (1866-1939) was an antiquarian and esteemed scholar who wrote the first history of Bengali literature and conducted pioneering work in Bengali folklore. He helped set up the Bengali department at Calcutta University, where he was Ramtanu Lahiri Professor. He was a tireless researcher, compiler and collector of Bengali folklore, chiefly in the form of East Bengal's gitikas, or folk ballads. Among his prodigious and original contributions to Bengali folklore is the four-volume ////// with its priceless collection of a total of fifty ballads. The first volume of the series contained what has famously come to be known as the Mymensingh gitikas. //////On this centenary birth year of Manik Bandhapadhya (born 19 May, 1908 died 3 December, 1956) the issue of ////// under review has three lead articles on him, with Kamruzzaman Jahangir detailing the novelist's development by following the path of his novels, and noting the salient features about them, including Manik's innovative use of language. Here it might be interesting to point out that one of the noticeable features about this article is Kamruzzaman's own linguistic style, with its widespread and no doubt deliberate use of English words within his Bengali text ('internal,' 'lifestyle,' 'serious,' 'style,' 'total,' 'develop,' 'specific,' etc. spelt in Bengali), and which may be signifying the renewing of English as a source of loan words for our mother tongue. Among other interesting pieces are two poems by long-dormant Shahid Quadri (//////' and 'Biplob'), and ////// is to be congratulated if it succeeds in nudging this New York-based poet towards greater productivity. The other thing of specific interest is the translation of a Sajjad Zahir short story from his //////, a collection of his writings. Readers today may not know much of him, but Sajjad Zahir was one of the founding members of the Progressive Writers Association during the 30s, which left its mark on all Indian vernacular literature. He was also one of the contributing writers of the famous Angaray collection of Urdu short stories published from Lucknow in 1932, which provoked the blood-wrath of conservative Indian Muslim society then.//////A concert at Rabindra Sadan, Amjad Hossain's playing at Nandan,//////A play at Shishir Mancha, something at the Academy too. //////Stand at Kolkata's hot-shot culture spot and sip a hot-shot cup of tea.//////Look around, search for known faces, nod when you see one//////Say//////Stand just so beneath the stairs or the tree so that everybody notices you,//////That you're a culture spot regular, they see,//////That even after the ten-to-five you're here for culture, they note,//////That despite domestic troubles culture you are close to, they realize,//////So that they see your cotton punjabi, bag slung on shoulder, appreciate the sari//////Silver-colored metal dental fillings contain mercury that may cause health problems in pregnant women, children and fetuses, the Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday after settling a related lawsuit.//////The International AIDS Society (IAS) yesterday urged government and fellow civil society leaders attending the upcoming UN High Level Meeting on AIDS to address the gap between commitments and results on universal access to HIV prevention, care and treatment interventions.//////Doctors are not absolutely sure why honey heals but they are learning new things about honey everyday.

This reminded me of my own experience with export targets as an Ambassador. My first tryst with export targets came in Egypt when the Commerce Secretary expressed disappointment in a letter after my Embassy failed to meet the target. That depressed me but not for too long for soon I learnt that the Embassy that topped the list as the most successful Embassy was one in the Middle East that was headed by a non-career Ambassador, a former private college Principal, whose main concern was politics with the Bangladeshi community. In Japan, in the space of a few months, I was once congratulated by the Commerce Secretary for surpassing the target but reprimanded the following quarter when the Embassy fell short. In four years in Japan, I was congratulated and reprimanded on export targets without realizing why my Embassy failed or "succeeded! The strange fact was that there was really no tangible reason for such failure or success.//////THE hallmark of the Bush administration is not to engage in diplomacy with America's adversaries. During his visit to Israel in the second week of May, President Bush criticised Democratic Presidential contender Senator Barack Obama's readiness to pursue diplomacy with the so-called 'perceived' enemies of America. The President called the strategy as 'appeasement repeatedly discredited by history'.//////NATO and the European Union need to support each other's operations with greater pooling of their capabilities, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told a June 3 gathering of officials in Brussels at an event sponsored by the Security and Defence Agenda think tank.//////The Defense Department's procurement system is failing to deliver U.S. troops the weapons they need while running up nearly $300 billion in cost overruns, a government auditor warned June 3.//////In less than six months, Saab Barracuda has delivered prototype camouflage systems fitted to the Australian Army for the M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks and M88A2 Hercules Armoured Recovery Vehicles, giving them higher survivability on the battlefield. //////Literature on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has been copious, especially in the last decade. Analyses of his life and politics --- and do not forget that he began to loom large over our political horizon from the mid-1960s onward, a position that has only been strengthened over time --- have continued to delve deep into the personality and leadership qualities of the man. For all the attempts made by his detractors since his assassination in 1975 (and those detractors have been many and vicious), Mujib has remained even in death a pivotal force in Bangladesh's politics. His place in history assured, there is today an endless interest in assessing all that he stood for in his life. That is certainly reassuring, given the many instances between his fall in 1975 and the rise of his daughter Sheikh Hasina to power in 1996 when he was sought to be airbrushed out of Bengali history. Those attempts have clearly not succeeded, as these books under review would suggest.//////I first read ////// in its original form many years ago when I was a first-year student at Dhaka University. I was eighteen at the time, I was desperately in love and it was the girl who had laid claim to my heart that gave me a volume of collected works by Tagore and suggested that I read it. Little did I suspect the hidden message that she may have wanted to convey at the time! She cried as she gave it to me, I cried as I read it and we both cried afterwards as if the banks of the mighty Jamuna had erupted and overwhelmed our tender, young lives with waves of bittersweet sorrow. Melodramatic bordering on the absurd, it felt as if our lives had been torn asunder despite the fact that we both sat there holding hands, bunking class and casually shelling peanuts on the grounds of Modhu's Canteen. //////The word no one wants to hear: Genocide. Germany and six million victims.//////The mammoth contextual complexities, structural heterogeneity, and functional diversity render modern parliaments no easy subject of research and exploration. Dr. Taiabur Rahman has ventured to explore, usually with verve and insight, a number of major challenges and issues surrounding the operation of contemporary parliaments in the three South Asian democracies of Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. The main focus is on parliamentary committees -- especially on the role they play in holding the executive to account in these countries. Notwithstanding the growing emphasis on and repeated attempts to ensure such accountability, ensuring 'government accountability through parliamentary control' has, thus far, proved to be one of the most elusive goals for politics and society in South Asia. Dr. Rahman's long pursuit in searching for the ways and means of developing an enabling democracy in this region has produced a series of research articles; and the current volume represents his untiring zeal for and continued commitment to the search.//////
