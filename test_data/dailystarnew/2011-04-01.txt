As a result, the amount of revenue collected annually is too low compared to the population's actual potential to pay taxes. Small wonder the government has to meet the budgetary gap through borrowing from banks and foreign aid. //////A sense of history is the foundation upon which a society finds a niche for itself in the global scheme of things. In Bangladesh, given the various distortions which have crept into our history, inculcating a sense of history in the young is of seminal significance. That is why the government move to provide a fifteen-volume work on War of Liberation free of cost to nearly 17,000 school and colleges is welcome. The initiative toward this laudable exercise was of course taken by the last caretaker government, for which it deserves credit. It is our expectation that the present elected government will eventually fulfill this onerous responsibility of bringing our young population level with the history of the country, particularly in relation to the War of Liberation and the events that preceded it.//////Sri Lanka's coach Trevor Bayliss says his team can defeat favourites India in Saturday's World Cup final despite injury worries to star bowler Muttiah Muralidaran.//////India on Thursday revelled in its sporting and diplomatic success after beating Pakistan in a cricket World Cup semifinal that also hosted leadership talks on better cross-border ties.//////Indian newspapers splashed the country's triumph over bitter rival Pakistan in the World Cup semifinals across the front pages Thursday, applauding the game as an "epic showdown."//////Legends Sachin Tendulkar and Muttiah Muralidaran face-off in a mouth-watering duel for the last time when India and Sri Lanka clash in the World Cup final on Saturday.//////Disappointed Pakistani cricket fans on Wednesday blamed a sluggish Misbahul Haq for defeat in the World Cup semifinal thriller with arch-rival India.//////Former greats and fans Thursday singled out sloppy fielding as the main reason for Pakistan's 29-run loss against bitter rivals India in the high-profile World Cup semifinal in Mohali.//////A shadow of the tearaway who once terrified batsmen, as well as cricket administrators worldwide, Shoaib Akhtar's career ended meekly, denied the headline farewell he cherished.//////Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi said the performance of his side's younger players had been among the positives of a World Cup campaign that ended with a 29-run semifinal loss to India.//////India coach Gary Kirsten and Sri Lankan counterpart Trevor Bayliss may have earned lavish praises for their invaluable inputs, but unfortunately only one will be smiling on Saturday night.//////A billion hearts will beat for Sachin Tendulkar as India bid for their second World Cup title in the all-Asian final against buoyant Sri Lanka on Saturday.//////India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni warned his team to ignore the hype and national hysteria that will dominate the frenetic build-up to Saturday's World Cup final against Sri Lanka.//////Rains and bad light played key roles on the final day of the fourth round of the National Cricket League as all three matches were drawn at different venues yesterday.//////He may have been roundly jeered by the home fans, but Franck Ribery's second-half cameo in France's 0-0 draw with Croatia has given coach Laurent Blanc plenty to think about.//////Inter Milan midfielder Dejan Stankovic believes his side are in a better position coming into Saturday's derby than Serie A leaders AC Milan.//////Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema could miss next week's Champions League quarterfinal first leg clash with Tottenham due to injury, Spanish newspapers said Thursday.//////Indian government on Thursday decided to grant income tax exemption to International Cricket Council (ICC) for the World Cup cricket competition.//////Manchester United legend Bryan Robson criticised Fabio Capello's handling of the England captaincy saga on Wednesday but said he supported the decision to reinstate John Terry.//////Kapil Dev, the only man to captain an Indian World Cup winning side, said Thursday that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's reputation as skipper should not depend on the result of Saturday's final against Sri Lanka.//////Indian tennis star Sania Mirza, who had jokingly tweeted she was at 'war' with husband -- and former Pakistan cricket captain -- Shoaib Malik, praised the defeated semifinalists on Thursday.//////Simon Taufel and Aleem Dar have been named as the on-field umpires for the World Cup final between India and Sri Lanka on Saturday.

His suggestion to Bangladesh government to abandon the decision of setting up a nuclear power plant and the reasons put forward are true to the point.

The concept of providing tiny loans for very poor people was taken up by other countries around the world. It is seen as literally a life saving idea - people lift themselves out of malnourishment and inadequate housing and use the loans to create income generating small businesses. They can then send their children to school, save money, become healthier and the women especially can become role models for their daughters.//////This is in response to the letter sent to you by Shaheen Anam on 29th March 2011 regarding the lack of reciprocation by the Pakistani cricket captain Shahid Afridi to the adoring crowds of Dhaka that supported them in the quarter final match against the West Indies in the World Cup 2011 Quarter Finals.//////As reported in the daily Arab News recently, Saudi Minister of Labour Adel Fakieh has assured support for Bangladeshi workers within the laws of the Kingdom that guarantee protection for foreign workers.

Our rulers, however, think otherwise. While explaining the Yunus issue to our foreign friends, one senior minister resorted to falsity. Another, while embarking on her mission of mercy to bring solace to our brethren ejected out of Libya, said with a straight face that no matter how many people lose their joy and happiness, the law must prevail. The question therefore is: If a law or a rule brings despair, grief, sorrow (opposite of joy/happiness) to the vast majority of the people (80% ++ if the opinion polls are to be believed), then, if we profess to be a democratic state, should not that particular law, go, be dumped and scrapped instead of the person affected by it?//////I am cent percent satisfied with the performance of Bangladesh cricket team in the World Cup 2011. Just take a look; we have won three matches out of six. We have beaten England, Ireland and Netherlands. Some people talk about the shameful defeats against South Africa and the West Indies. In 1992 World Cup, Pakistan team scored only 76 runs (against England). But afterwards they took the trophy! To me, the only point Bangladesh should think about is sensible batting. My request to BCB, please make sporting wicket, not slow wicket. Bangladeshi pace bowlers are also good and our Batsmen are good in fast and sporting wicket.//////I am writing from Pakistan. I thank all Bangladeshi cricket fans for supporting Pakistan cricket team during the quarter-final match. I wish one day Bangladesh would play a match in Pakistan, and we would wave Bangladeshi flags in support of our guest team in a future cricket world cup.

The allied forces including USA are attacking Libya by violating the sovereignty of the country resulting in deaths of hundreds of innocent people. If USA and other countries were so worried about international peace and humanity in real sense, they would have launched joint army action against Israel which is continuously refusing to vacate the occupied Arab areas despite the resolution passed by the UN. //////Our sincere condolences go to the people and government of Japan. In particular to the bereaved families who lost their near and dear ones during the natural calamity of unprecedented magnitude. This is a very difficult time for the people of Japan. To add to the misery, nuclear plant blasts sent another wave of profound shock to the Japanese people. Some of the areas where earthquake and tsunami hit are known to me personally. Japanese are resilient, diligent and extremely positive-minded people who will overcome these appalling catastrophes. And Japan is a tested friend of ours and always stands by us through thick and thin. At this time of great disaster, we would like to assure our Japanese friends that our continuous prayers and heartfelt sympathies are with them. //////I've been a regular subscriber of The Daily Star for about eight years.

I hope you will consider my request and do the needful. //////It has become clear why our Prime Minister and her government stood against Prof Yunus and Grameen Bank. After the rejection of Yunus' writ petition in the court against Bangladesh Bank's order to remove Yunus from his office, Attorney General Mahbub-e Alam made it clear that if anyone was supposed to get a Nobel Peace Prize in Bangladesh it should have been either Sheikh Hasina or Shantu Larma. The government though failed to give attention to the country's serious problems such as power crisis, gas crisis, water crisis, population explosion, traffic jam, price hike of daily commodities and many other issues; it was able to remove Prof Yunus from Grameen Bank not considering its long-term effect not only in the country but throughout the world.//////This is the 40th year of our independence.

It also must be a sheer coincidence that how the United States had started to minify Saddam Hussein in Iraq is also how it appears to plan to pare down Muammer Gaddafi in Libya. But one thing is apparent from how US dealt with one dictator in the past and is dealing with another in the present.
