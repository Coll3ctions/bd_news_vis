And now that even senior police officers have acknowledged the situation, there are additional reasons to be worried about the state of things. What is indeed gravely disturbing is the new dimension which seems to have come into the picture. These police officials have pointed to what is clearly a break in the police chain of command owing to the close ties many of their subordinates maintain with political, usually ruling party, activists across the country.

Prostitution, regarded as the oldest profession, is practiced worldwide, not just in Bangladesh. The article, based upon a report of an NGO, emphasizes the role of a powerful steroid oradexon in making young girls (often between 12-14 years of age) more mature (older than the officially allowed age of 18) and sexually attractive to the customers. This in return brings more profit to the brothel owners. The drug, used by majority of Bangladeshi female sex workers, has serious side effects and is hazardous to health. The scene portrayed in the article is indeed a pathetic one as these young girls, often lured away from their villages, to work as sex slaves are locked up in a prison like environment. The article should reach the Bangladeshi authorities who should look into the matter seriously and must take appropriate measures. After all, the article portrays a very negative image of Bangladesh. //////The historical importance of May Day is great. Labourers of America demanded 8-hour working time in 1886.

Now the young generation is obsessed with western music and films. //////According to a recent research report an airborne deadly fungus - Cryptococcus gattii is spreading among humans and animals in the northeastern United States and the Canadian province of British Columbia. This new genetically different fungus strain is capable of causing serious health problems to humans as well as animals (cats, dogs, dolphins, etc.). C.gattii enters into the human body through inhalation of spores of the fungus. C. gattii infections include persistent cough (lasting for weeks or months), fever, shortness of breath, sinusitis, severe headache, nausea, night sweats, photophobia, skin problems, et cetera. The good news is, C.gattii is not transmitted from person to person or animal to person. An open wound may be a route for intrusion of the deadly fungus into the human and animal body system.//////Late Dr. Mohammad Shahidullah was very correct in saying " Disease is contagious not health".
