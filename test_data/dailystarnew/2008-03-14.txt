But what surely leaves everyone perplexed is the extent to which the district administration there has failed to take action against such NGOs even after reports about their negative activities were circulated widely. It is a lax administration we are speaking of here, for the very simple reason that despite the detection of as many as 30 fraudulent NGOs in the district, no punitive measures appear to have been taken against the people behind them. Just how serious the problem is turning out to be is to be seen from the way in which a million people have been swindled out of an altogether Taka 500 crore in eight north-western districts by these fake NGOs.//////Readers of The Daily Star cannot but congratulate Syed Badrul Ahsan for his intensely thought-provoking and eloquent piece on how he would like to see our police perform.

It was no small feat for a student with English medium background and one with no coaching. I was quiet sure I would get English, as I got more than twenty-four and twenty in compulsory and advanced English respectively; which were above the required minimum. But the interview burst my bubble in the worst possible way. Not only was I frowned upon for being from English medium but I was also denied the subject on the sole ground that I did not have English in my A-Levels, the fact that I had an A grade in English in O-Levels didn't seem to prove my competence either. Seriously, not even five percent of A-Levels students take English, but that does not mean they don't want to study it. Since it is not compulsory to have those particular subjects in A-Levels that we want to take in undergraduate level then why this is different for English, which has been the medium of our studies? But while I was denied English, others who had it as a third or fourth choice were taking it up as their more favoured subjects were unavailable. So, they would rather take in reluctant people than eager and capable just because of rules that show little logic. This has happened not only with me but with quiet a few others.//////According to information available, tigers are being killed.

One can see some rationale behind the CEC's firm attitude to hold the election on time or quit. He is opening up his mind with new hints and gestures. May be I am totally wrong, but I get the feeling that the election will be held as planned in a different scenario. Major political parties or players might opt not to participate in the election because of the circumstances obtaining around two interned political leaders; or, there might be a split in the party with regard to participation in the election, and deflection of prominent members cannot be ruled out.//////Whenever someone in the government is asked about the election, you will automatically hear a standard answer that it is the responsibility of the Election Commission to arrange it. And if you put the same question to the gentlemen of the Election Commission, you are almost sure to hear that they are almost ready and it is the government which has to create the congenial atmosphere and facilitate holding of this grand event. The question is a normative one. And both the answers are correct, politically. But is something missing? //////After going through the article of architect Dr Nizamuddin Ahmed (The Daily Star 1/2/08), I was rather surprised to find that he knows all the problems and the probable solutions about our current repulsive architectural culture prevailing in society. But the influence on our architects in Dhaka is negligible. It is the motivation factor, which is distorted [by market conditions].//////Two letters to editor by readers in a local daily on 20th February made interesting and contrasting reading; with fairly reasonable viewpoints! One was by Juliet Kausar from Iran giving the writer's views on the issue of "custodial torture", and the trampling down of "human dignity" and the "arrogance of power" with a real life example! The fact remains that this is the reality of Bangladesh today! //////The present caretaker government should stay for the next five years to protect democracy. //////A report by BSS-Dhaka about celebration of Ekushey in our missions abroad, published in a local daily on 22nd February, began as follows: "Amar Ekushey- the International Mother Language Day......etc." I was somewhat confused, as I believe it should have been "Omor Ekushey" and not "Amar Ekushey"; as phonetically the meaning of the two words differ markedly. While "Amar" in Bangla means "Ours", "Omor" means "Immortal". I believe we mean "immortal" and not "ours"; more so as the day is now recognised internationally.//////Through your newspaper, I would like to appeal to Pervez Musharraf to step down as president. The people of Pakistan have already given the verdict against him in election 2008. All of his allies and his army of ministers have been badly defeated in the elections.

But, whose 90% (a conservative estimate) consists mostly of rural based uneducated farmers who have no notion of democracy. To, probably, Mr. Zaman's sheer disappointment, these are 'farmers and chashis' whose children joined our great war of liberation and created our nation. //////The dogs were in their worst form during the Liberation War.
