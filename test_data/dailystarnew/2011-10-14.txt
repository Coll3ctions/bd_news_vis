That is because of the intransigence the government of Binyamin Netanyahu has consistently demonstrated where dealing with the Palestinians is concerned. Even so, his readiness to free the prisoners in order to have soldier Gilad Shalit released by Palestinian extremist groups could be regarded as a sign of the Israeli authorities softening their belligerence somewhat. Perhaps that could lead to some new thinking about the Palestine issue as a whole.//////Expectations got the better of the Tigers yesterday in the first one-dayer against the West Indies at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.

Good governance and its associated services simply do not reach many people, and where they do, the services offered are so corrupted, inefficient and disorganised that they fail to make any positive impact. There exists a vicious loop: the impact of poor governance is felt disproportionately by those who are poor, unorganised and do not have the means to access services from alternative channels, such as the private sector and the middlemen. In turn, this further diminishes the opportunities available to them to break the cycle of poverty, exploitation and marginalisation. Governance services such as maintaining the rule of law, primary education, primary health care, preserving equality and human rights, targeted government programmes and subsidies, can enhance welfare of people in any country. Yet large sections of people, especially in developing countries, remain poor, exploited and marginalised, and are not able to improve their lives as they are deprived of even the most fundamental benefits of good governance.//////In recent times, the number of road crashes in our country has increased alarmingly. Every day the electronic and print media are covering horrifying news of tragic road mishaps occurring on different roads and highways across the country, resulting in the loss of many invaluable lives and causing disability to a large number of people. The tragic accident at Mirsarai, Chittagong and the road crash in Manikganj in August this year that claimed the invaluable lives of Tareque Masud and Mishuk Munier, are but a few examples of the innumerable road accidents taking place every now and then.//////The economists predicted and suggested how to prevent the downward journey of the county's economy! It seems like it is becoming a national pastime: people coming on talk shows talking about how to improve the country's lot; people sitting at round-tables and talking about how to improve our economy.

And I couldn't believe that it would become the headline. //////I am writing this letter in response to Syed Badrul Ahsan's article titled Metro rail and the public interest."

It has been reported in the newspapers that a good number of people from different professional backgrounds are involved in this immoral business. The arrestees include university teachers, doctors, bankers and students. //////Normally, the secretary of the Nobel Prize Committee dials the one who wins the prestigious Nobel Prize. It is amusing to know from a recent Arab News report entitled Call of a lifetime: 'Congrats! You win a Nobel!' that sometimes the recipient thinks that someone is cracking a joke with him!//////Most of the time when road accidents take place, we only blame the drivers. It is not right to blame them alone. The BRTA authorities and the commuters are also responsible for this. Thousands of drivers, who hardly have any knowledge about driving and traffic rules, get licenses by bribing the officials of BRTA. And it has become a common practice that the commuters shout at the drivers to overtake other vehicles. It is our responsibility to curb road accidents.//////I am very shocked to know that Saudi Arabia beheaded eight Bangladeshi workers in public for murdering an Egyptian security guard in Riyadh in 2007 despite Bangladesh's repeated pleas for clemency. //////The Populist movement started at the end of the first Gilded Age in the 1890s. The movement developed from farmers' alliances, formed in the 1880s, in reaction to falling crop prices and poor credit facilities. The leaders formed the People's Party (1892), also known as the Populist Party, which advocated a variety of measures to help farmers. Mass protests were staged by the unemployed workers, especially in the 1930s during the Great Depression. It took roughly four years to organise this.

We listen all the time, not having even half as much time to talk. //////The signing of the strategic partnership agreement between India and Afghanistan not only underlines India's engagement at multiple levels in Afghanistan but also India's future strategy in the region.

The US Senate has scrapped Obama's jobs bill. Two of his own Democrats joined Republicans to vote against it. There are 53 Democrat Senators to 49 Republican. It was skating through the thin ice anyway. The 60-vote supermajority mark required for the bill to advance in the chamber was a steep call.//////It is impossible to preclude nature's fury when it strikes in the form of cyclone, hurricane, tidal surge, flood and earthquake. In recent years, imminence of deadly disasters has been aggravated either by natural factors such as geological, hydrometeorological and biological changes or by social factors such as unplanned urbanisation and indiscriminate manipulation of natural resources, not to mention the excesses of the industrial revolution in the West precipitating climate change. //////We know that excess of anything is dangerous. Let us take the example of water. Water is life and excess water is flood. Because we live in a climatically vulnerable country like Bangladesh, we do not need to be told about the ferocity of floods. People of Bangladesh know very well how disastrous the consequences of monsoons, flash floods, torrential downpours, and weeks of downpour can be.
