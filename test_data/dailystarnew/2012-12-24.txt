In Bangladesh, Tupperware started its sales operation in 2012 with different types of plastic food containers. //////Many poor folks in the world haven't yet found the real meaning of Christmas. So many people are lost, lonely, downtrodden, weak and weary. Some are weak in their bodies, weary in their flesh; others are weak in their minds; and yet others are weak in body, mind and spirit. There are the trampled-on, the poor, the persecuted, the hungry; those who are victims of war and crime and exploitation; those who nobody wants and for whom nobody cares; those who have so little in the way of worldly goods, who are lacking in food, clothing and shelter -- even the basic necessities.//////When Bishwajit Das was hacked to death, there were TV cameras and photojournalists around.

But no religion allows killing innocent people. I urge the people of all religions to realise the ideology of their religion and practice it accordingly. This way the world will be peaceful and secure for all.//////Connecticut school shooting incident was very ugly and sad. We are in tears along with Barack Obama and people of the world.

But it can also be a source of problem if a garment unit is situated in a residential area as it can create sound. An example is a factory located at Mirpur. It is close to a residential area and has two high voltage power generators that operate during load-shedding. In the area, load shedding is a common experience. These generators operate for long hours and create intolerable noise pollution. I am a resident of the area. Sound pollution causes hearing problem, heart problem, brain stroke, etc. Considering its adverse impact on public health, it is advised that the unit may replace those screaming generators with quieter ones. It will save some money, as well as give relief to local residents.//////The heart of the Indian capital turned into a battle zone yesterday as thousands massed to denounce the brutal gang rape of a young woman triggering appeals from both the government and opposition.//////Egypt has adopted a new, Islamist-backed constitution with nearly two-thirds support in a referendum preceded by weeks of sometimes bloody protests, official media said yesterday.//////Pakistan's powerful army chief has made reconciling warring factions in Afghanistan a top priority, military officials and Western diplomats say, the newest and clearest sign yet that Islamabad means business in promoting peace with the Taliban.//////North Korea's recent rocket launch amounted to the test of a ballistic missile capable of carrying a half-tonne payload as far as the US west coast, the South Korean defence ministry said yesterday.//////Police shot dead a television journalist yesterday when they opened fire during a protest against a sexual assault on a film actress in India's northeast, an official said.//////Afghanistan's Taliban has called for a new constitution as a pre-condition for it joining the nation's fledgling peace process, according to a declaration issued by representatives at a landmark meeting in France.//////Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti yesterday said he was ready to govern the country again but would not be a candidate in the February election.//////A huge fire swept through a market in downtown Kabul yesterday, destroying hundreds of shops and forcing the city's nearby money exchange to evacuate, police and witnesses said.//////Syria has acted to consolidate its chemical weapons into "one or two" places to prevent rebels capturing them, Russia's foreign minister said on Saturday.//////A Cairo court has decided it will rule on the appeal of ousted former President Hosni Mubarak on January 13, a court source said yesterday, a move that could lead to Mubarak being retried over the killing of protesters last year.//////Observing that Gujarat remains an important state for its investment, the United States on Saturday, said it would continue to engage with the state across a broad range of issues including trade, investment, university linkages and people to people exchanges.//////Observing that Gujarat remains an important state for its investment, the United States on Saturday, said it would continue to engage with the state across a broad range of issues including trade, investment, university linkages and people to people exchanges.//////Iran is engaged in a "smart economic war" with Western powers whose sanctions against its nuclear programme are hurting some Iranians, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Saturday.//////Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati foresees early general elections but said her party would not do anything to bring down the government.//////Flooding and heavy rain are continuing to cause problems in south-west England and parts of Wales and Scotland.//////Mohammad Rafi has a soothing effect on you, even when he is singing the saddest of songs. In his sadness as in his moods of good cheer, there is the exhilaration of romance which comes alive. It is a feeling which transfers itself into you, to a point where you know that Rafi sings for you, that his sentiments and yours are indistinguishable one from the other. Recall this heart-breaking number he sings, with Asha Bhonsle, in the movie Meri Soorat Teri Ankhen: tere bin soone nain hamare. It is symbolic of a sheer feeling of helplessness in a man who craves love and yet does not easily come by it.//////Tareque Masud Memorial Trust together with Laser Vision Limited organised a launching programme of "Songs of Tareque Masud" and a DVD of "Naroshundor" at Sevenhill restaurant, in the capital on December 22. //////Rafiqul Islam Chowdhury is a budding artist who focuses on separation, love, romance, features relating to birth and death as well as nature and its mysteries.

Although Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has crossed old tally of 117, he must be disappointed that he did not get 145, the figure which the exit polls had projected and he had begun to cherish.//////Seeing Biswajit Das staggering out of a building drenched in blood, disoriented and helpless, was absolutely sickening. The sight of some "brave" and "patriotic" young men brandishing their weapons and poking, battering, hacking away at him was disgusting. The fact that no one could help him -- not the police, not the bystanders, not even the doctors when he finally made it to the Mitford Hospital (through the courage and kindness of a rickshaw puller) -- was incomprehensible. //////In the aftermath of the leaks of Skype conversations, one of the sticking points is whether the trials at Tribunal No.1, of which the now-resigned Justice Md.
