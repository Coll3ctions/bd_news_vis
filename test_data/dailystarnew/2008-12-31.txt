It said it is the masses that hold the ultimate power in a republic. And it is they who break down the doors of Bastille again and again whenever tyrant rulers and their henchmen make feeble attempts to hide inside. History tells us that the despots have never been forgiven by the people. //////Once again, the Bangladeshi voters have demonstrated that it is best to never underestimate them. Once again they have delivered a verdict as clinical as it has been mature, and shown that when they are able to exercise their franchise without fear for their safety they are able to render decisive and critical judgments.//////Former advisers of caretaker government, renowned jurists, educationists and economists yesterday said fresh voters imbued with the spirit of the Liberation War rose above any temptation and played a decisive role in determining the winners in Monday's national election.//////Chief Adviser (CA) Fakhruddin Ahmed yesterday said the December 29 parliamentary election set high standards for all future elections and signalled the beginning of a new process of democracy and good governance in Bangladesh.//////A 74-run sixth wicket partnership between captain Mohammad Ashraful and Shakib Al Hasan on the fourth day kept Bangladesh alive in the first Test against Sri Lanka at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////At least three people were killed and 69 others injured in post-election violence in Chittagong, Pabna, Jessore, Noakhali and Dhaka yesterday.//////Pakistan yesterday called for negotiations with India and asked New Delhi to relocate its troops away from the border in a show of goodwill to defuse tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.//////Israeli aircraft kept up a relentless string of attacks on Hamas-ruled Gaza yesterday, smashing a government complex, security installations and the home of a top militant commander as thousands of Israeli ground troops, backed by tanks and artillery, massed along the border and waited for a signal to attack.//////AS the nation takes a deeper look into how Monday's elections went and its historic outcome, we cannot but note some particular features that characterised the polls. Voter turnout was a whopping 85 per cent, in the words of the secretary of the Election Commission, marking an increase of 10 per cent over the last election in 2001. Such enthusiastic and spontaneous exercise of the right to franchise is a highwater mark of and a point of pride for democracy anywhere in the world. This is also a fitting tribute to the congeniality of the election atmosphere which encouraged voters to come out in large numbers to cast their ballots. It is to the credit of the EC and the caretaker administration that their constant vigil ensured that goons or any other vigilante groups could not disrupt the voting process. //////A large body of gullible Bangladeshis, around 400, fell easy prey to machinations of fraudulent job brokers setting sail to the sea apparently on way to the Malaysian coast, some two months ago. Most of them are from Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. This is how their tale of tragedy unfolded: After the ill-fated Bangladeshis floated in the sea on six speed boats for some days, their fake employment agent put them on board a ship and abandoned them in the high seas. As they floated listlessly and ran out of water and food, seven of them died while 102 were rescued -- thanks to the Indian coast guard. As many as 300 have gone missing and many of them feared to have drowned.//////NOW that the people of Bangladesh have spoken, and spoken loudly, it remains for the incoming government of Sheikh Hasina to get its priorities right and go about putting them in implementation mode.

But there was a distinct change yesterday in the Bangladesh captain's approach that took the first Test against Sri Lanka into the fifth day at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. //////Graeme Smith's cool 75 set up South Africa's first series win in Australia as they eased to a nine-wicket victory in the second Test at the MCG Tuesday that destroyed the hosts' world-beating reputation.//////Graeme Smith has hailed a shift in the power-balance in world cricket after what he described as the greatest year in the South African team's history.
