The practice of copying or cheating in the examination halls however has decreased in the last 7 to 8 years due to continued motivational campaign and vigilance on the part of both teachers and the administration with enhanced co-operation from guardians.

It was a time when I was involved with housing rights, worked briefly for ADB on urban poverty reduction where shelter was a small component to be delivered through the NGOs, as a means to provide affordable workspace to the poor that could enhance their productivity. But then learnt that it was the abbreviated version of real-estate developers' association. Ever since I have thought of how to bring apartments closer to affordability of a larger number of families, which in fact was a topic of my PhD completed in 1990. I also had applied the 'theory' into practice by initiating an apartment project by a group of BUET teachers in 1992 which cost about half the market price, and the method has been replicated!//////President Bush might be comparing the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with that of US involvement in the First and Second World Wars.

The results have created much enthusiasm in the country in general and the educational arena in particular. At the same time, they have provoked some questions as well. //////Aboriginal people or 'Adibashis' are sons (and daughters) of the soil. They are here for ages. But they have been taken on and/or deprived as well as persecuted by others because a number of reasons such as their simplicity (no intrigue ever crossed their mind), ignorance, specially of law, shaky personality (their sheer small number seldom helped them stand against odds put up by the majority and win), landlessness (gradually being dispossessed of land) and lack of security (law of the land or law enforcers came to little help, unfortunately). And because of these reasons they have been facing so many problems without any appreciable solution as yet. Let us discuss briefly the problems in the light of the reasons.//////The first time Mukhtar saw Sharda was from his rooftop, where he had gone to grab a kite that had landed there. It was only a glimpse. She lived in the house across the street, which was lower than theirs, and he had seen her through the open window of the bathroom where she was washing herself, pouring water on her body from a pitcher. This was a surprise. Where had this girl materialized from, because no girl lived in that house. The ones who used to had all been married off. The only female now left was Roop Kaur, with her flabby husband and their three boys.//////I looked around at the tents, followed directions and found rich veins of English books translated from Arabic literature beneath the surface of the main gala: talks, discussions, debates and workshops. All of it was to encourage collaboration between UK and Arab publishers and translators. Current trends in contemporary Arabic literature will be introduced to a UK audience by showcasing some of the best writers and writing from the Arabic world. Approximately 40 leading writers, commentators and industry professionals from the region were being showcased within these bland stalls: Bahaa Taher, Alaa Al Aswany, Faisal Darraj, Hisham Matar, Raja Alsanea, Jean Makdisi (sister of the late Edward Said) and Amjad Nasser. They would take part in these events each night, providing a visible platform of new voices to the publishing audience. Since I couldn't spare the time to attend them in the days ahead, I went for a final walk on the tired carpets that would give me a feel for the cut and thrust of emerging Saracen literature.//////How much do we know of literature in subcontinental languages other than our own? We know more about Western literatures, down to the latest Booker and Pulitzer aspirants. No doubt this is another, regrettable, instance of continuing Western hegemony. If things were better ordered in South Asian culture, we would be familiar with at least all the major writers in the region, and there would be many more books directly translated from one regional language to another. The most satisfying translations must be those between closely related languages, such as the North Indian ones, whose kinship minimizes the loss in passage. As matters stand, our best introduction to other subcontinental writers is through English - witness, for instance, A. K. Ramanujan's magisterial translations from Tamil and Kannada.//////When it comes to weight loss, there is no shortage of advice. Check any magazine rack or bookstore, and you are bound to discover that latest and greatest cure for being overweight.//////Human breast milk is the best food in the early days of life.

Looking for a running mate is the major concern of the summer. The election strategist, rumourmongers, fate gurus, lobbyists, even Mafias are meanwhile jockeying for advantage. When Obama is double digit ahead of MacCain, his VP is so focused these days, as if Republicans are not going have one really. New Hampshire 'unite for change' call from Hillary and Obama sharing the same podium is good start for the Democrats. November is too far and it is too early to deduce how much healing is possible between Hillary and Obama camps.//////ON 9 June 2008, the Finance Adviser to the Caretaker Government presented the national budget for the financial year (FY) 2008-09 in a live broadcast over the national radio and TV. The marathon address touched upon almost all aspects of the nation's economic life - the difficulties surmounted and the successes achieved. While highlighting the budget performance last year, he also laid before the nation the socio-economic targets for the coming year and how the government planned to achieve those. He covered a wide vista of governmental activities from agriculture to industries, from education to employment, from communications to power generation. However, there was not a word on 'defence', despite it being one of the largest expenditure sectors of the government. //////It is reported Bangladesh has not yet firmed up its stance on the question of recognising Kosovo's independence, despite persistent diplomatic presentation by US Ambassador James Moriarty, who met Foreign Adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on 1st July for the second time to pursue the issue of recognition of the new Balkan state.//////Instances of an army continually occupying its own country are rare. Yet the Pakistan army has systematically been engaged in the job for the past fifty years. It was Justice M.R. Kayani who first made note of this occupation factor, drawing in the process the very great ire of General Ayub Khan, known today as Pakistan's first military dictator. Or you could even say, without batting an eyelid, that Ayub was the man in Pakistan's, or South Asia's, history who first taught soldiers the art of overturning civilian governments and then giving themselves a very wide berth in statecraft. In all these years since October 1958, when Ayub and Major General Iskandar Mirza first went into the business of clamping martial law over Pakistan, Pakistan's soldiers have spread their wings nearly everywhere, to the extent that Ayesha Siddiqa recently spilled all the beans about the army's hold on the economy in her disturbing (for the army) Military Inc.//////Frogs in a Well is a case study of the women of the pirzada families.
