It was a formidable enemy we defeated in 1971. No fewer than 93,000 of Pakistan's soldiers together with their civilian appendages had their comeuppance on 16 December 1971 as the victorious Mukti Bahini and the allied forces swept into the new nation's capital. Nothing could be more poignant than the historic image of the Pakistan occupation army, a force that had caused the death of three million Bengalis, had raped countless women and had burnt and pillaged in villages and towns across the land, surrendering before the very people it had sought to exterminate or colonise in the nine months of the war.//////THAT the government has decided to upgrade the nursing profession and go for an increased intake of nurses augurs well for the health services of the country.

On Saturday evening, supporters of Golam Rasul Master and Nazir Hossain locked in an altercation over a trifling matter which turned into a violent clash at around 3:00am on Sunday leaving at least 25 people injured.

Eight houses were destroyed in the attacks and counterattacks. //////After long nine months of genocide, rapes, arsons, loots, plunders and a short 13 days' 'war', Pakistan Army Eastern Commander Lt. General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi ('Tiger') surrendered unconditionally on behalf of his 93 thousands war criminals and country at a public ceremony at Dhaka Ramna Race Course (now named Suhrawardy Uddan) to the Bangladesh and Indian joint command on 16 December 1971. Since the end of Second World War it is the largest surrender of any army. Also, this is one of the fastest surrender in military history. //////Transports play an important role in carrying people and goods from one place to another. It may be both speedy and slow transports. Rickshaw is one of them and unfortunately it is one of the causes of traffic jam. It causes traffic jam in the narrow lanes in the city area, especially in Dhaka city. Scooters are also responsible for traffic jam. As a result, traffic jam is a common phenomenon in our city life. It is also so acute in almost all the urban areas of Bangladesh. So, to lead a traffic jam-free life rickshaws and scooters should be removed from the towns.//////One of the obstacles that is seen in the creative education system is guidebook and notebook. The main purpose of creative education system is to enhance creative thinking among the students. This education system mitigates the sole dependence of the students on memorizing. But if the guidebooks and notebooks are published the students are more likely to memorize the answers from those books. The teachers will also prepare question papers from such books. As a result, creativity among the students will not develop. Due to the existence of guidebooks and notebooks, the students study the textbooks very little. The students also try to pass through adopting unfair means. Realizing the truth, the government took the decision to ban guidebooks and notebooks. But publishers and sellers filed a writ petition against the government order. The High Court dismissed it and upheld the order. After that the Supreme Court stayed the High Court verdict following their petition. Getting the opportunity they published guidebooks and notebooks. //////The recent attempt of planting palm trees in different regions of Bangladesh by a few individuals and organisations will go futile as the weather and soil condition of our country are not congenial for such plantations and this very fact is known to our experts and the forest department. A real life picture of palm trees bearing very ordinary fruits can be visualized on a trip to Sylhet in the forests located by the side of highway which does not contain the material for either soap or edible oil. Frequent rainfall all over the year, which is the very basic necessity for the productive growth of palm trees, is absent in our country. As a result, it is unlikely for us to grow palm trees for the production of edible oil.//////The country is turning into the land of the rich and the poor. Lots of people move to the towns every day leaving of the villages. As a result, the cities are getting crowded. But though they come to town in search of food and work for living, sometimes their dreams are not fulfilled. //////In the past, following consultation, a patient used to get the prescription directly from the doctor at the Apollo Hospital. Patient had the choice either to purchase the medicine from Apollo's Pharmacy or to buy outside. But now Apollo doctors send all prescriptions through their Local Area Network to their Pharmacy Billing. //////Winter, the second last season & obviously the coldest season sets in again as per the rule of the nature and is greeting us with its little fog at night & dawn as it is the outset yet. We have been getting the indication of winter from the last few days. As a season of pithas it is second to none. Different kinds of handmade cakes are made by our women, especially in rural areas to get the full taste of the winter. Date juice adds more pleasure to that. Besides, lots of colourful guest birds also come to Bangladesh with the commencement of winter, as if winter invites the birds to stay for a while (two months). However, the winter of Bangladesh is much more comfortable undoubtedly than the winter of other countries as we do not have snow & ice. //////The Supreme Court verdict on Bangabandhu murder case has debunked Gladstone's adage " Justice delayed, justice denied". We had to wait for long 34 years to get justice. Many nefarious machinations were taken to scupper the process of the trial. The Indemnity Ordinance was the first step in this regard. The villainous politicians were very active to save the self-declared killers of Bangabandhu that was very unfortunate for our country. Ultimately their attempts did not succeed ultimately. The apex court of Bangladesh played its due role boldly and responsibly. We cannot but genuflect to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh for its landmark judgement. Now, the government should take necessary steps to execute the verdict as soon as possible. Besides, it is imperative for the incumbent government to make diplomatic endeavours to extradite the convicts who are hiding in different countries. If the govt. succeeds in bringing back the ringleaders to Bangladesh through the diplomatic process, it will be a great victory for the nation. We hope the AL led government will leave no stone unturned to materialize the SC verdict for the sake of rule of law.//////It is most unfortunate that still party clout and favouritism take precedence over the 'rule of law' to be equally dispensed with. The waiver of conviction of Mr. Akbar, son of an AL leader, by the President is a glaringly bad example. //////It is refreshing to see that the government has decided to take stern actions against those responsible for the recent launch capsize in Bhola. If the authorities mean what they say, and are willing to follow through with it without bias or prejudice, it will set a precedence worth following. //////After going through a series of reports on depleting Modhupur forests in The Daily Star, I visited the forest and became frustrated seeing the destroyed forests. But it was another surprising matter for me to see a BAF firing range in Rasulpur area of the forests. What is the effect of sounds of bombing by aircrafts on the animals of the forests ? //////Susang Durgapur situated in one of the districts of Bangladesh called Netrakona is 182 km from Dhaka. It is a genuine natural splendour of woodland river & hills where the Garos and other tribals reside. One can easily take pleasure in boating in the river, seeing the green bushes around, climbing hills etc. Wild elephants at times comes from the jungle. However, going to Susang Durgapur is bothersome for both the domestic and overseas tourists because of the communication problem in this area. Nonetheless, especially during winter, Durgapur is crowded with many tourists. //////I was surprised when I found the former President Hussain Mohammad Ershad all of a sudden transformed himself from a poet to a columnist. His article 'Untold story of Grameen Bank' gave me new information about the contribution of late General M.A. Munim, his wife Prof. Ayesha Akter Munim and even a new insight on President Ershad.//////The logic is simple. Eliminating rickshaws in Dhaka city would mean less people would migrate to Dhaka from the rural areas. This would be an effective way of controlling the population of Dhaka. This would also mean less crime in Dhaka as well as less traffic jam. As far as the rural areas go, the government will have to de-centralize and develop the other cities in Bangladesh to create more opportunities for the people. Let's all move forward and try to keep up with the rest of the world.//////A couple of days earlier, there were news reports in some Bangla newspapers on Mr. Matiur Rahman Nizami, Ameer of Jamaat-e- Islami. He is reported to have given a Fatwa, 'religious ruling' that the present government's initiative to try the war criminals are, in fact, acts of anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic kind. We do not know wherefrom he brought these rulings of Islam for the people of Bangladesh, but we do hear the interpretations of the Holy Quran which rather emphasize severe punishments for rapists, arsonists, killers, unpatriotic citizens and collaborators who work against the motherland. In Islam, the people who work against their homeland, support the occupiers and invite the invaders are "non-believers". //////It is so horrible and sad to learn that Babri Mosque was demolished at the order of top BJP leaders in India, back in 1992. This news was revealed as an Indian newspaper was able to publish it on 23 November, 2009, before the Liberhan Comission was brought to Indian Parliament.//////Anyone visiting our lower courts both criminal and civil will find number of people including old, disabled, children and some mothers with their infants crowded in the open porch ( veranda) of the courtrooms, anxiously awaiting their turns of hearing inside the court chambers. They have to remain standing for hours. Some tired of standing sit on the dirty floors to lessen their fatigue. One can see the pain and frustration on their faces. But they all have assembled there seeking justice. This looks so pathetic and horrible! No one seems to have felt or bothered about this inhuman treatment of people in front of our courts of justice, even after 38 years of our own rule. The scene in front of the courts of women and child repression is even worse, as if the government is teaching them lessons for filing cases. //////A powerful car bomb exploded in a busy market in central Pakistan yesterday killing 20 people, in the latest in a stream of deadly attacks to hit the country, officials said.//////Even as the Pakistani political and military leadership has reacted strongly to the proposed US drone strikes inside the country, President Barack Obama has warned that America would launch missile attacks inside Pakistan if it gets actionable intelligence about the presence of top al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders in a particular area.//////Three car bombs struck the heart of Baghdad yesterday killing four people in the fourth wave of coordinated attacks in as many months, days after top ministers were quizzed in parliament over security.//////A Chicago man accused of planning the deadly 2008 Mumbai siege also had Bollywood and one of India's most sacred Hindu temples in his sights, US prosecutors said Monday.//////Video footage that allegedly shows Sri Lankan troops executing prisoners during the final stages of its battle against Tamil Tiger rebels was not fabricated, a British newspaper said yesterday.//////A suicide car bomber struck a heavily guarded neighbourhood yesterday near the home of a former Afghan vice president and a hotel favoured by Westerners, killing at least eight people and wounding dozens, officials said.//////China yesterday rejected as "unacceptable" US and EU calls to release prominent dissident Liu Xiaobo, who appears headed for trial on subversion charges after co-authoring a bold petition for democracy.//////Iran said Monday a court will try three Americans who wandered across the border from Iraq last July and became ensnared in an increasingly bitter standoff with the West over Tehran's nuclear program.//////Israel yesterdays slammed an arrest warrant issued by a British court against former foreign minister Tzipi Livni over her role during the war on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip at the turn of the year.//////A near total shutdown is being observed yesterday in Indian-administered Kashmir to protest a federal investigation into the death of two women.//////Music, poetry, plays and art -- culture on the whole has always had a major impact throughout our national history. Politics may bring down tyranny, change policies but it's culture that promulgates the message to the masses, generates awareness and takes a national movement to its peak. And who better to discuss the cultural aspect of national movements than Kamal Lohani? Lohani, a journalist, cultural personality extraordinaire is the Director General (DG) of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) at present.//////To celebrate the 39th Victory Day, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) has arranged a nine-day festival titled "Bijoy Mela". The festival opened on December 14 at the BSA premises through an exhibition. BSA also arranged a special programme at the National Theatre Hall to observe the Martyred Intellectuals' Day.//////Tagore singer Sadi Mohammad and dancer Shibli Mohammad are familiar names in our cultural circuit.

As part of this event, a cultural programme along with discussion was held at the premises of the museum on December 14 (on the occasion of Martyred Intellectuals' Day).//////We were eight brothers and lived at a rented house in the Chamelibagh area of the city. The atmosphere was eerily quiet. I just got enrolled in college during the Liberation War. On December 10, 1971, some members of al Badr came to our home at midnight. They were looking for my father. My mother started crying and we were puzzled. My father was working late, writing and translating. They picked up my father. We could hear the microbus leaving, recalled Shaheen Reza Noor, senior assistant editor of the daily Ittefaque and son of martyred journalist Sirajuddin Hossain. Noor is the president of Prajanma '71, an organisation formed by the sons and daughters of martyrs of the Liberation War. //////ATN Bangla will telecast TV play "Shesh Potro" tonight at 8:45 pm.
