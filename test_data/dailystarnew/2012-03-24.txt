The Awami League still believed that a constitutional way out for a transfer of power from the junta to the elected representatives of the people was possible. What was, however, unknown was that the military regime was giving the finishing touches to the operation it had decided to launch against the Bangalees.

The sense of national involvement in the event was total, the longing for victory irrepressible and emotion and passion ran so high that these would take a long time living down. //////The probe committee formed to investigate the Munshiganj launch tragedy in its report says the capsized launch was overloaded to the point that it failed to maintain its balance when a sand-laden vessel hit it. Although it was carrying only 15 passengers above the limit, it was overloaded with goods estimated at 15.26 tonnes beyond its capacity.

So when parliamentarians stoop low there is cause for concern. Is it time, therefore, to make concerted efforts to restore politics to its edifying status?//////Though India-Pakistan relations are going through a relatively calm phase, things can change quickly. We must therefore take advantage of the present atmosphere to lock in beneficial patterns of behaviour.//////In the backdrop of the observance of the National Children's Day on March 17, grim reports of the plight of millions of children, mostly born of poor parents, are pouring in. Bangladesh's young population (under 18), about 45% of the total population, are virtually unnoticed. They are the untapped wealth of the nation. The male children supplement the meagre income of the parents, while most female children work as domestic help. A large number of girls, because of abysmal poverty, fall into the clutches of child traffickers and find themselves in red light areas in the country or beyond the borders of the country. //////There was a time when any statement on Kashmir, either by the prime minister of India or that of Pakistan used to create a rumpus.

It ranks sixth among high TB burden countries in the world. Several factors, such as dense population, environmental pollution, and low physical quality of life prevailing among many people, are contributing to high incidence of the disease in our community.//////When the government is not capable enough or unable to monitor and stop the ongoing violations of environmental laws, it is the people who can contribute significantly in assisting the regulator by informing the officials of any shocking environmental degradation that is posing severe threat to their surroundings, and also by following the rules properly themselves as sensible citizens and raising awareness among others to stand against pollution.//////A popular cold-weather complaint of recent winters -- if the world is getting warmer, why is there 15 inches of snow in Central Park right now? -- has been quietly laid aside this year. Schoolchildren who had anticipated snow days and sledding will tell you that the weather has been disappointingly mild; in fact, since record keeping began, the park has experienced only one warmer winter, in 2001-2.//////Poetry is always about the human condition. Or you could say it is the story of the individual in terms of a broader connection with the collective body of men and women going through the pains and passions on which life comes as an offering to them. Yes, poetry is often a happy reflection of the turns and twists of the heart, of the rhythms which inject meaning into existence. More often than not, though, it is the breaking heart which reveals itself searingly through poetic imagery.//////My ideas are not rushed when I account my thoughts on paper with a fountain pen. There is a balance in coordinating the pause and etching the final words on a page. I can be as extravagant or as stringent with words at my heart's will. Today that art of penning seems to be on its way to complete oblivion. We live in a world of quick notes and abbreviated messages that leave behind many unsaid thoughts. The pen and ink are lost to time and have become collectibles. Today's hurried age is an age of instant information, disposable sensibilities and thoughts abandoned midway.//////If medical treatment/therapy has been proven unsuccessful and the liver is no longer able to function, liver transplantation remains the only option for patients suffering from liver failure.//////Vaccine is considered as one of the most efficacious, cost-effective and beneficial tools for saving millions of lives in the world.

The combination of concern over China and the US debt crisis could set Washington on a course to becoming a mere regional power in the Asia Pacific.//////February 2011The latest issue of //////, a literary magazine with a fairly prolonged lifespan, was gathering dust on my shelf, being placed quietly underneath my recently bought English and a few Bengali titles. As one corner of it uneasily jutted out, I pulled it out from under the stack. Its cover, stripped of any glitz, is unadorned with a cluster of pale leaves and gives off gloomy light in the foreground of which is put a vertical portrait of the versatile author Abdul Mannan Syed. He died in 2010. Nearly half of the issue is dedicated to his life and works. As I kept browsing through the pages, I met writers and poets who are barely known to readers but seem to have taken up writing as a calling, as an end in itself. //////Why something is called aam (mango), something else called pata (leaf) and another boi (book) seemed to be arbitrary, accdidental, so long to linguists in the world. It was for long believed that people of a certain community accepted the meaning of these words as such. It seemed those people could have accepted the same words to mean something else like aam (mango) for books and so forth. Modern linguists have discovered a common structure of sentences in all languages in the world. But to them all seems arbitrary beyond the structure of sentences.//////The combination of thoughts, feelings and imagination tinged with appropriate light and shade go into making a real poem, a poem which evokes interest and provokes thoughts of readers. //////
