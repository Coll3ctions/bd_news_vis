But a delegation of striking teachers in the meanwhile met the prime minister and called off their strike on her assurance, but the students have not relented.

The important thing about Chanderpaul is that this depressing effect he has on many fans is nothing compared to how he probably affects the opposition.

Some foreign friends contributed a lot for the emancipation of Bangladesh from the clutches of Pakistani occupation forces during 1971. Some days ago Bangladesh honoured those foreign friends who strongly deserved to be honoured. Our heartfelt gratitude to the friends who came to Bangladesh to be honoured. It is a good initiative by the government to honour our foreign friends who made invaluable contribution during our war of independence. They (our foreign friends) drummed up support from world leaders and mobilised financial support from different organisations, countries and individuals and provided training to Mukti Bahini. On the other hand, some countries went against the birth of Bangladesh disregarding the just struggle of Bangalee people. Sadly, a section of Bangalee people helped the Pakistani army and committed all types of war crimes. They actually did not want the independence of Bangladesh. We are waiting to see due punishment to the Pakistani collaborators in this land. Without the help of our foreign friends, it would be difficult for the independent Bangladesh to claim its position on the world map. Finally, I would like to thank our government for taking such a noble initiative to honour the true friends of Bangladesh.//////Only a few years back, countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were much like us. But now they are much ahead of us only because they gave the first priority to education and developed a huge skilled and enterprising population.

People already know that the no light would ever be shed over the journalist couple, Sagar-Runi murder. But the present move by the law enforcing agencies to exhume their dead bodies for viscera report surprises us. One does not need to be a criminologist to understand the necessity of viscera report. It was necessary at the beginning of the investigation. But we are optimistic and still keeping our hopes alive that the killers will be identified and punished soon.//////A recent conference urged young people to choose careers that corresponded with the calling of their hearts and not go for 'the well-trodden paths'.

Our session was 2005-2006. Our Honour's final exams were scheduled to be held in 2009, according to our academic calendar. But it was held in September 2011 because of session jam. Now seven months have passed, but the results of our Honour's final exams have not been published as yet. In the meantime, we can not apply for jobs as our results have not been published. Even we can't take admission in Master's programme. So, we are losing invaluable time from our life.. It should be mentioned here that the private and public universities of Bangladesh are publishing their results in due time. Only the students of the national university are the sufferers. So we urge the authorities concerned to address the problem of session jams in the nation al university and ensure publishing of the Honours finasl exam results without further delay.//////Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is the front runner for President, as the formal and informal consultations among the constituents of the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) on the election, scheduled for July, gained momentum.//////Chinese President Hu Jintao yesterday called for the United States and China to respect each other's concerns, amid a row over a dissident who fled to the US embassy.//////The UN admitted a shaky three-week-old truce in Syria is not holding but said the number of observers would be doubled within days, as violence erupted yesterday near Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo.//////Myanmar's army is poised for a major assault on Kachin minority rebels, the guerilla group said yesterday, despite calls for an end to the violence which has cast a shadow over the new regime's reforms.//////Egypt's military rulers yesterday vowed that this month's presidential election will be fair and moved to assure the public it would hand over power, a day after a deadly attack on an anti-military protest.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is looking forward to meeting dynamic and influential Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee next week during which she will discuss the progress made by West Bengal under her leadership and her take on India-Bangladesh ties.//////Newly released papers from Osama Bin Laden's hideout reveal a frustrated al-Qaeda leader struggling to control an unruly network, the US military says.//////Secret diaries of an Australian woman who was one of young Barack Obama's girlfriends, show the warmth and trust of the future president in love, but also hint at his reserve and "coolness."//////Russia yesterday said its dispute with the United States over missile defence was near a "dead end" and warned it might have to deploy new rockets in Europe to take out elements of the controversial shield.//////Libyan authorities granted immunity to former rebels who fought to oust Muammar Gaddafi's regime and has criminalised any glorification of the former leader, in laws passed yesterday.//////Nepal's Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai will disband his cabinet and form a new national unity government in a bid to end the country's political deadlock, an aide said yesterday.//////French President Nicolas Sarkozy made a last-ditch appeal to far-right voters yesterday after failing to land a knockout blow in a heated televised debate with Socialist rival Francois Hollande before tomorrow's presidential runoff.//////Maoist rebels in central India released a government official yesterday after holding him hostage for nearly two weeks in the latest of a series of kidnappings by the guerrillas, police said.//////The toll from one of India's worst ferry disasters rose to 113 yesterday as rescuers fished out the bodies of more passengers who drowned when the boat sank in a river in Assam state.//////Khartoum yesterday said it seeks peace with South Sudan and hopes the small country responds favourably to African Union and UN resolutions for ending hostilities.//////The UN Security Council on Wednesday ordered sanctions against three "very significant" North Korean state firms over the country's failed rocket launch, US ambassador Susan Rice said.//////Gunmen armed with explosives killed at least 34 people in northeastern Nigeria when they attacked a cattle market and burned it to the ground, residents and officials said yesterday.//////Former House speaker Newt Gingrich dropped his erratic campaign for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination Wednesday, but pledged to remain in the public eye as an "active citizen."//////Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks set to sail to an easy victory in early general elections likely to take place in September, a series of polls showed yesterday.//////Yemeni soldiers killed eight al-Qaeda militants as they tried to attack an army post in the southern province of Abyan yesterday, the defence ministry said.//////A Cairo meeting between Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal and an official of the rival Fatah movement made no headway on the formation of a Palestinian national unity government, an official said yesterday.//////Yesterday marked the 83rd birth anniversary of writer and social activist Jahanara Imam.

Which leads us to this rightful question. What is happiness if contentious politicians, suicide bombers and trigger happy gunmen can make a happier country?//////The thought has occurred to me before, but seems more relevant now. If you are lucky in life, you become a statue in death. If you are super lucky, you turn into a giant statue, majestically distinct from the torso-sized apparitions where it is impossible to determine whether our hero had a sparse moustache or merely the misfortune of a diarrheic bird dropping by for a rest and a chat on his head. The great icons of a nation get disfigured on a mammoth scale, whether it is Gandhi dominating India's Parliament or Lincoln staring grimly from America's Mount Rushmore. It needs distance to get sufficient perspective on such majesty. No man is a hero to his valet, possibly because the valet stands too close to nose hair.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit to Dhaka unveils tomorrow. Her sojourn in Dhaka comes on the heels of her Beijing trip along with US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

Over the past year, across the Middle East and North Africa, ordinary citizens found their voices using social media and blogs. But freedom of expression continues to be repressed in many countries and some have seen a significant decline in media freedoms. Around the world, journalists, bloggers and others have been obstructed from doing their work by being harassed, monitored, detained, or subjected to violence. //////Microsoft Imagine Cup is the world's premier student technology competition which has been running for almost a decade.
