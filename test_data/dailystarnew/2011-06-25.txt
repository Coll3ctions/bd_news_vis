This Is Embarrassing.

It is blue in colour and has a strong odour. The production of ozone in ground level atmosphere (troposphere) is regarded negatively because it comes from pollutants, which result from industrial activities, transport operation and some natural sources. On the other hand, the natural production of ozone in the stratosphere is necessary because it plays a key role in protecting life on Earth from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. The major environmental problems we are facing now is its decreasing level in the stratosphere and the increasing level in the troposphere due to anthropogenic activities. //////In recent days, Bangladesh is facing serious problem due to the shortage of natural gas supply.

He was there at Dumbarton Oaks when the United Nations was given shape. As Soviet permanent representative to the world body, he stamped his nation's signature on the formative stages of the UN. He served as deputy foreign minister.

As ambassador to Washington, it was his job not merely to present Soviet diplomacy in as bright a light as possible but also take a measure of the way American policy makers shaped attitudes to his country.//////Imagine a man attempting to understand a woman.
