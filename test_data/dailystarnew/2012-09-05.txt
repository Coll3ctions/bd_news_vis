The rate has declined to 40% within 9 years which is a great achievement. But still more than 7000 mothers die each year due to pregnancy-related complications. Study shows that 90% of such deaths can be prevented by making their health and wellbeing a priority. Is it not a big tragedy? We have only three years left to achieve MDG-5. In order to achieve the target, we have to reduce maternal mortality rate by 25 percent by 2015. A study found that women's low status in society, poor quality of maternity care services, lack of trained providers, low uptake of services by women, and unfriendly hospitals -- all contribute to the high rate of maternal deaths. The situation is also compounded by strong cultural and traditional beliefs that deter women from delivering at healthcare clinics or with medically trained attendants. Under these circumstances, if we want to achieve the MDG-5 by the stipulated time, the government, national and international organisations including UN organisations should come forward and work hard together and invest in safe motherhood programmes to drastically reduce the rate of maternal deaths. //////I stay at Gulshan 1.

They are only developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, to which every country has inalienable right. Still the imperialists are drumming up their false propaganda that Iran's possession of nuclear weapon is very dangerous for the world peace. The saner people of the world are now aware of the fact that the imperialists are the real enemy of peace. It is they who invaded Iraq and destroyed the excellent infrastructure of the country on the false premise that Saddan Hossain possessed WMD. //////I draw your attention to the news item in your daily (Sept 1), "Quader slaps rail staff which any law-abiding, self-respecting and sensitive person anywhere in the world would find disturbing, offensive and in violation of human rights and human dignity. Restoring order and discipline in the communications ministry (or for that matter, in any ministry or government department) under the vigilance of the minister concerned is laudable, but verbal or physical abuse of any employee by any minister or high official is simply a criminal offence. In any country with some semblance of the rule of law (including Sri Lanka and India), the minister would have been arrested for resorting to physical violence and most definitely he would have lost his job, and the victim would have got due compensation.//////Prof Yunus is one of the most famous and honoured personalities in the present day world.

In the picture, women wearing veils were compared to a covered piece of chocolate and women not wearing veils were compared to an uncovered piece of chocolate which gets dirty and attracts flies. To my horror, I noticed that a number of well-educated people appreciated it. Needless to say, whoever posted it, tried to glorify the veiled women and demean the non-veiled women. Nowadays Facebook is a very powerful social networking site and it can be used to influence millions of its users on various issues. So I earnestly request all sensible users to discourage this sort of nonsensical post.//////The death of Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, is really a great loss to humanity as he is known to be the most renowned space traveller in the world.
