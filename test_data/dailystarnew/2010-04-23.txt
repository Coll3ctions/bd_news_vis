In a little more detail, one is to understand that of the 405 decisions made by the council of ministers, a total of 325 have been carried out. It is now a mere 80 that are being worked on. We are happy that the government has decided to enlighten the nation on its achievements and has, in such an appreciable way, taken the people into its confidence. It conveys the government's sense of accountability and there should be more of it. However, even as we appreciate the move, we will hope that this self-assessment about its performance has nothing to do with being self-congratulatory. //////THE Department of Environment (DoE)'s suing four ship-breaking yards in Chittagong for polluting environment is a clear case of misplaced emphasis, to put it politely. With an amendment to the import order letting toxic ships in without pre-inspection certification either by the supplier or the importer, the litigation is actually an eye-wash and playing to the gallery. As far as a response to the surging genuine concerns over the state of ship-breaking yards goes, it even sounds diversionary. In fact, another ministry of the government, namely, commerce ministry, deciding 'to allow dismantling vessels built with toxic substances', the four breaking yards in question have been sued. What does this work out to?//////The just concluded National Cricket League T20s was a perfect comeback tournament for country's leading paceman Mashrafe Bin Mortaza. It was not only because the "Narail Express" became man-of-the-tournament for his striking all-round showing of ten wickets and 93 runs, rather he got back the much needed self-confidence ahead of the ICC World Twenty20 to start from April 30 in West Indies. //////Cricket, at the highest level, is no longer just about bat and ball. Starting from a computer analyst to a spin bowling coach, a cricket team's needs have changed considerably from the days when a player himself was considered the best coach. Now with the advent of professionalism at both the international and domestic level, it would be quite the task to tell a cricketer to coach the team as well.//////Sachin Tendulkar, the Mumbai Indians captain, has injured a finger on his right hand during the semifinal against Royal Challengers Bangalore, making him uncertain for the final on Sunday.

After examining records and witnesses, District and Sessions Judge M Mominullah handed down the verdict.//////Our capital city is almost in the middle of the country. Other important cities are not more than 500km from Dhaka city. So, it is very easy to provide a high quality transportation system either by railway or highway. But unfortunately we are far behind other countries in this respect. My focus is on railway. Railway can be a very profitable sector for government. Rail journey is much more comfortable and safer than any other mode of transport. It can be a first choice of travel and carrying goods. It is unclear to me that even now we are not able to provide a good railway system throughout the country. Last month I travelled from Dhaka to Brahmanbaria by "Mohanagar Provati. It took two(2) hours to reach the place. Distance was 142 km. i.e. it travelled 70 km /hr. Cleanliness and other services of this train is praiseworthy. But what about other routes? My home town is Jamalpur. There are four inter-city and two commuter trains on this route. Distance from Dhaka to Jamalpur is 177km. But it takes six hours to reach at an average speed of 30km/hr! We want to get rid of this nightmare. People on this route are not travelling free of cost. They are also paying. They also have important works. They also want to reach home early. We want at least 70-80km/hr train service. It is not an impossible task. The easy solution is to construct double-line from Dhaka to other mega cities. Proper maintenance is also required. //////Droughts are recurrent features in Bangladesh, affecting plant growth and leading to loss of crop production, food shortage and for many people starvation. The records of incidence of drought in Bangladesh indicate that the north-western region of Bangladesh is the most drought prone. During the last 50 years, Bangladesh suffered about 20 times from droughts. The 1973 drought was one of the severest in the past century and was responsible for 1974-local famine in northern Bangladesh.//////Pahela Baishakh was, and should be a day to remember for all of us! Not for the red and white dresses, nor the songs and cultural activities, but for the 'UNUSUAL' absence of load shedding! Load shedding has become a daily reality-- much like the morning cup of tea. That day it was a significant beginning of the New Year heralded by its absence! Till the time of this writing (around 7.30pm!), we have not lost a minute of electricity to load shedding. A rare event, worth more celebration than the New Year with its surprising and possibly auspicious(?) beginning!//////Remittance inflow in our country increased by 20 percent in 2009. More than one crore Bangladeshis are now living abroad. Their remittances contribute to our GDP hugely. But there is absence of proper legal platform to send the money. Expatriates are somehow compelled to remit through illegal channels. Recently, Eastern Bank, Dhaka Bank & mobile operator Banglalink launched a cell phone-based remittance transfer system. They will allow the remittance receivers to cash in a day. The banks will offer mobile wallet accounts to the remittance receivers through Banglalink network.//////Biodiversity is the multitude of different living beings in a particular ecosystem or on the whole Earth. Biodiversity can be seen and studied at different organisational levels: genetic, organisational and ecological. It touches upon both native environments on land and sea as well as agricultural and other man-made surroundings. In agriculture, 7000 species of plants are used by farmers somewhere in the world, critics of Genetically Engineered Food (GE food) claim that the products of biotechnology threaten biodiversity. Every year hundreds of millions of pounds of organophosphate insecticides are sprayed on crops. These broad-spectrum insecticides kill virtually every insect on contact. The run-off from the sprays kills even more organisms in the soil and waterways. In an ideal world, we could just stop all use of these chemicals. But, unfortunately, such drastic measures would reduce crop yields. //////It is obvious that, our government is committed to turning Bangladesh into a 'Digital Country'. Highlighting such a great plan, the prime minister has called on the whole nation to use Internet as a means of exchanging information, news, views and so on. As the benefits of Internet are well known, I needn't discuss them here. //////Female students of public and private universities still suffer due to poor transport system. //////Global warming is a common issue today. The Arctic polar cap and Himalayan ice are melting and the sea level is rising gradually. Global warming and melting of ice is directly going to affect people living in the coastal areas. Sea level rise is a grim possibility and it poses a serious threat to people living in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. Twenty-five percent of our coastal areas may be submerged in the next fifty to hundred years, creating a huge problem of re-settlement of millions of people living in the coastal districts and can turn into a major national disaster. //////Being citizens of an independent country, I know the first thing that people need is security of life. But are we getting it really? Keeping our eyes in the newspaper, every day we watch all sorts of crimes being committed. //////I am greatly disappointed by the news of physical harassment of females by youths on Dhaka University campus after sunset on the day of Pahela Baishakh.

If the authorities were serious enough then in this computer age such a long time would not be required for publishing the final results. //////How dangerous times we the students are passing through! Students are being killed one after another! Student politics has been turned into an excuse for killing people! As if anyone belonging to any political group or scholastic institution can be killed any time! And afterwards, though some committees are formed for investigation, hardly any one is found guilty in the end due to lack of enough evidence. //////To free Dhaka from traffic congestion we are thinking of the introduction of underground and sky train services, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), elevated expressway etc. However, an easy, speedy, low cost and sustainable solution would be a Surface Train Metro Service (STMS) from Joydevpur to Narayanganj with all intersections grade separated. Double Decker Trains at every 2 to 5 minutes, as required, in this route can reduce the traffic congestion of Dhaka significantly, since most of the Dhaka's traffic generation points lie along this line. The track can be 4 lines from Kamalapur to Tongi with 2 dedicated lines for the Metro; else the central station can be shifted to Tongi. Some positive aspects of this project are: //////To the Bengalis it seems like something fishy is going on in India.
