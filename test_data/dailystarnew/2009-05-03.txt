But what is important is to see that the measures are put into effect on a sustained basis. It may not be out of place to mention that we have been witness to similar articulations in the past from governments assuming the reins of power but down the road the instructions were seen to lose much of its force and in the end to frizzle out. However, we would like to believe that, given the current global economic downturn whose effects we have already begun feeling, the government means business.//////THE Pakistan army has for the past few days been locked in fierce battle with the Taliban in Buner town just a hundred kilometers from Islamabad. The government's report that fourteen militants have been killed has now been followed by new reports of the Taliban kidnapping a number of Pakistani security personnel.

What does he do to get under the skin of quality batsmen like Kevin Pietersen and what does he have to get a hattrick in a Twenty20 game? It's too easy to dismiss it as luck for there is intelligence -- street smartness, perhaps -- in his bowling.//////Rajasthan Royals staged a dramatic fightback to upset table-toppers Deccan Chargers by three wickets in their Indian Premier League match here on Saturday.//////Mohammad Yousuf has claimed that he has "resigned" from the ICL after he decided last month that his priority was to play for Pakistan.

Concerns about the Swine flu contributed to an increase in risk aversion and weighed on investor sentiment. The Mexican peso fell 3 pct versus the dollar, and hit a 3-week low after reports of the outbreak surfaced. The WSJ report on Bank of America and Citigroup further contributed to the strength of the yen and the d	+ollar, which tend to rise in times of risk aversion.  By the end of the week the dollar fell broadly, hitting a three week low against a basket of currencies as speculation the global economic downturn is slowing continued to raise demand for riskier assets. The euro climbed along with high-yielders as investors looked beyond a weak headline reading of US growth and focused on signs the economy may soon pick up, an outlook suggested by the Federal Reserve in its policy statement on Wednesday. This kept intact a broad, ongoing improvement in market sentiment and risk demand, which analysts said would continue so long as economic data does not significantly alter the view that the global economy is starting to show signs of recovery. Concerns about the spread of swine flu waned on the view that the disease thus far would have limited economic impact, and a report of an imminent bankruptcy filing by Chrysler did little to stifle the risk rally, with analysts saying that markets have already priced in the US automaker's failure.//////Speakers at a seminar yesterday called on the government to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Family without delay to safeguard the rights of about 65 lakh Bangladeshi workers.//////A four-member team of Bangla Mountaineering and Trekking Club (BMTC) will leave Dhaka for Nepal on May 7 to conquer 20075 feet high Lobuje Peak in the Himalayas.//////Inspector General of Police (IGP) Nur Mohammad said the police should provide information to the press for the sake of transparency and national interest.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday called upon the industrialists to be humane to the workers and meet their fundamental needs, and requested the labourers not to create any anarchy destroying the country's exports. //////Several hundred children were bubbling with excitement and joy as a celebrated magician performed his jugglery, a technique that appeared very fruitful in delivering messages to kids at rural schools.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked engineers to be honest in their work and forewarned that any negligence in maintaining quality of construction work will be considered unpardonable.//////Speakers at a seminar on Friday said the concerned authorities should strengthen the existing monitoring system whether the industry owners follow the labour law to ensure rights of the labourers as they are exploited due to lack of proper monitoring.//////Speakers at a human chain programme yesterday urged the prime minister and her cabinet colleagues to stop use of air conditioner to reduce loadshedding.//////Health ministers from Commonwealth countries will meet in Geneva, Switzerland on May 17 to discuss 'Health and climate change', a theme of special relevance to the Commonwealth's developing countries and its small island states.//////Speaker Abdul Hamid Advocate yesterday called on the guardians and child organisers to make children aware of some certain quarters who distort the real history of the liberation war.//////A seven-week course titled 'Executive certificate in public health management' was launched at a ceremony at Brac Centre in the city yesterday.//////Speakers at BBC Bangladesh Sanglap yesterday said the government should monitor commodity markets regularly and ensure proper supply of products by activating Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) to ensure lower price rates of essentials.//////Kendrio Khelaghar Asar honoured 11 of its members, who took part in the Liberation War, at a ceremony at Liberation War Museum in the city yesterday. //////The Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College organised an art competition for the children in the city on Friday marking the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day 2009. //////The Supreme Court (SC) may hold hearing today on the leave to appeal petitions against the High Court (HC) judgment that had declared illegal the 5th Amendment to the Constitution endorsing late president Ziaur Rahman's takeover and previous acts from August 15, 1975.//////Indiscriminate lifting of earth from the banks of the Naboganga by local land grabbers is threatening the river and its surroundings.//////Two underground operatives, charge-sheeted in murder and other criminal cases filed against them during the last ten years, have also filed petitions with the deputy commissioner of Khulna to withdraw the cases.//////Hundreds of mango trees in the district are being affected with gummosis disease, locally known as athajhora rog, much to the worry of mango growers.//////A Correspondent, //////A six-year-old girl was raped at Kotalipara in Gopalganj on Friday.

According to police, the victim's family and locals, neighbour Suranjan Roy, 20, took the girl to a jute field at Uttar Para village and raped her and left her there profusely bleeding. Suranjan is now absconding.//////Observance of  May Day requires establishment of workers rights. Otherwise, it would be a hollow celebration of a day.//////Dhaka city is 400 years old  and it is only recognised when one visits the old part of the city. Although it is the city heart but now it's in a very deplorable condition. The slums are increasing and footpaths are occupied by poor people.  This part is endowed with architectural masterpieces   like Lalbagh Kella and Ahsan Monjil, etc. //////The busy, clogged up Dhaka city and it dwellers need to have some sort of comfort while commuting throughout the day to their destinations. Cars and rickshaws,  according to many people,  are the main reason of the city's traffic congestions. //////It is good to note that the present government has felt the necessity to reform our existing education system which is not only obsolete and ineffective but also corrupt. It has constituted an education commission with some of our illustrious educationists as its members. May be within the next three to six months, the commission will compile a report and submit it to the government for its consideration. The government will probably take another six months to study the report to find out how quickly and efficiently it can implement the recommendations. Finally, in about another six months or so, the government will forget about the report and put it in the deep fridge. One may ask why I should be so pessimistic about the new education commission. The answer is very simple. All the reports submitted by the past education commissions in our country had met the same fate. In the face of agitation on the streets,  the parties or persons in power never found it expedient to take any action on these reports. However, in the process the state every time had to spend in vain a huge amount of money to launch and run the activities of such education commissions.//////Armed with a weapon of a new kind, a breed of new age warriors have taken over the streets of Dhaka. But Bangladesh isn't at war with anyone. Who are these soldiers? What are they fighting for? asks my friend Nabil.//////Arrangement of talk shows on regular basis in private tv channels has become routine programmes. Whenever someone  switches on the television set the viewer will find a talk show or personal interview of people from  different fields. Many of the participants are not eminently known to the viewers. By the grace of private channels they get opportunity to express their views on many issues. The idea of the tv channels is good and I believe it is intended to educate their viewers with in-depth knowledge and information  on some current issues.//////I am writing in response to  Sayed Zain AlMahmood's  letter   'Seize the moment' published in the Star Magazine on 13 March. At  the outset, I would like to convey my heartiest thanks to him for his outstanding, timely & informative article on road accidents. In his writing, he gave a vivid picture and statistics of the causes & casualties of road accidents occurring  in Bangladesh and around the world. He terms road accident as a forgotten epidemic & compares it to  malaria and tuberculosis which get timely attention from the government, media & donors. He also mentions that road crashes cost us roughly 2% of the GDP every year & is almost equal to the total foreign aid received by Bangladesh in a fiscal year. Bangladesh has one of the worst crash rates  in the world-- more than 100 deaths per 10, 0000 vehicles. He further shows that the official figure for road deaths is three to four thousand a year.//////After thirty-eight years of our independence,  the donors & multilateral financial agencies are  becoming  controversial for their roles as development partners of our nation-state Bangladesh. //////Students/examinees numbering about 1500 were instructed to welcome the Member of Parliament and  the  people accompanying him at Adhar Chandra High School, Savar. Young students did so despite  a record high temperature in the country in decades last Monday. In doing  so,   students/examinees had to suffer for about two  hours from the heat wave which could have caused health hazard to them  and could be cause for even death from heatstroke.We condemn such undemocratic and cruel acts.//////Remember the immortal lines of Shakespeare? My horse, my horse, the kingdom for my horse!  The BNP's stand  on Khaleda Zia's residence seems  to be similar. There really is no issue. She was allowed to stay on in her husband's temporary residence after he was killed in a military putsch. She is  no more helpless. Therefore it is not expected that she stays on in that house and carry on with her political activities. //////We know that some government schools and colleges will be established in Dhaka city under a project,  which is  now under consideration. //////I do not expect  that all my reactions to the prevailing political situation in Bangladesh would be published in the newspapers.  I had the opportunity to watch a few satellite tv footage. I have comments on one or more of them as follows://////With the installation of a new government, changes in the bureaucratic administrative systems are inevitable and it has been practised in most of the countries in the world as the new the government sometimes lacks confidence in the bureaucrats  who had worked with the immediate past government or immediate past political government.//////After bird flu, now it is swine flu! Recently detected in the United States of America, swine flu or swine influenza virus takes 24 to 48 hours to incubate after intrusion into the human body.

Excerpts from the interview//////It is rare for the Delhi audience to applaud loudly at the end of a film. However, even the most blas film goer clapped along at the conclusion of  Dharm in New Delhi recently.

In fact I would even go so far as to voice my protest against such celebrations as "Women's Day" because it makes me feel as though all other days are "Men's Day."//////IT'S actually quite stupefying to think that women themselves also act against the rights of their own kind. A section of male readers could jump up at the previous sentence and breathe a sigh of relief. And yet, that remains the reality.//////WOMEN'S sport has taken quite a beating from obscurantist groups in the recent past. And it doesn't help when the media helps to accidentally bolster the view of the bigots by publishing sexualised literature about women's sport. In a magazine piece that talked about women participating in the 2008 Olympics, a woman athlete was described as follows: "She participated at the summer Olympics as a Javelin thrower, and although her performance was not particularly one to remember, her physical splendour remains as a flag for people to reminisce on."//////
