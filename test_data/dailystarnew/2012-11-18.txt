The muscular West Indies pace bowler was not in any credible discussion during the first four days of the first Test but seized the spotlight after Bangladesh created a wonderful opportunity of winning the match by claiming the last four second innings wickets of the touring side even before the dew had dried up on the fifth morning at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.//////Although the president exercises the right to grant a convict clemency, it is actually the prime minister who is responsible for it. //////It was a pleasant surprise for the foreign writers who joined the Hay Festival Dhaka to have a gift from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.//////With the staging of Rabindranath Tagore's "Shapmochon" by Pallavi Dance Centre and rendition of Lalon Shah's mystic songs by Arif Ali Baul, the curtain fell on the three-day Hay Festival Dhaka yesterday. //////A mobile court in Dhaka yesterday sentenced the managing director of a cosmetics company, his director wife and a supervisor to two years' imprisonment for using harmful substances in the company's products.//////Myanmar's president has pledged to consider new rights for the stateless Rohingya minority ahead of a landmark visit by President Barack Obama, but stopped short of a full commitment that citizenship and other new freedoms would be granted.//////National Human Rights Commission Chairman Prof Mizanur Rahman yesterday criticised a section of experts for favouring the entrance of Rohingyas into Bangladesh on humanitarian grounds. //////Two BNP leaders yesterday criticised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for threatening to implement sharia and alleged that the government intended to create instability in the country by misleading the people.//////Speaker Abdul Hamid yesterday expressed frustration over the low prices of paddy, saying if the farmers do not get fair prices for their produce, it may have a negative impact on the ruling Awami League's votes in the next general election.//////Firebrand Indian right wing politician Bal Thackeray, who founded Shiv Sena party, died in Mumbai yesterday after suffering a cardiac arrest.//////The family of Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, a Bangladeshi arrested by US federal authorities in a sting operation last month, hopes the government will provide the youth with legal aid.//////Tangail-3 (Ghatail) constituency goes to by-election today.//////Home Minister MK Alamgir yesterday reiterated that the government will not hold dialogue with Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. //////Two activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League beat up a police constable at the city's Baya police outpost yesterday evening for making them pull over their motorcycle for checking.//////Israeli aircraft bombed Hamas government buildings in Gaza yesterday, including the prime minister's office, after Israel's cabinet authorized the mobilization of up to 75,000 reservists, preparing for a possible ground invasion.//////An adrenaline junkie soared through the air in a boat attached to hundreds of balloons on Friday as part of a test flight for an ambitious attempt to cross the Atlantic.//////The UN Security Council was to meet in an emergency session yesterday after UN attack helicopters launched missions against rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, diplomats said.//////Human Rights Forum (HRF), a national coalition of 19 rights and development organizations, has portrayed a disquieting picture of the human rights situation. The statistics over the last four years of the AL-led Mohajote government speak for themselves: a total of 156 people have disappeared and 462 got killed in what is euphemistically called crossfire between 2009 and 2012. The figures work out to 39 'forced' disappearances and slightly above 115 extra-judicial killings respectively per year.//////With Israel's massive air attacks on Hamas-ruled Gaza strip on Wednesday and Hamas militants responding with rocket fires, the fear that the conflict may spiral into a full-fledged second Gaza war is rising. Israeli air attacks have already taken severe toll of civilian lives in Gaza. //////In future when someone, other than those who keenly followed the five-day classic, looks back at the first Test between Bangladesh and West Indies he or she will only see another defeat of the Tigers. But the scoreline of the 77-run loss will not reflect how intensely the game was fought at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. And there was reason for the home team's members to hold their heads high despite the defeat as they really fought hard in their first match in a year against the Caribbean side. Credit should be given to the West Indies bowlers, especially Tino Best, for initiating the collapse with raw pace and an array of short balls. While the local boys showed the character that fans had been crying out for long, it was not an easy task for a team like Bangladesh to chase down a target of 245 on the fifth day track or survive 78 overs for a creditable draw.//////West Indies captain Darren Sammy's reaction at the post match press conference at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday perhaps best described the way the game's balance 'see-sawed' from one side to the other. It was, in a sense, a mixture of both joy and relief that engulfed every statement made by the visiting captain.//////A mere glance at the scorecard reveals the influence that Shohag Gazi has had on Bangladesh's bowling in this Test match. Of the 14 wickets that Bangladesh took, nine of them were taken by the off-spinner. His 6 for 74 in the third innings of the Test is the best bowling figure by a Bangladesh debutant, surpassing pacer Manjural Islam's 6 for 81 in 2001. Perhaps more importantly, he has filled the off-spinner's void in the national team, a void that the selectors had been wanting to fill for some time.//////West Indian bowler Tino Best perhaps bowled the spell of his life yesterday at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium as his maiden five-wicket haul in Test cricket, 5 for 24, turned the tables of a game that seemed to be heading towards a rare win for the hosts.//////International Cricket Council (ICC) president Allan Isaac, who came to Bangladesh on Friday on a two-day 'goodwill' visit, stated that the ICC would readily support a tour of Pakistan if Bangladesh decided to travel.//////There were a number of similarities between Shohag Gazi and Veerasammy Permaul. They both love to smack the ball to the fence and all their wickets came off conventional spin-bowling. A battle between them, therefore, was bound to be interesting. Gazi had the edge initially, after he bowled Permaul off the last delivery of the fourth day. He also hit him for a six and two fours yesterday. Permaul though had the last word as he got his counterpart caught at mid-off, after Gazi tried to swing his blade once too often. //////Rangana Herath bagged a five-wicket haul to put Sri Lanka in a strong position on the opening day of the first Test against New Zealand in Galle on Saturday.//////France's Olympic gold medallist Camille Muffat set a new world record in the short course women's 800m freestyle event at the French championships on Friday.//////The first round of qualifying for the Focal Point 26th International Junior Tennis Championship started at the National Tennis Complex in Ramna yesterday.

His century carried his team to 299 for three and a lead of 60 by the close. Mominul Haque was batting on 54 and Chittagong will want him to score big today to bat Rajshahi out of the match.//////Border Guard Bangladesh thrashed Bangladesh Prison by 43-13 points in the opening fixture of the Walton Motorcycle Super Seven Services Kabaddi League at the Kabaddi Stadium yesterday.

Her recent book Where I live combines Arundhathi's first two Indian collections of poetry. Arundhathi was at Hay Festival Dhaka yesterday and spoke to The Daily Star. //////It seemed somehow appropriate that any discussion on cricket should start at the figurative crack of dawn.

For EU officials, the decision makes sense since the award goes to an institution that really deserves it. EU supporters are delighted by the fact that it is the only regional intergovernmental organisation to win the prestigious peace prize. The other intergovernmental organisations to win the peace prize are in one way or another affiliated to the United Nations.
