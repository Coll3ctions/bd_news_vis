I went on the bus the other day, my car being unavailable, and had the most mind boggling experience.//////The last few days it has been overcast and cloudy in Boston, with the sun playing a game of hide and seek with massive patches of clouds, trying to break out of the cover of clouds, but losing the battle more often than not. Cloudy days are not my favorite ones, and during fall and winter, when days are short and nights are long, I am not eager to jump out of bed and start my daily routine if it's cloudy and dark outside. On any given morning, before I get out of bed, I make sure that the sun has made its appearance on the eastern horizon. Why? Because if the sun is not up yet, I feel very little urge to get up myself. During the winter months, when it is dark by 5 PM, and the night sometimes lasts almost 14 hours, I feel the sun gets more rest than we do. I hardly ever get more than seven hours of sleep, whereas the sun has at least twelvetherefore, I don't see why the sun can't be up in the morning before I do. Also, I need the sun to get me started. Nothing wakes me up and energizes me as much as the sight of the rising sun in the morning.//////The wind chime was a melancholy window from which a choir of sadness filled my heart to the extent of non-existence.

While Clark's comment is undebatable, it is also true that Darwish's poetry transcends its national boundary by reflecting on universal humane values through the mirror of the Palestinian experience. It is one of the major reasons why Darwish now is a great name in world literature. Memory for Forgetfulness is his exquisitely written prose-memoir. Ibrahim Muhawi's adept translation brings out the delicacy of the piece. It is based on Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 that was aimed at wiping out the PLO's base from southern Lebanon. The fact seems most startling when one reads the memoir containing evocative details of Beirut under siege. Darwish, however, lifts up the sufferings of the invasion to an aesthetic level through his musings on reality, belonging, history, resistance and the role of art involving these. The entire book is an extended internal monologue (the poet's thoughts in his mind) about which Robyn Creswell writes in Harper Magazine's January 2009 issue: //////Tourism of the world is always influenced by Asian tourism. The thing has become constant for ages because of its multicultural fervor and colorful biodiversity.
