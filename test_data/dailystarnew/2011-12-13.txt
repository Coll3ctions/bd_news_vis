Like Aristotle, he rejected the idea of vacuum, believing that there can be no space (extension) without substance. In accord with his philosophy, Descartes denied the intelligibility of weight as a primitive quality of matter, and argued that material bodies are impelled toward the Earth by the impulse of particles of a second species of matter continually arriving at the Earth from all directions. Galileo, in his Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences (1638), chose not to commit himself to any particular cause of gravity, indicating that he thought such speculations were premature at the present state of science. He wrote//////Pyrite, better known as fool's gold, was known to the ancient Romans and has led prospectors astray for centuries. But it has now also helped some researchers discover related substances that they say offer new, cheap and promising options for solar energy.//////A fundamental principle of physics, especially of quantum mechanics, is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principl. It states that one can never know for sure both the position and the velocity of a particle. That means the more accurately one knows about the position of a particle, the less accurately one knows about its velocity. The uncertainty principle, also known as Indeterminacy Principle, was developed by German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927. The concept relates to the inherent indeterminacy in the simultaneous measurement of the position and velocity of a particle. And once the velocity of the particle is precisely known, the knowledge of its position in space becomes completely indeterminate.//////Scientists have discovered an unusual kind of battery at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean: a living one, fueled by microbes that live near hydrothermal vents.//////Meteorite, or ALM, was found on Dec. 5, 1912.

It is believed that it has an elliptical orbit which, every 26 million years, sends matter towards the earth causing mass Extinction events. It was the discovery of these seemingly regular events that gave rise to the hypothesis in the first place. The star is predicted to be most likely a red or brown dwarf and has been named Nemesis or Death Star. //////
