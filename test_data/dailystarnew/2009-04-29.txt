It certainly makes sense. The fact that MPs need such space to do their work has been acknowledged especially since 1991 when democracy was restored in Bangladesh. There is hardly anyone who will disagree with the idea that lawmakers, like their counterparts in the US and at Westminster, must be provided with all the facilities that will enable them to perform their public responsibilities to the satisfaction of their constituents. One wonders, though, as to why such a long-felt need of our parliamentarians has not so long been addressed.//////IT is good to note that Bangladesh government has been quick to respond to early warnings issued by the WHO on swine flu which it has dubbed as 'public health emergency of international concern'. This virus capable of mutating into more dangerous strain and transmitting into humans as the growing number of victims has already proven needs surely to be guarded against.//////A group of individuals have made it known that national security is in a state of threat with the present government running the show. They are dead wrong. And how they are wrong is for the government to explain.

He exhibited that today, nonchalantly picking up Manpreet Gony for a six over long leg.

People are just helpless. //////Bangladesh is the most densely populated country  in the world. The growth rate of population here is still high.  But the land mass  of the country does not increase, not even an inch. Besides, the agricultural land is reducing every day. Why not, every day new schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, offices, courts, playgrounds roads, homes, markets bazars, trade centres, industries etc are being established on the agricultural land. //////Although the steam is getting less powerful, the BNP activists are still holding the street to retain the house. A newly empowered heavy weight politician of the BNP, who happens to be a lawyer, is really out to make all kinds of arguments to retain the house of his leader. Bangladesh is a country of extraordinary judicial culture--for some one's mistake or favour the country will have to pay for it. Even  constitutional protection is given to protect an illegal and immoral act of individual and of the government. The learned lawyers of the BNP might find a way out to save the house so that they are not evicted from the place of birth and bastion of power. This is well said by the SG of the BNP. according to him,  ' Minus cantonment means minus politics or minus one " what an interesting admission of the political ideology of the party. We feel baffled learning that the house is donated to the entire family of president Zia, which means they will inherit the right from generation to generation and the basic political ideology will carry with them. I thank the political mentor for taking such a farsighted action for the newly born political party in 1975. This is called political statesmanship. The learned lawyers might be saving the heritage whether it is illegal or immoral by any standard.//////Your timely editorial, highlighting the sad plight of railways on April 18, deserves the government's serious attention. This matter is of national interest; since railways provide the cheapest mode of passenger and goods transportation.

Basic source of energy is gas and goal. Gas is in short supply. So  its exploration  needs to be expedited.//////The so-called Islamic militancy is an  "unlawful war" of some misguided people against the civilized society. The members of the militant groups claim themselves to be Muslims and are waging war in the name Islam. If we look at their latest front of war, they are killing  fellow Muslims inside the very prayer houses i.e. mosques. For example, we are watching what is happening in Pakistan-- the so-called Islamists are killing their brothers and sisters in the mosques on special prayers day, the Friday. So, it is very easy to understand that the so-called Islamists are not real Muslims but they are using Islam and destroying its image.  //////The propriety of ACC's action in filling cases against people and the way it spent a huge amount of  taxpayers' money have  been called into question. Many people were put in jail, harassed and humiliated in connection with ACC cases. The role of  the Anti-Corruption Commission during the two years of the caretaker government's rule has come under sharp criticism for the manner in which it instituted cases against  political and business leaders, including two former prime ministers.//////Rashidul Hasan's front-page report of 20 April on the matter  is an eye opener.  However,  the moot question is,  did the minister approve the proposals for the lavish office decoration as reported in another daily as well as for the purchase of a luxurious SUV?//////Some days ago a man came to our office to buy an apartment from a particular project. He wanted to know whether any buyer from Barisal was there. According to him,  it is impossible to live with a neighbour  from Barisal. My other two co-directors smiled silently as I am a man  from Barisal. Over two decades ago,  I along with my wife went to the house of one of my acquaintances. There were a dozen people who were engaged in a debate over who are the worst people in Bangladesh? The conclusion of the debate was  that the people of Comilla, Noakhali & Barisal were the worst! My wife also fell into this category as she is from Noakhali.//////Your recent opinion poll on 100 days of the present government is really a praiseworthy one.//////Mr. Delwar Hossain Khan, popularly known as DHK,  probably the most widely recognized and professionally awarded personality of Bangladesh's pharmaceutical industry,   died  on  Wednesday( 21st April morning)  at a local hospital in Dhaka.//////Education is the backbone of a nation which is imparted by the teacher. In the developed countries in the world, teachers are honoured in many ways. On the other hand,  in our country teachers are neglected. There are many points to discuss but today  we are focusing  on one of the vital issues.//////I would like to draw the kind attention of the general readers  and  the lawmakers of the country in particular  to  the Section 18 (3) of the Arthorin Adalat Ain 2003 (Ain). This is a bad law as it discourages the investors to invest in the long run. No business can guarantee profit. If it could be ensured, then everyone  would  start a business. In practice , only 3-5% of the world population are risk takers i.e.  the entrepreneurs, the prime movers of the economy.//////If it is looked upon from public interest and from the point of inadmissibility of conducting political activities in a restricted and sensitive zone, the proposed cancellation of the lease to Begum Zia of  her cantonment residence in no way goes against the tenets or ethics. Earlier,  as the people were unaware of such a vast land being  under the occupation of a single family, they  had nothing to say against, but now they do not sympathize with the family.  //////Against the backdrop of BCL's destructive activities which have virtually closed almost all the major educational institutions in the country, our prime minister has stepped down as the organisational chief of BCL. Following her resignation,  a legitimate  question arises as to why  she has  done so.  Does she mean she  has  failed to control the BCL? If so, then who else can bring the BCL  back on the right track? It is also possible that she has resigned being frustrated  with the notorious activities of her party's student wing. But her resignation will not bring any  durable solution. She and her government are responsible for  restoring  order in the BCL and create a congenial atmosphere in the educational institutions. Though our PM has sent a message of stern action against those BCL activists who are locked in fighting,  extortion, tender manipulation and other criminal activities, this may not serve the purpose as her message of stern action is not a new one to the BCL men. //////Civilization is changing slowly but surely, during this 21st century the first and the third worlds are under continuous stress, as the rate of change is rising: and the global problems multiply.
