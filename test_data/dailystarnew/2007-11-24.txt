Under the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 and Anti-Corruption Rules, 2007 the operative word was 'may' for an IO to take statement from an accused. The reason why it is now being made mandatory is far too obvious to have been missed so far: whatever the allegations against an accused, his right to defend himself is to be provided for at the very initial stage of the legal process that is marked by investigation. In some cases reportedly, ACC issued notices against graft suspects without conducting inquiry. That such things will now be matter of the past is a proof of the ACC's open-minded flexibility to be correct in its action. //////It is disconcerting news that the shrimp industry in the southern districts received a big blow when hurricane Sidr struck last Thursday night in the coastal areas where the hatcheries are located. The waves and winds combined together to generate a force too formidable for the hatcheries to withstand. As a result, within hours, high quality shrimp varieties including Black Tiger got washed away to the sea causing a loss of about Tk. 250 crore. Besides, factory buildings and other infrastructures also suffered heavy damage that have to be rebuilt all over again. Understandably, shrimp farmers who had taken advance loan from the exporters will now find them in trouble for no fault of theirs.//////The world has watched with great care the holding of the latest session of the Chinese Communist Party Congress in Beijing. There has also been some speculation and analysis about the changes that might have been brought about within the paradigm of governance in China as a result of this Congress.//////Electricity has a great impact on development of a society. In Bangladesh only 30-35 percent of total population can use electricity from national grid. Energy consumption per capita is extremely low compared to neighbouring countries. It is half of Nepal and one fourth of India. In Bangladesh average demand of electricity is 5,200 MW, but average generation is 3,200-3,300 MW. Low consumption of electricity is affecting the entire development of the country. Due to power shortage education, business, health service, agriculture and other productive works have been constantly hampered. We cannot expect that in near future it will be possible to extend the grid system up to the remote villages in the country.//////Chief Adviser Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed's statement (November 6) that the government is working "to strengthen the local government so that it can take its services to people's doorsteps and bring transparency and accountability in all sectors" is a very welcome one, and every sensible person would look forward to seeing the government keeping the pledge. //////It seems that the ability to innovate is beyond our national selectors as sticking to the tried and trusted remains their natural character.//////Venkatsai Laxman and Mahendra Singh Dhoni cracked responsible half-centuries to pull India out of trouble in the opening Test against Pakistan here on Friday.//////The Kotla Test is alive and well.

Alex Kountouris, the team physio, said MacGill was running out of time to improve his fitness but MacGill promised he would do his best to be ready for the first Test against India.//////Apart from a lot of sweating and snake-spotting, England weren't able to ascertain too much from their opening warm-up match at the Colombo Cricket Club. The bowlers toiled with little reward on a dead pitch while the batsmen enjoyed a succession of misleadingly unchallenging innings. Nevertheless, for Alastair Cook, who top-scored with 63 before retiring at the lunch break, the chance to build an innings over the course of two-and-a-half hours was not to be sniffed at.//////Sri Lanka's fast bowler Dilhara Fernando will play in the upcoming Test series against England despite a recurring ankle injury, his captain Mahela Jayawardene said on Friday.//////South Africa will play in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers although guaranteed a place at the finals as hosts. //////Opener Shakil Haider smashed 130 as Team East were off to the perfect start against title contenders on the first day of their final round match of the Challengers Cup at the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium yesterday.//////Indian batsman Vangipurappu Laxman quelled doubters with a valuable 57 not out on the second day of the first Test against Pakistan on Friday.//////Bogra District Women Sports Association formed a 14 members women cricket team on Friday for the next National Cricket League competition in Rajshahi. //////Mohammad Kaif felt repentant and patched up with the press photographer whom he had roughed up for taking his snaps which led to a protest by the media fraternity here and an FIR being lodged in the name of the cricketer.//////India Cricket League executive board chairman Kapil Dev on Friday said that the mystery shrouding the participation of former West Indies captain Brian Lara in the Twenty20 cricket matches of the league would be cleared in next three to four days.//////Defending champions Batch 06 and Batch 05 both recorded solitary goal victories in the NSU Intra-Batch Championships at the WAPDA ground yesterday.//////England do not expect to finalise their line-up for the first Test against Sri Lanka before the second of their warm-up fixtures.//////Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria described Mahendra Singh Dhoni's wicket as a breakthrough for Pakistan to stage a comeback in the first cricket Test against India and said his team had a plan to set a 300-run target for the hosts to win the match.//////The biting winter cold provides a new test for the Spanish championship contenders and Barcelona midfielder Xavi Fernandez has called for his team-mates to toughen up mentally as they bid to wrestle the title away from Real Madrid.//////England's stars return to Premier League action this weekend hoping to erase the painful memories of their Euro 2008 elimination.//////Former three-time World Player of the Year Ronaldo is set to make his first competitive appearance of the season this weekend as he makes his return to the AC Milan squad for the trip to Cagliari.//////Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill has joined Jose Mourinho on the early list of contenders to replace sacked England manager Steve McClaren, according to reports Friday. //////Former Chelsea star Gianfranco Zola claimed Thursday that compatriot Fabio Capello would make an ideal England manager following Steve McClaren's sacking earlier in the day. //////The surprise African packages of the last World Cup qualifiers were handed a golden opportunity for repeat success when they were named Friday among the seeds for this weekend's draw. //////Croatian football chiefs on Friday rejected a Russian oil tycoon's offer of four Mercedes cars to players in the squad for allowing Russia a place in the Euro 2008 finals by defeating England. //////Barcelona's Edmilson has apologised for his criticisms of the side at a team meeting held before training on Thursday, teammate Andres Iniesta has said.//////Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has raised serious question marks about his future as he prepares his team for a key run of matches that could decide their season.//////Iraqi stars Nashat Akram and Younis Mahmoud, and Saudi Arabian striker Yasser Al Qahtani were named Friday as the final three players in contention for the AFC Player of the Year award. //////Jose Mourinho, the favourite to replace sacked England coach Steve McClaren, admitted it was a big blow to see the team eliminated from Euro 2008. //////Former Italy coach Marcello Lippi has refused to rule himself out of the vacant England job but says he does not expect to be considered.//////The preliminary draw for the 2010 World Cup takes place at the Durban International Convention Centre at 1700 (1500 GMT) on Sunday.

It has brought out yet another anthology of short stories by women writers, edited by Niaz Zaman. The 20 stories in the volume are by both Indian and Bangladeshi authors. It contains translations and original writing in English, with the majority of the fiction afforded here being very much in the former category. Eleven contributions are by Bangladeshi women (with three, the ones by Niaz Zaman, Neeman Sobhan and Shabnam Nadiya written originally in English) and the rest (well-known writers such as Selina Hossain, Shaheen Akhtar, Rabeya Khatun, Farida Hossain, Sonia Amin, Purabi Basu, Nasreen Jahan, Makbula Manzoor) being translations from the original Bengali. The Indian writers are Volga, Bani Basu, Suchitra Bhattacharya, Gauri Deshpande, the perennial anthology favourite Mahasweta Devi, Suraiya Qasim, Pratibha Ray, Temsula Ao and KR Meera (whose stunningly homespun tale of love retrieved from the debris of the special loneliness induced by illness has been reproduced above). The vernacular languages of India are well represented in this volume, ranging from Urdu to Telegu to Oriya. Especially welcome is the inclusion of Temsula Ao, since Assamese writers tend to be under-represented in such anthologies. Ms. Ao lives and works in Shillong, writes in English, and has published a book of short stories These Hills Called Home: Stories from a War Zone (previously reviewed in this page). Among the Bangladeshi writers Shabnam Nadiya's piece titled 'Parakrousis' (which along with some stories being written by a writer not in this collection, Abeer Hoque) may signal a break with the recording of genteel bourgeoisie sensibilities that is still the hallmark of Bangladeshi women writing in English. Hanif Qureshi, who as a young man churned out the stuff, once proclaimed the iron law of English pornography of the '60s: 'No sex with pets or blacks'. So too in Bangladeshi women's English fiction no woman lights up a ciggie, forgets to put on underwear and run over a cat with her car. And absolutely no sex with pets! But things might be changing.//////One morning in Bangkok, in December 1968//////Thomas Merton reads his paper on Monastic//////Perspectives.
