In effect, the individual in question caned the students because they were creating commotion in a classroom next to the one where he was taking a class. Now, of course it is troubling when young people in school create a noisy atmosphere and so disturb the proper working of the school. It is only to be expected that they will be disciplined.

Reporting on the unbridled rise in house rent, a national daily said recently that house rent in the capital city has increased three times over the last 15 years. The law on house rent is there in papers only and it is not being executed. //////The High Court has issued judgment to demolish this grand but unfortunately an illegal structure; built on unauthorized public land!//////Like it or not, neither the government nor the opposition has any other agenda besides making the lives of the people more miserable. They simply can not conceive of doing any good to them, they have altogether lost their capability of doing so.//////Finally, the probe report on much talked about share debacle is out. It is praiseworthy on the part of Mohammed Khaled Ibrahim and his team. Here are a few suggestions , book building method should be totally scrapped to stop over valuation of shares. SEC should be completely re-organized and transparency and accountability should be restored. A counter vigilance team comprised professionals may be appointed who will be responsible for auditing the activity of SEC on a monthly basis and if any wrong doing is found, it should be immediately notified to the proper authorities and immediate actions must be taken against the responsible persons. Demutualization is a must to give SEC an independent entity free from outside influence. Recommendations made by the probe body if initiated properly will definitely boost the capital market gradually and bring back confidence of the investors. //////Horoscopes are now widely published in the columns of newspapers every day. People who predict how lucky one will be, based on whatever methodology, and doesn't make sense. And the prophet (pbuh) said, "Whoever went to a fortune-teller and asked him about some matter (i.e. of the unseen) and believed him, would have his prayer rejected for forty days." (In Sahih Muslim). I sincerely advise the newspapers not to publish these things.//////Officials, pensioners, small businessmen and others purchase govt. saving certificates as a safe saving instrument, because they do not have the ability to bear big risk. Until a few years back the interest rates of saving certificates were quite attractive for this group of people. But in recent years, persistent pressure from the Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chittagong Stock Exchange led the govt. to reduce the interest rates of saving certificates substantially in the name of boosting capital market. As a result, small savers rushed to the Capital Market but recent bubble there made them paupers. So, the govt. should give priority to the interest of small savers rather than the interest of the members of DSE and CSE. //////I supported Lankan team in ICC World Cup final and wished they had won to see the Indians wince. The unmitigated Indian hegemony over Bangladesh in the form of lopsided trade balance and treaties and her wanton killings of Bangladeshis at the border and her merciless strangulation of international rivers that flows into Bangladesh turned me against India.//////We are very saddened by the news of the removal of Prof Yunus by the present government. What are we showing to the world by this action? We are telling the world that we have not yet overcome our petty party politics, where even the Supreme Court is highly biased and always acts in favour of the Prime Minister. Please do not let this happen. We, the Bangladeshi Americans feel that we have been betrayed by the politicians and so-called educated people of Bangladesh. Some of our colleagues at work asked me why Dr. Yunus was removed from the Bank which he established to help the poor people of Bangladesh. I could not answer them clearly.//////I loved the article by Mr. Mahfuz Anam, published on 6th of April, 2011. I feel it would have been better if the Prime Minister spoke out about the issues highlighted in that article. Islam condemns violence, and Qur'an is not something to display during protests. I think this has happened for the first time that the Qur'an has been used during protests. Furthermore, there are many people who have not even read Qur'an, but when it comes to protesting and condemning others, they will do it gladly. Recently, there was one youth who was protesting the injustice to Muslims, and he was using slangs. I wish I could ask him if using slang was allowed in Islam. I hope Muslims set their priorities straight practice what you preach!//////It is heartening that a Tiger Rescue Service (Star Magazine, 18 Mar 11) has been initiated. TRS needs all the encouragement and funds to protect the 400+ tigers remaining. The report incorrectly stated that the last wild tiger, Sundarbans apart, was killed in Bhawal Madhupur in the 40s. In the winter of 1961-62, while proceeding up a steep slope in dense jungle at about 8 am to my timber extraction site from my camp about 8 miles upstream of Chema Jhiri in Bandarbans, I suddenly became aware of a strange silence prevailing all around. I stood still at one end of the narrow path. Suddenly a large tiger silently emerged from the undergrowth on to the path at the other end (maybe 20 yards away), stopped and for an eternity, we looked at each other. Then it disappeared. //////Bangladeshis are finding more reasons to feel proud almost daily.//////It is needless to say that the number of extra-judicial killings is on the rise. Though this ruling government promised in their election manifesto before the national election that they would put an end to such killings, the issue seems to be in limbo. It is obvious that such killings keep undermining the rule of law and damaging the image of the country abroad.//////We bring to your kind notice that most of the letters we receive still contain more than 150 words, which makes it difficult for us to edit and publish.
