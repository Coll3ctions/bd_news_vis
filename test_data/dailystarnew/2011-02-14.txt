So, when the media person in charge of conducting the meet started with: 'Please don't ask any questions on spot-fixing and captaincy', every one was thinking this would be another boring and forgettable affair.//////Captain Andrew Strauss believes England have a great chance of winning the World Cup even though his side are not among the perceived favourites of the tournament.//////Top England batsman Kevin Pietersen has dismissed reports that he will be retiring from one-day cricket after the World Cup in the sub-continent to prolong his Test and Twenty20 career.//////Some 61 Pepsi consumers on Saturday won tickets of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 through different competitions, organised by ICC's official sponsor Pepsi, at the Amazon Club in the city.//////A brace from Idris Kasirye helped Rahmatganj MFS edge visitors Chittagong Mohammedan 2-1 in a Grameenphone Bangladesh League match at the Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////Bangladesh Army moved into the final of the Chowdhury Group Shaheed Smriti Hockey Tournament defeating Usha Krira Chakra 3-2 in their last group match at the Maulana Bhasani National Stadium yesterday.//////Piyush Chawla spun India to a remarkable 38-run win over defending champions Australia in a high-profile World Cup warm-up match on Sunday.//////They are the unconquered frontiers of cricket -- giant nations with huge populations, but China and the United States can only look on from the sidelines as battle is joined at the World Cup.//////The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has dismissed reports that it had filed any appeal on behalf of banned Pakistani pacer Mohammad Aamer with the International Cricket Council (ICC).//////Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss stressed the need for veteran off-spinner Muttiah Muralidaran to be fresh for Sri Lanka's World Cup bid.//////Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia won her fourth WTA singles title Sunday with a crushing 6-0, 6-2 victory over Italy's Sara Errani at the Pattaya Open.//////Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic continued her impressive season with victory over Belgium's Australian Open champion Kim Clijsters in the final of the Paris Open on Sunday.//////As always, the Pakistan cricket team will be one of the more fascinating outfits during the World Cup.

According to the news, on 23 January, some hoodlums in Iswardi, Pabna killed an SSC examinee named Sorna Khatun (15) after gang raping her. A gang of 12 kidnapped the girl from her home at gun point in presence of her family members and forcibly raped her. Afterwards they broke her legs, gauged her eyes and hanged her body from a tree. I really don't understand why we cannot ensure social security for our women at all levels and why there is no effective initiative to vigorously counteract such incidents. Unless we ensure exemplary punishments for the beasts that commit such brutal crimes, we will never be able to build a safer society for our women. If I was the Prime Minister or the Home Minister of the country, I would personally go to the field, ensure quick arrest of each of those culprits and personally arrange a swift public trial to ensure that they are publicly executed after meticulous tortures. I think our law enforcers, public representatives, judiciary and our policy makers are responsible for the creation of a social context where such unspeakable violence against women can go unpunished. Such incidents have almost become an inevitable part of our social life and we seldom get to know if the criminals are eventually brought to justice. My sole message to the people who can do something is: Please Do Something.//////Rosemary is a leafy evergreen shrub native to Mediterranean.

The party which came to power with a landslide victory in the 2008 general elections is losing focus within 2 years of its tenure. There is a tendency within the members of the ruling party to simply ignore the reading on the wall and to be in a state of denial and come up with explanations that are sometimes irrational.//////From the news item published in The Daily Star on November 10, 2010, we had learned about the uncertainty gripping Ghorashal Power Project as communications minister was meddling with the tender process, every time PDB sought the cabinet purchase committee's approval, communications minister who is a member of the committee opposed it. The reason behind had been the minister's wish to give contract to a company of his choice which could not become the lowest bidder; Sacho was representing the Chinese company which failed to meet the required criteria.//////This matter of shackling and cruel confinement of poor helpless villagers by a brickfield owner was published in most dailies on 27th January and some even published the picture of the shackled victims.

It reminded me of one of the saddest Bangladeshi stories - of a dedicated engineer and designer who came here and re-designed the rickshaw, made a prototype according to the science of ergonomics - but no one followed it up. How do you help people who do not want to be helped?//////Bangladesh is a densely populated country of 55598 square miles. It has a population of over 120 million. Every year more than 2 million people are being added to our population. The problem is now out of control. The country cannot afford to provide its people with the basic necessities of life. The most important thing is that the area of Bangladesh is too small to support her vast population. As a result, many problems like food shortage, lack of health care facilities, education problem, unemployment, shelter problem etc have gripped the country.//////World Cup Cricket 2011 is whispering in our ears.

Card and gift shops are offering enticements products and the lounges are decked in red. Amid all this special attention to that special someone, being single can be a downer. If it helps, you are not the only lonely one out there and at least you aren't trading your desperation to find that 'Man' or 'Woman' for the ratings of one particular TV show.

Tahrir square in Cairo, Egypt's capital, where hundreds of thousands of Cairenes gathered to voice their anger against widespread poverty, unemployment, corruption and misrule, which finally transformed into a single issue demanding Mubarak's resignation from office, kept the world glued to it since January 25 when the uprising broke out. //////Salahuddin Ayyubi, more familiar as Saladin, would have understood what was happening in Cairo 2011 perfectly. When, eight centuries ago, he set out from Damascus to recapture Jerusalem, he headed not towards any Crusader state dotted across the map of Arab Asia, but marched instead to Cairo to destroy the rotting regime that had infected Egypt with smug impotence. Saladin knew, and said, that an Arab victory was impossible without the mobilisation of the heart of the Arab world. The epicentre had shifted from Baghdad with the decay of the Abbasids, and there it lies still. //////It was Ben Ali first, then Hosni Mubarak, who is next? This question is in the minds of all the freedom-desiring citizens of the world. Unchallenged autocrats are really being challenged by the suppressed, deprived, poor and suffering citizens, irrespective of religion, political ideology, age, sex and education or professional status. The only demand of those revolutionary people is a free and just society where citizens can enjoy freedom and better living standards. //////Recently, I called on Finance Minister A.M.A. Muhith. I was amazed to see this over 75- year old "youngman" maintaining appointments in his digital diary. This is exactly what he meant in 2008, in a television interview, while talking on his party's election manifesto with reference to the party's commitment towards building a "Digital" Bangladesh. How far have we moved towards this goal? We don't have any definitive answer. //////February 13 was the 90th birth anniversary of Dr. Ahmed Sharif, a researcher, teacher and renowned writer. We had gathered at his residence in 1999 to celebrate his birthday. Even though there was singing and recitation of poems our revered sir was very thoughtful. Someone proposed that we observe this day somewhere outside the resident of Dr. Ahmed Sharif, and everyone agreed. At this, Dr. Sharif said: "Surely you may celebrate the next birthday in grandeur, but at that time I may not be alive." His prophecy came true when he died 11 days later. //////
