But is this everything? The answer is no.

Your great grandfather might have had an experience of similar type, in a similar river, on a similar boat, and had probably created similar imagination. This is nothing but epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study of the interaction of genes, experience, and environment in the expression of a trait. //////In an interesting turn of event in the field of paleontology, scientists very recently discovered the fossils of, what they are referring to as, an ancient crocodile with mammal-like teeth! Discovered in the Rukwa Rift Basin, South-Western Tanzania, which's details have been published in the August 5 issue of the journal Nature, paleontologists believe that this newly discovered species, named Pakasuchus Kapilimai, lived between 65 and 144 millions years ago during the Cretaceous period and in the region what is now known as Sub-Saharan Africa. Traditionally what is understood about crocodiles is that, all species of such kind surviving today look, as well as behave in similar fashion. That is, they live mostly in water, ambush their preys of various kinds and eventually swallow it either whole or in sizable chunks. But the discovery of the fossil of this relatively lanky, cat-sized animal with skinny legs, dog-like nose along and mammal-like teeth features only supports a growing consent that crocodiles, as species, were once far more diverse than they are today. It must be mentioned here that the fossilized remains clearly indicate that Pakasuchus (even though at only 50 centimeters or 20 inches in length) has many trademark features that clearly categorizes it as a crocodilian. But its land-based lifestyle on the African floodplains far removed from its aquatic descendants and preying on dragon flies, lizards as well as other animals only point out its distinct mammal-like characteristics which make it a stand-out one in the history of crocodile community. According to Patrick O' Connor, lead author and associate professor of anatomy, Ohio College of Osteopathic Medicine, If you only looked at the teeth, you wouldn't think this was a crocodile. You would wonder what kind of strange mammal or mammal-like reptile it is. It is him who named the species after Kiswahili word for cat, the Greek word for crocodile and in honor of the late Prof. Saidi Kapilima, who was an important member of the expedition which was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society.//////An international team of scientists including Mark Williams and Jan Zalasiewicz of the Geology Department of the University of Leicester, and led by Dr. Thijs Vandenbroucke, formerly of Leicester and now at the University of Lille 1 (France), has reconstructed the Earth's climate belts of the late Ordovician Period, between 460 and 445 million years ago.//////A team of Canadian iciclologists has put to rest the notion that one frozen cone of drips is exactly the same as the next. By growing lots of icicles in controlled laboratory conditions, the scientists have uncovered evidence that runs counter to an earlier theory saying that all icicles should, by and large, assume the same uniform, platonic icicle shape. They posted their observations online August 11 at arXiv.org, with a supplementary series of videos on YouTube.//////Human body is used to grow and change since the time of its birth. In adolescence, the body starts to grow fast but after twenty the rate of growth falls. But the process continues even after the body becomes fully grown up. Human body is composed of different kinds of cells. Some of these cells are always being replaced by newer cells. New cells slowly take the place of the older cells in the body. Through aging, the body loses its capability to produce newer cells. So after a certain age people get old. //////The vividly fluorescent cluster was found in waters off Lord Howe Island, 600 kilometres (400 miles) east of the Australian mainland, with some displaying rich reds that were difficult to find and in high demand for studies of cancer cells, researcher Anya Salih said.//////The term comes from the story of the little girl who said, I know how to spell 'banana', I just don't know when to stop.

It also applies to a web design, which is subjected to feature creep or the rapid expansion of features which complicate the simple design.//////
