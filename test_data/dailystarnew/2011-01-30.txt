In all, it finished off on commendable note. It's no doubt a booster to the democratic process. //////As we reflect on the state of things in Egypt today, the situation takes increasingly newer dimensions with every moment that goes by. Tens of thousands of Egyptians keep pouring on to the streets, demanding that President Hosni Mubarak quit power. For his part, the long-time Egyptian leader has tried to pacify the country by sacking his ministers, which of course is not enough. He has promised to carry on with what he calls reforms, a promise he has made over the years without meaning to carry it through. In these past thirty years, politics in the country, never very enlightening, has stagnated. Mubarak has not only ensured that he wins elections with no less than 98 per cent of the vote every time, but has seen to it that his opponents cannot raise any protest on pain of being locked away. Meanwhile, in the manner of so many other rulers in the region and elsewhere, he has carefully been grooming his son Gamal to take over from him.//////Belgium's Kim Clijsters came back from a set down to beat Li Na 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the Australian Open final Saturday, dashing Chinese hopes of a first ever Grand Slam singles title.//////An after-match bust-up between two players of opposing teams that eventually embroiled the whole teams and officials added a tinge of colour, surely a dark one, to a mundane Bangladesh League encounter at the Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium yesterday.//////Bangladesh golf sensation Siddikur Rahman played a sublime final round in the American Express Bangladesh Open at the Kurmitola Golf Club yesterday, but still fell two strokes short of Indian Gaganjeet Bhullar, who took the trophy after holding on to his slim lead. //////Bangladesh Football federation will receive 3 lakh US dollars as profits for the football's regional governing body.

Addressing a rally, president of TIB Natore unit Amzad Hossain said the present government's electoral pledge was to strengthen ACC, but actually the government is doing the opposite by making amendment to ACC Act. "We hope the government will reconsider its move, otherwise the government itself will become the worst sufferer," he cautioned. TIB Natore unit member Poritosh Adhikari said, curbing corruption is impossible unless and until the ACC is strengthened. It will be nothing but cheating with people if the government goes away from its electoral pledges, he added. If the ACC is unable to work independently, its negative impact falls on human rights, the speakers said. So, they urged the government to reconsider the cabinet proposal. //////In a talk show on a TV channel last Sunday the commerce minister mentioned that only 5% of our total consumption of edible oil is met from the local produce like mustard oil. This pushed me to remember my boyhood days in mid fifties, when living in a sub-divisional town, I saw all people in that town used only mustard oil for cooking. If we consider the population of that time at about 40 million ( US census record) which is about 25% of the present population of Bangladesh at 160 million, then what happened today that we import 95% of our edible oil consumption as the minister mentioned. To my calculation it should be 75% only of total consumption today. Present higher consumption figures may be for two reasons, one for increased cooking oil consumption due to improvement in our life style or due to some wrong information.//////Border security force (BSF) of India looks very dangerous .Their shoot and kill tactics continues as they are becoming more and more abusive towards the lives of border people of Bangladesh.

I agree. Instead of whining about what the "developed" world has already caused (and as an American, I confess we've done a lot wrong) let's get on with correcting what we can where we are. Here in Dhaka, the asthma caused by "dust" (air pollution) is killing babies and shortening the lives of all residents. Let's enforce the laws already on the books to get brick factories to install scrubbers in their smoke stacks. You can see which ones are complying by seeing the white smoke pouring out, and which ones are polluting our lungs with coal-black smoke. Are bribes involved with this? And the buses and trucks with black exhaust--why are they allowed to operate? Construction sites? They should have "curtains" to contain the dust of concrete, sand, and sawdust and not be allowed to spew it into the atmosphere. We have the means to greatly improve our environment just by enforcing the laws we already have. Please, let's get started. It's a matter of life and death, and it's do-able!//////The Daily Star has carried an editorial today 11-01-11on Begum Khaleda Zia's press conference. It is good reminder for both the Prime Minister and Begum Khaleda Zia. Well, the prime minister's self-satisfying explanation of her drive in various sectors, I believe, was a normal exercise which most heads of governments do because the general public in third world countries remains confused about what is going on in their countries. //////Even a layman can now tell that the predominant theme in the present world is injustice. The post cold war era has seen the rise of America with her 'might is right' and 'either you are with us or with the enemy' policy. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina addressed the nation on January 6, 2010 after completion of 2 years of her government. In her speech she pointed out the government's successes, one of them is law and order. She claimed that law and order is better as her government has taken a tough stance against crime and corruption. //////Selling organizations need to deploy people in the territories (demarcated markets) to promote products, to collect orders, and to deliver goods. In addition to this, many shop-keepers recruit people to sell goods from the shop-shelves and nowadays many banks and add-firms recruit people to visit customer to sell their services. However, salesmanship is an art. It can be sharpened through training and exercise. Many fresh university graduates or post-graduates can start their careers in this profession. In the beginning, they can run apace and can achieve the sales target. This sector will help us to solve the unemployment problem of our country.//////Every year so many new words are being included in the internationally recognized English dictionaries.

When my daughter was 9 years old in the mid-'80s she observed to me that I must be rather useless because I had to keep spending more time in Bangladesh while the problem of poverty remained unresolved. I clearly had to re-double my efforts, according to her.//////No government is expected to deliver one hundred percent of commitments made to the people in order to be voted to power. This doesn't happen even in highly developed societies, which enjoy the most advanced democratic standards. But when a government reneges on a topmost priority pledge, there is something drastically wrong. The obvious conclusion then is that once elected the government does not care about the promises it made at the time of election, or about public expectations. //////Today is the 58th World Leprosy Sunday. Organisations all over the world are engaged in awareness-raising about leprosy, reducing stigma and discrimination against the affected people, providing treatment for them, preventing disability, and promoting their socio-economic rehabilitation. //////By the time you get to read this column, Hosni Mubarak may have quit power or he may have crushed the resistance to his rule by brute force. And then there is a third possibility, which is that the popular revolt will be going on, with both sides digging in for the eventual battle. Hopefully, in the end, it will be the people of Egypt who will do what the Tunisians did only a few weeks ago. And hopefully there will be change in Jordan and Yemen as well. Perhaps the sparks of revolt will be ignited in Libya as well? Perhaps the entrenched monarchies of the Middle East will one day, and soon, go the way that Iran's Pahlavis went more than three decades ago?//////
