For this is the night when Allah revealed the Holy Quran, through the last Prophet Muhammad (SM), not just for the Muslims to seek guidance from but for the entire mankind to be guided by. The Holy Quran, along with the last Prophet of Allah, has come as a redeemer to the Muslims in particular.

The immigration authorities in Dubai, as we understand, have now acknowledged that the visas were genuine and that there was a 'communication gap' that compelled the workers to go back to Dhaka. That is all very well, but even so the explanation given out by the Dubai authorities about a communication gap being there does not hold much water.

against women (VAW). Although, we know that VAW is a universal phenomenon, what many of us may not know is the extent and form the violence takes. Acid throwing is a particularly vicious and damaging form of VAW in Bangladesh. There are cases of acid throwing in other countries but these are isolated incidents, nowhere near the number of attacks that occur in Bangladesh. The victims are attacked for many reasons. In some cases, the attack takes place because a young girl or women has spurned the sexual advances of a male or has rejected a proposal of marriage. Recently, however there have been acid attacks on children, older women and sometimes also men. These attacks are often the result of family or land disputes, dowry demands or a desire for revenge. The major victims are women(47%), men(26%) and children(27%). When acid is thrown on a person the results are horrifying. It causes the skin tissue to melt, often exposing the bones below the flesh, sometimes even dissolving the bone. Many acid attack survivors have lost one or both eyes. //////Inzamam-ul-Haq's decision to retire after the Lahore Test against South Africa means that world cricket will be bidding farewell to one of the greatest batsmen to have walked onto the cricket field.

Without question, Bangladesh's contribution of troops has proven useful to the UN. Like Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Kenya, all major troops contributing countries, Bangladeshi troops cost much less than troops from North America and the European Union. //////I fully support Dr. Abdus Sattar Syed's opinion on this issue (Letters to the Editor page, June 19, The Daily Star) that the advance income tax of Tk.1000 proposed on every fresh issuance or renewal of a trade licence should be withdrawn. I would like to go even further to propose that the requirement of trade licence be waived for very small starting enterprises (a suggested limit: fixed investment under Tk.1.5 lakh). Unfortunately, we inherited a legacy of a top-down authoritarian rule of the colonial past which has not changed a little even after adoption of democracy. Field officials of the government have the authority to harass the general public if their corrupt demands are not met. //////Just within a week of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed's meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mr. Abdullah Bin Ahmad Badawi in New York where, as reported in our media, the Malaysian PM assured our Chief Adviser of all possible help to assist Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, comes the bad news of ban on our workers in that county. //////It is an undeniable fact that some very remarkable accomplishments have been made by some NGOs in healthcare and education and expanding opportunities to the disadvantaged children of Bangladesh. Yet, no doubt, the TIB findings on corrupt practices of NGOs are well founded.//////Mr. Islam's report in your daily (Oct:3) on abnormal quantities of ammonia gas exhausts from Zia Fertiliser Co. Ltd. , polluting the environment around ZFCL factory, is deplorable news. What are the authorities doing about containing it?

People in the locality are suffering from skin diseases and respiratory problems. However, strangely, nothing was mentioned about the employees of the factory and their families who live in the factory location! //////The politicians have again started to beat about the bush. Though the main problem of Bangladesh is now corruption, some politicians are saying undemocratic things.

What is this? Why around 300,000 would be workers had to be put in this situation? It seems that the present administration is more interested in pushing those hapless workers to different countries than engaging in wise and effective negotiations. We suggest the government immediately send officials to other manpower exporting countries, like the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Egypt....to learn as to how to ensure proper safeguards for our workers.//////Myanmar's ruling junta said yesterday it hoped to achieve "smooth relations" with detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a day after suggesting that her release from house arrest was unlikely to happen anytime soon. //////Israel has ordered the confiscation of Arab land outside east Jerusalem, the army and Palestinian officials said yesterday, reviving fears that the occupied West Bank could be split in two. //////Britain is "running away" from Iraq, partly due to Prime Minister Gordon Brown's desire to distance himself from Tony Blair, experts said Tuesday. //////The crucial meeting of the UPA-Left committee on the Indo-US nuclear deal was held in the capital on Tuesday, amid strong and divergent views expressed by both sides on the issue that further fuelled speculation about mid-term polls.//////Iran yesterday began talks with a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog on Tehran's controversial uranium enrichment programme, state television said. //////Japan extended sanctions yesterday against North Korea by another six months to mid-April to keep up the pressure on Pyongyang over its abductions of Japanese nationals, government officials said. //////About 100 Taliban stormed a remote police post, sparking lengthy exchanges which left 10 militants and a policeman dead, while four rebels died elsewhere, officials said yesterday. //////In a meeting held yesterday, the Union Cabinet decided in favour of the imposition of the President's rule in Karnataka. //////A car exploded Tuesday in Spain's northern Basque country, wounding a bodyguard, regional authorities said. //////Seven bodies were recovered from the wreckage of a plane that crashed in the Cascade Mountains, and authorities said the other three people aboard were also believed dead. //////A Pakistan Supreme Court bench that will rule on the legality of President Pervez Musharraf's overwhelming election victory was expanded yesterday, officials said. //////Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was grilled by police on Tuesday over his alleged abuse of influence in the privatisation of Israel's second-largest bank two years ago. //////With Eid-ul-Fitr just around the corner everyone is gearing up for the festivities.

By revelation, of course, is meant first revelation because the Holy Quran was revealed in portions during a total period of twenty-three years. //////Rabindranath Tagore wrote Raktokarobi in 1923 in Shillong. The Official Secrets Act, that barred government officials from giving out information to people, was passed in India in 1923, and still exists in Bangladesh as a colonial inheritance. Why invoke the name of Tagore in this context? Is the year 1923 a mere coincidence? //////I am very happy to learn that the government is going to give the responsibility of tax policy formulation to a body separate from NBR. In fact, due to my regular communication with NBR since 1998 pleading for correcting tax inversions existing between the import of finished products and raw materials of electronic items, this very aspect appeared very strongly to me and I have been arguing for the separation of tax policy formulating body from NBR for quite some time. //////The table is full of traditional Eid delicacies with the air filled with aroma of spices.
