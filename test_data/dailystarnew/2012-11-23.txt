According to them, the constant overload of information could be triggering mental health problems. Paul Veugelers, a Canadian public health professor said, "If you want your kids to sleep better and live a healthier life, get the technology out of the bedroom." He led a study of nearly 3,400 Grade 5 students in the province of Alberta which showed that as little as one hour of additional sleep decreased the odds of being overweight or obese by around 30 per cent. The recent study also confirmed a link between getting less sleep and having electronic gadgets in the bedroom. Half of the students had a TV, DVD player or video game console in their bedroom; 21 per cent had computer; and 17 per cent had cell phone. Five per cent of students had all three types of devices. 57 per cent of students use electronics when they should be sleeping. //////We have learnt from newspaper reports that Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on November 13 described the violence in west Myanmar between Buddhists and Muslims as a "huge international tragedy" and said illegal immigration from Bangladesh had to be stopped. //////Traffic jam is a big problem in Dhaka city. It is a regular matter that we are to wait in the rickshaw or bus or other transports for hours due to traffic jam. It becomes worse when gatherings and processions are held in the middle of the road. By closing the road, political programmes are being held regularly in front of national press club. Those who have to use this road know how much they suffer. Besides, if any big party calls a meeting or procession in Dhaka, the whole city comes to a standstill. To stop this immediately, the government should allot a big open space for political gathering. I would request the prime minister, the policy makers, and the authorities concerned to look into the matter seriously.//////Most English dailies on November 10th reported on government's final go-ahead to Asia Energy Corporation, for open pit mining of coal, and having a mine mouth power plant at the location. After years of arguments, discussions and deliberations, we finally see a concrete decision being taken. I hope it is acted upon, and not left to gather dust in some bureaucratic labyrinth! It is vital that there is biparty agreement and understanding on this important national issue, so that the project can progress without any hindrance, in our overall national interest. Already, a lot of time and effort have been spent on this matter. Admittedly, many farms and rural households and people living in the area will be uprooted and need resettlement. This has to be done with compassion, sincerity, patience and understanding of the plight of the affected people. This is as important as the main project and needs to be taken up with due importance! Our political parties should also restrain from a contentious issue out of it. The fact remains that we may have to pay a social and human price for this endeavour; but this has to be minimised. All interested NGOs should be mobilized and supported by the authorities concerned in carrying out this humanitarian ask, of resettling the affected people. Let us all hope that we will succeed in this important venture.//////What are the challenges for Obama in the next four years?//////It has been a practice in Bangladesh to hold tests for admitting students into the universities. After the completion of HSC exam, students get no break as they have to take admission to different coaching centres for taking preparations for university admission tests. This is unfair. Holding admission tests mean that our public examinations carry no value in the eyes of the government. So this practice should be stopped forthwith in the interest of both students and guardians. The guardians have to pay through the nose for their children's coaching. The real beneficiaries of this system are the coaching centres which are making brisk business.//////Kidnapping for ransom has become a regular event now-a-days; mostly schoolgoing children are the target of the criminals.

The kidnappers killed him and his body was found in a water body because his parents did not pay the ransom money and informed the police. After tracking their mobile phones police arrested three people and with their confessional statement, the police were able to locate the body.
