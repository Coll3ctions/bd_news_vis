If we do, then why are the people of Chittagong facing the danger of being washed away and thrown into the drains, or falling into manhole and being lost forever during a heavy shower? The reason is lack of proper drainage system. The very well known 'Chaktai Khal'and a number of other less known khals have been occupied, of course illegally and filled up by sand coming down from the innumerable hills cut down by land grabbers. So long we have been living in a fool's paradise. Every year during the rainy season we hear that a sizeable fund has been made available and very soon the 'Chaktai Khal' will be dredged and the drains from all around the city leading to the 'Khal' cleared, which will stop water logging in the city.

Recently, though a proposal by the ministry for freedom fighters to enhance the retirement age of freedom fighters serving in government jobs up to 65 years has been placed in the upper echelon of the govt, but it is yet to yield any outcome. The government has formed a new committee with a view to scrutinizing all such public committee reports and to make final recommendations. On 30 July last, reportedly in a meeting of the said committee, the previous proposal of all the committees to enhance the retirement age-limit to 60 years has been rejected due to strong opposition of some influential and young bureaucrats (Amla). It was said in the report that instead of discussion on enhancing the age limit, it was discussed as to how to decrease the age-limit from present day 57 years to 55 years. If the report is correct, then it is not only surprising, but also devoid of practicality.//////Britain and France are leading a push for new EU sanctions to punish Iran over its nuclear programme.
