Begum Khaleda Zia seems to believe that if we go by what she has said.//////Corruption is a much talked about word these days. Everyone thinks that it is uttered whenever necessary.

I am totally upset with his saying There is hardly anyone who can accomplish higher education in a foreign university because of high educational expenses. So they do odd jobs.'' How could he pass a comment like this? These days, lots of Bangladeshi students are studying in foreign universities, especially in the UK. As an educated person you should respect all types of jobs. There is no difference between an odd job and others jobs. You are doing a job to earn money. That's it. Anyway, I want to give you an example. I came to London in 1995 after finishing my BSc. I had to work hard to earn my university tuition fees. But as a college student I was not able to work so many hours a day. So, only during my vacation I could earn a lot of money. Now I am a student of a good university and I am also proud that I am doing my MSc with my hard-earned money. //////I agree with Mr. S Rasul's opinion expressed in his letter "Spelling" (30/06/08).

It has a tremendous potential to solve problems of the agriculture sector, and can be a powerful tool to cope with the existing food insecurity. I talked with the Head of the Dept of Biotechnology (BAU)and national coordinator of ISAAA(Intl service for the acquisition of agribiotech) Dr. K M Nasiruddin about different issues on agribiotech. He said that the ever increasing population, limited cultivatable land and increasing demand for alternative energy sources has led to increasing application of the biotechnology techniques in the Indian agricultural arena. Various research institutes and departments of the government of India and other state governments are directing their efforts on exploring and exploiting newer technologies for enhancing farm production and increasing productivity. But here in Bangladesh the biotech issue is still not receiving due attention.//////Salvation for the Deserving (SFD) congratulates Finance Adviser Dr. Mirza Azizul Islam for his speech delivered on June 24, 2008 at a function of Dutch Bangla Bank Ltd. The Finance Adviser stated ,  The government is considering tax exemption on a part of corporate income to be spent on discharging corporate social responsibilities (CSR). We think that such kind of an initiative would definitely encourage the business organisations to engage them in social development activities. It should be mentioned that SFD has been advocating from its inception in different seminars, symposiums and writing that donation to the organisation should be kept tax free as no nation can survive keeping the 1.5 crore people uneducated, untrained and in improper hygienic condition. The present caretaker government signed the 'UN Convention on the rights of the people with disabilities'. Furthermore, the national office of the 'National Foundation for the development of the disabled persons' was shifted from the 3rd floor of a multi-storeyed building to a separate one-storied building. Such kind of initiatives shows the government's benevolence to the disabled and marginalised persons. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the government for such initiatives. We know that, due to limited resources, the government alone cannot achieve the goal of poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Able and affluent people should come forward to shoulder the social responsibilities. Considering the facts, the speech of the Finance Adviser to encourage corporate houses to carry out their social responsibilities is praiseworthy.//////While strolling at Kurfrstendamm in Berlin where Syed Mujtaba Ali (Deshe Bideshe) walked many years ago, these thoughts again came to my mind://////The commander of the US navy's Fifth Fleet warned on Monday that the United States will not allow Iran to shut the Strait of Hormuz, the Gulf sea lane through which much of the world's oil is supplied.//////Israel again sealed off the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip on Tuesday in retaliation for the latest rocket attack to breach a truce in and around the impoverished Palestinian enclave.//////A grouping of left-wing parties who prop up India's government will meet this week to reconsider their support and forcing early polls, an official said yesterday.//////Sri Lanka's air force bombed a Tamil Tiger rebel air base and a rebel navy base, while separate ground clashes in the country's war-torn north left 20 combatants dead, the military said Tuesday. //////Israeli and Syrian negotiators were set to meet separately with mediators in Turkey yesterday for a third round of indirect talks that could be complicated by MPs' efforts to block an eventual return of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.//////European governments are looking at a raft of sanctions to be imposed on Zimbabwe after President Robert Mugabe was elected unopposed in a vote denounced as a sham, the French foreign ministry said yesterday.//////Militants killed more US and Nato troops in Afghanistan in June than in Iraq for the second straight month, a grim milestone capping a run of headline-grabbing insurgent attacks that analysts say underscore the Taliban's growing strength.//////Iraq's largest Sunni Arab parliamentary bloc is set to join the Shia-led cabinet of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki after boycotting it for nearly a year, the spokesman for the faction said yesterday.//////President Pervez Musharraf told a five-member US Congressional delegation on Monday that Pakistan would not tolerate a recurrence of US-led Nato attack on Pakistani troops from Afghanistan.//////UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon pledged Tuesday to press Myanmar to bring "genuine freedom" to its people after he struck a deal to bring in international aid after a devastating cyclone.//////French diplomat Alain Le Roy was Monday entrusted with the heavy task of leading UN peacekeeping operations at a time when the blue helmets are more needed than ever around the world.//////The remains of 17 workers have been recovered from the rubble of a seven-storey building that collapsed in northwest Tehran, Fars news agency reported yesterday.//////Thirty-three days after his father Gyanendra was stripped of his once revered position as the king of Nepal - and he himself lost the right to succeed to the 239-year-old throne, Nepal's controversial former crown prince Paras on Tuesday left the country for Singapore, triggering speculation about his return.//////Indian Kashmir formally revoked yesterday a decision to hand over land to Hindu pilgrims after days of violent protests that left four dead and nearly 350 injured in the Muslim region.//////A Chinese man armed with a knife killed five policemen on Tuesday when he went on a stabbing frenzy at a Shanghai police station, authorities said.//////Pakistani forces demolished two buildings used by militants in the Khyber tribal district on Tuesday on the fourth day of an operation against rebels there, officials said.//////Sharp policy disagreements and turf battles between American counter-terrorism agencies have held up Bush administration's secret plan to operate inside Pakistan's tribal areas, the New York Times reported on Monday.//////In days gone by, young ////// (cowherds) playing banshi (bamboo flute) under banyan trees was a common sight in rural Bengal.
