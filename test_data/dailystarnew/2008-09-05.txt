In the beginning it was his health and subsequently it was the issue of his bail that became the subject of intense speculation. There was a judicial ruling for his release on bail for purposes of treatment abroad. For whatever it is worth, the fact remains that Tarique Rahman has been a man shrouded in controversy ever since he joined politics. His behind the scenes role in the last government led by his mother and his not so behind the scenes role through Hawa Bhaban earned him unhealthy notoriety over the past few years.//////FOLLOWING the approval of the final draft of the consumer rights protection ordinance by the council of advisers, some of its features have drawn criticism from experts and activists in the field. This awaits assent of the president to be promulgated into an ordinance through a gazette notification. Since the enactment process is yet to be completed, we believe, there is still scope for mitigating some of the inadequacies contained in the draft before it is promulgated and put into effect.//////LAST week I wrote about my recent trip to Indonesia, and how intrigued and impressed I was to learn about the diversity and visibility of progressive Islamic voices in that country. I'll be honest; before I went to Jakarta, I was under the impression, from newspaper/magazine articles and television news over the past few years, that Indonesia was a country heading in the direction of fundamentalism. //////MANY worthwhile advisors of erstwhile caretaker governments are almost forgotten, but one of them refuses to go away like a fly in the trashcan. A former justice of the High Court, who adorned the caretaker cabinet for 74 days, allegedly took bribes while in office, totaling a sum of Tk.1.25 crore. A brain-teaser for those who are interested. Going at this rate, how much money would he have made if he were to serve in a regular cabinet lasting five years, each year comprised of 365 days? //////MANY in Washington have described Russia's attack on Georgia as a turning point in international affairs.

Not even Kevin Pietersen, their unerringly positive captain, could have foreseen England's dominance.//////Andy Roddick is starting to look like a planning genius as his decision to skip the Beijing Olympic Games in favour of preparing for the US Open pays off.

But often we notice that for very insignificant reasons it becomes chaotic. We don't know which devils are playing the key character behind this. We feel that the government should trace and punish them. The investors in this sector are assuring us that they will give all reasonable benefits to the workers.//////I sighed as I read Nabilah Khan's cry for a 'unified education system'. I have heard it for 40 years in the UK and now here! //////The UN and its elaborate Charter for peace, individual freedom and human rights were established soon after WW2. However, it is not functioning well at all because of lack of good will and co-operation on the part of stronger nations. In particular, the right of 'self determination' is apparently a failed concept. Most of the present turmoil in the world, in Kashmir, Georgia, Chechnya, Darfur, Afghanistan, Iraq. Tibet (and perhaps even Palestine) could be prevented if this provision of the UN could be enforced for world wide peace and tranquillity. An exceptional case of such UN success was in East Timor. Why can the world not see many more such cases of self determination of the troubled or disputed regions? The 'Principle of territorial integrity of a sovereign nation' (an archaic concept), must be subservient to the 'Principle of happiness and self determination of the people' of a ruled region. Size is irrelevant as states such as Monaco and Luxemburg demonstrate their happy and prosperous existence.//////Nowadays, very often, in several buildings in Wari residential area the supply and flow of water in WASA pipeline is very irregular, small in quantity, causing great inconvenience to the WASA customers/consumers.//////For a long time, Rajshahi University has been maintaining a favourable environment of education. Many departments have become successful in removing session jam. But on 19 August, over a trivial matter, there occurred a clash between the students and the inhabitants of an adjacent locality. It is a matter of great regret that the university has been declared closed following the incident.//////I am trying to survive with my two children depending on my income which is not sufficient for three of us. My elder child is a brilliant student from her childhood with great penchant for music, drama, drawing, dance etc. I was not able to give her the support that she needed. She herself tried her best and achieved good results in all aspects. She has shown her ability in her academic side by achieving 8 (eight) "A" grades in her O-level , she didn't get any coaching or similar facilities. She achieved the The Daily Star Award. She has appeared in her A level exams with the great hope of achieving the same type of results.//////I would like to thank the letter writer (under the above caption). //////There is nothing more English than to find day-trippers from London sitting on the pebble beach at Brighton, resolutely determined to enjoy themselves despite the lowering August sky. We looked down from amidst the amusement arcades and fish n' chips stalls on the pier, during my first ever trip to the seaside resort of Brighton and my first trip to England as an American. Brighton has its famous royal pavilion, modelled on the Mughal architectures of east. Because Brighton always was a place to go so see something out of the ordinary, a place where anything seemed exotic compared to the six day week factories. Where for a spell each year the English could be something other than English. And so it was on the beach there last Tuesday. A group of boys were sitting in the waves up to their necks, clothed in shorts and tea-shirts, shrieking every time a larger wave crashed over them. At a demure distance, but still subject to near total immersion from the largest waves was a group of girls in brightly coloured salwar- kameez. Up the beach was grandma in black niqab, video camera pressed against the slit, capturing the scene and shouting directions. All Muslim by dress, Bengali by volume and mirth, and so completely, so absurdly British. Then the heavens opened in high borsha passion and everyone on the beach, whether in the waves or not, was instantly drenched. And in the rain I could hear "nache nache rumo tale"//////Some newspapers carried out a front-page report on Tarique Rahman's injury along with his wife's tearful picture. I was in a coffee shop yesterday, when I came across a group of people expressing their sadness witnessing the 'million dollar' picture. What amazed me most is that nobody cared for the person who died because of the vandalism that took place near Dhaka University. The poor man's death was another priceless life the common people give to 'jalao porao' politics. Today, we chant slogans for democracy and perhaps that is why we have the right to burn anything and to kill anybody. Today, the tears of Dr. Zobaida Rahman are much more valuable than the pain and agony the family of Jahangir Alam is going through. What was his fault? He was walking on the roads of a democratic country! //////After the fall of General Musharraf, our politicians always refer to the CTG to observe the fate of the non-democratic government, so that our CTG can take this into account and quit as soon as possible. But what happened after Musharraf's resignation? //////At last the whole nation has been disillusioned about the much-trumpeted charisma of the CTG. Even long before the expiry of its term, it has got its paws & talons blunted and teeth broken. Ah! How high was the expectation of the nation! But they have failed us. They are to be cursed more than those who have hitherto been sucking the blood of this wretched nation. What shall we say? A bunch of so-called highly educated people/bureaucrats! They did finally land us in this ditch where the thugs and goons and their godfathers had been wallowing! Shall we ever be able to put trust in so-called highly educated people/bureaucrats? What difference did they make from those inebriating with power & position & purse? What made them so kneeling in compromise with the branded corrupt and plunderer politicians? //////Sexual harassment of female students by their teachers in our educational institutions all over the country is common, which shocks us very much and tarnishes the image of the particular institutions as well as the teaching profession. The teachers who are involved in sexual harassment lack morality and principles. They have stigmatised the noble teaching profession. I cannot imagine how a teacher can sexually harass female students. //////We are very passionate about our cricketers. They sometimes made us really proud. The last World Cup was a dream tournament for us. //////I live in Australia and during my last visit to Bangladesh I tried to buy a new plot in a suitable location that has full project permission from Rajuk. I visited the REHAB fair and due to the government's tight control on marketing of new projects at that time, there were only a few real estate companies offering a small number of plots and the price was very high. I could not select any. People very often lost their hard earned money deposit to various agents which finally could not provide them with a plot, nor did they return the money. //////A common question in talk shows- what lessons the politicians have learnt from 1/11. Yes, they are leaving behind examples of how to survive during political Tsunami. Instead of looking for success and lessons of 1/11 in talk shows, set up a commission of inquiry to find out the exact answers to these questions. The time has come to ask what lessons the government has learnt from the politicians. //////I am so much curious to know about the main duties and responsibilities of an ambassador because I am confused by the activities of our foreign embassies. I know that an ambassador is a representative of the government as well as the nation and the ambassador is considered a guardian of immigrant workers abroad, but in our case the situation appears to be different. //////At least 17 militants were killed yesterday when troops backed by helicopter gunships destroyed rebel hideouts in Swat valley in Pakistan's northwest, the army said.//////Efforts to rescue tens of thousands of villagers cut off by a monsoon-swollen river in northern India were reaching a critical stage yesterday, aid workers and evacuees said.//////French President Nicolas Sarkozy warned Iran yesterday that its determination to press on with its controversial nuclear drive risked an Israeli strike that would be a "catastrophe."//////The United States inched towards a deal Thursday in its efforts to persuade nuclear supplier nations to lift a 34-year-old embargo on trade with India, a diplomat at negotiations said.//////In her first national address, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin wowed the Republican convention using wit, sarcasm, charm and ridicule in a full-scale assault on a now familiar cast of GOP targets: an elitist adversary, biased media and high taxes. //////A Pakistani court on Thursday adjourned till October seven the hearing of an application seeking reopening of the trial of corruption cases against former Premier Nawaz Sharif, his brother Shahbaz and other members of their family. //////Pakistani police were Thursday investigating a failed assassination attempt on Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, a day after sniper fire struck his motorcade.//////Thailand's Cabinet agreed Thursday to hold a referendum on a civic group's street campaign to oust the prime minister, which has paralysed the government for the last 10 days and raised fears of violence and economic chaos. //////Though internationally renowned as a photographer, Anwar Hossain's contribution to Bangladeshi films is no less profound. Consider the critically acclaimed films made in Bangladesh; several of them feature Anwar's signature cinematography -- ////// and ////// for instance. //////Eminent lyricist, educationist, litterateur and poet Dr. Mohammad Moniruzzamn (72) passed away on September 3 at the Bangladesh Medical College Hospital. He had an open-heart surgery recently. He was also suffering from kidney related ailments. The demise of Mohammad Moniruzzamn caused a wave of mourning in the cultural arena.//////Abdul Alim (1931-1974) possessed a melodious and gifted voice which is yet to be surpassed by any other folksinger of our country. His presentation was simply magical. His songs epitomised the very essence of rural Bangladesh and mesmerised listeners across the country. Indeed, he played an important role in popularising this form of music. Today marks the 34th death anniversary of the folk maestro. It is unfortunate that his death anniversary is observed rather unceremoniously and he is now almost an overlooked chapter.//////Ibsen Scholarships for International Ibsen Projects 2008 was handed over to Centre for Asian Theatre (CAT) on September 1, at the National Theatre Stage in Oslo, Norway informed the theatre troupe members at a press conference held recently. //////New variety show ////// will be aired on Channel i at 9:30 pm tonight.

People from all corners, despite their political identities, welcomed the move and, from Day 1, supported this government. //////THE United States elects a president in two months. The whole world is watching because whoever is victorious will be the leader of not just of US but the world. Africans, Asians, Europeans and Latin Americans -- unhappy with the Bush administration's eight years -- all have a stake in the election's outcome. But they'll discover that whether Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain is the next US president, his foreign policies may not often be in concert with global public opinion. //////THOSE who keep in touch with Hollywood science-fiction movies know about the film "Star Wars," and worry about the earth being attacked by aliens. //////OVER breakfast with a couple of Germans and an American at a hotel in Macau, I pondered one of the most puzzling East-West mysteries.
