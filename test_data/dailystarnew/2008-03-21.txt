In a larger sense, we renew on this day the principles that came into the lives of all those who believe in the oneness of the Almighty, indeed in the majesty of His power to inspire us into a full flowering of our intelligence and intellect. And within such a flowering comes the fundamental premise that life on earth is but a shadow of the bigger reality awaiting us in the life hereafter. That reality is but the idea that here on earth we follow a path set for us by the Almighty, a path that has been explained to us in all its finer details by His messenger.//////A foreign diplomat is going door to door peddling wisdom to our political leaders.

release. //////It is expected that a win should always be accompanied by magnanimity. What was painful was to see a tribal mentality on the part of the victorious PPP and especially Muslim League (N). No one expected a hit below the belt. It is natural for a political leader to gain and lose popularity. Personal involvements may or may not play any major role in it. It is the public adulation and public enduring interest that matter most. I was a little bit surprised that someone was commenting so harshly on a dead person.//////With tangible development in quality of education and immense increase in the number of students at all levels of education leading to an unbelievably huge number of competent candidates in job market, a fierce competition comes as no surprise. Keeping in mind the fast-evolving nature of the current world which requires veritable competence in order to survive as a dignified nation, we can't afford compromise with the quality of public administration, a crucial organ of the state.//////Dhaka metropolitan city and Narayanganj dwellers are consumers of water supplied by Dhaka Wasa, a 100% government owned organisation. It is monopoly business for Wasa. No one can lift water from underground in Dhaka and Narayanganj city areas without obtaining permission from Wasa. We have learnt from the media that the government is enacting Consumer Protection Law to protect the rights of the consumers, while we observe supply of contaminated water by Wasa. Is it not self-contradictory? Twelve million city dwellers in Dhaka and Narayanganj have been consuming contaminated water supplied by Wasa every day.//////I feel cynical about my confidence in the typical style of our governance. However, thanks to the government for taking a step further to make the EC independent and free from govt. intervention. //////The Daily Star has carried a very brief review of the draft ordinance passed in principle by the cabinet of advisers. This is based on the briefing by the press secretary to the chief adviser. I think the readers would be more benefited if some elaboration is available with regard to the issue of "designed to ensure the people rights", and the rights of the press. There are few significant words like " good faith", " restrained language" and "constructive". These would remain subjective unless well defined by examples and references. The ultimate judgment would remain open and might be arbitrary.//////During the second round of talks on electoral reforms with the Election Commission, the Awami League (AL) proposed that the parties that obtained 10% of the vote in last election should be allocated Tk 15 lakh for each candidate they would field and Tk 50 crore for central engineering from the state fund. According to this proposal only the AL and the BNP qualify for the funds from public i.e. state exchequer. If accepted, these two parties would receive Tk 190 crore from the government for 300 candidates they normally nominate in the parliamentary election.//////Perhaps the most pronounced term is now 'Sangsker'. First of all, it should be clear why Sangsker is necessary. After the Liberation in 1971, we saw both autocratic and democratic governments. In most of the cases, whether it is in the government or in party politics, decisions are taken the autocratic way. //////These days our very sick Jamuna Bridge is very much in the news; unfortunately for all the wrong reasons! This largest engineering construction work undertaken in Bangladesh seems to be heading towards a national disaster! Kaptai dam, another monumental work, was however completed during Pakistan time. Here too we managed to make a mess of the water turbine generator's maintenance and repairs, possibly for penny pinching approach to it.//////I was shocked to hear on ATN's 7:00pm news on Feb 21st the comment of Pakistani columnist Ikram Sehgal to the effect that the Language Movement of 1952 was responsible for not only the current political turmoil in Pakistan but also for the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan! The Pakistani journalist very conveniently forgot to mention that it was primarily because the then military government of Pakistan had refused to hand over power to the elected majority party of Sheikh Mujib.//////I fully realise Mr Sazzad Hossain's concern regarding our highly valued Bangla language and its impact after the recognition of 21st February as the International Mother Language Day (Letters, 12/03/08). I would like to add a bit further.//////The Star Weekend Magazine feature story "A Place to Call Home" should serve as an eye opener. We feel deeply for the sufferings, daily humiliation of the Palestinian people by the Israelis, whereas at home we have created the same for the Biharis.//////The need to keep one's own language and culture was a huge motivating factor for the language martyrs and indeed for the creation of Bangladesh. Yet the same nation has often looked the other way as more and more pressure is put on the indigenous people of, for instance, the Chittagong division. The abuse of the most basic rights of these people has been time and again reported both nationally and internationally. While the present government is addressing corruption and thus the effects of some of the past injustices meted out against them, there is work to be done to ensure that all minorities are given the same opportunities as the majority. This does not mean just "treated in the same way", as the term equal opportunities is often translated. There needs to be a change of culture in the national psyche. Are some Bangladeshis less Bangladeshi because they speak English, Urdu or Changma Vaj as their first language?//////Many human rights groups emphasise the need for preserving the mother tongues of different tribal peoples such as Santal, Chakma, Marma and so on. //////I am writing this with a heavy heart (a feeling shared by 150 million unfortunate people minus 11-14 cricketers and the cricket board, selectors etc). In a good article Mr. Imam writes, "What went wrong with Bangladesh cricket?" I just want to make a small correction- "What went right with Bangladesh cricket?"//////They are chasing the extremely corrupt officials such as those of Titas Gas. They should be commended for that. However, generally the economy has slowed down. The salaries of government officials need to be raised to a more realistic amount, given today's prices, that way the system won't force them into corruption. The government would benefit from external professional management consultants who can put in systems whereby the gas/electric employees cannot breathe without someone knowing about it. They also need to encourage and support business activities and stop the scare tactics which have stunted economic growth. This will lead to more employment and prosperity for the people and more tax for the government to use for projects. //////We (myself and my wife) were on a holiday visit to Bangladesh for 4 weeks recently. Dhaka was the main place of our stay. On 19 January 2008, we intended to go to Barisal by coach at 8:00am from the bus stand opposite Notre Dame College. We took a rickshaw from Segun Bagicha at 7-30am. We turned left to Topkhana Road opposite Press Club. As the rickshaw came near the middle of Toyenbee Circular Road, the heart of Dhaka commercial zone, a blue taxi came suddenly from behind on the left side of our rickshaw and a criminal from the passengers' seat grabbed the large brown handbag of my wife and pulled hard. My wife cried out for help and the handbag was snatched away by the fast running taxi. I was seated on the right side of the rickshaw witnessing this terrible robbery at broad daylight helplessly. The handbag was pulled so forcibly that we were about to fall from the rickshaw. My wife was shocked to tears by this horrible experience. There was no police or Rab or anyone else to help us. The street was calm and clear. Our holiday mood was shattered by fear and shock. We approached the bus terminal and were told by the passengers that we were lucky that we were not harmed. This kind of incident was said to be common in Dhaka during morning hours or night. If we resisted further, we could be knifed or shot. It is not safe to travel from bus terminals or Sadar Ghat in the morning before office hours or late evening. Streets at that time are quiet and clear without any police or Rab patrols for exploitation by the professional criminals. Within 14 days of this incident, two murders took place in Dhaka . //////The US military's death toll in Iraq is nearing the 4,000 mark as the conflict launched in March 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein's iron-fisted regime enters its sixth year. //////US Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday he expected the new Pakistan government to be "good and effective" US allies, as he made a surprise visit to neighbouring Afghanistan. //////An international human rights group urged Nepal to stop doing Beijing's bidding yesterday and end its crackdown on Tibetan exiles protesting against China.//////Thailand's Supreme Court yesterday agreed to hear a vote fraud case against the speaker of parliament, which could lead to the sacking of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra's close ally. //////Withdrawing US forces from Iraq would hand victory to al-Qaeda, US Republican presidential hopeful John McCain said here yesterday on the fifth anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq. //////A suicide car bomber attacked a Pakistan army base in a troubled tribal region bordering Afghanistan yesterday, killing at least five soldiers and wounding a dozen others, officials said. //////US President George W Bush is to visit Croatia in two weeks, after a NATO summit at which the Balkan country is expected to be invited to join, the foreign ministry said yesterday. //////An explosion rocked a Hamas training base in central Gaza Strip yesterday, killing two activists and wounding one, Palestinian medical officials said.//////British actor Paul Scofield, who won an Oscar for his role in "A Man For All Seasons," has died at the age of 86, his agent said yesterday. //////The upcoming film ////// -- written and directed by Shubhashish -- features popular TV actor Rosy Siddiqui in the lead role. The artiste recently spoke to ////// about her character in the film and her experiences in the course of filming.//////My mother gets upset whenever she hears news of Suchitra Sen falling ill and undergoing treatment at some clinic. She reads three to four newspapers that week to get updates on the legendary screen diva's condition. I can sense she silently prays for her recovery and well-being. Why does she feel so strongly about Suchitra Sen? Is there an unknown bond between my mother and her? Not really, when 'Suchitra Sen', the 'Fist Lady of Bangla cinema' is concerned, but there was an undeniable bond between my mother and one Roma Sen Gupta from Pabna who moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) during the Partition (1947). //////Renowned singer Abida Sultana, also known as Shikha to her near and dear ones, recently took some time off from her busy schedule to have a brief chat with //////.

Political, economic and social stability is jeopardised if food security is brought to the precipice. Starvation, death, and disorder follow. Governments, therefore, need to attach topmost priority to food security.//////THE first person to advocate effectively the cause of women in history was, as it happens, a man, born not in Europe or America, not in the modern age, but in Arabia, in the sixth century. The first person to effectively champion and establish the rights and privileges of women was indeed the holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).//////WE live in a world where peace and reconciliation are most wanted. Man is alienated from God and his fellow beings. Reconciliation is harmony and peaceful co-existence and mutual trust. Jesus Christ sacrificed his life to atone for our sins, so that there is peace with God and also peace among men. The sacrifice of animals was inadequate for doing away with human sins. Theologian Philip Hughes observed: "A brute beast, by its very nature, is unqualified to serve as a substitute for man, the crown of God's creation." //////
