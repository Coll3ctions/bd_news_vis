Since then I have been asking myself whether I have been living in a democratic country or an uncivilized country. The latter one may be my question's answer though that is not enough. Hitting public servants is not new in the country and the practice is getting worse day by day as no exemplary action has not been taken yet regarding this. A few days ago a lawmaker of Dhaka city beat a police sergeant, as the hapless officer did not call him sir, the lawmaker was willing to be called by sir as the term is frequently used in the developed countries to communicate with someone, irrespective of the position of the person. In those countries even a clerk can be called by the word 'sir' as this is the sign of civilization and education. //////There are strict laws guiding construction of high rises in and around any airport, I am worried that if the matter comes to the notice of Int'l Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO), Bangladesh could face severe penalty. //////After reading the article entitled "Why this behaviour?" My heart went out to the sales workers at Aarong. I too am an American, but I am absolutely appalled with the behaviour of my fellow countrymen, particularly this woman. Her churlish behaviour is sadly common, We Americans think our rights that we carry in our own country travel with us when that couldn't be farther than the truth. This cultural insensitivity shows a lack of respect and/or common sense. This woman should have her passport revoked. I got married six months ago to a Bangladeshi woman and I've only begun to scratch the surface of this unique and diverse culture. Bangladeshis all over the country have shown me nothing but love and their hospitality is second to none. What a shame this woman was belittling workers at a department store because they couldn't speak her language. A person from the other side of world comes to a new country and expects to have all the comforts and luxuries of her home. //////Recently, there has been quite a few reports and meetings on fatal accidents. They are trying to find out causes and solutions. Obviously, most reports found Reckless Driving as the Main Cause. Please refer to the heading in today's DS (24 Aug.)"Cops to arrest errant drivers" on page 16.This does not conform to rules of punishment for driving offences in most other countries.

After her fall, a baby was born and embraced death within a short period of time. //////This refers to the letter by Sikander Ahmed (Aug 23).//////We have just mourned the death of our loved 'father of the nation' for the thirty fifth time. Many of these years have been spent under autocratic governments; some have been spent with democratic governments who were happy to present a distorted view of history. But now, and for the second time, we have a democratic government in power which will not be worse off if a true history of our beloved Bangabandhu is presented in full. //////Once again a destructive fire broke out from a factory at old Dhaka and claimed the lives of three. This happened two days after the government decided to extend the deadline it had given to the factories to move away from residential areas. To some extent, the government's misjudgement can be held responsible.//////I wondered, as I sat before the audience, how these eight years of school life had passed so quickly, leaving behind a handful of memories I would speak to my teachers, friends, parents at my graduation ceremony, (held on 7th August, 2010) delivering heart felt thanks to the teachers who had been our mentors, leading us ahead in times of failure and gloom, school staff who had never backed down in the most pressing moments, gave us a helping hand when I thought there were not any. I listened to what the teachers had to say about us, praising us for our sincere efforts to score the best results in our O level exams; our honourable principal urging us to look at out path ahead and strive towards the zenith of success. I walked slowly towards the podium, dragging my feet as they faltered and spoke at length how grateful I was to be a student of Paramount School, the only affiliated centre of Cambridge University in Rajshahi, providing education at comparatively cheaper fees than other reputed English medium schools of our country. I felt blessed, lucky to be a part of the family where my journey began from class three and culminated at O-levels and I sincerely pray to the Almighty that may this family continue to thrive.//////We, the expatriates, are very much worried about the fragile political situation of Narayanganj. Spearheading smear campaigns and fabricating news in the media has been a common tactic, in painting political adversaries. There are no political ideologies. //////There was a time when very few women got proper education. But now girls are receiving higher education. Some people insist on having educated girl as their wives. Others are strongly against this. It is considered in brief advantages and disadvantages of having an educated wife. We can easily recognize, by her appearance, a girl who has received western education. She is fashion loving. The greater part of her time is wasted in dressing her hair. She is too fond of using cosmetics. She puts on costly dresses of the latest fashion. But there are many advantages also of having an educated wife. Being educated, she can manage her home more efficiently. She can look after the work of the servants and maintain accounts. She keeps her kitchen in hygienic condition. An-educated girl understands her duties well. She can teach many things to her children. Not only this, an educated wife can also help her husband in his office work. She can work as a typist, by checking accounts, preparing draft, and by her personal suggestions. An educated girl is not always obedient and faithful. She has her own friends. She does not like to observe family traditions and customs. She goes to her club. She wants to dominate her husband. She likes to live in her own independent way. An educated wife can be a great asset to her husband and her family, if she is good-natured and respects the traditions of the family and co-operates to run it smoothly.//////Mothers cried and children squealed with delight as a company of US troops arrived back from Iraq on Saturday, after a yearlong tour marked by desert heat and monotony.//////A shootout between the Chechen president's personal protection detail and suspected separatist insurgents left 19 people dead early yesterday, including five civilians, officials and media reports said.//////Thousands of Indonesians were evacuated from the slopes of a volcano yesterday after it erupted for the first time in more than 400 years, spewing out lava and sending smoke and dust 1,500 meters (5,000 feet) into the air.//////President Hamid Karzai said yesterday Washington's war strategy for Afghanistan needed a rethink, as a Taliban-led insurgency gathers pace and foreign forces casualties surge.//////Tens of thousands of people are still missing in the Gulf from Iraq's past 30 years of warfare, with families still living in hope of news, the International Committee of the Red Cross said yesterday.//////Seven US troops have died in weekend attacks in Afghanistan's embattled southern and eastern regions, while officials found the bodies Sunday of five kidnapped campaign workers for a female candidate in the western province of Herat.//////The International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor has accused Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of abusing African hospitality and threatening the West as he seeks to avoid arrest on genocide charges.//////China yesterday denied reports that defence exchanges with India had been suspended by New Delhi in retaliation for Beijing refusing a visa to a top general from its neighbour.//////The dance form Manipuri, is now quite popular among urban Bangladeshis.
