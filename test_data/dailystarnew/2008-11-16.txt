But as I reached Sayedabad the bus suddenly came to a halt. I looked out from the window and found a large procession, at first I thought it to be a political one, but as the bus moved forward I found it to be a procession of '' Safe Highway Movement'' with a large number of school children carrying colourful placards and banners together with their guardians and teachers and they were escorted by smartly turned out women police and cavalry of police dept.

Look East: where more human resources are available at cheaper rates. The glitter and the glamour of the USD have drowned in its own secret misery. Truth is naked and unvarnished. //////It is a commonly held view in our country that the international development financing agencies are keepers of superior knowledge and technology. With due deference to them, I would like to express my deep concern on the river training works that have been proposed by the ADB recommended consultant for the Padma Bridge. It is rumoured that the proposed works consist basically of dumping sand filled bags. Well, this and many others innovative models have been tried and tested by international experts in the Jamuna-Padma River under different donor-funded projects. All these innovations have failed to stand up to the mighty river. If the rumour has any substance, the proposed river training works and the risk of its failure would put the bridge and associated facilities in danger thus jeopardizing a huge investment. With less robust river training the initial investment will no doubt be less but the whole-life cost would be high, not to mention the huge burden of recurring capital maintenance. Who will fund and manage this huge undertaking year after year after the completion of the bridge?//////It would appear that the election of Barack Obama has galvanised the intelligentsia of Bangladesh.//////The reconstituted PSC published the final results of 27th BCS exams after a long hassle. //////It is so much frustrating to see that political leaders do not learn from the past. The way they are speaking is so irritating that we do not see any ray of hope. I am so surprised that they want to force the government to change some important points of RPO that are in favour of public interest. They are talking like dictators. I do not know what they mean by democracy. They have no respect for the country and the people.
