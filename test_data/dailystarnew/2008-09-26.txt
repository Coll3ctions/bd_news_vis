The new code of conduct for parliamentary polls will not allow any electioneering until three weeks before the start of polling. //////The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) is unlikely to file any case against former premiers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia regarding their wealth since enquiry has not found any ill-gotten wealth accumulated by them.//////Chief Adviser (CA) Fakhruddin Ahmed on Wednesday dispelled any confusion over holding the general election in the country on December 18 as already announced.//////The much-anticipated talks between Awami League (AL) chief Sheikh Hasina and BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia have taken a new turn following comments coming from the government, political parties and the mediator.//////The US Congress on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution urging US President George W Bush to consider extending generous economic support to Bangladesh on completion of an internationally accepted free and fair election before the end of December 2008.//////The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday approved the charge sheet against former premier Khaleda Zia and 15 others, including 10 former ministers, in a case filed in connection with illegally awarding Barapukuria coalmine operation contract to a Chinese company.//////Schedules for the upazila and parliamentary elections will be announced simultaneously in the first week of November. //////The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has asked its counsels to take vigorous preparations to fight legal battle against graft-suspects at the High Court (HC) after the Eid and Durga Puja vacation. //////In her wealth statement the BNP chairperson showed properties accumulated through seven sources of income with all the taxes on her money and properties paid.//////Hasina in her wealth statement said she does not own any house or land and that most of her properties, which are not in Dhaka or abroad, are inherited.//////The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) yesterday started testing for presence of melamine in powdered milk collected from different city markets.//////Acting British High Commissioner Duncan Norman yesterday said the Awami League (AL) and BNP have committed to refrain from violence, establish sustainable democracy and carry on reforms activities.

If that says anything about the results obtained so far in its operations by the Tac, there is the more intriguing tale of how high officials, politicians and businessmen suspected of corruption have shrewdly stayed away from the body. What has happened, in the words of none other than the chairman of the commission, is that only lower ranking employees have been trekking to the commission and coming up with confessions. Obviously, that is not quite the kind of results the government had anticipated when the Tac was set up.//////WE don't want to make too much about it but it has drawn our attention. At this point in time, as many as six advisers holding charge of 12 important ministries, are away on official tours abroad. We wish the simultaneous absence of so many advisers from the capital city could be explained away as some awkward coincidence. The very fact that such a big number of government functionaries thought alike to be in a jet-set mode leaving their desks for varying time spans at the fag end of their tenure may be construed as cavalier attitude. They may have had some compelling calls of duty to respond to, but in public perception, when half of the cabinet chooses to be on an odyssey, attention to governance and policy issues under their watch is likely to be affected.//////WE are entering the final stretch of the US presidential election, to be held on November 4. At the time of writing it wasn't clear whether the first debate that is scheduled for Friday night would be held as scheduled or not due to the suggestion of the McCain camp to postpone it (as well as all electioneering) due to the economic crisis that the US is currently facing.//////THE stick in the mud that he was, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has changed his mind. Last week he agreed to share power with Morgan Tsvangirai. South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who brokered this power sharing deal, resigned under pressure from his party. //////IT seemed as if the global economy were headed for the kind of crash we haven't seen since 1929. All the elements for a great financial meltdown and economic depression were in place last week -- choked-off credit lines, massively leveraged firms, assets gone bad, sinking mortgages, panicked consumers and paralysed companies. "What is different," says Harvard economic historian Niall Ferguson, "is that then the federal government and the Federal Reserve did all the wrong things. Now they're mostly doing the right things."//////Michael Oniya's first-half strike put Brothers Union on top of the Citycell B.

I am a mid-level employee so cannot afford CNGs , even if I can find one. Taxis and private cars are unthinkable. For this reason I am very pleased to see that your fearless newspaper has highlighted the acute problems caused by traffic jams on a daily basis. However, the police authorities are relentless in blaming rickshaws for the jams and even force me to walk (I use a crutch) in the heat and in the rain.//////Roger Federer, now world no. two tennis player, won the US open 2008 recently in a flamboyant style. He just outplayed the surprise challenger Murray of England. When Murray beat present world no one Rafael Nadal in the semis, people started to smell something very interesting to take place in the final. But Federer, coming out of the ashes of his tennis reflex crisis, made Murray run around the court---back and forth with his magic backhand forehand shots! It was indeed nice to see him making a unique game plan. //////Your reporter termed the 10 year ban on our players as "inevitable" and I agree, although I might add the word "regrettable". As you said in your editorial, the ICL is a reality that we cannot overlook. Rather than the predictable and petty reaction from the BCB to ban the players and do no more, a more considered reaction was desired. //////I know lots of letters and articles were printed in your newspaper regarding the topic but every day it seems that the Dhaka traffic situation is going from bad to worse. The DMP has failed to keep the traffic under control, especially during the month of Ramadan. The outcome was Saturday's (13.09.08) gridlock all over the city resulting in a baby's birth inside a vehicle.//////This could well be an exercise in futility, but I could not resist the temptation to resume my crusade for the solution of our Traffic Jams, that have now brought the city to a halt. The wide and commendable coverage that DS has been giving in recent weeks, both in writing and through stark pictures of gridlock and tailback have encouraged me to send you this, my 24th letter since last Ramadan on the subject. Your Tailback Tale No 1 is heartily welcomed.//////I read a very alarming news article relating to contaminated baby formula in China which has already caused the death of two babies. Milk powder tainted with Melamine in infant formula has sickened more than 1,200 infants so far across several provinces in China in a scandal that erupted last week but had originally focused solely on a particular brand. The initial scare had prompted a nationwide probe and the additional tainted brands appeared to have been detected through testing linked to that investigation. The Chinese government has said milk collectors deliberately contaminated the milk with melamine, possibly to boost its protein content. The government has ordered a halt to the sale of the 69 milk powder brands adulterated with the chemical melamine, adding the products were made by 22 different companies spread across China. //////I am referring to the disturbances created by the activists of the JCD, student wing of the BNP, which paralysed life on Dhaka University campus a few days back. They resorted to burning private cars, taxis, and buses, just because of rumours that Tarique Rahman had slipped in the hospital bathroom injuring himself.//////Over the past few years, it has oft been suggested that most of our national problems would be solved only if the two leaders would meet one another and talk. This topic has gained importance recently, particularly when it came out from one of the advisers of the present government. The adviser had to reassert that he never said the government would apply pressure to get the leaders meet. Though many observers are sceptical about the meeting, the nation as a whole is looking forward with both curiosity and hope to this occasion. //////In front of my residence, there is a Wasa pump site within the boundary of the government officers' quarters at Sobhanbag. Wasa has recently installed a generator which works when electricity is not available. As these days electricity goes off frequently, the generator has to be operated very often. But the inhabitants of the surrounding areas cannot live in peace due to its unbearable dreadful sound. The children cannot concentrate on their lessons. The house owners apprehend that their tenants may leave the place.//////The fuel price was around $146 plus per barrel a few weeks back. But at present it is going down significantly. It has come down even below $90 per barrel. When the price of oil was spiralling up, suddenly bus and other transport owners increased the fares. When the reason behind setting higher fuel prices no longer exists, the prices should be lowered by the authorities concerned and this should lead to reduced transport fares. //////Dhaka is now consuming the silent tears of poor children who are forced to undertake various gruelling tasks at their very early age, just to ensure the next meal for them and their family. Children are now being engaged in different risky jobs which often jeopardize their lives. It's a common scene in the streets that children are working as helpers in tempos and buses, and peddlers of flowers and water. They are found working in garages and chemical shops and also as domestic aid. Too often they face accidents as these are the tasks for which they are just not fit , both physically and mentally. These children lose all of their spirit and enthusiasm in their childhood and due to their grumpy fate they are prone to be at a very high risk in terms of health and security. The most shocking thing is that the rate of child labour is increasing day by day and by the time those children will be adult, they cannot contribute to themselves and the family just because they will have already lost their future in their childhood. //////Road traffic accident (RTA) is one of the most important causes of death and disabilities. And one of the important causes of RTA is unfit vehicles. They also cause air pollution. Dhaka is the most polluted city in the world. Air pollution also causes many diseases including cancer. Again it causes death and disabilities of our population. //////Today (17-09-2008) I went to the office of VFS in Gulshan-1 with my application for tourist visa to visit Thailand but came to know that all visa seekers would have to make appointments over telephone in advance to apply for visa to visit Thailand which was not the norm two days before. I have tried for more than two hours during office hours to contact the office of IVLAC/VFS over phone numbers 8850636 and 8811071 to get an appointment but could not make it as both the phones displayed either busy or no connection symbol every time.
