We find such a stance reflective of lack of maturity and not up to the intellect and wisdom that one expects of political leadership at the top. It is certainly not the way to look at sensitive issues, particularly when that has to do with as complex a relationship as that of India and Bangladesh.//////THE death of Jyoti Basu at ninety six brings to an end an illustrious career in West Bengal and Indian politics. There was always something intrinsically substantive about Basu. His long journey in politics, his primacy in its growth and expansion, indeed the way he stamped his authority and influence on it turned him, long before his death, into a household name not just in India but around the globe. There was the larger than life individual in him, a man dedicated fully and unequivocally to a cause. //////THERE was the leonine about him. Jyoti Basu was precisely what his name epitomised. He was light unto millions of Bengalis on the other side of the historical divide. He was a politician the likes of whom will never be again, for it was a grand combination of ideology and conviction which worked as the underpinning of his politics in all the decades that saw him transformed from student to lawmaker to chief minister to elder statesman. //////WHAT should have been a regular visit to India by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina suddenly became a much-hyped and talked about trip. Though, before the visit actually took place, it was the media that to some extent kicked up a lot of dust on the upcoming visit, and political parties, especially the opposition BNP, joined the bandwagon later and began raising the usual cries against the ruling party, going to the extent that Begum Zia threatened to lay thorns along Sheikh Hasina's path if she returned "empty handed" from India.//////The morning didn't show the day for the Indians at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in the port city on Sunday. India amassed 63 runs without losing any wicket from 13 overs in the first session giving indication that the much-praised batting line-up were going to pile up a mammoth total after Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan had decided to bowl first to exploit the overcast condition. Many might have been frustrated by the performance of the local bowlers in the first session but everything changed dramatically after the lunch session when India lost wickets like ninepins, thanks to the disciplined bowling effort by the Bangladeshi bowlers, especially Shakib and Shahadat Hossain were outstanding. It was a disastrous second session for India as they lost six wickets for 97 runs. And at the end of the day, Tigers proved that they have the quality to pull off surprise even in the longer-version of the game as an improving side. Sachin Tendulkar may have stood tall to frustrate Shakib's men a little bit but it was a memorable day nonetheless for the Tigers considering the fact that the Indian batting had hardly collapsed like that in the recent past when making over 400 runs has become a common feature of their batting. //////Bangladesh Under-19s lost their second match of the campaign as they lost to West Indies by a single run in Palmerston North yesterday.//////When Sachin Tendulkar attended the press briefing after scoring an unbeaten 76 on an eventful first day of the opening Test against Bangladesh at Chittagong yesterday, the batting maestro was up against some obvious yet bitter questions that interestingly had nothing to do with his outstanding effort under pressure that also saw him cross the 13,000-run milestone.//////Bangladesh Athletic Fede-ration (BAF) has a history of producing the fastest man in South Asian (SA) Federation Games that even the regional superpower India can envy.//////Chittagong bowlers wiped out the Barisal bottom half cheaply on the fourth morning of their National Cricket League match at the Khulna Divisional Stadium to record a 122-run win.//////The IPL has released its final list of 66 overseas players who will be involved in the IPL auction on Tuesday.

The list includes players from all eight Test-playing nations other than India, with 11 players from Pakistan, Australia and South Africa; nine from Sri Lanka; eight from England and West Indies; four from New Zealand and one each from Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, Canada and Holland.//////Morne Morkel took three wickets in seven balls as South Africa swept to a series-levelling victory on the fourth day of the fourth and final Test at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday.//////On a day of inevitabilities, Australia moved within six wickets of completing a clean-sweep against a disappointing Pakistan. Simon Katich scored his first century of the summer, Ricky Ponting recorded his highest aggregate in a Test and Pakistan's top order looked shakier than the few yachts brave enough to take to the Derwent River on a gloomy, windy and eventually rainy Hobart day.//////Grand Master Ziaur Rahman maintained his winning streak in the 8th Parsvnath International Open Chess Tournament in India as he beat Indian IM Kamble Vikramaditya in his fifth round game in Delhi yesterday.//////Chelsea reasserted their credentials as Premier League title favourites on Saturday with a 7-2 demolition of Sunderland that manager Carlo Ancelotti hailed as their best performance of the season.//////Lionel Messi scored his 100th Bar-celona goal on Saturday as the Spanish champions thumped Sevilla 4-0 at Camp Nou to go five points clear of Real Madrid.//////Roger Federer is the bookmakers' pick to win the Australian Open and it is hard to go past his Grand Slam dominance but influential pundits are tipping it's Andy Murray's time.//////Bari breathed new life into the Serie A title race by holding champions Inter Milan to a draw for the second time this season after a 2-2 stalemate that included three penalties.//////Egypt extended their record Africa Cup of Nations run to 14 games without defeat when securing their quarte-rfinal berth with a 2-0 win over Mozambique on Saturday.//////Brazilian legend Pele threw his support behind Diego Maradona on Saturday, insisting that the controversial Argentina coach was not to blame for his team's lacklustre form.//////Manchester United and Bayern Munich target Manuel Neuer said Sunday he will stay at Bundesliga title-condenders Schalke 04, providing the Royal Blues qualify for the Champions League next season.//////Portsmouth have sent a legal letter to the English Premier League over their transfer embargo and withholding of television rights revenues, the beleaguered club's chief executive Peter Storrie said.//////Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson will on Monday make a decision on whether Dimitar Berbatov, a scorer in the 3-0 win over Burnley, requires knee surgery.//////Everton defender Joseph Yobo has told Nigeria coach Shuaibu Amodu that he may have suffered a hamstring injury against Benin which could rule him out of the rest of Africa Cup of Nations.//////A local entrepreneur is going to build a five-star hotel based on international timesharing concept in Cox's Bazar at a cost of around Tk 150 crore.//////Family Bank, a microfinance bank licensed by the central bank of Bahrain, opened in Bahrain on Thursday, said a statement of Yunus Centre.//////Bharti Airtel is set to introduce its own brand in Bangladesh, targeting the youth and rural population in the six-operator mobile market.

It is evident that they have nowhere to go : no shanty or shack made of plastic and thatched bamboo. In other words they have no makeshift shelter, let alone a house. To ward off cold they make fire and burn garbage which gives off an acrid smoke .As the whole country is reeling under a cold wave, the misery of these homeless people is imaginable.//////I appreciate Dr. Shabbir A. Bashar for his article entitled Solar power as a prime energy source in Bangladesh? published in The Daily Star of December 26, 2009. It is very timely particularly when our policy makers are busy like anything to promote solar energy in the country without looking in its cost benefit. In this regard, I want to add a few more points here.//////St. Martin's, a small continental island in the Bay of Bengal, is located on the southern most tip of Bangladesh separated from the mainland by a channel which is about 9 km wide. St. Martin's island is endowed with vast marine and land resources having great biodiversity significance. The island is a good example of co-occurrence of corals, algae, seaweeds, grasses and mangroves. //////According to BRTC, the number of the vehicles is about 12 and a half lakh in the whole country.

They got licences according to the list of the labour union.//////Here we are dumping chemical dyes in the river, and at the same time, cleaning it up! What a contrasting phenomenon that reflects our total unawareness about environment pollution and poisoning! Mixing dyes on the riverbank should be a punishable criminal offence, not far removed from what Rid Pharmaceuticals did to Paracetamol syrup for babies!//////Bangladesh is missing millions of foreign exchange just because of a wrong decision.//////A New Year's resolution is a commitment that a person makes to a venture or reforming of a habit, frequently a lifestyle transformation that is normally interpreted as beneficial. The name comes from the reality that these commitments in general have an impact on New Year's Day and linger until satisfied or discarded. //////It is generally agreed that the world is facing a serious environmental problem due to global warming. Because of this, extreme events, for instance cyclone, tornado, flood, draught, sea-level rise, vector-borne diseases and other natural calamities are appearing recurrently. Anyhow, at the end of the year 2007, there was a terrifying cyclone 'Sidr' in Bangladesh, which was one of the serious consequences of global climate change. We can still remember the fateful night of November 15; 220 km per hour windstorm accompanied by a 30-foot high tidal-bore that hit Manikkhali under Burirchar union of Borguna upazila and Talatali of Amtali upazila.//////To draw world attention to the effects of climate change, Maldives govt held an under-water cabinet meeting in the sea and Nepal held their cabinet meeting on top of the Himalayas.//////Since taking oath last year, the AL govt. has crossed one year going through many twists and turns. Taking the notion of `change`, the govt. came to power and we can say that in some sectors the government has performed well. Before the AL came to power, Bangladesh experienced a crisis in the agriculture and power sectors which are now resolved to a large extent. //////To treat the boys and girls unequally is called gender discrimination. Naturally, in a male dominated country, the males enjoy more facilities than the females. The females suffer form an inferiority complex and the males feel themselves superior to the females. //////At least 60 people have died this winter in the cold wave. News reports from various print and e-media have mentioned that the cold wave is severe. It is so pathetic that so many people died because of cold, probably for the first time in Bangladesh. The southern districts are the worst hit.//////We shouldn't forget that blood groups, stature, colour of pupil and other physical and cultural heritage, etiquette, manners and thought process of Benglaee Muslims and Bengalee Hindus are very similar, except religious belief. We also shouldn't forget that for historical reasons Bengalee Hindus of lower castes or oppressed Hindus had been converted to Islam to save themselves from Hindu Zemindars and feudal lords created by East India Company. That is part of history, whether you like it or not. //////Sports and tourism are very interrelated and complementary. Sports and tourism share common goals, which build bridges of understanding among different cultures, lifestyles and traditions, promoting peace and goodwill among nations, motivating and inspiring young people and providing entertainment and enjoyment to relieve the pressures of daily life to large sections of the population. //////It is an irony to see the 'warmists' acknowledge the natural variability of climate in their January 6 press release stating that the coldest northern winter in 40 years " does not disprove global warming" because the bitter winter weather is simply a short term "blip" and a manifestation of "the natural variability of climate". Had it been the warmest winter in 40 years they would surely be singing a different tune.//////I am writing with reference to Point Counterpoint: "Profiling and screening Muslims only," by Abdullah Dewan (Jan. 10).//////A US drone attack yesterday killed 20 militants in an area of Pakistan's northwest tribal belt where local Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud reportedly escaped death days ago, officials said.//////Desperate Haitian quake survivors awaited vital supplies on Saturday as coordination problems hampered a massive international aid effort and US troops struggled to clear the logjam.//////President Barack Obama on Saturday brought together his White House predecessors, Republican George W Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton, for a joint appeal for victims of Haiti's devastating earthquake.//////Exhausted police fired in the air to scare off armed looters pillaging shops Saturday in the quake-ravaged Haitian capital, but to little effect.
