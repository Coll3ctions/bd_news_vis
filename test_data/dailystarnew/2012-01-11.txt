Inflation rate is considered one of the most important macro-economic indicators. Bangladesh's economy is at its worse at this moment. There are scores of reasons for rising inflation such as, demand-supply gap, poor monetary policy, lack of proper government regulations and policy decisions, excessive expenditures on non-productive sectors, import-export imbalances, etc. Inflation contributes to the loss of purchasing power, decrease in real income and a prolonged negative impact on investment. Given that we have twelve percent inflation rate till date, our savings rate remains somewhere around twelve percent or below. Now consider its consequences. We invest in different savings instruments with the sole objective of a good return whereas we end up with fewer amounts compared to what we had before in real terms! This is a nightmarish situation for any economy that exhibits a very dangerous trait if we consider the market dynamics such as multiplier effect, people's expectations, and demand-supply equilibrium. It is hard to survive in such a situation where people are struggling to obtain their basic needs. Hence, it demands drastic measures on the part of the policy makers.//////Depending upon the lens through which one analyses Bangladesh's current economic development, anyone will arrive at different conclusions. This is similar to the parable of four blind men who conclude differently as they touch different parts of an elephant's body. The one touching the tail compares the animal with a rope, the one feeling the trunk thinks it to be a snake, while the one touching the body decides that it must be like a wall. Like the blind, we also miss the big picture if we fail to recognise the different lenses and conclusions. At one extreme are the optimists who embrace free trade, free markets, liberalisation, and privatisation.//////Kamal Ahmed Majumder, who assaulted a female journalist recently, is known for terrorizing people who dare to speak against him using his goons. He is the president of the management committee of the reputed Monipur High School & College and is allegedly stealing money from the funds of the institution.//////I was worried to learn the news of an attempted rape by two top leaders of BCL in Satkhira recently. Many a time, the leaders of BCL in different institutions committed this kind of heinous crime. In most cases, the culprits went away unpunished. The BCL is embarrassing the present government repeatedly. We know that our PM has special feelings for our women and children. She is also vocal against repression on women. But it surprises us when we hear that after such a barbaric incident, the BCL committee of the district concerned has been dissolved only. Is that the punishment for a crime like rape?//////It is commonly believed that digital or e-textbooks would significantly lower the cost of pursuing education. But a recent study at the Daytona State College, Florida, United States found a quite different result! Students who purchased e-textbooks could save only one dollar compared to those who purchased traditional printed materials. The study however identified some problems on the way to using e-textbooks which include lack of necessary computing skill on the part of the students and often faculties, difficulties in opening digital course materials during lectures, etc.//////Byron's last page report in your January 7th issue defines OSDs as those who are officially called as Officers on Special Duty, which many jokingly refer to as 'Officers Searching a Desk'! However, there is contradiction in the report. In the first paragraph, it is stated that OSDs "are considered to be in a state of punishment"! This naturally pre-supposes that some fault or mistake has been committed by the officer. In contrast, in the eighth paragraph, officials from the public administration say that "civil servants are made OSDs mainly for two reasons - they get promoted but are not given any posting and for political reasons"! It adds that "these officers get full pay and all fringe benefits, including official vehicles where due." This therefore precludes any state of punishment! Although no statistics are available, it is estimated that the government spends several crore taka a month on OSDs! Assuming that it is ten crore taka a month, it comes to hundred and twenty crore taka every year, spent for "no work with all pay"! In contrast, low paid workers in the production sector work on "no work no pay basis"! Is it not a gross injustice? If OSDs are being made as a measure of punishment, then government should consider reducing their earned leave by half the number of days they are posted as OSDs. This can be adjusted against their usually large accumulated leave during payment of final dues at the time of retirement. That will have at least some monetary effect of the punitive measure taken.//////I was undergoing a three-day training programme at the local Mazda Dealership with a view to becoming a professional sales person. On the second day our trainer, a veteran sales person, during midday recess, inquired who parked his car at the place designated for the customers. I replied that it was me. Then he asked me to remove the car and park it on the alleyway adjacent to the Mazda Dealership during the next break.//////Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is not an honest man as he had not lived up to his constitutional oath, Pakistan's Supreme Court said yesterday, as it warned of action against him for failing to act on an order to reopen graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari.//////As a survey made public yesterday reported high level of malnutrition among children in India, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the problem of malnutrition is a matter of national shame.//////Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaque Pervez Kayani held an informal meeting with senior military officials at the Army General Headquarters (GHQ) yesterday following his return from China, DawnNews reported.//////Islamists aimed to cement control over Egypt's lower house of parliament as a final phase of voting began yesterday, while a secular party's plan to boycott elections for the upper chamber threatened to weaken the liberal bloc.//////Republican White House hopefuls faced New Hampshire voters yesterday in a first-in-the-nation primary which is all but certain to strengthen frontrunner Mitt Romney's hold on the nomination.//////The newly bereaved are at greatly increased risk of heart attack after the death of a close loved one, US researchers say.//////Gangs set up burning roadblocks, police fired tear gas and businesses shut in Nigeria yesterday, the second day of a national strike that has paralysed the country and left six people dead.//////At least two policemen were killed when a group of suicide bombers stormed a government building in southeastern Afghanistan yesterday, the interior ministry and officials said.//////Iran is accused of jamming broadcasts by Qatar-based news channel Al-Jazeera, satellite operator Arabsat said in a statement received yesterday.//////Thailand yesterday agreed a $63 million pot to compensate all victims of years of political unrest and aid reconciliation in the deeply divided nation, a government spokeswoman said.//////Describing India as the "greatest democracy on earth", Israel has said it wants New Delhi to become a permanent member of the expanded United Nations Security Council.//////Libya received roughly $20 billion in assets that were held overseas by Muammer Gaddafi's regime and frozen during the conflict that ousted him, the country's foreign minister said yesterday.//////The weeklong Sultan Mela-2012, marking the 87th birth anniversary of noted artist SM Sultan, began at Sultan Moncho premises in Narail on December 9.

But, of course, his campaign for popular liberty began long before that, through his plays and his articles and his absolute fearlessness before the powers that were. When he died recently, it was once again time to recall the tumultuous times which he inhabited, indeed helped shape, in what would soon be a post-Cold War world. By the time he died -- and this is again the unvarnished truth -- he was no more the political giant he was when he rode to power in Prague at the head of what came to be known as the Velvet Revolution; and yet that old appeal, the unforgettable charisma was always there. Havel went to his grave as one of the more widely respected political figures of his time.//////W E distri-bute goodwill gene-rously on New Year's largely because there isn't much chance of seeing it again for 364 days. But cynicism is a distasteful response to the array of mobile and immobile best wishes that welcome the departure of yet another year of our lives. Having received my little share, I thought it only fair to record what precisely my five preferred best-of-the-best wishes for 2012 are. //////The Indian prime minister's visit to Bangladesh is considered a failure in public perception in Bangladesh because it was much hyped as one that would resolve the long-standing water-sharing issue on the Teesta River.//////A series of financial crisis that jolted the world economy over the past fifteen years or so has raised serious concerns about unethical conduct in banking operations. Regulatory authorities around the world are struggling to formulate reform measures to prevent recurrence of such malaise. Any discussion on the subject of ethics in banking inevitably requires some elaboration of what is understood by ethics, what are the functions of a bank and the interface between them. //////January 11 is the birth anniversary of the late Justice Syed Mahbub Murshed. He will be remembered for many things, particularly his fearless independence on the Bench and many landmark judgments, chiefly on constitutional issues. Consider the following cynical statement about justice made by one Thrasymachus in Plato's Republic: I declare that justice is nothing else than that which is advantageous to the stronger. To Plato (and Murshed) justice was the very antithesis of this rhetorical statement. Judges are meant to be independent, but do they always dare exercise this independence in the face of a powerful executive, and when their own personal advancement may be jeopardised by the exercise of strict independence and adherence to the right, however inconvenient? In other words, there are many who behave in accordance with Thrasymachus' thinking, and a few who do not. //////
