Once, the tiger ruled over a major part of the globe ranging from the Pacific to the Black Sea and from Ural Mountains to the Mountain Agung. It is an irony of fate that tiger is facing an onslaught of poaching throughout its range. The main factor contributing in the decline of cat population is habitat degradation.

Over the past few centuries tigers lost more than 80% of their natural habitats and what remain are only small fragments under heavy anthropogenic pressure. //////LAST year I wrote an article (published on August 7, 2010 in The Daily Star) with a title 'how likely is flooding this year'.

There is magic in the moon, says Akhtar. Wherever its light falls --- on ponds, on deserts, on homes, on flowers, on fallen twigs --- it envelopes the object of its brilliance in beauty. And so it is with Faiz's poetry. It acts as a transformational force on the themes it deals with. It underscores the power of poetry to create the sublime and then bring it into the lives of people. It is just as well. In this centenary year of Faiz Ahmed Faiz's birth, it becomes necessary to recall the fervour and the commitment he brought to Urdu poetry and in the process enhanced the quality of a genre that in earlier times was enriched at various points by Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Bahadur Shah Zafar and Allama Iqbal. And, of course, by so many others.//////The death anniversary of eminent philosopher and educationist Professor Sydur Rahman passed on 28 August. He was an uncompromising voice for secular thought.

The hint of slight fragrance in the air came from the south side of the pond where the dense foliage of honeysuckle was growing wild and left untouched. It was empyrean beauty. She sat still, closing her eyes, while savouring the blended crescendo of wind, music and laughter, but not words. Hers is the boundary that crosses speech into silence. In it she finds an outpouring of self through the compulsion to reach within, a kind of oblivion to her history of becoming. It is a terrain on which she has come to depend as some kind of transcendence to the sprinklings of finding her real self. //////Neonatal mortality rate in Bangladesh is 37 per 1000 live births on an average; in some areas this is even much higher.

Yes, there are the civil wars and the pogroms that we are pelted with day after day through the media. The tales of corrupt, venal dictators and of the murderous nature of men, as in the Rwanda genocide of 1994 or the post-independence happenings in the Congo in the early 1960s, are what have kept us bound to the thought that Africa is a synonym for chaos. That is a mistaken belief, for Africa is a place, a continent like any other. Nature has endowed it with beauty. Its people, part of its innumerable tribes, have kept life going in the way their ancestors did long ago.//////
