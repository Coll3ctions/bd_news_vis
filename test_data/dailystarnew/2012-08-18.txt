It is essentially on how much people are able to observe the dictates of faith, in this case uphold the spirit of Ramadan through staying true to all its concomitant injunctions, that the spirit of Eid-ul-Fitr is to be determined. In plain terms, therefore, the Muslim who has steadfastly observed, in that very deep sense of understanding, the month of fasting has not only understood better the transitory nature of life but also his calling in the world of the living.//////Parliamentarians need to review laws already enacted, particularly those that deal with fundamental rights, such as civil liberties. These need to be monitored on how they are being implemented in the field. Parliamentary Standing Committees (PSCs) are empowered by Article 76 (2) (b) of the constitution to review both enforcement of laws and propose measures for the better enforcement of laws should they see fit. Such review is needed particularly in light of the fact that several laws like The Speedy Trials Act or indeed Section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure continue to be misused to settle political scores and violate human rights, as highlighted in the recent case of Limon. //////Football is a team game which needs an experienced man-manager at the helm.

It was the mid-nineteen nineties. Preparation work for a World Bank-funded project on non-formal education was underway and the meeting was part of this process. As an education specialist in the team, I was interested in the views of rural Bangladeshi women on literacy programmes for young adults. The animated interventions, confidence, and enthusiasm of five or six women particularly struck me. They introduced themselves as members of the Grameen Bank. This was my first direct interaction with Grameen borrowers. The women left an everlasting impression on my mind.//////The number of industries in Dhaka is huge, and it is ever-increasing while causing serious pollution to water, air and land of the densely-populated capital.

Incidentally, District of Columbia was severely hit recently by thunderstorm which knocked out power and kept the city roasting without air conditioning for days in 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Global warming appears to be real.//////Our planet contains an amazing diversity of plants, approximately a quarter of a million species. They provide essential food and shelter, without which we and most other animals would quickly die. In turn, many plants cannot survive without animals to pollinate their flowers and disperse their seeds. Each plant has its own unique needs, some relying on many kinds of animals, others on just a few or even one. Butterflies, bees, bats and birds each pollinate plants that others cannot. From deserts to rain forests, flowering plants have developed a wide range of colors, shapes, sizes and forms, all designed to guarantee that a particular pollinator spreads pollen from plant to plant, ensuring the production of new seeds.//////Those living call it life. Life, a bouquet of enigmatic questions. Life, the veil of red, yellow and blue, churning out hues galore. Questions, questions and questions. Come to think of it. When did the days of oneness, closeness, trust and trivial disagreements end? Where to hide the shock of humiliation, of rejection and the pain of a parting which only death was to provide? How to answer the children and the family, how to confront society, the questioning ensemble of lifted fingers? Where did things go wrong and start going downhill? Was it fate? Was it single-handedly so strong that could, in a flash, destroy a nest so neatly prepared and rip the non-biological tie of matrimony?//////Don't expect love poem today//////I can't I'll be busy//////Once again, Eid is coming to greets us.

Some political analysts are questioning Bhutan's resistance to establishing diplomatic ties with China, while others have asserted publicly that Bhutan-China relations are inevitable and would become a diplomatic reality in the years to come. Amidst these competing voices, Bhutan, for its part, has officially maintained silence over the issue. An obvious pointer to this was the way Bhutan chose silence in the wake of media reports in China and India about the interaction on developing Sino-Bhutan relations between the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Bhutanese Prime Minister Jigme Thinley at the sidelines of the Rio+20 summit. Significantly, the official mouth piece of Bhutan, The Kuensel, totally ignored the issue. However, a popular daily, The Bhutanese, mentioned categorically, on the basis of a Press Release issued by the Prime Minister's office, that the local Chinese media had misreported that Bhutan and China will establish diplomatic ties. //////The crisis in Syria has unfolded in March 2011 with having its own roots. People have discontents with government's action and came out to street while the government reacted in a way that most dictators do. We have, however, two versions of accounts of the event. It is almost impossible to independently verify the array of information that comes from both sidesinternational media is struggling with its ebbing credibility for quite some time, while the Syrian government media is naturally hiding information to save President Assad. Nevertheless, nobody has a reason to believe government's story that only 'terrorists' are to blame for all the misfortune the Syrians are facing on the street. //////Sixty-seven years have passed since then.

In //////, it is powerful fiction that he weaves out of the twilight struggle Bengalis went through in 1971. And yet it is not fiction. The narrative transcends fiction, for its roots lie in the realities which shaped the war against Pakistan more than four decades ago. In this work, the symbolism is what matters, for in Safia Begum comes alive the story of all the mothers who paid a terrible price in the struggle for liberty, who found themselves facing squarely a conflict not of their making. With three million people dead, with more than two hundred thousand Bengali women raped by the Pakistan army, Bangladesh's history thrives on a scale of epic proportions.//////Julius Caesar disregarded warnings about the Ides of March. He believed, as Shakespeare would have us know, that he was more dangerous than danger itself. That precisely is what he told his wife Calpurnia when she tried to dissuade him from going to the senate because of the nightmares she had gone through during the preceding night. As he approached the senate, he came across the man who had warned him of the Ides of March. 'The Ides of March are come', said Caesar, almost in a triumphant vein. 'Aye, Caesar, but not gone', replied the soothsayer. On his way to the senate, Caesar was handed a scroll by the scholar Artemidorus, who apparently had some inkling of the plot against him. The dictator did not deign to read it. Moments later, he was dead at the foot of Pompey's statue inside the senate building. There were twenty three stab marks on his body. The last one, made by Brutus, was in his groin.//////, a collection of forty-eight poems, reached me mysteriously. My first copy was either stolen or lost. However, I procured a second copy and devoured many of the poems. It is difficult, really difficult sometimes to discover the hidden meaning of some of the poems. It is a common phenomenon with almost all the poems. The first poem of this collection, 'Mystic Infinity', shows that the poet wants to seek divine pleasure through closing his eyes and forgetting the pains, anxieties and sorrows of this modern age. He wishes to immortalize this peace and tranquility of mind. I am sure the first poem will captivate the attention of any reader and get him or her into reading the other poems. //////
