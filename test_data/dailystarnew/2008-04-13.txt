Exhaust fumes from faulty engines of motorised vehicles, especially diesel engines, remain the number one cause behind release of large amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and lead particles. Thus, one can clearly perceive the consequence in terms of air quality when the number of motorised vehicles keeps increasing by ten percent annually in the city alone. The constant increase of vehicles is also contributing to severe jam on the streets, which again causes burning of fuel in large amount in the stranded vehicles. //////FOR a nation yet to get acclimatised to substantive democracy, Nepal appears to have been doing reasonably well for itself. The elections last Thursday, for which votes are still being counted, drew as many as 60 per cent of the electorate to the polling stations. There have, of course, been instances of pre-election violence, but they have been minimal. The dire predictions earlier made by many about a disruption in the voting have been belied. And yet it becomes the responsibility of all parties taking part in the elections to ensure that the results are respected and upheld.//////IF one were to interrogate Walt Rostow's proposed theory of the stages of economic growth then the time to be taken by the developing countries in reaching stage of developed state would become indeterminate.

The bad news is that he has irritated Mayawati, the increasingly iconic leader of India's Dalits.//////AFTER the Democratic Party National Convention in Atlanta in July 1988, nominee Governor Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts held a 17-point lead over the Republican nominee, Vice-President George H. W. Bush.

You must accept that defeat will, at present, mostly be inevitable, but you must also be able to draw from it some solace, something to hold on to.

Let me clarify: Food prices have gone up internationally. It's not an excuse for the present CTG but a reality. Why don't we change our food habits, not for these " hidden hunger days but for the years ahead. Not only potato, which had a bumper production this year, but other cereals could be added to make it a balanced diet. We need publicity. BTV can do that instead of sermonising the farmers on how to produce boro or how to protect potatoes. Actually BTV is run by taxpayers' money but they are not doing enough to promote national interests. //////The Clintons have injected former President Bill into the battle to such an extent that an insulting (yet not inaccurate) word -- Billary --is back in political parlance.

It is a worthwhile achievement, and the private sector investor deserves our congratulations for this innovative industry for recycling cotton and garment wastes. I believe this enterprise has a good potential in Bangladesh and is an important import substitution for reducing the need for imported raw cotton and yarn.//////It is time we should bring about substantial changes in our lifestyle with regard to food habits particularly amongst marginal and vulnerable groups. Indeed, there has been a worldwide food grain and cereal shortage. Global climate change has an adverse effect leading to sea level rise, increase in floods, cyclones, tornadoes, drought and loss of biodiversity. Many factors including climatic changes resulted in unprecedented price escalation. We have witnessed over the last one or two years unprecedented political turmoil, flash floods and devastating effects of cyclone Sidr resulting in totally chaotic consumer market scenario. Misdistribution of fertiliser and/or pesticides, too much profiteering by the middlemen and increased cost of transportation have certainly contributed to the unaffordable price of rice, ata and edible oil. //////It is wonderful news, published in your daily and issued by the foreign ministry on 24 March, that British passport holder Bangladeshis from now on will retain their Bangladeshi citizenship automatically under a new rule of the Ministry of Home affairs.

As evening creeps in, the readers have no choice but to read in dimly-lit halls. The corridors have bad smell as the toilets are not cleaned properly. //////Our country is facing many problems of which three appear most pressing. These are food crisis, shortage of power and financial crunch. The caretaker government is trying many options including disbursing valuable advices, of course free of cost! People demand something concrete. To alleviate the food crisis it is suggested that we change our food habit, take more potatoes to supplement rice. Can't we set some examples here? We may serve potato made items in our government functions, we may urge government officials to take their lunch made from potato and other vegetables. Those institutions getting government subsidies in food items may take 50% potato in place of rice or ata. The guest control law may be stringently followed to stop extravagant use of food items. //////A local Bengali daily has carried a news item that the two leaders in jail will have to agree to three conditions to get released from jail. I have no intention to repeat the conditions mentioned, but the conditions look like an arbitrary formula of the government to pave the way for controlled democracy. I have doubt that these would be acceptable to the two leaders or to their party cadres. These conditions seem to be a hard line approach of the government, but the scope of negotiation cannot still be ruled out, hopefully. //////Israeli forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip yesterday, the army said, after a raid that left seven people dead, including a 10-year-old boy.//////Afghan and foreign troops clashed with and called airstrikes on militants in southern Afghanistan, leaving 24 dead and eight wounded, an official said Saturday. //////Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse called for national unity Saturday in his traditional New Year message as 10 more deaths were reported in the conflict-racked nation.//////The leaders of southern Africa gathered yesterday in Zambia for emergency talks to discuss the post-election crisis in neighbouring Zimbabwe, despite Robert Mugabe's decision to skip the summit.//////Iraqi authorities ordered residents off the streets of Baghdad's Shia militia bastion Sadr City on Saturday, warning they are littered with bombs, after a night of fighting that killed 13 people.//////Chinese President Hu Jintao took a hard line yesterday in his first remarks on the recent unrest in Tibet, saying the matter is an internal affair that impacts Chinese sovereignty. //////Pakistani security forces have taken control of a militant stronghold in the restive northwestern Swat valley following an increase in activities by pro-Taliban rebels who had been lying low for several months.//////Former US president Jimmy Carter on Saturday urged that Nepal's Maoists be struck off the US terror list after the former rebels took an early lead in election results.//////Socialist Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero took the oath of office in front of King Juan Carlos Saturday, beginning his second term as prime minister with a flagging economy and Basque separatism as his chief concerns.//////Indian activists on Friday became the latest to denounce the UN Human Rights Council's new country review method, slamming a "distorted" process that left civil society on the sidelines.//////Italian voters yesterday mulled over their choice on the eve of an election that offers little hope for significant change as the country faces an economic slowdown and continued political instability.//////Recent violence in Basra has convinced the administration of President George W Bush that Iran and not al-Qaeda is now the primary threat to US interests in Iraq, The Washington Post said yesterday. //////Barack Obama sees himself with a disadvantage in Pennsylvania and with an advantage in North Carolina.

Ancient China was the centre of world civilisation, and the seat of knowledge, wisdom and culture for millennia. Even our Prophet Muhamamd 1500 years ago instructed people to travel to China to seek knowledge. China, especially in recent decades, has achieved tremendous progress and development in all spheres of national life. It has turned out to be the most vibrant nation, a great economic powerhouse, a nation most confident and determined, and is unabatedly surging forward. China watchers appreciate that, with the present pace of development, by 2030 it will be the largest economy and greatest economic power, overtaking US.

It has very high maturity, prudence and vision.//////FOOD prices are continuing to sky-rocket throughout Asia, causing many governments to intervene to try to stabilise their domestic rice prices for fear of acute shortages in the future.
