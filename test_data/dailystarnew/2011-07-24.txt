The glory of wining was shining in their eyes, but who knew that it would be their last triumph? Among those 43 boys 7 of them were only son of their parents, which also matches with me. Almighty Allah's thoughts are unpredictable! I think He warned us to be aware and take action against these stupid cruel people who only looks for their profit.

Please hand the accused over to the law enforcers before you go for the killing game. Find the true culprits behind these murders and give them exemplary punishment which may discourage others to do these heinous acts in future. //////After killing Osama Bin Laden and throwing his dead body into the Arabian Sea, the USA now wants to kill Zawhiri, the successor of late Osama Bin Laden.

On all previous 14 amendments no one cared to arrange any public debate not to speak of inviting opposition to discuss. 15th amendment is made perhaps with an unusual long discourse. Awami League led Grand Alliance government tried to elicit opinion of all concerned before placing the all important bill. The amendment passed duly. BNP led opposition boycotted all the processes including parliament sessions. Now they have taken the path of agitation and other destructive means to ventilate their opinions. The leader of the opposition even made audacious gesture like 'throwing away' the constitution. This attitude is not in conformity with the democratic norms. The same party is also agitating against charge sheets of sensational 21st August carnage and 10 truck arms haul case. We do not want to comment on under trial cases but these are all true cases. Let the truth be established in open trial. Government should be firm to establish rule of law. Opposition should stick to lawful process. The constitution of the country is sacred document. None will be allowed to throw it away. //////A love letter written and posted by a Pittsburgh girl to her beau (Boyfriend/lover) in February 1958 finally reached California University of Pennsylvania on July 8, 2011.
