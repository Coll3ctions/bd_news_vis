This much becomes obvious from the declaration adopted at the conference. It is to be noted that a strong team from Bangladesh took part in the congress and indeed made a number of points about the theme that needed to be debated in the larger interest of children not only in Bangladesh but elsewhere as well. What the congress has done is simply to focus on the many ways in which the rights of children are systematically violated, to a point where they are not allowed to become part of creative society. //////WHILE the entire nation is anxiously waiting for the long stalled ninth parliamentary election, the exchange of pleasantries between two top political leaders Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia on November 21 evening at the Armed Forces Day reception, brought a bit of relief for the nation in the on-going stalemate on holding the parliamentary election. //////THE power of fear is immense and intense. It is axiomatic that evil of the magnitude perpetrated in Mumbai, through a collusion between Pakistan-based hate-filled terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Indian fifth columnists will have a direct impact on the political mood of the nation. It is inevitable that the mood will reflect on polling in an election season. But we need to understand the nuances of this impact carefully. The hyperinflation of knee-jerk analysis can be toxic to the truth.//////It had been considered as the toughest task for the Tigers to play South Africa in their own conditions and nobody would disagree with this reality. Not only for the bottom-ranked Bangladesh side rather even for many other top-ranked sides it is a difficult territory to achieve something, so there had hardly been any high expectations in the Tigers' second trip to the country after a six-year gap.//////Sakib Sarkar gave a good all-round show to help Rangpur claim a close two-wicket win over strong Mymensingh in the third quarterfinal of the 29th National Cricket Championship at the Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore yesterday.//////Michael Hussey and Ricky Ponting produced contrasting half-centuries on a day when Australia continued to control the second Test but could not bury New Zealand in perfect batting conditions. //////Sumit Chowdhury led the trounce of Nepal under-17 side as his six wickets helped Bangladesh under-17 win by an innings and 45 runs at the Tudikhel ground in Kathmandu yesterday.//////Manchester United will be looking for revenge as well as the chance to get their Premier League title push back on track when they take on newly-rich neighbours Manchester City on Sunday.//////Arsenal's fading English Premier League title ambitions face a make-or-break moment on Sunday when they visit leaders Chelsea for a London derby at their Stamford Bridge fortress.//////When Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari and Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger go head-to-head in Sunday's Premier League showdown, they will briefly put on hold a friendship forged in Japan a decade ago.//////Zenit St Petersburg have raised the stakes in their battle with Andrei Arshavin over his transfer from the club, after they claimed that it would be end of his career if he went on strike.//////Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez admitted on Friday that he was mystified by the latest hamstring problem to be suffered by star Spanish striker Fernando Torres.//////England midfielder Gareth Barry on Friday pledged his future to Aston Villa until the end of the season, quashing speculation that he may leave in the January transfer window.//////Italian Olympic swimming champion Federica Pellegrini suffered a health scare when she struggled to catch her breath while taking part in the country's winter championships in Genoa, the ANSA news agency reported Friday.//////Lalit Modi, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) vice-president, has said India could go Pakistan's way in losing out on international series if terrorist attacks continue.

Hussey has become so good at stabilising potentially worrying situations that he could get a job straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa.//////The Test has started to slip away from New Zealand but Brendon McCullum hopes that at least their inexperienced line-up has learnt from the series so far. Things started to go wrong when New Zealand added only eight runs on Saturday morning for the loss of their last four wickets and a score of 270 was insufficient at a venue where first-innings totals are often double that.//////A former AC Milan player has admitted he and other players in the Italian club were "victims" of doping in the 1960s and 70s.//////With a 3-1 win over Sadharan Bima yesterday, Uttar Baridhara Club became unbeaten champions in the Second Division Football League.//////Calcutta Cricket & Football Club clinched the six-a-side cricket tournament of the Dhaka Sports Carnival at the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium yesterday.//////A seven-member Bangladesh team will take part in the first-ever South Asian Taekwon-do Championship in Kathmandu from December 1.//////Cricket Australia has lost "millions of dollars" from the postponement of the Champions League Twenty20 and the teams involved in the tournament are also worried about what they have missed out on as a result of the Mumbai terrorist attacks.

This leaves natural gas or coal as only available prime fossil fuel sources (not requiring import from abroad), which although polluting can nevertheless be used with refinements. However, the supply of these fuels are also not unlimited and in a few years they would also run out.//////The businessman of Bangladesh are said to be the champion in food adulteration. Most of the businessmen of our country are unscrupulous. They have no conscience and morality. The main objective of the business is maximization of profit. In order to achieve their prime objective they often choose the shortest path, which is unethical as well as illegal. An unscrupulous businessperson can make money by killing innocent people. Business ethics may be found in the book but in reality we are far away from this practice. According to the Weinrich H & Koontz H Business ethics is concerned with truth and justice and has a variety of aspects such as the expectations of society, fair competition, advertising, public relations, social responsibilities, consumer autonomy, and corporate behaviour in the home country as well as abroad. But what we find in reality is odious business practices. No one is concerned about consumer's health or welfare. One can easily find the redundancy of proof about my statement if we look around the following matters.//////Football legend Diego Maradona had a fine debut as the coach of Argentina's national team when Argentina won a friendly game against Scotland at Hampden Park, Scotland -- 1-0. Interestingly, Maradona scored his first international goal against Scotland at the same venue in 1979 when he was 18-year old. Argentina won that match 3-1 and the current Scotland coach George Burley played against Maradona in that game. Maradona fielded a strong line up based on all Europe based players except one player, Emiliano Papa who plays for Velez Sarsfield in Argentina's domestic league. Maradona appointed Liverpool's hard working midfielder Javier Mascherano as the team's new captain. It seems that the most capped Argentina veteran, Javier Zanetti of Inter Milan, Italy (he is the captain of Italian giants Inter Milan for the last few years), won't lead Argentina under Maradona. //////The terror that struck Mumbai on November 27 was a heinous assault on innocent people --- a tragedy for humanity at large.//////BETTER late than never.

The necessity of respective manpower production, that is, physiotherapists is increasing. It is essential for our country due to gradual increase in the number Road Traffic Accidents.//////Just tune in to a deshi TV channel, you will find them sometimes at loggerheads and sometimes trying hard to salvage the country and the people from all junks and pains overnight. They are the talk show experts, the jack of all trades. They delve into the faults, mistakes, lacks and lapses of this caretaker government, meticulously analyse them, severely admonish the Advisers and the Election Commissioners and then put up their valuable advices what should have been done but not what should be done next. They never tread the path by mistake even where this government has done commendable jobs. Who are they? Not all but few vainglorious media persons, retired government officials and ruminant politicians who stood hat in hands before the party governments in power and their 'Netries". They did not do any such thing at that time when the party governments openly committed big blunders like corruption, terrorism, plunders and all evils, rather they endeavoured tooth and nail to prove them clean and even. The consequences were seen by the people of the country and of the world.//////While talking with me, a Turkish friend at DU very recently expressed his concern about the possible misery of hartal, which was a terrible experience for him when he came across this as a first year student at this university. I believe, the people, during the reign of emergency, also have forgotten this phenomenon.//////Recently I had the opportunity to observe the debate between two lawyers in a court. One of them was trying to save an innocent man and another was trying to prove the innocent man to be a criminal. Fortunately, the magistrate issued bail to that innocent man and made him free temporarily. I am 100% sure that the lawyers and police knew that the person who was in jail was innocent. This incident raised lots of questions in my mind. Such as 1) Should police be given the power to arrest anybody just on the basis of allegation or suspicion? 2) If yes then can we live in an independent country with freedom of honest people?, 3) Should not our government take any action against those police personnel who arrest innocent people after getting bribe from a criminal? 4) Should not the lawyers who try to prove an innocent person guilty face questions regarding their professional ethics? //////Pinki and Sharna are two friends from their childhood. They were born and brought up in the same environment and same culture. They face similar social problems almost every moment because they are girls. Girls of their age are married normally at minor age in their society. But they don't want to marry at this stage, rather they want to continue higher studies with the expectation of being famous scientists. Now Sharna and Pinki are classmates at the Khairunnessa Memorial Technical School at Ikrail located in a river island (Char) of Bangladesh and they are supposed to appear at the S.S.C (Vocational) Board Final Examinations under Bangladesh Technical Education Board in March 2009.

The intensive care unit (ICU) is one such inherent but basic part of a hospital. Our medical college hospitals do not have this life-saving unit. It is quite explicable that the government cannot provide everything for free where a big population of the country does not pay taxes. But setting up an ICU at medical college hospitals is a demand of time. Many local private hospitals in Bangladesh now have the know-how and they can help training nurses and technicians to run an ICU.//////I went to apply for Indian visa in the Indian Embassy at Dhaka. It was a unique experience. The applicants' line for visa extended from the embassy gate of Road.137, Gulshan to the end of shooting club and beyond. Thousands of people thronged for visa. I interviewed a few. Most of them were young people in the thirties and from normal middle class background. At first they lined up at the bridge-head near 'Arong' outlet in Gulshan -Tejgaon link Road from the previous day evening. After midnight police allowed them to 'run' and again line up near the shooting club. During this procedure the 'dalals' or brokers reigned supreme .They occupied most of the front positions. The visa section opens from 8:00am and they accept applications till 12:00. Brokers sold the places later on. The asking rate varies from one thousand to two hundred taka depending on the place and time of sale. Police is also a party to this business. The brokers, guards and police work in tandem in sale of places. There are three lines- for women, 'specials' and hapless 'men'. Preference is given to the women and 'special' applicants. Every day at least a few hundred 'men' return without being successful. As demand is more than the supply some 'corruption' is bound to happen. A solution needs to be found.//////Pakistan's cabinet was holding crisis talks yesterday to discuss a response to the Mumbai attacks after Islamabad reversed a decision to send the head of military intelligence to India.//////There was mounting evidence that a Kashmiri-based Pakistani militant group, most likely Lashkar-e-Taiba, was responsible for the deadly attacks in Mumbai, The New York Times reported on its website late Friday. //////Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, who is hiding in Pakistan, may be involved in organising the attack on Mumbai, claimed Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad sources.//////Indian newspapers yesterday lambasted security chiefs and politicians for a panicked and selfish response to the Mumbai terror attacks.//////A survivor of the Mumbai attacks told US television Friday of a harrowing encounter with a smiling gunman at the Taj Mahal hotel, at the start of the bloody wave of attacks in the Indian city that has killed up to 155 people.//////Indian troops shot dead seven Islamic militants, including Pakistanis, in revolt-hit Kashmir ahead of another round of voting in state elections, police said yesterday.//////Eight of the Islamic militants involved in the attack on India's economic capital Mumbai infiltrated the city a month before the raid, Indian military intelligence sources told AFP yesterday.//////Indian newspapers yesterday lambasted security chiefs and politicians for a panicked and selfish response to the Mumbai terror attacks.//////President-elect Barack Obama on Friday expressed sorrow for the victims of the attacks on Mumbai and said the militants who staged the assault would not defeat India's "great democracy" or the global coalition arrayed against them.//////Gunbattles and airstrikes by Nato and Afghan troops killed 53 militants in Afghanistan, including a wanted Taliban commander who tried to hide from soldiers under a woman's burqa, officials said Saturday.//////The head of Myanmar's military regime has told supporters plans for elections in 2010 under a controversial "road map" to democracy are well under way, state media reported yesterday.//////Former Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by the military in 2006, has warned of bloodshed if the army stages another coup to end the political turmoil paralysing the kingdom.//////Somali pirates demanding 25 million dollars for a Saudi supertanker seized two weeks ago said Saturday they were hoping for a "favourable" reply as the expiry for the ransom loomed.//////Canada's Conservative government faces possible defeat as early as December 8, after refusing to back away from a showdown with the opposition over stimulus measures and spending cuts.//////Artefacts from various historical periods are on display at the Mohasthan Archaeological Museum premises.

An estimated 12 to 25 terrorists are believed to have entered Mumbai by sea on November 26 at around 9:30 p.m. (local time). After landing, the terrorists initiated attacks at a police station, then fanned across the city to attack the soft underbelly of hotels, cafes, cinemas, and hospitals.
