It's a matter of concern that the city is getting more crowded day by day. There is no gainsaying the fact that parks are like the lungs of a modern metropolis. But unfortunately, the port city has no park worth the name. Thanks to our apathy to the environment, most of the hills that once dotted the town have already disappeared. Today one can find some hills only in the areas that belong to the railway. //////Humayun Ahmed is now a name of hope for his millions of fans.

He called on rulers of the Muslim countries not to oppress their people but to help them lead a dignified life. I strongly support the observation made by the respectable Grand Mufti as he said, "It is the duty of Muslim leaders to maintain justice and fight corruption. Their priority should be the welfare of their people". //////The Public Service Commission has recommended increasing the age limit for BCS examinees in its annual report of 2010.

Muammar Gaddafi was killed in a barbaric manner and his body was dragged through the streets of Sirte by a frenzied mob. The West became overjoyed and hailed his death instantly.

It is an open secret how peaceful protests of Libyans turned aggressive and overpowered a strong ruler of Africa. The West killed two birds with one stone. //////Technology makes our life easier and comfortable. A new addition to this technological advancement is EVM (Electronic Voting Machine).

In a society of shrinking truth and declining heroism, this young woman from Barguna has rekindled our self-confidence through her sheer, considered refusal to accept a man for a husband who has absolutely no shame in asking for a dowry. You hardly get brave individuals like Farzana any more. More to the point, the instance is rare of a bride decisively walking off the wedding stage, changing back into her usual raiment and telling the man she has just married to get moving. In a social ambience where conservatism runs deep, despite all our emphasis on liberalism of belief and thought, Farzana has achieved a feat. Beyond an expression of this clich, let us note that from her we have just learned anew the meaning of a principled attitude to life, a feeling that no one should take things for granted. The man she married and now will divorce, his aunt and the rest of the family ought now to be informed, from the point of view of both legality and morality, that they have sinned and have committed a criminal act and must therefore pay the price.//////Bangladesh took over the chairmanship of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) on November 14, after the successful two-day meeting of the Forum.

In addition common complications from diabetes, namely coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, amputations, renal failure and blindness, are resulting in increasing disability, reduced life expectancy and massive health costs for almost every nation.
