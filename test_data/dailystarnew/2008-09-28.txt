On the one hand, there is the clear feeling that the chiefs of the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party should get down to one on one discussions. On the other, much theatrics has come into the entire matter, especially since Barrister Rafiqul Huq in off the cuff remarks said that the two leaders should talk directly to each other and that he was trying to bring them together. Huq's acceptability to both sides attracted public attention and generated a good deal of interest. //////THE Holy Prophet (PBUH) has enjoined upon us to seek Lail-at-ul Qadr, Night of Power, in the last ten nights of Ramadan and says that he who spends the Night in worship, with a pure motive of faith and devotion, will have all his past sins forgiven. //////QUITE a number of scholars have dwelt on the role of the rural non-farm activities (RNFA) in greasing growth and reducing poverty in rural areas.

It has been revealed that RNFA constitute one-fifth to one-fourth of household income and account for 20-40 percent of rural employment generation. More important than this, they are bracketed as a beacon in the rural livelihoods. //////THE definition of a political party from the time of Edmund Burke as "an organised assembly of men united for working together for the national interest" has changed over time to one that may not accept members from a minority community and insists on establishing khilafat.

Bush convened the Annapolis peace talks last October, the number of construction tenders issued in East Jerusalem has increased by a factor of 38 compared to the previous year.

I have got mixed feelings about the whole issue as I see strong points both in favour and against these players. I will try to share my points of view and concerns which are solely my personal opinion. I don't expect everyone or anyone to agree with me; I am just trying to bring a different perspective into the issue://////It is matter of great concern that the polythene bags have staged a comeback after a gap of six years. Thanks to the strict measures taken by the authorities, the production, supply and consumption of these bags were brought to a minimum level. Consequently, the environment became a bit cleaner. But of late the situation has taken a turn for the worse .//////We note with grave concern that The Daily Star, in its issue of Sunday, 21 September 2008, carried a misleading editorial regarding Hizbut Tahrir Bangladesh. The editorial is baseless and clearly motivated. On behalf of Hizbut Tahrir, we register our protest at the editorial. The following is our response to some of the comments made in the editorial in question.//////On 16 September another barbaric incident of acid throwing took place. This time the victims were a two-year-old infant Ashiqur and his mother. The baby was seriously and the mother was partly burnt. It was utterly shocking news.//////When fuel price was higher in the global market, the govt. increased the price to reduce its subsidy. And we are the worst sufferers. Our monthly income or salary was not raised. Now in the global market fuel prices have gone down to 97-100 $. //////It is no better a government than its predecessors. The CTG was supposed to set examples of capability and efficiency and clean out all corrupt practices! Now it seems that they need cleaning up badly; while we head on towards God knows where. Living behind the Gulshan First Market, our power is shed regularly without fail for the last fortnight promptly at 6:00p.m., and comes back when they wish. We break our fast and offer namaz in total darkness! This Iftar time blackout for us is religiously sustained by DESA. For the rest of the day, power availability is at the mercy of the power distribution centre. Continuous power, an essential service, has now become a scarce rationed item that brings back childhood memories of rationing in wartime Calcutta in the early 1940s! Even then, however, except during air raids, power was always there!//////Very recently I read an article on '' updated health policy ''by Farhad Mazhar. We are surprised by the fact that the task force has been sent to DG Health office and at the same time health policy has been updated in favour of multinational companies. Very confusing steps. There was no discussion with conscious citizens. I watch all the channels of TV including BTV. Why this confidentiality? We are also not against privatisation in a controlled way. But preserving the rights of mass people is very important. //////The crackdown on Hizbut Tahrir has apparently proved the fact that many militant outfits are still active in Bangladesh, which can be a potential threat to our sovereignty in the future if they are not nipped in the bud at the earliest possible time. Regrettably, three of the men arrested were 'respectable university teachers', who are supposed to be our ideal role models. We should carefully underscore the fact that these people have the scope and ability to influence the youth and they are capable of persuading them to adopt their destructive principles. It's also perplexing to wonder how such an extremist group was allowed to exist in our progressive political milieu, even after so many fatal terrorist attacks that virtually shook the foundation of our national security. Similarly, I don't understand why in a democratic nation this fundamentalist group should be allowed to hold a press conference and permitted to announce an audacious ultimatum that demanded the release of their detained associates within the next 48 hours, who were actually convicted of drawing the foundational blueprints of multidimensional terrorist activities. Don't we have any standard codes of law and order in this country? It really doesn't matter what enlightened principles these 'overexcited' people are adhering to. The 'means' they have chosen to achieve their objectives should be viewed as absolutely unacceptable in this liberal era of democratisation. //////Too often we hear complaints of insufficient laws and rules which contribute to the chaos and nightmare on the roads of Bangladesh in general and Dhaka in particular. I would rather contend that whatever rules we have are not enforced, resulting in the arrogant attitude of drivers and owners. I have driven in the US for over 14 years and 9 years on the streets of Bangladesh. I have been ticketed in the US for changing lanes too abruptly and for driving above the speed limit. However, the streets of Dhaka are more like jungles of Africa, where hordes of animals roam the plain freely, than the streets of a modern city, where traffic laws would rule the roads and courtesy should rule the hearts of the drivers. Being ticketed for changing lanes without signal is a joke. Instead of writing a long article on what is wrong and how to fix it, which would probably end up being a 10-chapter book, I list five violations for the police to look at...let's start somewhere...//////Although the rainy season is a blessing for us but it is not so all the time, particularly when floods occur. At present, many places and roads have gone under water due to floods. Many people have already lost their homes, cattle and crops. //////How can we relate sociology , politics, religion and economics to each other? I am a bit puzzled. //////To favour a student illegally is one kind of corruption. Every student should be judged on his or her performance, what he or she achieved in the exams or any other evaluating task. Of course judgment should not go over the essentials. //////Today parents are spending more time and money for their children's education.

With ////// around the corner, the Dhaka malls, such as Rapa, Anam, Orchid and Muscat Plaza, are out with their ware of trinkets and jewellery that will easily delight the feminine eye. These contain bangles of all shapes and sizes, wrought in gold metal and decked with imitation pearls, rubies, amethysts and emeralds. They are made to match with clothes and are within the budget. They look real and are designed with bells and flowers. Coloured glass bangles are there too and often they are imported. These too come in a wide range of scintillating shades. The necklaces and earrings, even the ones at Hallmark and Archie's, are irresistibly delightful. //////The handloom industry in the Rangamati Hill District is a welcome employment opportunity for unemployed young females and underprivileged women, particularly the indigenous womenfolk. //////Lata Mangeshkar, the greatest Indian songstress of all time, turns 80 today (September 28).

The play is based on a story by Askar Ibne Shaikh. The script is by Mujtaba Soud. Sadek Siddiqui has directed the play. //////WE celebrate Lailat ul-Qadr on the auspicious night of 27th Ramadhan. But nobody knows definitely when the Great Revelation came down to the benighted world through the agency of the angelic host, representing the Mercy of Allah. The Night has been variously fixed as the 3rd, 12th, 21st, 25th, 27th or the 29th of Ramadhan. It is probably one of the last three. Ibn Hambal reported that Ibn Omar had narrated a Hadith in which the Holy Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: "Whoever seeks the Night, let him seek it on the 27th."//////ON my way back home from work I am always stuck up in snarling traffic. The vendors try to make a living out of it. During the dying hours of Ramadan they sell mineral water. These nimble-footed briskly moving vendors generally sell popcorn. They also sell lemons, roses, fried peanuts in little packets, picture books, maps, and even dolls. I am deeply attracted by the urgency with which they sell their items. Sometimes I wonder how much they make out of it! I like their zest for living against great odds. I wish Bangladesh could catch this commercial spirit. //////COME September, and Hindus all over the world get enthused in festive fervour.
