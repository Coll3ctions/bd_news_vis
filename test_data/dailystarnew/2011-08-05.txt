The resolution, supported by fourteen members, the only exception being Lebanon, has condemned the Bashar al Assad regime's use of force against Syrian citizens and the violation of human rights in these past three months of an uprising which as yet shows no sign of abating. In all these months, President Assad has made promises of reforms more than once and just as quickly reneged on them. //////Zimbabwe's first day on their return to Test cricket went according to script as Bangladesh bowlers fell flat and inspired little. The home side dominated proceedings at the Harare Sports Club, ending the Day One of the one-off Test on 264 for two, a total that could have been higher if not for two strokes of luck for the

Also the functioning of two big agencies, namely, Rajuk and DCC, are not being seriously reviewed, for increased efficiency in day to day functions. Allocation/approvals/sanctions and O&M (operation and maintenance) should be separated, and handled by independent agencies. //////The recent incident of sexual assault on a Class X student of Viqarunnisa Noon School and College by one of her teachers has undoubtedly cast a slur on the teacher community. We find no words to express our indignation for such heinous act that took place in one of the most sought-after educational institutions in the country. The culprit, Porimol Joydhor, is now behind bars after his confessional statement before the metropolitan magistrate. The whole nation wants to see an exemplary punishment meted out to him who no longer deserves to belong to the teacher community. //////On an average, 15 -17 people are being killed in road crashes across the country every day. I don't know what the causes are and who is to be blamed for this, as no one has taken the responsibility for these road crashes and the deaths. None has been prosecuted or even charged with a murder. It's up to the government and administration to solve this problem. //////The news of schoolboys' trip of death, which took place at Mirsarai upazila in Chittagong, shocked us very much. A truck packed with students flipped over into a ditch, killing at least 43 students.

And the cunning drivers and helpers escape regularly. //////BTV news had a long hegemonic influence in our electronic media journalism ever since its inception. But its heydays marked a state of decline when our country embarked on her much-awaited journey to democracy. With the proliferation of numerous private TV channels and FM radio stations, BTV was put to its road to redemption. But sadly, time and again this channel, leaving aside the public expectation, has anointed its news programmes with party politics to pander to the whim of the ruling party. We know that government has made it mandatory for all private channels to broadcast BTV news which is ridiculous. When most people are disgusted to watch BTV news, they are compelled to swallow the BTV news broadcast by almost all private channels. I request all private channels to take a vigorous stand to stave off this practice. //////The conscious people of the country have hailed the government decision to increase the supplementary duty and price level of cigarettes as proposed in the new budget announced recently. This will definitely help to drop consumption of cigarettes which takes a heavy toll of lives in our country as well as in other parts of the world every year. The dreadful consequences of smoking have obviously prompted the strengthening of the anti smoking campaign and drive around the globe. In our country various anti-smoking motivational programmes are being undertaken by different socio-cultural organisations. The government is also playing its part. To discourage smoking, particularly in public places, the government has, in the recent past, enacted 'Tobacco Control Act' keeping provision for penalty for public smoking. However, the government must be reasonably strict in enforcing the law if it wants to prove its sincerity in controlling the use of cigarettes and a few other similar products.//////My wife and I applied for tourist visas to Iran. We had our applications denied in just 5 days. Why? Don't they want tourists from Bangladesh to go to Iran. Perhaps it is because the present government has a secular policy - but not everyone shares the government's views. We are a Muslim country so Iran should welcome exchanges between brothers and sisters. How can Muslim countries know each other's cultures if we are not allowed to travel freely to these countries? I know of an American and a Ukrainian who had no trouble getting a visa it seems Americans are more welcome in Iran than tourists from Muslim countries. //////There are signboards in which it is written 'Police are your friends. Take help from the Police'. But now-a-days many incidents are happening which do not reflect the above saying, not only do police not help; sometimes they try to portray people as criminals. The incident at Aminbazar is a glaring example where police looked on while six students were beaten to death. They rescued the seventh, a student named Al Amin, after he agreed to say whatever the police wanted him to say. From the July 28 issue of the newspapers we learnt that instead of withdrawing two false cases against Abdul Kadar, a master's student of Biochemistry at Dhaka University, police is trying to frame him in a carjacking case. We are baffled, what has happened to the police that they are out to get the innocent people? They should perform their duties sincerely so that people could regain confidence in them.//////She was sitting on the footpath in Karwanbazar. I asked her name, "Shirin Akter," she answered. She was not more than eight years old. I enquired about her parents and she said her father had left them and married another woman. Her mother sells vegetables at Karwanbazar. Shirin is third among her five siblings. She lives in a slum in Begunbari and works in a garment factory. Whatever insignificant wage she gets, she gives it to her mother. //////Govt eyes Arial Beel, 3 other sites //////Palestinians are determined to go ahead with their UN membership bid as an Arab League follow-up committee endorsed a final draft of the request to be presented to the UN General Assembly, a top official said.//////Three men in charge of nuclear power safety and policy have been sacked amid the ongoing crisis at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.//////The Indian government yesterday introduced a new anti-corruption bill in parliament, which activists have panned for exempting the prime minister from the scrutiny of a powerful new ombudsman.//////China has arrested 2,000 people and shut down nearly 5,000 businesses in a clampdown on illegal food additives, after a series of food safety scares.//////US President Barack Obama turned 50 yesterday, marking the milestone at a moment of political peril after a damaging debt showdown with Republicans and as he plots his 2012 reelection bid.//////President of India's ruling Congress party Sonia Gandhi yesterday underwent surgery in a hospital in the United States for an unspecified illness which will keep her out of India for a month.//////As part of Celebrating Life 2011-- a joint initiative of The Daily Star and Standard Chartered Bank, a three-month-long filmmaking workshop has begun yesterday.

Then most people talk amongst themselves about what some people have told them. The gyres of discourses get wider and wider until divergent views converge upon concurrence. Frankly speaking, an opinion is formed pretty much like we sharpen pencils. It is sharpened to a point.//////Six months ago, after weeks of protests, the Tunisian people gathered in front of the Interior Ministry to demand that their longtime president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, leave the country. He fled for Saudi Arabia on Jan. 14. //////This is to take issue with certain parts of the article titled "India and Bangladesh: Embraceable you" that has appeared in the Asia section of The Economist's July 30th 2011 edition. Given the image-offending, unsubstantiated, presumptive and misleading nature of some of its content, our government could have slapped a lid on circulation of the latest issue. But since this government hasn't done it, the principle of free flow of information stands upheld. Or, may be the government just chose to ignore what appeared to be absurd and eerie imputations to them. //////Constitutions took modern shape after long historical voyage. Perhaps the first code of justice was formulated 44,000 years ago by the Sumerian king Urukagina of Lagash (territory in Iraq). The oldest written law is the Code of Ur-Nammu of Ur (2050 BC). Some other important ancient law codes include the code of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin and the code of Hammurabi of Babylonia. //////The recent escalation of prices of essential commodities has created an uneasy situation for the public because of the start of Ramadan within a few days.
