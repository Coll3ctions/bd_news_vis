an appeal by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for it to declare a unilateral ceasefire in Gaza is the latest sad twist to an increasingly agonizing story.

In the last one week, Israeli soldiers have attacked local neighbourhoods in Gaza while Tel Aviv's airpower has relentlessly pounded away at residential buildings in the name of flushing out Hamas militants. Not even the UN compound there has been spared, an act of wanton aggression that has forced US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to raise the issue with the Israeli leadership. Now Amnesty International has weighed in with a call for an investigation into the incident and has even hinted at the attack being regarded as a war crime.//////ARRIVAL of US-UK team to Dhaka to identify the persons involved in laundering of $200 million to Singapore and to help Bangladesh recover the money is a significant development towards retrieving of our stolen wealth siphoned off abroad. //////IN simplistic terms, communism failed as an economic system because it could not sustain itself in meeting the demands of the people, as the supply of the commodities was determined more through bureaucratic fiat than through an analysis of the real demand for the goods and services. //////ONE of the most instructive stories I have read about democracy comes from 1865.

Probably it has become their routine work. //////The retaining of power for two consecutive years by the caretaker government and the delaying of the national elections have been an exceptionally intriguing situation that has confronted us lately. The caretaker government started off their proceedings by entering into the political arena quite ambitiously but consequently failed to live up to their desired expectations. The more they dug, the more dirt spilled out of the heart of this country. All kinds of obnoxious and filthy corruption were viciously interrelated and no doubt they were unable to cope with all these diverse predicaments and directly hit the core with the extremely restricted time limit they had. Of course in a country rules are made to protect it and for its betterment, but when those same rules and regulations act as a stumbling block for development and change, then they have to be deliberately overlooked. After the tragedy of 1/11, the whole country plunged into deep worries. The political parties all went after each other's throat and made life miserable for the people. Under such immense pressure the caretaker government, which comprised caretakers of the highest esteem with unmatched capabilities which was accompanied by their rather outstanding and remarkable professional careers, succeeded in pushing this country out of the political unrest. But at the end of the day we all would be displeased to unwillingly agree with the fact that they really should have done more. //////It is heart breaking to see repetition of the same oration by the leader of the losing party, irrespective of whoever the person is. Being one of the members of the post liberation war generation, I earnestly urge all party leaders in current and future Bangladesh to create the legacy of gracefully accepting the election verdict and work in a united fashion for taking our beloved motherland on the path of peaceful political co-existence and achievable developments, the main themes of a multi-party democratic political process. Simultaneously, I also urge the winning party leader to establish a new political culture by meeting the losing party leader to extend her earnest and cordial invitation to work together for the first time in the history of Bangladesh, as we have seen in recent times in the US election that resonated the same theme of "Change". I may be one of the first few to ask for initiating this healthy culture of political humility, but am confident that I am not a loner in my thoughts and urges! We have had enough of the ailing political culture of accepting an election verdict when it goes in favour, while rejecting it if it goes against. We now need to move forward and require to see our politicians working in unison on critical national and economic issues in order to achieve meaningful development.//////In 2001, the people of this country voted the AL out of power mainly due to the unprecedented terrorism resorted to by their party cadres, especially the BCL, Jubo League etc. Instead of asking for a halt to those activities, at that time the AL chief even called the BCL cadres as her  golden boys-- much to the annoyance and displeasure of the general public. Life in educational institutions, villages and cities became unbearable due to their nefarious activities. //////It is indeed a commendable act by the newly appointed PM to appoint Dipu Moni as the country's first woman foreign minister. It is hoped that this will translate into a more level headed and sober approach to all affairs foreign and their offshoots pertaining to domestic issues too. Her initial comments about dealing with militancy and terrorism are of some concern here and it requires some reflection. Your paper quoted her saying://////That language is the dress of thought is more or less known to all of us and every nation in the world has its own mother tongue which is very sweet and dear to the nationals. English is recognised globally as an international language which is in a commanding position among other languages prevalent in different countries of the world. Ever since the period of colonisation by the English of different parts of the world, the use and dissemination of the learning of English language have been widely made with a view to making the position of English firm and consolidated. Even though the mother tongue of a nation is much sweeter than any other language, English as an international language that holds a unique position and it goes without saying that learning of English is of paramount importance.//////I am writing with reference to a LETTER FROM EUROPE headed In sorrow, not in anger written by Mr. Chaklader Mahboob-ul Alam, a columnist of The Daily Star, that appeared in your issue of January 5, 2009. In his letter, Mr. Alam provided details of his agonizing experience while performing Hajj. It is indeed regrettable that his joy and spiritual exhilaration was tainted due to the fact that he had to part with his passport as this was taken away by the Immigration Authority of KSA without any receipt. He went to a great length in his frantic efforts for recovery of the passport. He further stated that he was asked to pay an amount of approximately two hundred euros to some authority in Medina and was advised to go the next day to collect his passport. Sadly, even after this payment the passport was not delivered as promised!//////The Awami League has earned my appreciation for checking the prices of the essentials so quickly. But I wonder why the economists failed to understand during the past caretaker government the Awami League's secret in checking the price hike. //////Are the stalwarts playing the role of the think tank? Will they monitor and the government's decisions if they are going to make any wrong step from behind the curtain? That means, there will be a double layer government system. The young generation will lead the country from the front and the experienced stalwarts will play their role from behind the curtain to build up our beloved Bangladesh. If this is the cause of leaving aside the stalwarts from the cabinet, the AL is really going to bring a change and finally they have to realize there is nothing to mind. Every one from top to bottom, whether in the government as cabinet members or not will have to work for the sake of building Bangladesh, that is, the cherished dream of the freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for the cause of our independence. //////This refers to the editorial of Jan. 10, with the above title.//////Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has expelled the Israeli Ambassador from his country.

In the course of the past few years, the independent media has increasingly come under attack. Electronic and print-media institutions have been burnt, bombed, sealed, and coerced. Countless journalists have been harassed, threatened, and killed. It has been my honour to belong to all those categories, and now especially the last.//////In the Western world, whenever a new government takes over, their economic and political teams generally work hard in lowering people's expectations about what can be delivered by the government in the near term.
