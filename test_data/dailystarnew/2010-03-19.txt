We have been informed that there will be a wait of at least till the end of April before the MRP project gets underway. That is certainly not cheering news, seeing that it threatens to put a very large number of Bangladeshis in a spot where applying for and getting passports is concerned. Effective next month, the passport and immigration department will not accept applications for any new handwritten passports. That is understandable. But what does place people in a difficult situation is that even if they begin applying for MRPs from April 1, there is little guarantee that they will be getting these passports in a reasonable frame of time. We note here, of course, the assurance by the authorities that they expect to begin the process of producing MRPs by the end of April.//////On the eve of the second Test match between Bangladesh and England, the pitch came under spotlight as question has been raised about the unsuitable surface for the five-day game in Chittagong.

He deserves thanks for speaking out some disturbing facts regarding the draconian administration of Biman & Civil Aviation since inception.//////It was audacious of BNP lawmaker Shammi Akhter to have called the Father of the Nation 'Feraun' in the sacred House of the Nation which gave way to protest from the treasury bench and exchange of filthy words between the government and the opposition MPs that caused a huge pandemonium leading to the opposition's walkout. The nation is thunderstruck that a parliament member could hurl such an irresponsible remark on the man without whom this nation would have not been born and she could not be a lawmaker in a sovereign nation-state. Did she make the remark to please her Madam who preferred the date of Bangabandhu's assassination, a national Mourning Day, to make her date of birth and she, without least scruple, observes the date with pomp and grandeur? //////We have come to learn that the AL led grand alliance government is going to promulgate new laws to discipline the private universities in our country. More than fifty private universities have mushroomed in our country after the enactment of Private University Act, 1992. Most of these universities do not comply with the rules set by the University Grants Commission. It is really tormenting that UGC is in deep slumber and actually it is tacitly buttressing the monkey business of these private universities. Most of the private universities are run commercially. But it is true that a few universities are definitely providing quality education and they merit eulogy for their pedagogical innovation and sophistication. It is pleasant to know that the present government will scupper all the nasty business in the name of education. Higher education cannot be a fundamental right, it is certainly a privilege. To be a teller in a bank and to work in a restaurant abroad, a person does not need a university degree like BBA or MBA. But only those who have adequate intelligence and academic knowledge should be given chance to study in a university, whether it is private or public. //////If the BNP government had committed the mistake of renaming Dhaka Airport, Jamuna Bridge, Barisal University, Chittagong Airport and Rajshahi Airport etc., this does not mean and justify that the Awami League government would also commit such mistakes.//////The only possible way to stop 'parliament violence', as it may be termed, is by passing a law against the unnecessary discussion on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and late president Ziaur Rahman in parliament. We have so many problems that crumble our every day life that we can spend hours over a cup of tea discussing them. So when our 'honourable' members take part in parliament proceedings, if they spend five minutes over all these problems, such as, over population, road accident, corruption, student politics and so one, I bet they will momentarily forget about who was 'Feraun' and who was the 'killer'. //////As reported in 'The Chronicle of Higher Education', USA, the college/university presidents are becoming easy targets for cyber squatting and hoaxes. Recently, a fake resignation letter was released on a fake webpage resembling to that of Mark G.Yudof, President of the university of California, which read -I hereby resign my tenure as President. The fake letter then praised student protests and added -I have decided to go back to school to study the history of social movements. Mr. Yudof immediately clarifying his position said that his resignation was a complete nonsense.//////One of the most fundamental aspects of human life is security. Without any doubt, it can be said that Dhaka city is one of the most insecure cities of the world. Every now and then the inhabitants of this city are being attacked by the muggers.

I think the writer has not studied the Alia Madrasa syllabus carefully. Please collect and read the syllabus and compare it with school and college syllabus. You criticised Madrasa education and appreciated the new education policy from your own stand point.

Some of us are aware of the fact that the syllabus of GCE O level and A level changed recently. The syllabus that the Edexcel authorities had been running since 2000 gave way to a new syllabus for both O level and A level, with considerable changes in the format as well. I would like to put forward an appeal on behalf of the candidates who appeared in the A level examination in the Legacy syllabus (old syllabus) in the January session 2010, this was the last examination that was to be held under the Legacy syllabus. Many of us failed to achieve desired grades and we wish to give improvements on them to get better results. The option we now have is to sit for the subjects under the new syllabus, and in my case I want to sit only for A2 level (the second part of the complete A level) but I cannot do so as the Legacy syllabus has been discontinued from the January 2010 session. And if I want to reappear in the examination to get a better result, I will have to cover the whole new syllabus within a short time and sit for all the six units to get a complete certificate. Which is a burden to me, and students like me.//////I'm very concerned. I live at the end of Gulshan Avenue, very near to a beautiful, neat little park near to a lake in Gulshan-2.

But have you ever noticed that the severity of the itch is inversely proportionate to the difficulty of the reach? In lay terms it means your hand almost never finds the spot where it should happen to scratch the most. That in a way is also true for the intellectual quest of this nation. It has more thinkers than it has thoughts, but their thinking hardly touches the real spots. The reason is straight and simple. Intellectual curiosity doesn't drive that train. It's driven by foregone conclusions.//////The telecom regulator is set to slash mobile short message service (SMS) charges by at least 50 percent, a move that is expected to encourage users to air more texts.//////Nokia has started selling of its highly anticipated entertainment package, Nokias X6 from March 15.
