Which of the two prevails at a particular time gives it bad or good name. The passing year, 2011, is no different except that the shadows have lengthened. Corruption darkened the atmosphere throughout the year and what it exposed was that the system was reeking with graft. Non-governance tormented the nation further.//////So goes the Indian prophecy://////The death of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, and the ascendance to power of one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, creates some opportunities and potential traps for the administration and senior leaders in the United States things they should be sure to say and be sure not to say.//////When the military government in 1971 committed atrocities against the people of East Pakistan, it undermined the legitimacy of the very state it purported to defend. In West Pakistan the state's propaganda machine was deployed in the familiar whipping up of public opinion into a frenzy that was fuelled by a combination of misguided notions of religious "purity" and ethnic prejudice. The Bengalis, who at the time constituted the majority of Pakistanis, were demonised as a seditious ethnic group soiled by Hindu influence. The consequent failure of the people of West Pakistan to rise up in mass protest ruptured the fabric of humanity that gives cohesion to society and ennobles national consciousness.//////Adaptation to the impacts of climate change was regarded as an afterthought initially by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. But by the late 1990s many of the G77 group, particularly the 43-member Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the 49-member LDC group pressed for more focus on adaptation. However, the Annex-1 countries (A1Cs) initially resisted this attempt, perhaps apprehending that a focus on adaptation would be an acknowledgment of responsibility and liability, since they were mainly responsible for global warming. //////Fresh water scarcity is an increasing problem in the coastal zone of Bangladesh as it is turning into brackish and saline water gradually. Climate change exacerbates the problem through sea level rise, poor rainfall in winter, high rate of evaporation and cyclone and storm surge. Some human induced interventions like barrage in the upstream rivers to diversify the flow, faulty management of coastal polders and commercial shrimp culture and salt production have increased the salinity level of surface water many-folds. //////One estimate shows that some 5.2 million people (including 4 million children) die each year from waste-related diseases all over the world. Thousands of tons of waste are generated everyday in our country. These include household waste, industrial waste and medical waste among many others. Household waste can be handled easily as this is less dangerous to public health and easily recyclable. But things are different for Medical Waste (MW). Medical waste is defined as any solid or liquid waste that is generated in the diagnosis, treatment or immunisation of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals. //////National Professor Kabir Chowdhury died a Keatsian death in his sleep on the morning of December 14, 2011. He was eighty eight. He wrote even on the last day of his life. Like Tennyson's Ulysses, he drank life to the lees. 'I was ever a fighter', he wrote in a magazine edited by yours truly in 2005. He dreamt of one fight more, the best and the last. He was eighty two then. And what an elegant, gentlemanly and refined fighter he was! He was the nation's finest and ever reliable friend, philosopher and guide. //////After hearing the words I do not know how long I sat still. Suddenly a bitter taste rose up in my throat. I rushed to the washroom. I washed my hands and face and feeling a little better I came back to the room somewhat later. I could not see the traces of anyone in the living room. Did the gentleman go to the washroom? No, that was not so. I came out of the room and went towards the main door and saw that the hat was not on the hat-rack and the overcoat was missing. He was surely gone. I saw that the time was a quarter to one at night. The snow was still drifting down outside.//////Chikungunya is a viral fever spread by mosquitoes.

Researchers found that chickenpox less common in regions with high UV levels and opined that sunlight may inactivate viruses on the skin, making it harder to pass on, reports the journal Virology.//////Iraq war has ended' or 'US occupation of Iraq has come to an end' contradicts with history. History confirms that foreign occupation is nothing new to Iraq. Whenever the great players in the international system opted for change in the order of the game in the Middle East, they started with Iraq. The great siege of Baghdad by Mongols in 1258AD with their mission to impose imperial control over the Middle East was not different from the ones Americans did in 1991 and 2003. Only the context and pretext had changed, the motive remained the same. The people of Iraq over the ages have built a psychic shield: they have been used to this reality. Mongols massacred 100,000 to 1,000,000 inhabitants; Americans scored not less: they killed more than 100,000. //////As American forces pulled out of Iraq, we asked Iraqis around the country three questions: //////This year is going to end with some remarkable changes across the Middle East and Africa. The 'Arab Spring' has been blowing throughout the year. Now, the US is withdrawing its army from Iraq. This decision has attracted mixed reactions from experts. Some praised the decision while others reproached. In the declaration ceremony Obama said that Iraq had become democratic and had an independent judicial system. This statement has surprised many Iraqis including me as a Bangladeshi. I wish the Iraqis had all these!//////* 3,187 Days the US has been in Iraq.//////With quite a bit of deliberation I went on weighing the efficacy or otherwise of buying the hefty collection of writings by Christopher Hitchens I held in my hand last week. The place was Crossword, the large bookstore on Calcutta's Elgin Road, the time of day being the morning. A particular reason for my interest in Hitchens had been the style in which he wrote --- blunt, to the point, unabashed. Once on the left of political belief, he had made a complete swing to the right, to a point where he turned out to be a supporter of the Bush-Blair invasion of Iraq in 2003. That should have put me off Hitchens and it did to some extent. But then, there is always the fact that you must know of what others, who do not think as you do, happen to be nurturing in their minds. It is never a good idea to ignore your enemies or adversaries. Not that Hitchens was either of those for me. I never knew him personally. But, yes, I have always appreciated the quickness of his mind, that sure grasp of ideas he put down in his writings. And, by the way, a few years ago, on one of my regular trips to Waterstone's at London's Piccadilly, it was Hitchens' ////// which took my fancy. For obvious reasons. The slim volume contained distinctive chapters on what Hitchens thought had been Kissinger's role in the murderous coups which felled Chile's Salvador Allende (in 1973) and Bangladesh's Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (in 1975). It promised to make interesting reading. And for all one knew, Hitchens was one man Henry Kissinger was mortally afraid of. I bought the book. It has pride of place on my book shelf today.//////Thanks to continued development programmes funded by international NGOs and organisations in our country, there has been an upsurge in research on social development. Research works have focused on various sectors that are integral to projected development goals, such as education, employment and infrastructure. Many of those have taken extensively on predominant ideological stigmas standing in the way of development. Very few, however, have dealt with the fundamental inter-relation between energy resources and sustainable development. Seen from this perspective, Ershad Ali's ////// appears to be a remarkable difference that attempts to bridge the gap between the energy sector and development. It also relates non-renewable energy such as fossil fuel to global warming and suggests thereby a set of renewable as well as sustainable energy technologies that as well as meeting the burgeoning demands are environment-friendly.//////
