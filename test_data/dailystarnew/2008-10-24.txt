In fact, it's being propelled to a heightening state with each passing day -- thanks to a totally confused handling of the issue and an evasive approach taken to it. Basically, one gets the impression of deliberate waffling in taking a clear-cut decision about the public health hazard, with import and business considerations getting the better of public health concern, especially that of our children.//////We take this opportunity to congratulate the people and government of India on the launch of the Chandrayaan 1 mission to the moon. One hardly needs any telling that, for a developing country like India and indeed for the region, the venture is cause for justifiable pride. That sense of pride as well as belonging is enhanced by the fact that India is an important component of SAARC. As a fellow member of the South Asian regional organisation, we feel that the stride Delhi has taken in space will have a positive impact on scientific development for Indians in particular and for their neighbours and for developing countries in general. The launch of the lunar mission is, briefly, one very powerful sign of the advances in technology that India has been making in recent years. It is at the same time a broad hint that where the exploration of space is concerned, the Indians have finally come of age.//////One of the occupational hazards of being an assistant editor is that you don't get out from behind your desk to go out into the field nearly as much as you should.

It seemed the Chittagong pitch simply fitted him like a glove. Shakib is a talented player and our so called cricket board should nurture talents like him.

My expectation is that the reformed ACC shall perform most efficiently to prevent political corruption by adopting very stringent rules and regulations, rather than running after the politicians and hooking them under the law. Because of politicisation of the whole process, from inquiry to the door of the judiciary, the ACC has to concede defeat in their approach. //////We feel proud of being students of the country's first science & technology university - Shahjalal University of Science & Technology.

Mrs. Matia Chowdhury said in that interview (October 16) that she wants a free, fair and credible election in an environment free from fear, apprehension and criminal activities. I totally agree with Begum Matia Chowdhury and that is precisely why the next general election MUST be held under the supervision of the caretaker administration, with a relaxed state of emergency. All previous records show that during AL/BNP rules elections were rigged, voters were intimidated and even denied entry. People didn't feel safe to go to polling stations during the AL/BNP rules. //////My focus in this letter is not on the occasional news headlines on torture of household assistants.

It was even shocking for me as I knew she was one of those who even worked for the humanitarian missions and often identified for her philanthropic contributions to society. Surely, I was prompted by this incident to write but I understand the level of mass torture going on throughout the socio demographical classes of urban life. //////The statues of several "bauls" or traditional Bengali singers were demolished from their building place, in front of the main entrance to Zia International Airport.

You can quite easily multiply this by ten for such institutions in the USA, continental Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore etc. So 170 billion pounds were siphoned off by the fat cats over just one year by a conservative estimate. If this had gone on for the last ten years, 1.7 trillion pounds have been creamed off which is about the same amount now required to be paid off by the ordinary taxpayer of each country to stave off a complete meltdown of the western style capitalist system.//////I really appreciate and welcome Channel-i's initiative to cover the traditional boat race of Gopalganj. This boat race is a heritage of that area but unfortunately we, the youngsters of today's Bangladesh, do not know about all these traditions as there is a lack of interest and focus in our culture and heritage. This responsibility goes to our television channels also as there is a common trend of blending western flavour or Indian style in various programmes. //////Talk shows on diverse issues hosted by Mr. Hamid Mir and Mr. Kamran Khan on GEO TV in the recent times - I mean, up to and including yesterday, 14th day of October 2008 - are, in an average sense and as appropriate - found to be well focused on Pakistan's competing priorities; competitive in terms of time, space, and outcome related potentials; civil at inter-human levels; well researched; well presented; and antidote seekers when it comes to fighting diseases of in-country and ex-country origins at political, non-political and other levels. Well done!//////Thanks to Mr S. Mahmood, a senior journalist, for his very appropriate analysis regarding the role of foreign envoys in dealing with the internal affairs of Bangladesh, especially the crucial general election.//////Women are frequently objectified in the media. Media often objectifies women, portrays women as physical objects that can be looked at-- and fail to portray women as subjective beings with thoughts, histories, and emotions. In reality, human beings are both objects as subjects, as they are physical collections of molecules as well as individuals. To objectify someone, then, is to reduce someone exclusively to the level of object. //////Chief Adviser Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed expressed his concern in a meeting held in September about the low rate of literacy.

I would like to mention here that New Delhi is almost connected from one end to the other by metro rail (Surface as well as underground). The total system is well maintained and people are commuting as per their needs. //////Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is a small and unplanned city crammed with a prodigious number of people. The excessive number of people requires an excessive number of transports. The traffic congestion resulting from excessive number of vehicles; especially private cars , illegal parking, occupation of roads and pavements by hawkers, unwillingness of reckless drivers to abide by traffic rules and so on has been a nagging and intractable problem in everyday life of city dwellers. The sufferings and miseries of the commuters, passengers and travellers resulting from suffocating traffic stalemates have gone beyond tolerable limits. Besides, traffic congestion is causing immense loss of valuable working hours of the people. So, the government should immediately come forward with pragmatic and substantive solutions to address the nagging problem. The government should ask the authorities concerned to be strict and unflagging enough to make the people and vehicle-drivers abide by the traffic rules, to stop illegal parking, to stop picking up passengers here and there, to stop unfit vehicles from plying, to resist trucks from entering into the city before 9:00pm, to restrict and, if needed, ban the movement of rickshaws on the roads where buses are available to smoothen the traffic movements. Exemplary punishment along with substantial fines should be meted out to those who flout and recklessly break traffic rules. The government should impose a significant amount of tax on private car imports and on road permits. The number of double-decker buses that can accommodate many passengers at a time and local buses should be increased to reduce the magnitude of the problem. The people should be encouraged to walk small distance instead of riding rickshaws on the way where buses regularly ply. More consciousness about traffic rules should be raised among the people. The government should also ask the school authorities to make arrangements and to run school-vans and school-buses for the safe transportation of the school-children and to assure the guardians of their safe transportation and to stop them from waiting on the roads for their children with cars causing serious tailback. //////Indian and Pakistan officials will hold counter-terrorism talks here today, the Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday, to build trust and allay security concerns between the two rivals.//////Pakistan must attack insurgents in its northern areas and tackle extremists threatening its stability and complicating international efforts in Afghanistan, a senior US diplomat said yesterday.//////Government forces captured several bunkers from Tamil Tiger rebels as heavy fighting raged despite torrential monsoon rains in northern Sri Lanka, the defence ministry said yesterday.//////Stressing that military means alone cannot bring peace in war ravaged Afghanistan, Nato has said it was not opposed to talks between the government and Taliban leaders willing to lay down their arms, reports EuAsiaNews.//////Minority Asians may be the biggest group of undecided voters in the upcoming US presidential and congressional elections and will play a key role in the outcome of the ballot, officials say.//////US presidential hopeful Barack Obama played up his foreign policy credentials while John McCain highlighted national security, as a poll yesterday showed the Democrat hanging onto his lead in three key states.//////The embarrassing price tag of her campaign wardrobe and her blooper about the job description of US vice president confirm what recent polls say: Sarah Palin is a burden to the Republican presidential ticket.//////A suicide car bomber targeted an Iraqi minister during rush hour Thursday morning in Baghdad, killing at least 13 people and wounding more than 20, officials said.//////The UN food agency has warned that millions of North Koreans could face starvation, but a South Korean official said Thursday that Seoul has not decided whether to respond to a request for food aid to the communist country.//////The next US president, be it Barack Obama or John McCain, should get to work immediately to jump-start Middle East peace talks, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said here yesterday.//////The European Union honoured jailed Chinese dissident Hu Jia with its top human rights prize on Thursday in defiance of Beijing's warning that selecting him would seriously harm its relations with the 27-nation bloc.//////Tensions boiled up around Georgia's breakaway regions Thursday, as Tbilisi said Russia was massing troops in South Ossetia and rebels in Abkhazia accused Georgia of killing a senior army officer.//////A huge explosion at an illegal fireworks factory in western India on Thursday killed 27 people, including 12 children, police said.//////A species of cockatoo feared to have become extinct has been "rediscovered" with the sighting of a handful of breeding pairs on a remote Indonesian island, researchers said yesterday.//////Describing India and Japan as "major powers" and "two major pillars of new Asia," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday said the two strategic partners are ready to play a "commensurate global role" in world affairs.//////A video installation titled "The Peak of Burning" by Budoor Al Riyami (Oman) is one of the very few artworks employing modern technologies on display at the 13th Asian Art Biennale '08.
