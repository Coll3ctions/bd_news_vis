Individual morality, family values, social norms, economic machinery, political discipline, and statutory institutions all have perversely adjusted with the reality of corruption. General people fear to find any corruption free public space and suspect that anticorruption regime could control corruption within a tolerable range.//////WITH such positive talks between India and Pakistan at Islamabad, the tragic happenings in Kashmir seem more than a coincidence. That the youth in the valley are angry because they are not getting their due is known to all. Their pelting of stones at the security forces has been going on for more than a year. Still, why should Kashmir be on the boil when relations between India and Pakistan are on the mend? //////THE formation of the National Rural Development Council (NRDC) headed by the prime minister, as reported in some newspapers, is the accomplishment of a long cherished expectation in the realm of rural development. //////AFRICA is often termed a "dark continent." But there are evidences that modern humans first evolved in this continent, which is rich in both forest and desert. Can there be anything to learn from the African nations regarding education? Although Bangladesh is an Asian country, I argue that she can learn much even from this "dark continent." //////DURING the last couple of decades a crop of new social movements presented a seemingly comprehensive framework for understanding the aboriginals -- their world-view, cognitive orientations, cultural patterns and age-long socio-economic institutions. //////GIVEN the physical and socio-economic parameters, Bangladesh can be regarded as a test case of sustainable development (SD). Our per capita cultivable land and forest are among the lowests in the world. About one-third of our population still lives below poverty line. On the other hand, a consistent economic growth of 5-6% a year during the last two decades and the potential for double-digit growth in near future had and will have gigantic impact on the limited natural resources, such as land, water, forest and fisheries. The challenge of increasing food supply is degrading the soil quality. An increasing number of industries is polluting our water in extreme ways, endangering the public health in the most serious manner. Climate change impacts are likely to pull us back. //////GLOBAL warming is an increase of average air temperature of the Earth's surface and oceans' temperature. The most important challenge for sustainable agriculture is climate uncertainty, more specifically global warming. According to Gallup Polls, over a third of the world's population is unaware of global warming, with people in developing countries less aware than those in developed countries. Anticipated changes in global climate leading to more frequent extreme conditions will need adaptations of agricultural crops in order to sustain agricultural production. //////WHAT are the reasons that increase the volume of damage in an earthquake? Is it possible to reduce this intensity of damages? Is it only the degree of magnitude (Richter scale) that determines the intensity of damages in an earthquake? These are queries from the people who have not usually have much idea about the seismology or plate tectonics. In fact most people when they hear any news regarding earthquake immediately look for reports on Richter scale magnitude of earthquake. But if we look at the recent earthquakes in Chile and Haiti, the Richter scale magnitude appears as not the major factor that contributed to the damages. Chile earthquake was far stronger (8.8 magnitude) than the Haiti earthquake (7.0 magnitude) yet the death toll and other damages in Haiti happened to be higher than Chile. What was the reason behind ?//////I consider myself extremely lucky having had the privilege of welcoming Ted Hughes, the late poet laureate of Britain, as a guest at our home in Uttara. It was the year 1989 and the season was mild winter. By sheer coincidence, I was asked by the poet's liaison officer to arrange a cultural evening-cum-dinner in Bangali style in the informal and relaxed atmosphere of a home, an experience that the poet himself wished for when he was on the last leg of his tour of Bangladesh. Although initially nervous, I was beside myself with joy at the thought of the plan taking a concrete shape at our home. Then again, I panicked momentarily, telling the surprised liaison officer that I didn't have furniture good enough to welcome the poet laureate with. The officer simply smiled and waved my worries aside. That same evening Ted Hughes flew back to Dhaka after a few days' stay at the Sundarbans, having had first hand experience of observing wildlife in their natural habitat, which was one of his passions throughout his life.//////Ever the intrepid adventurer, I never pass up a chance to go exploring whenever the opportunity arrives. So when my wife Eva's friend the inimitable Poly invited us to accompany her to her village home on the weekend I grabbed the opportunity with both hands. Alas! My niece and her mother were flying in from Washington DC that very morning at 0450 and my sister and I were to receive them. Due to these logistical constraints, Eva opted out of the trip and I was in a bit of a quandary myself, what with the World Cup matches going into the wee hours of the night. Ultimately, I decided I would make it. So I packed my overnighter and went off to bed by midnight. //////The first time I saw her she stood on one side of the dining room, ramrod straight, like a dancer, her eyes downcast, staring at the floor. She twirled the tassel of her dopatta with her fingers in a continuous nervous motion. Her flawless skin was a couple of shades darker than cafe au lait, setting off her exquisitely chiseled features like that of a bronze statuette. Her eyes, when she did look up occasionally, were as dark as the night; but a brilliant twinkle lit them up every time she flashed her dazzling smile. Her long, jet-black hair was combed back and neatly tied in a thick braid. She was tall, much taller than an average local girl, and slender. She spoke in a soft intimidated voice, almost inaudible.//////Rain, you say in that terse note, as//////The skies explode in cheerful fury.//////Brishti . . . that is the rainmaker in//////You marvelling at the searing, soaring//////Light piercing the clouds pregnant //////With possibilities.//////You are the summer wine I never dare to drink but secretly desire//////You are the rainbow colored butterfly flying in the wide open//////You are the Goosebumps I get watching Roman Holiday//////Three leading scientific and health policy organisations recently launched a global drive for signatories to the Vienna Declaration (www.viennadeclaration.com), a statement seeking to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies.//////Cervical cancer affects millions of women each year.

There are steps you can take to reduce the risk, or even prevent naturally.//////We all know that the best place to go when you become sick is the hospital. But it is also possible for people to become more ill while staying in hospital. Infections which patients catch while in the hospitals are called nosocomial infections, and they are a major public health risk. In the US alone, where medicine is highly advanced and infection-control practices are in place, an estimated 100,000 people die each year due to nosocomial infections.//////Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause, offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance.//////Do you remember those old days?

Unlike terrorism that emanates from South/South West Asia and piracy that originates from South East Asia, terropiracy is a probability linking South and South East Asia as a contiguous unit of operation. With the Durand Line as the epicenter of global terrorism, the Taliban on both sides of it see no barrier separating the South from South West Asia. For the pirates in and around the Straits of Malacca, the peninsular confluence between South and South East Asia is but a choke point to disrupt the supply chain of global trade. Over 90% of global trade is conducted by sea with Singapore as the world's busiest port and its largest container trans-shipment hub for a network of 250 shipping lines connecting it to 600 ports in 123 countries.//////SAARC Ministers for Interior/Home have called for a comprehensive regional strategy to fight against terrorism. The third meeting of the SAARC Ministers for Interior/Home held in Islamabad adopted the SAARC Islamabad Statement on Cooperation against Terrorism, which reaffirms the commitment to further strengthen cooperation to fight and eradicate terrorism in all forms and manifestations.//////THE just-concluded ministerial level meeting between the two perennially hostile south Asian neighbours India and Pakistan was the focus of many eyes for a variety of reasons. The meeting in Islamabad, was the first of its kind since the Mumbai attack in November, 2008 that sent their topsy-turvy bilateral ties to the lowest level in many years. When India's Home Minister met his Pakistani counterpart they faced an uphill task to take the spirit of the New Delhi-Islamabad ties to a scale often described by both sides as normal. Indo-Pakistan ties are generally characterized by enmity and belligerence, but this relationship also produces bilateral cooperation in many areas notwithstanding their differences owing to several disputes. //////THIS book reminds me of Kahlil Gibran's saying, ////// is a literary journal produced by the Department of English and Humanities, University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh. The journal, published annually, rightly defines itself as a  peer-reviewed journal of scholarly articles and book reviews.//////WHEN one hears of Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan's diaries, incredulity is what one is struck by. There is a reason for that. When towards the end of his decade-long presidency of Pakistan in the 1960s he came forth with his memoirs, bearing the arrogant title of Friends Not Masters, a goodly number of questions were raised about the ghost writers who probably had worked on them. And indeed there were the ghost writers, all of whom in later years were spotted explaining away their roles in the making of the memoirs which, incidentally, amounted to little that was enlightening or revealing. //////OUR imaginations run wild at the slightest hint of a mystery that possibly shrouds an event or a story. We forgo the comforting nap of the afternoon and peaceful slumber of the night for the excitement of watching a mystery movie or reading a strange story. Had there been no mystery in this world, it would have been a very dull place to live in. That explains why mystery stories of the Bermuda Triangle, Loch Ness monster, etc., are ever popular with young readers. //////
