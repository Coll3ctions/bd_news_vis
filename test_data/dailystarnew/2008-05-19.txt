The four part series will now start to appear from tomorrow. //////KNEE-JERK reactions to incidents are almost always counter-productive. And yet a knee-jerk reaction to the recent blasts in Jaipur has come from the authorities in Rajasthan. The off-handed way in which the police administration in the Indian state has pointed the finger at extremist elements in Bangladesh raises a good number of questions about the manner in which such a conclusion has been drawn. A senior police officer has told the media that the way the bombs were manufactured and concealed in bags is similar to the way Huji operate. Now, that is as queer a conclusion as any. Are we now to suppose that terrorists can be identified through the bags they use? And is it fair, even before thorough investigations have been undertaken, to draw inferences the objective of which is clearly targeting a country, in this case Bangladesh?//////JUST take a pause and think of the impregnable stature our garment sector has reached in recent times defying daunting odds. Pitted against the storms of post-MFA challenge, internal political turbulence, closure of factories, labour unrest over minimum wages and poor working conditions, the sector has evolved into a reputable state worthy of attention in newer areas of the world. The credit goes to 2.5 million skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers in woven, knit wear and textile sectors, of whom remarkably 80 percent are women. //////EVEN though much more remains to be done, Pakistan and India seem to have made a major breakthrough on the issue of the much-hyped gas pipeline from Iran to Pakistan and India late last month. Given the history of the project, tied as it is to the mercurial bilateral relations between Islamabad and New Delhi, as well as domestic politics in both the countries, optimism without reservation would, however, be unwarranted. This approximately 2775 km pipeline project has already bumped into uncertainty, with India somewhat sidelining it since the US nuclear deal was under consideration in the Lok Sabha. Several other factors also stood in the way of materialisation of the IPI although the idea was broached originally as far back as in 1993, when it was expected to cost $3.3 billion. With the prospect of the US nuclear deal having been shelved for now, India has renewed its interest in the project, although its cost has now escalated to $7.6 billion.//////OLD rules get old because they have legs to walk through generations. Time, then, to recall one of the oldest: When you are dead, lie down. So many politicians simply don't get this, whether they are provincial wannabes like the erstwhile Congress satrap from Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Das, or the woman who wanted the White House, Hillary Clinton.//////ON May 6, bdnews24.com quoted Bangladesh Bank's (BB) Deputy Governor Nazrul Huda as saying that BB would hold back issuing licenses to private commercial banks (PCB) for opening new branches if they didn't slash interest rate spread (IRS) between deposit and lending.

Every year we observe May Day in a befitting manner. We hold meetings and seminars, but that don't change the lot of the common people. University teachers, NGO representatives and human rights activists are seen in these seminars. But the ground situation remains unchanged. //////When one looks back to the agriculture scene of the past in Bangladesh, it would be seen that the government agencies motivated farmers to use fertilisers to increase farm production. Urea and other fertilisers are indispensable to get higher production. The farmers agitate when they do not get fertilisers. The media tries to influence the government to maintain an adequate supply and to keep the prices low. If any problem arises, the government is blamed. The Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) has set up some fertiliser factories and has been operating those for a long time. The demand of fertilisers has been increasing rapidly. The local production can meet only 50 per cent of our requirements. But in the past fifteen years, the last three elected governments and private entrepreneurs did not come forward to set up any fertiliser factory . About 1.5 million metric tons of fertilisers has to be imported every year. //////This year Bangladesh witnessed a bumper production of potatoes. An extra 3 million metric tones of potato has been produced by the farmers. The World Food Program (WFP) has also declared 2008 as the Potato Year.//////Atiqa Odho has conducted an interesting interview with former Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. The interview was one of the products of Odho Corporation telecast by GEO news channel of Pakistan on the evening of 10 May 2008. The outcome of the interview can be, in many respects, considered as revealing, lesson bearing, advisory, and an antidote or a response (or both) to the present day criticism of the acts and deeds during his (I mean, PM Aziz) premiership. Aziz was appreciative, in relevant ways, when it comes to matters pertaining to effectiveness of overall leadership of President Pervez Musharraf and his personal commitment towards Pakistan and Pakistanis, among other things.//////After reading Mr. Sikander's letter published in DS on May 9, 2008, I could not help but write once more on this subject. //////The prices of essential commodities are shooting up. I hardly go to kitchen market because I am dependent on others but the reaction from them and the media is really terrible & pathetic. The queue for OMS (BDR market) is lengthening. The middle class people are the worst sufferers, as they can neither buy from the shops, nor stand in the queue.//////Two top Bangladeshi political parties and two top leaders are under prosecution since the current caretaker government has taken over. We all know the caretaker government is trying to bring back democracy. I just cannot grasp why our political leaders are mounting pressure on the government for unconditional release of the two top leaders. They should rather understand that by establishing the rule of law they can free their leaders (if they are innocent) . //////I noted with interest the itinerary of Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mahmood's visit to Bangladesh. Significantly, a visit to Savar is missing from his trip here. Why? All dignitaries, and particularly dignitaries from Pakistan, should be taken to the Smriti Shoudho in Savar to pay respect to the millions killed by the Pakistani army, in one of the worst genocides of the 20th century. At a time when Bangladesh is agitating for the trial of war criminals, why is Mr. Mahmood not being taken to the Smriti Shoudho? Surely, the Pak Air Force chief could spare an hour of his time to pay his respect to the martyrs of 1971. //////These days the political reforms are the talk of the town. It is people's hope that in the coming days all sorts of election will be freed from the influence of the black money and muscle power.//////This morning we have heard and watched two important reports on Channel- i. These are regarding a) anti-corruption drive seminar b) Acquisition of 3 -crop agriculture lands in Munshiganj for EPZ. I think both the reports deserve close scrutiny.//////It is a universal fact that any government worth its name is responsible for the welfare of its people. The Burmese military junta has shown themselves as an exception. It is reported by the Indian authorities that they had informed Burmese authorities that the cyclone was moving towards the Burmese coast two days before it struck Burma. //////Those involved in the real estate sector of Bangladesh are aware that there are arrangements for land development by developers on a 40:60 or 50:50 sharing basis and landowners have to bear no construction costs for their share of apartments. It would be highly appreciated if a clarification is given on how to update the tax-file of a landowner after the land is completely developed and ready apartments are handed over to the landowner, and whether the landowner is required to pay any taxes.//////It is a very good thing that exporters are trying to diverse the product and service base from Bangladesh.//////Islam respects women more than any other religion. It has given permission to women to work anywhere using hijab but our fundamentalist Islamic leaders want to keep the women caged even in the 21st century. The government should take necessary steps to contain obscurantism.//////Some men and women earn greatness during their lifetime by making outstanding contribution to their own nation, or to the world civilization. As a mark of respect and gratitude to these great persons and to glorify their contribution, institutions and establishments are generally named after them after they die. This is also done to inspire the members of the younger generation to follow the footsteps of these great souls. But in Bangladesh we just see an opposite trend. Here some people in authority, especially the politicians, who are mostly corrupt, are in a great hurry to immortalize themselves while they are still alive! They don't want to wait till their death when people could evaluate their contribution and, if felt necessary, could decide to name some institution(s) after them. In the last three decades, we saw a mad rush by the corrupt political leaders of our country to name educational institutions, students' halls of residence, hospitals and other welfare institutions after their own names. In almost all such cases these persons did not spend money from their own pockets to establish these institutions. They all did it either by managing the required money out of the public exchequer, or by indulging in extortion from the general public, by exercising their political power. All this is being done in very bad taste, to say the least.//////I have been reading for long the pieces written by Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed in op-ed pages of The Daily Star. His recent articles, mostly on the ensuing US presidential elections (I remember one exception being an article suggesting that Bangladesh consider giving honorary citizenship to some noted Indians who were born in Bangladesh), have been interesting. But I am constrained to point out one particular streak of opinion in his recent articles on US presidential elections: the betting horse must always win the race, no matter what. The week before last i.e. before the Indiana and South Carolina primaries, he bemoaned Senator Obama's several political mistakes; criticised him for his failure to denounce his one-time religious leader, Jim Wright; took him to task for his unguarded comments regarding the mental make-up of small-town voters in Pennsylvania; and seemed to have rebuked Senator Obama for remaining elitist in attitude (gulp the coffee being offered even if you need orange juice). //////Thanks to AMK Chowdhury for his concern about ''derogatory practice '' an issue he raised in an article published in a weekly. //////A leading aid group warned yesterday that thousands of young children in cyclone-ravaged Myanmar could starve to death within weeks unless emergency food supplies reach them soon.//////US President George W.

It has given you more support and more momentum than most analysts expected a year ago. Keeping things simple and vague has worked so far, and it might work all the way to the White House. "Change you can believe in" is a great all-purpose slogan. It allows every person to fill in his or her own interpretation of what it means. In some ways, it's reminiscent of Jimmy Carter's 1976 promise to run "a government as good as the American people."//////SCIENTISTS are sending a DVD to Mars.
