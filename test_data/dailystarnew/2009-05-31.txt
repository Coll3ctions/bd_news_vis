It is that the recurrent incidents of so-called crossfire deaths are beginning to give Bangladesh a bad name around the world. It is not just Amnesty International which is concerned about the seeming impunity with which agencies such as the Rapid Action Battalion have been shooting people dead. There are others, in the country and outside, who are repelled by such unacceptable patterns of behaviour on the part of an agency of the state. The latest incident of the killing of two young men in the Jatiyo Sangsad area by RAB only underscores the malignancy that goes in the name of 'crossfire.' It deepens our sense of shame about ourselves, especially at a time when we are collectively striving to establish a social system based on the rule of law.//////WE are concerned at the field reports that instead of farmers it is the traders who are making profits from the rice procurement drive. Peasants are selling paddy to the millers and traders at lower prices than the rate fixed by the government. The farmers in the major rice-growing areas like the northern districts and Comilla region are selling paddy at around Tk 400 and Tk 450 per maund respectively, whereas the government price is fixed at Tk 560. Farmers are saying that the prices they are getting from traders or millers do not even cover their cost of production. //////DOLEYA (40) of Ghatak Char Village was married at 16. Not surprising, since early marriage in rural areas is a regular phenomenon. Doleya's husband is an agricultural labourer -- owning only 2 decimals of homestead land. Despite his sincere devotion, he could do little to feed a family of seven due to his prolonged illness. //////AFTER three weeks of political turmoil, Nepal has finally got a new coalition government. The moderate communist party, UML led coalition, has replaced the hard-line Maoist led coalition. When the Maoists pulled out of the government, opposition parties had to toil hard and wait long to materialise such a coalition to achieve a majority in the jumbo 601-member constituent assembly (CA), and subsequently lead the government. All these mammoth efforts have put a veteran communist politician Madhab Kumar Nepal at the helm. //////TODAY is the Pentecost Sunday.

The hub around which thousands of youngsters have become renowned citizens of Bangladesh, the nucleus of the existence of blossoming flowers that had bloomed to their full potential enlightening the minds of today's generation with new notions, perceptions regarding philosophy, economics and science. //////Chewing and smoking of tobacco have been among the biggest health hazards worldwide. Despite the inextricable link between a host of serious disorders and tobacco consumption, the practice continues to be widespread. This disturbing trend -- especially in developing countries has a lot to do with low awareness levels as well as lack of a sustained campaign against the menace. A campaign focusing on the hazards of tobacco consumption and highlighting the bountiful benefits that follow once the habit is kicked can go a long way in educating the masses. A sizeable section of the tobacco-users happens to be blissfully unaware of the dangers that smoking or chewing of tobacco invites. More worrying is the fact that in recent times, more and more teenagers and youths, even children, are increasingly getting caught in the murky tobacco trap. As for the country, it has a high incidence of tobacco consumption and consequently, tobacco-induced ailments -- the most perceptible being cancer. //////In the past, the volume of work was limited in case of individual person, business houses, even states. Gradually workloads as well as spaces have been increasing. Considering this fact, management thinkers have invented 'division of labour' and are insisting on 'specialization'. This is true not only for production methods but also in state affairs.//////The puppets of the student leaders are compelled to be present in their respective hall guest rooms at a certain time every night. This is a common scene in every hall of Dhaka University. But this is the highest seat of learning in the country. Keeping this in mind, parents send their children to this university. But things change when they enter the campus. They have to get involved in politics to survive. To stay in their hall, students have to attend the guest room meeting at night!//////The global recession is a good lesson for the super-rich Gulf states. The economic decline has started, and it cannot be stopped with wealth. The Equalizer Effect is 'on'.//////Very often we find that responsible people in high positions reveal information, gathered from suspects during questioning in connection with serious crimes, to the print and electronic media which adversely affect the interest of the case in question. We have seen this happen during the investigation of BDR carnage and also in the 10-truck arms smuggling case. It is needless to say that if vital information is leaked out before completion of the job, it will only help the people involved in the crime as this will enable them to go on a damage control activity, which will harm the case in the long run.//////I would like to draw kind attention of the authorities which are managing transports from Shyamoli crossing to Adabor. Every morning around 8:00am, I face a serious jam at Shyamoli crossing while coming out from Adabar area by car, due to huge influx of cars, microbuses, mini buses, large buses plus rickshaws. This is the peak hour. So, all the people in and around Shyamoli crossing need to go to office, school and to their respective destinations. It is very surprising that there is a useless road connecting Adabar ring road to Mirpur road near the bus counter of Hanif, Super Bus and other bus counters, the road is blocked by some pillars at the end approaching Mirpur road, so, no vehicles can go through it. Why is this road not usable? If this road is opened to the public transport, then all the vehicles can take left turn coming from Adabar ring road to Shyamoli crossing, there is no need to come to Shyamoli crossing and take left turn towards Gabtoli/Technical. The vehicles going towards Gabtoli /Technical can use the connecting road from Adabar ring road to Mirpur road. //////It is a matter of great satisfaction for the peace loving people around the world that Sri Lankan armed forces have proved their worth by defeating the LTTE. We support the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. //////I went to IEB, Lalkhan Bazar, with a view to visiting the telecommunications and technology fair. Well, I went there along with my friends, but the security guard did not allow us to get in. He rudely discouraged us and mentioned that we were too small to realize the solemnity of this day.//////Most of the cities in the world were established on riverbanks. So was our Dhaka. It is endowed with four majestic rivers. But out of sheer greed and negligence we are killing these lively water flows, so rare around the world. A section of government officials particularly those involved in land administration are the root cause of such encroachments. Every encroachment is initiated by some sort of dubious paper works by such officials. So if we want to stop suffocation of rivers and reclaim encroached lands we should start from land offices.//////The way Mashrafe bowled in the final over in his first match in the IPL was indeed heart breaking for fans all over Bangladesh. I just cannot understand his reason for being nervous. This is just a game, not a war. Why can't he just play his natural game? This is not the first time he has done this. //////While the contemporary world is changing with the advent of new inventions of science and technology, Bangladesh is lagging behind. It is regretful to note that these days students do not like to study science. Rather, they are very much interested in business studies. After completing their education, students of biotechnology, pharmacy, information technology, geography and environment science, agriculture science etc., are not getting jobs. They are feeling frustrated. These brilliant students with excellent results should be in good positions wherefrom they could render their services in nation building. At this moment, Bangladesh needs to engage brilliant students in the arena of research. //////We the general students of Chittagong University are very much anxious about the present unstable condition prevailing on our campus. Some days ago we saw the clashes between two rivals groups of student wings.We see that there are many empty seats in the halls. The whole thing has been politicised to the point where general students have no say, and bloody clashes often erupt over allocation of seats. The outsiders ruin the academic atmosphere of the halls and the campus. //////Almost all the TV channels announce their programmess in advance for the viewers of New York, Dubai, Middle East and obviously for local viewers in their bid to highlight special occasions like birth and death anniversary of Kabi Guru Rabindranath Tagore, National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and for other purposes. It is very difficult to memorize all the programmes of all the channels at a time and hence it is of no use to telecast the programmes in advance. On the other hand, the programmes are punctuated by several advertisements that bring the viewer to zero tolerance level. The programmes are not viewed fully by the viewers. On top of that, unscheduled load shedding shatters the patience of the viewers who make it a point to view a special programme of their choice. So, TV programmes, especially drama serials, cannot be enjoyed due to disturbances of advertisements, load shedding and for telecasting of many drama serials at a time through different channels. Hence, viewers enjoy only TV news and rest of the time browse from channel to channel. //////Smoking in public places has become a common phenomenon. Certainly, it is an indecent thing. Nowadays it has spread out among all classes of people. Though some teenagers think that smoking is part of smartness, but it is not true. //////The US defence chief urged Asian allies yesterday to consider tougher sanctions against North Korea, noting that past efforts to cajole the reclusive regime into scrapping its nuclear weapons program have only emboldened it.//////Pakistan yesterday vowed to take "full care" of more than two million people displaced by a military operation in the northwest, as it said it had regained a key town from Taliban fighters.//////US Defence Secretary Robert Gates urged Europe and China to step up their involvement in rebuilding Afghanistan, saying Saturday that America alone cannot put the conflict-ridden nation back on its feet while mired in a fight against the Taliban.//////There is resentment among a section of the Congress in the northeast over the poor representation from the region in the Manmohan Singh ministry. //////US Defence Secretary Robert Gates pressed Myanmar's military rulers yesterday to free pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and reopen dialogue with the opposition.//////As Pakistani military intensified operations against the Taliban in Swat valley and adjoining areas, a top US General has said that it is going to be "a tough fight" for the country whose "very existence" is threatened by the militants.

The audience, comprising mostly youngsters, started swaying and humming along with the star musician at Winter Garden, Dhaka Sheraton Hotel.//////Fellow theatre activists and personalities from other sectors greeted Dr. Enamul Huq with wreaths and bouquets as the veteran theatre personality has celebrated his five decades in theatre. Huq's cherished theatre organisation Nagarik Natyangan arranged a two-day celebration programme, which coincided with his 66th birth anniversary (May 29), at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA).//////When I was a child I had a cassette player on which I would listen to Shesher Kobita by Tagore every single night before going to sleep. I thought I understood the theme. I listened to that cassette after 15 years again and suddenly realised I hadn't understood a word of it. Acting is like that. Even after 20 years, I feel that I have a lot more to learn." Such is the humility of a household name in Bangladesh -- Bipasha Hayat.//////A new drama serial, titled " Dorakata", is set to go on air from tonight on Rtv.

Between September 2008 and February 2009, exports from Bangladesh fell by an annualised rate of less than 4 per cent -- while this is an unwelcome reversal from about 20 per cent a year growth witnessed in the recent years, it is still a significantly better performance than 70 per cent or so annualised fall in the East Asian region over the same period. //////The current fiscal year is coming to end on June 30, 2009. Government machineries are busy finalising the budget for the next fiscal year. Hence this is an appropriate time to assess the state of the economy of Bangladesh. //////THIS devi of disinformation is a late blooming flower. Her biography makes her 57 years old at this writing. But surprisingly, there is not a single sighting of this prolific author until 2006, when at the ripe old age of 54 she suddenly burst into various online publications, starting with Asian Tribune, an online daily published by an organisation called the World Institute for Asian Studies or WAIS. //////THE walls are scorched black, a thin film of soot covers the burnt out wreckage inside the living room of Nurul Islam's former flat. A thick smell of burnt plastic hangs in the air. On the corner of the dining room table, a packet of cigarettes stubbornly sits in pristine condition, and books arranged on nearby shelves are in a near perfect state. It's a bright Thursday morning and the light is good. It pours in through the windows, bringing a strange glow to the otherwise pitch-black former family home.//////
