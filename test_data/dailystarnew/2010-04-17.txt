Common people were given the impression that Bangladesh was floating in gas. Even supplying gas to India was seriously considered at high level. During BNP-led regime //////IT was a dinner hosted in honour of Pakistan Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir at the High Commissioner's residence at Delhi. The talks between India's Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao and him had ended without any concrete result. I asked Bashir at the dinner whether Kashmir figured in their discussions. He said, 'Yes'. But the most significant remark he made was in reply to my query if the ground covered behind-the-scenes would have to be walked over once again. He said they would pick up the thread from where it had been let off. We would resume from the stage already reached, Bashir said.//////THE formation of the provisional Bangladesh government in Mujibnagar remains, and will remain, a defining moment in our lives. It came into shape in the grey region that served as the frontier between the sinister and the illuminating. The sinister was the programmed genocide launched with unprecedented viciousness by the Pakistan occupation army; and the illuminating was the truth that such a brutal assault on human dignity, indeed on the traditions of a people, could not go unchallenged and unbeaten. And so it was on 17 April 1971 that in Meherpur of Chuadanga, the senior leaders of the Awami League, close associates of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, came together to proclaim before the world that out of the debris of a fast enveloping war had emerged a government, the overriding purpose behind the deed being the liberation of the land.//////THE entire area stretching from Dhaka to Barisal to Teknaf to Tetulia appears to be a huge tinder box of crimes -- killing, rape, burning, and violence. Most traumatic, the sleepy villages, once known as peaceful abodes have now been also rocked by gruesome incidents of sexual abuses that threaten to plunge the conservative people's paradise into identity crisis. So deep is the rot and so pervasive the cynicism that pious proclamations of intent no longer make a difference. //////THE Protestant work ethic fuelled industrialisation in Europe and the USA in the nineteenth-century while the Confucian work ethic powered Japan's entry into the elite club of the rich and economically dominant nations in the early twentieth-century. The same work ethic catapulted the economies of many East and South East Asian countries like China, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand in the recent past.//////WHEN there are more travellers than transporters, when a larger vehicle will save space by replacing several smaller ones, and bring in other environmental joys lesser air and noise pollution, more greenery with roads occupying lesser space for number of persons moved mass transportation emerges as THE solution. Added to that is 'rapid', as of course time is of great meaning and consequence to particularly a city dweller.//////Twenty million people will live in Dhaka in 2030 if present growth trends continue. Unhindered informal/unplanned and formal/planned growth on its fragile ecology makes it one of the most vulnerable/unlivable cities on the planet in the face of climate change and other natural calamities. The present traffic scenario is connected with this explosive urban growth and has to be treated accordingly. //////THE MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), sometimes referred to as the Bangkok Metro, is Bangkok's underground metro system. It was constructed under a concession concept. Most civil infrastructure were provided by the government sector, Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) and handed over to their concessionaire under a 25-year concession agreement. As MRTA's concessionaire, Bangkok Metro Company Limited (BMCL) provides M&E equipment, including electrical trains, signalling systems, SCADA, communication, PSD, etc for the subway project and fully operates the system. To maintain the system, BMCL has subcontracted in 10 years to Siemens which was the M&E system supplier since system opening and 7 years maintenance contract to two local maintenance services for north and south line. The metro has a fleet of 19 trains; the 19th train entered service in October, 2007 after a major accident. Besides the MRT, Bangkok also has an elevated rail system called BTS or informally the Skytrain.//////In Bangladesh we get to welcome in a new year twice. Once on 31st December. And a second time on 14th April. How blessed we feel to start afresh at the stroke of midnight; or to break open the bind of a new Hal-Khata and poise our pens atop a blank page. There is something wonderfully life-affirming about the beginning of something new. A beginning is a discrete journey of sorts, ours to interpret as we wish. An ending denotes a reactive beginning thereafter. Stuck at crossroads denotes the proactive beginning. Whatever the particular interpretation, the concept remains the same. Hope. Faith. Resolution.//////The hordes approached, filling up the vast expanse with their steely grey formations, a formidable gathering. A hush descended, and the air had an expectant, almost electric taste to it. The lone crow spread its sooty wings in a lazy glide that belied its nervousness at the sudden calm and the dimming light. //////I popped open the tab on my noodle soup. It fizzed as the sachet released its score of vitamins. Taste calibration molecules began to color the clear white algae. There was a beauty to this, jellyfish changing color at dawn. My room was cardboard cutout, same as hundreds I had slept in. A pallet, a tray, a box for personal toiletries and extra clothes, of which I had none. I had rented the room for a week, rare, because I moved around a lot. I needed a fixed address this time, however, damn the expense. A knock. I put down my bowl, unfinished. My last friend this side of the world crawled in, wearing his physician's smock. He had his briefcase, full of the drugs I had paid for. //////THERE'S a jackfruit tree growing in front of my window. I am lying in bed, looking at it. It's been trimmed recently, I note with some sadness. It's not my jackfruit tree so I have no control over it. Its roots are in the neighbouring garden but, I assume, over the years it has leaned onto this side of the wall. The body of the tree is thus floating above what is technically our air space. I haven't known this tree long but I feel a kinship with it. For, my roots were planted somewhere else but my body is floating over someone else's air space. //////I believe in second chances. I believe in this absolutely, for my life is a testament to the universe's ability to press the refresh button, to at least give back some of the things that are taken in its purging tsunamis, where the storm washes away the clutter and sometimes leaves clarity in its wake. //////THE thing about places is that they make you believe in lies. Out of context truths can be lies. That's why I never trusted how a place made me feel. That might work to my disadvantage you might say. And to clear that up I should say I am not talking about planned vacations or weekend trips to parents, I am talking about those planned non-vacations, the migrations and di-migrations, the ones you impose on yourself to encourage progression of some kind, wealth, health, spiritualityall bull.//////THE first thing I remember is the taste of leather and dirt. Something kept banging against my chin. When I opened my eyes I saw a big-ass army issue leather boot swinging in. Thwack! I winced more out of habit because I felt no pain. //////The thunder clouds loom afar.//////Ominous yet welcome. //////Reminders of her abeyant mood.//////Healthy pregnancy brings healthy baby and secures mothers' health. A perfect pre-pregnancy plan is the first step that leads pregnancy safer to you and your upcoming baby.

With a view to raising awareness among people on the importance of voice preservation and enhancement, World Voice Day was observed yesterday.

Some of them are costly and have severe side effects, but now diet can also prevent seizure! Sometimes diet is better than the drugs even!//////GAVI Alliance Immunise Every Child is now the GAVI Campaign! The mission is still the same: to save children's lives and protect people's health by increasing access to immunisation in poor countries. GAVI has a large goal ahead: preventing close to 5 million deaths in the next 5 years.//////Foods rich in folate and B-6 may reduce the risk of death from stroke and heart problems, a new study revealed recently. The study conducted by Japanese researchers is published in the recent issue of Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association has found that these vitamins are associated with lower incidence of heart failure and death from stroke.//////Suggestions to help understand and express your feelings understanding and controlling your emotions is as important as managing your physical health.//////One of President Obama's election pledges was to secure loose nukes in his first term in office. Towards achieving that pledge, he invited to Washington 47 nuclear states to get a plan of action to deal with nuclear threat from non-state actors and terrorist groups in place of some vague gauzy statements. In the built up to this Summit, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that US intelligence sources have information that Al Qaeda terrorists are seeking to get hold of nuclear weapons while at the same time planning to target nuclear installations for terrorist attacks. Her statement put the Summit in context.//////On 11 March, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited India to strengthen the close partnership Moscow and New Delhi have traditionally enjoyed for more than 60 years.//////Will the United States and Pakistan ever trust each other enough to cooperate fully in fighting the Taliban and al Qaeda? This was the question haunting the recent strategic dialogue between the top brass of the two countries, which aimed to put their prickly relationship on a new footing. Although Pakistan's delegation was headed by its Foreign Minister, the suave Shah Mahmood Qureshi, it also included its wily military commander, General Ashfaq Kayani. Washington promised to speed up delivery of economic aid and military equipment for Pakistan's increased efforts at battling militants on the Afghan border. This is a new day, declared Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who hopes to shrink the yawning trust deficit between the two countries. But are there grounds to believe that when it comes to fighting militants, Islamabad and the White House' interests can converge? //////IN Bangladesh at least, theory has lent radical-sounding voices to many. Even some bookworms and careerists have turned vocal all of a sudden. People caring little for the motherland or the teeming millions have started talking a lot with support from theory. This is all the more true for Bangladesh where nationalist and radical traditions of intellectual exercise have rather been weak and slender. But, as fervor or uproar doesn't go unchecked in any area for an unlimited time, so a phase of reviews and assessments is what appears to have set in in recent years. This again has happened, lamentably, first abroad or in the West. We remain peripheral. Of course, there were important critiques from leftwing giants like Aizaz, Eagleton and others who never let theory go unchecked or unchallenged. Recently there have been many more joining that counter-current.//////SOME often say, what's in a face? Well, everything really. Faces and expressions are the reflection of the life that we lead. Of course, mankind has perfected the art of camouflaging true feelings to opt for a more passive social image. But what happens when we are alone? Do we mask our inner feelings then? Or maybe secured in solitude we feel that since no one is here, the real expressions can now come out. Shakoor's Ballads and Paintings is a compilation of human expressions from different social settings from the one where we are always on guard to the one where we just let go and allow the real 'me' to emerge.//////
