I have, however, chosen to highlight scientific and technological challenges not without reason. Planners, Managers and Economists of Bangladesh usually deal with all aspects of the challenges but the S & T challenges are usually overlooked. This is rather unfortunate in view of the fact the Nobel Laureate economist Robert Solow pointed out quite sometime ago that the real engine of economic growth is science & technology. Economists should note that it is science & technology that has acted as an instrument of change for all countries. Yet when our economists plan our economy, they tend to follow a stereo type methodology using all the economic jargons of the day and all the present day systems of loans and grants from the financial institutions of the world. The ideas of resource generation using science & technology have never been their strong point. It is with this view in mind that I have concentrated on the S&T challenges of the twenty first century which have already brought about economic revolutions in many countries.//////Regionally, as we approach the end of the Bush term, U.S. foreign policy is suffering from a zero achievement syndrome without even mentioning the Iraqi fiasco!//////A well-planned jailbreak and quick takeover of dozens of villages show Taliban fighters are again gaining strength.//////
