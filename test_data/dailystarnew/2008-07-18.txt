And it is so because it fills a major lacuna in the legal process. The lacuna is that individuals sentenced by a trial court are free to take part in elections as long as their appeals before a higher court go on. We realise, of course, that there is a standard legalistic approach in such situations, where an individual is free to engage in political or other activity as long as all his means of legal appeal are not exhausted. With due respect to such legalities or interpretations of legality, we also notice that the realities in Bangladesh since the restoration of democracy in 1991 have been quite beyond the ordinary. During that period many corrupt individuals got elected because of the lengthy appeals process. Indeed, over the past few weeks, with elections to the city corporations and municipalities approaching, reports have appeared of a number of people charged with corruption filing nomination papers for the polls. The resultant concern among broad sections of people can only be imagined.//////AFTER a period of relative lull we notice a recurrence of encounter deaths of alleged criminals in RAB custody.

Protecting the status quo from all challenges shall not become the prime activity of the government. //////OLIVER Wendell Holmes, Sr., one of the best regarded American poets of the 19th century, once observed that the axis of the earth sticks out visibly through the centre of each and every town or city.

For many centuries since then the city remained eclipsed under the Buddhist and Hindu kings until it proved its mettle in 1608. The Mughals arrived and made it the capital of Bengal.//////IT was Lee Hamilton, the Democrats' wise old man of national security, who let slip the real reason for Barack Obama's big foreign policy speech in Washington on Tuesday.

Can we guess which one came first? Cox's Bazar!!//////A large number of workers working in various industrial mills and factories face different kinds of maltreatment, discrimination and exploitation. For this very reason, the prevalence of trade unions as collective bargaining agents on behalf of labourers and workers to protect their rights, to create pressure through the government on the management of the industries to improve the working condition and to press home their demand for higher wages to cope with the inflation is reasonable, desirable and democratic. To defend the poor people from discrimination and exploitation, the trade unions have no alternative. But, the government's enforced Emergency Power Rule has restricted the political and civil rights of the people, including trade union activities.//////The news of price hike of essential commodities is being published almost every day.

The idea was indeed visionary as it aimed to unite both Muslim-Bengalis and Hindu-Bengalis under a common identity-- Bengali. Moreover, since then the Awami League championed the demand of ordinary people of East Pakistan under the charismatic and uncompromising leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman which ultimately resulted in the independence of our motherland--Bangladesh. A key reason underlying the success of pre-independence Awami League is that it was consistent with its principles and it succeeded in producing dynamic leaders who were able to lead the country even when Sheikh Mujib was imprisoned by the Pakistani forces. However, post-independence Awami League somehow failed to consistently practice the principles which it was formed upon. Some examples of such inconsistencies --its introduction of one-party system by creating BAKSAL; its participation in the election of 1986, which gave a new life to the autocratic regime of HM Ershad; its failure to have any within party democracy which only allowed incompetent people to emerge as leaders in the party apparatus; and lastly its short lived memorandum of understanding (MoU) with fanatic forces which alienated the party from its secular ideals. Today, it is hard to perceive the ideals that the Bangladesh Awami League really stands for, and, more importantly, what they aim to deliver in future. Even a month ago they were active in bringing back democratic forces in power. Now, after the release of their party chairman, they have somehow silenced down and some say a deal had been struck. We want to know what this deal is. And, is it in line with the principles that this party was formed upon?//////Your today's( July 9) editorial expressed concern, quite rightly, that the upcoming city, municipal polls are being contested by people of dubious reputation and highlighted the deep worries of the Election Commission. Perhaps if we look at the whole situation in perspective we have to take into account the history of such elections in the past-- nearly two decades since the ouster of the "dictator" where these elections were influenced by the clout of the party in power and accordingly in most situations the candidates were elected with the resultant impact of the ruling party broadening its base to continue its domination, misrule and corruption. In essence, this culture flowed through from the central level of the political parties where the prime target was to somehow come to power and get the licence to rule in their own way for a period of 5 years. Interests of the electorate were subordinated due to the "money and muscle power" of the candidates backed by the central leaders of the parties, who at any cost wanted a "winner"--his credentials were immaterial. Thus the culture prevailed and here we are today to root out this culture in one clean sweep through the aegis of the Election Commission-- this is "wishful thinking".//////Shortage of two taka notes causes huge suffering to the people. The notes in circulation are either torn, and therefore taped, or too old to use.//////Recently, I shifted my residence and had to transfer the T&T line to my new address. With fear & anxiety, I went to take NOC from Nilkhet Telephone Exchange. Considering my previous experience with the BTTB, I had made up my mind to face them with a lot of negative answers. //////In general, most of the students of our country who are weak or less strong in mathematics tend to choose the Business Studies group. Because, they believe that they won't have to face mathematics in higher education. The reason behind such kind of belief is the absence of mathematics at the HSC level under the present system. But the situation has changed. In higher education like BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration), BBS (Bachelor of Business Studies), BSS (Bachelor of Social Science) in Economics, the presence of mathematical courses & numerous mathematics based problems is quite evident. So, the students without mathematics background face problems in such cases. //////The BNP has lost a lot of ground due to its divided leadership. On the other hand, the Jamaat is gaining more and more political strength by virtue of their so-called "less corrupt" image and committed grassroots workers. It seems to me that the Jamaat might assume a leading role in the 4-party alliance, unless Khaleda Zia regains her position fully in the party with a new image and new policy. //////From the daily national news, we came to know that the annual confidential report (ACR) of government officials at upazila level will be written by the upazila chairman, after the local government election.

It has changed the old systems of file & record keeping which requires large space for storage. //////Separation of the judiciary from the executive is one of the greatest achievements the caretaker government has to its credit. In fact, the caretaker government has highly been appreciated at home and abroad for this noble act. The government has separated the judiciary to make it independent, responsible, speedy and free from all sorts of corruption. Although the court is regarded as a sacred place, no file moves from one room to another without. A section of dishonest employees is responsible for this. A warrant of arrest passed by the learned court does not reach the police station concerned in time, unless something is offered to please the officials concerned. Only the sufferers know the truth. //////The world must brace for another recession due to unprecedented oil price. Fuel price has soared to such a level that it has surpassed all previous records.//////The news that Bangladesh is a peaceful country dispelling the notions /opinions of many countries came as a pleasant surprise.
