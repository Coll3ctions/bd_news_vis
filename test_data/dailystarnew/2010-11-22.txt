And we seem to be in a state of torpor when it comes to addressing this danger. Statistics of the Highway Police indicate a figure of 510 deaths on the highways only in the first half of 2010. The figure is perhaps much higher considering the fact that many accidents do not get reported at all or are taken cognizance of by the police. //////The newly freed Aung San Suu Kyi has been giving out cautious signals of what she plans to do now that she is back in sunlight. While her release from long detention was surely a seminal event not only for the people of her country but also for the rest of the world, it was how she intended to make use of her freedom that became an important question for many. Perhaps there was reason enough here for such a question. In her previous stints of fitful freedom, Ms. Suu Kyi's refusal to go soft on the military junta ruling her country swiftly saw her back in lonely imprisonment. That as well as the feeling in a good many quarters that her idealism had all along been getting the better of her judgement may well have played a role in her present change of attitude. Where earlier she was vociferously in favour of outside nations clamping sanctions on her country unless the regime relented, now she appears to have shifted ground just a little.//////It is quite rare for the Tigers' think-tank to endure a "pleasant headache" but that is exactly what they would be facing when later this month, they sit to select the team for the five-match one-day series against Zimbabwe.//////Bangladesh had a mixed day at the Asian Games in Guangzhou yesterday with some heartening results chipping in amid disappointing ones.//////It may have been held more than thirty-one years ago, but the 1979 World Cup was played under conditions quite similar to what the cricket world is faced with today.

Just as the rebel Indian Cricket League in 2007 had drawn players away from national duty, incurring the wrath of national boards around the world, Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket divided the cricket world in two in the late 1970s. //////Having observed the booters during his first assignment at the Asian Games football, Bangladesh's Croat coach Robert Rubcic is likely to assess both personality and performance before selecting his next squad for the Olympic pre-qualifiers against Kuwait early next year.//////Siddikur Rahman made a steady finish in the UBS Hong Kong Open yesterday where he secured the 26th position with a fourth-round score of 3-under par.

If there were proper planning, reasonable level of development could have been achieve over the past years even with the government's meagre budgetary allocation.//////At present there is no extensive programme before us for population control. About one and a half decade ago the government and many NGOs used to work extensively all over Bangladesh on family planning programmes. This was a spontaneous movement. But now-a-days we do not get to see this programme anywhere in Bangladesh like in the past, though the government has been working on it through the ministry of family planning since 1965.//////At last Sheikh Hasina has completed her mission successfully by removing Khaleda Zia from her house. I think it was the most important mission of her political life. She is a prime minister, but after all she is a woman. She cannot work for a country without listening to her heart, and if she has a heart, then how has she removed Khaleda from her home? //////If we look back a few years, most women were busy in household affairs and caring for the children. Now women are participating in every sector and working side by side with the men. They manage both their family and work. However, they can't work with a tension free mind because they are not able to look after their children properly. Sometimes they are compelled to give up work for the sake of their kids.//////Reading Khaleda's eviction story, I feel ashamed of the political game being played in the country. Just imagine, you have got rid of a widow from her house where she spent the best days of her life. Her husband may have died long ago, but I am sure she used to cherish his memories in that house every day.//////Dhaka City has become a very unsafe place especially before and at day break or from dusk because of the thugs and ruffians who seem to have got a free-rein. Last Friday (29/10/2010) while we -- a girl child, a boy, two women and I, were coming out of a Chinese Restaurant on Banani Road number 11 and walking up to reach the main road (Airport Road) at 10 pm, were stopped by two private cars, one in front and the other at the rear. There were five young men, all looked to be between 18 and 25 years. In the twinkle of the eyes they got out of the cars and pointed a pistol at the chest of the child and dagger at the boy, and in a matter of few minutes robbed us of our all. The car number plates were hung reverse.//////The present government has committed to the people to complete the war crimes trial, but at present we see that the process is going on very slowly. This is likely to create doubts in people's mind whether the trial would be completed at all. We are waiting for the completion of trial of war criminals. And if that does not happen there will certainly be a disconnect between the present government and the general people of Bangladesh. This may cost AL dearly in the next election. So we hope that the AL government will take adequate steps to compete the trial as early as possible. //////Poverty and population boom are the roots of all other problems that threaten our national existence.

Thus who is at fault - the bank officials or DCC authorities?//////It is unbelievable that the government is dragging its feet in according Musa Ibrahim the due honour, respect and gratitude he rightly and richly deserves. Does it have such a myopic view and is so distant from the people that they don't recognize the will of the people? //////After the shameful drubbing the BNP received at the last elections, it was just a question of time when they would bring out the dreaded "hartal" card, in order to create chaos in the country and somehow dislodge the government in power. Never mind that they had promised not to use that card, and to perform their duties as the Loyal Opposition.//////One kilometre Mehdipur-Abdul Nabi Road, under Dagunbhuiyan, Upazila of Feni runs from Mehdipur Al-Amin Yatimkhana Complex to Mannan Sowdagar Bari Culvert on the Koraish Munshi-Senbag Road.

The visit offered India an opportunity to tell him what kind of world order it would like to see. //////Bangladesh is historically and traditionally a highly patriarchal society. All the processes, values and institutions that are associated with the construction of the country are gendered. The institutions and values of this gendered state always privilege masculinity. Women in Bangladesh have to fight with gender boundaries that assign them a subordinate position within patriarchal ideology, the essential feature of which is domination and supremacy of men and powerlessness and invisibility of women in almost all spheres of their lives. //////Zinc is an important nutrient for humans. Everybody needs zinc, irrespective of age and sex. An adult male needs to consume 4 mg, adult female needs 3 mg, an infant needs 1-3 mg and a child needs 3-5 mg of zinc daily. Pregnant women need 3-6 mg and lactating women need 6 mg daily. If the diet is devoid of animal products and high in phytate, daily zinc intake requirements will increase about threefold. The human body is unable to store zinc in large, readily accessible amounts, so it needs to be consumed daily in relatively small quantities.//////When John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, a whole world went spinning into shock.

The second was that it was none other than the president of the United States, its thirty fifth as a matter of fact, who had been murdered. //////
