In this issue we take an in-depth look at matters of vital national importance. We hope readers will enjoy this supplement as they have the others.//////WE are saddened and worried that in the name of Islam some people have been trying to create confusion around the issue of the proposed national policy on women. In many ways, it is a repeat of what these very elements tried doing recently about the education policy, a move that created some unnecessary confusion. Now when a progressive step is being taken to ensure that Bangladesh's women enjoy equal rights with men politically, economically and socially, these extreme elements are busy spreading the false notion that the proposed policy goes against the Quran and Sunnah. It does nothing of the sort. Indeed, we are outraged that where Islam once caused a positive transformation in people's thoughts and even now symbolizes equality and self-esteem for all men and women, some quarters are happy to convey the impression that Islam stands against granting equal rights to women. Nothing could be further from the truth.//////WITH Dhoni's six, which was the last of the tournament, and one that helped India surpass Sri Lanka's total in the final, the curtains came down on what must surely rate as one of the brightest extravaganza of any sport, let alone cricket. //////Saturday's stupendous feat in the World Cup final made Mahendra Singh Dhoni India's most successful captain in limited-overs cricket, having won both the World Twenty20 and the World Cup for the cricket-mad country. So, hardly could he hide his emotion.

Most of his answers were either long or like skipping the question with a joke, and his motto was: Enjoy the night first.//////What was dubbed as the "People's World Cup" ended in the best possible way. //////Kumar Sangakkara missed a "once in a lifetime opportunity" to become a hero after great Arjuna Ranatunga, but the Sri Lanka skipper showered praise on his opponents by saying that India deserved the trophy after the way they had played throughout the showcase event.//////Mashrafe Bin Mortaza feels it would be wise to stay away from the April 7 practice match against Australia.//////Sri Lanka star Muttiah Murali-daran admitted his last international appearance had been a letdown following a six-wicket World Cup final defeat by India.//////Delirious Indians broke into unprecedented celebrations across the country, setting off fireworks, jamming main thoroughfares with vehicles and partying hard on the streets savouring glory as India won the cricket World Cup.//////India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh ended a nationwide guessing game by revealing the identity of the driving force behind his World Cup heroics - Sachin Tendulkar.//////Indian newspapers revelled Sunday in the national team's World Cup cricket victory, hailing skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men as heroes for a new generation.//////The fireworks that exploded after India's scintillating World Cup triumph over Sri Lanka in the final were not the only ones that eventually added sparkle to cricket's showpiece event.//////Sri Lanka's defeated cricket team return-ed home Sunday to calls from state-run media demanding a probe into "blunders right from the start".//////The Australia cricket team will arrive this evening for a 10-day trip.//////India have been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate in their six-wicket World Cup final win over Sri Lanka, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced Sunday.//////Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga said on Sunday that his World Cup career is over.//////First day of the National Cricket League's fifth round certainly belonged to the bowlers as a total of 44 wickets fell in the three matches respectively across the country yesterday.//////Barcelona are on course for a third successive league title after a 1-0 win at Villarreal on Saturday moved the double champions eight points clear of bitter rivals Real Madrid in the title race with just eight games left.//////Wayne Rooney scored a hattrick as Manchester United seized control of the Premier League title race with a 4-2 victory over West Ham while rivals Arsenal slipped up against Blackburn.//////Pato scored a brace and threw himself cunningly to the ground to get Cristian Chivu sent off as AC Milan took charge of the Serie A title race by beating Inter Milan 3-0 at the San Siro here on Sunday.//////Borussia Dortmund came from behind to floor Bundesliga title rivals Hanover 96 on Saturday with a 4-1 victory which maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table.//////Victoria Azarenka defeated Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-4 here Saturday to win the WTA's prestigious Miami hardcourt crown for the second time.//////Indian doubles stars Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes said their Miami Masters triumph was inspired by watching their country's World Cup win over Sri Lanka.//////AC Milan president and Italy Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sprang to the defence of his former coach Leonardo after the Brazilian received a hot reception at the San Siro.//////Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp is hopeful Gareth Bale will be fit to face Real Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinal first leg on Tuesday.//////Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapakse Sunday consoled skipper Kumar Sangakkara after his team lost the cricket World Cup to India and urged them to do better next time.//////The market of aluminium extrusion products used in doors, windows and curtain walls has been growing rapidly as wood is getting scarce by the day.//////Real estate may have to feel the pinch of the ongoing political unrest in Middle East countries, as realtors fear land sales may slide by 10 percent in the coming months.//////Sri Lanka raised fuel prices Saturday by up to 7.5 percent in a bid to offset higher crude oil import costs.

He was identified as Abu Saled, 28, son of Zainal Abedin, a worker of state-owned Crescent Jute Mill at Khalishpur. The murder was committed as a sequel to rivalry over establishing supremacy in the area, police and locals said. According to police, a group of young men kidnapped Abu Saleh from Khalishpur Chitrali Bazar in the morning and later chopped him to death behind Kashipur graveyard. The gang had a quarrel with Saleh on Saturday afternoon, said OC Munirul Gias. Abu Saleh was an activist of Jubo Dal and accused in four criminal cases, the OC added.//////Two youths were fined Tk 5,000 each for sexually harassing a female SSC examinee at Dimla upazila headquarters Friday.

But on Saturday, farmers found his two severed legs in a roadside canal at Jugia at about 6:00pm and informed police. A team from Sadar police later recovered the body without the head. Police said the murder was committed several days ago and then dumped into the canal.//////It is very unfortunate to find so many Bangladeshis stranded in Tunisia and Libya after having endured great sufferings while fleeing from a war-torn nation. While they suffer, the Bangladesh government makes no sincere and hurried efforts to get these citizens back home which is a matter of great disgrace. Even IOM is saying that the Govt. of Bangladesh is half-hearted in its efforts to take back the citizens. I urge upon all to raise their voice in support of these stranded fellow citizens and if need be, launch private efforts to raise money to get these people back home. Too bad, the nation can spend billions to showcase ICC - it can not spare dimes when it comes to looking after its stranded citizens.//////It's a matter of great delight for us that Bangladesh has successfully played its part in hosting the Cricket World Cup 2011. We have once again proved that despite being an impoverished nation, we have the capability of producing world-class outputs if given an opportunity. This magnificent event has also given this tiny nation a great deal of international exposures that we truly deserved. //////Remember what General Mooen U Ahmed said after taking over on 1/11, the train has fallen off the tracks meaning the country and it needs to be restored back on its tracks. //////We are writing in response to Mr Alamgir Khan's article The other side of microfinance. In it he queried what the sources of our literature review on the impact of micro-finance were. We sourced our evidence from published research on micro-finance in Bangladesh, using material from researchers based in Bangladesh and those abroad. Since the list of references is too long to reproduce in a letter of this nature, we would like to point to two papers which provide the details of each of the points made in our article along with their exact citations. These two overview papers are Khandker, S. (2005). Microfinance and Poverty: Evidence Using Panel Data from Bangladesh. World Bank Economic Review 19(2) and Zaman, H (2004) The scaling up of micro-finance in Bangladesh: determinants, impact and lessons World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3398. We hope readers find these papers helpful in assessing the impact of micro-credit on the poor.//////Amnesty International and other Human Rights organisations' observation that the country should move towards the abolition of capital punishment is a clear evidence of recognition in principle at the highest quarters that there can be no rational justification for that extreme penalty in a democratic state. Their views represent the current thinking across the world. Although Bangladesh's law prescribes death penalty for crimes such as murder, abetting mutiny by members of the armed forces, and waging war against the government, it is in cases perceived as particularly gruesome and politically sensitive that the extreme punishment is awarded. In our country, the justice system works in such a way that of the criminals caught, a very few get convicted. Though abolition of capital punishment is welcome, the government should not tie the hands of justice in dealing with heinous crimes.//////I was saddened to learn of the passing away of veteran politician and BNP secretary general, Khandker Delwar Hossain, in Singapore. I rushed to see more detailed news. However, I was confused by the conflicting information on two popular websites, the websites of The Daily Star and BDNews24.com.//////We need to listen to the Bangladesh Bank governor. As it is Bangladesh Bank who removed Prof Yunus from Grameen Bank, they should defend it, not the Finance Minister and the Attorney General.//////We understand from various reports that majority of the general mass desire that Professor Yunus will be treated honourably. I have a proposal on how to bid farewell to Dr. Yunus as the outing Managing Director of Grameen Bank.It was published in the newspaper that the tenure of Chairmanship of the existing Chairman of Grameen Bank is going to expire in April 2011; (if I am not wrong) Dr. Yunus may be allowed to continue as the Managing Director of the Bank till expiry of the tenure of the Chairman of the Bank and after expiry of the service contact/appointment of the present chairman, he may be made the Chairman of the Grameen Bank if he accepts it at all.//////Sir Ian Kershaw, a military historian, wrote 'Fateful Choices' about the decisions taken in the Second World War, contrasting those made in the democracies compared to those made by Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin..//////In most of the residential areas of Dhaka, a portion of the road is grabbed by the unscrupulous house owners. And perhaps Mohammadpur is the worst affected. The house owners while building their houses grab a couple of feet from the government road. Unfortunately, none is there to see it and this unlawful activity hugely contributes to the traffic jam. But if government wants, they can bulldoze these illegal structures just by one week and get the roads back to the original size. This has been possible in Mirpur recently prior to the world cup and the scenario is totally different now. Let's free all illegally grabbed areas for a better Dhaka! //////The rickshaw-pullers' revolt against the traffic policy of the government by vandalising hundreds of vehicles, causing sufferings to commuters, school children, sick and old has left the nation stunned. The general public of this country have had enough. The insufferable traffic jams cannot be addressed because the rickshaw-pullers don't want it. If governments, be it the AL, BNP, JP or Jamaat, are incapable of protecting the life and property of its citizens, then democracy has failed in this country and we should look for other alternatives. //////When Barack Obama was elected US president, I, like many others, thought he would help the Palestinians win their just rights. But he seems to be following the path of his predecessors by extending all sorts of support to Israel allowing them to do whatever they like from killing innocent unarmed Palestinians to stealing their land by building more and more Jewish settlements. This is really frustrating.//////Bangladesh, though a poor country, yet it is characterized by a vibrant parliamentary democracy, independent judiciary and election commission and a free media. In addition, the people of the country exercise all fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and the right to information. We hope our country will soon develop in all sectors. //////The French army took over Ivory Coast's main airport yesterday as the battle for Abidjan dragged into a fourth day and recognised leader Alassane Ouattara came under fire for a massacre in the west.//////Japan's nuclear crisis will have a clear impact on global efforts to fight climate change, the chief EU negotiator said yesterday as the latest round of UN talks got under way.//////Veteran Libyan diplomat Ali Treiki has resigned from official duties, Arab League sources in Cairo said yesterday, the latest in a string of officials to abandon Moamer Kadhafi's regime.//////Two people were killed and dozens injured yesterday as demonstrations erupted for a third day in Afghanistan over the burning of a Koran in the United States, officials said.//////Syrian President Bashar al-Assad asked former Agriculture minister Adel Safar to form a new government, the state-run news agency SANA reported yesterday, as communications networks failed and residents in Douma prepared to bury the first of their dead.//////Embattled Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh urged opposition yesterday to end protests demanding his departure, saying he was willing" to discuss a peaceful transition of power.//////Two suicide blasts outside a shrine in the central Pakistani province of Punjab yesterday killed 41 devotees, police and administration officials said.//////A new wave of Tunisian boat people landed yesterday at Italy's Lampedusa island, authorities said, as Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he would visit to Tunis to try to halt the arrivals.//////A collection of letters written by a young Dame Elizabeth Taylor to her first love are to be sold at auction.//////German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle is expected to quit as leader of his ailing Free Democrats in a bid to shore up support for the party and the centre-right government, reports said yesterday.//////Israel has called on the UN to cancel a report that said it possibly committed war crimes during its 2008-2009 military offensives in Gaza. //////Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev was set yesterday to stretch his rule into a third decade by scoring a crushing poll win whose scripted nature has raised alarm over democracy in the energy-rich state.//////United Arab Emirates special forces on Saturday freed an Abu Dhabi-owned ship seized by pirates east of Oman in the Arabian Sea, a military official told state news agency WAM.//////The ongoing Grand Group Art Exhibition at Saju Art Gallery [Gulshan-2, Dhaka] features a collection of 150 artworks, created by 105 artists. //////It started off as an evening full of promise for an eager audience: dance, music, drama and film celebrating the [upcoming] 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore.
