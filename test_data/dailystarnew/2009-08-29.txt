By doing so, they reaffirmed the belief of the people of this country that Bangabandhu was not only the Father of this Nation but also that what happened on the tragic night of 15 August 1975 was a crime whose final adjudication needs to be completed.//////THE term "sustainable development" seems to have reached a stage of sustainability after having been used for long. Sustainability is a word most suited, perhaps, for describing an ecosystem constituted of biota like plants, animals and microbes living in any area of the earth. But unfortunately, we -- the most destructive animal species -- did not let ecosystem thrive sustainably, rather we caused extinction of much of the biodiversity in the world, resulting in large-scale environmental degradation. //////IT was more than a storm in the tea cup. Jaswant Singh's book on Quaide Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah made more news than his expulsion from the BJP for having written the book. I have been a witness to the era of partition and before. I think Jaswant Singh has been unfair to the history. If blame is to be apportioned -- a futile exercise after 62 years -- all the three parties -- the British, the Muslim League and the Congress -- in that order, are guilty. It is a subject which academicians from both the countries should discuss across the table to go over the reasons why the two communities, Hindus and Muslims, had got so alienated from each other that

For a country still developing, still emerging out of its debris of poverty and corruption -- art and culture is thriving in Dhaka, Chittagong and other urban locations. It's quite a trend now to turn on the TV to get some 'Bollywood Masala' or to download some hits of the Billboard chart for the urbanities. But does that mean that our national flavours have taken a back seat? No way. And there is more to national flavours than just folk music. Jazz, rock, pop, fusion and all that are now found in the music scene. In this aspect, lounge music plays an important role in bringing Bangladeshi music nearer to urban Bangladeshi audience. Recently, The Daily Star spoke to one of the pioneers of lounge music, Nafis Tahsin Ahmed Shubho, who is the founder and managing director of Wireless. //////If the early reviews for "I Look to You" are any indication, Whitney Houston could be a strong contender at this year's Grammy Awards.

The US President has described him as the best Senator ever in US history. His colleagues in the Congress, which he served for close to half a century, and the ordinary people of his country saw him as the staunchest defender of liberal causes in US history. His death is thus being mourned by people from all walks of life, but more particularly by the poor, the deprived and the most downtrodden in the US. //////ON August 26, 2009 in my home in Boston, I woke up to the news that Senator Ted Kennedy had died. It was of course not an unexpected passage; the Senator had been suffering from brain cancer for over a year. But as I heard repeatedly in the countless testimonials from well-known personalities that poured into the news, it was still a difficult moment for many Americans. After all, it is difficult to be prepared for the passing away of an icon, a towering figure in the American political scene who was at the heart of so much of the progressive social legislation, from immigration to health care, that has been passed in this country since the 1960s. //////MEDIA reports about the provision of high quality technical equipment for traffic and public order management of Dhaka Metropolitan Police are welcome. The issue that occupies concerned public mind is the quality of prompt and sympathetic service from our police that should logically follow such addition of gadgets. One may perhaps not be unjustifiably apprehensive about the concomitant impact of such capital equipment as in the absence of a deeper look into the core organizational deficits not much can be expected in respect of service delivery.//////YOUR browser may not support display of this image. This is a critical time in the global fight against poverty. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty over the last decade, thanks in part to debt relief and increases in aid. Bangladesh has enjoyed consistent growth since 1990, and poverty has declined by an average of almost 2 per cent each year since 2000. //////I lend my voice of support to Prof. Shairul Mashreque's call for combating climate change (CCC) published recently in The Daily Star (Green beckoning, July 15, 2009). Unfortunately, the process of CCC is not as easy as it might appear. And, while the global community now recognises the importance and the urgency of CCC, we need to realize that even if we diligently implement all the protocols and embrace all the best practices available to control emission of greenhouse gases, the results on the earth's temperature will not be significant for at least two or three more decades. I might also add that in spite of the agreements reached at the recently concluded G-8 meeting in Italy, and the actions taken by the USA prior to that, a reduction of global warming by 1 or 2 degrees will remain an elusive goal. //////THIS paper will mainly deal with probable Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a result of construction of Tipaimukh Dam. In early nineties a study was undertaken by the government with experts to ascertain the relationship between release of water from the dam during floods and dry season with water levels in rivers in the lower riparian Bangladesh.//////BANGLADESH is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change impacts. The major impacts of climate change are, the high frequency of natural disasters (cyclones, floods and tidal surge), sea-level rise and salinity increases in soil and water, which have direct and indirect impacts on reducing the agricultural land or their productivity and biodiversity. This means, climate change has direct impact on the livelihoods as well as food security of the inhabitants of the low lying areas in the country. //////You think that with time they would have grown accustomed to it, but they never do. At least once, every day, your father says with a laugh, We hardly need the television, do we, folks next door provide enough entertainment. And your mother.

If only I had known then, she hisses, we would never have bought this house.//////This issue of ////// opens with two articles on Rabindranath. The first one, a discussion by Ali Ahmed on re-reading Rabindranath's novel ////// makes for stimulating reading. The analysis is leavened by a warm account of the experience of first reading it decades back, intermingled with his schoolboy encounters with Saratchandra - boyhood memories of books and authors that will find strong echoes among readers of a certain age. The other piece on him, //////, by Morshed S Hasan does attempt to give an 'alternative' (I believe that is the current term for such exercises!) reading of Gurudev, but not with any particular success, as witness his effort to tackle the old, but difficult, question of the absence of Muslim characters in Rabindranath's fiction. Morshed grasps at straws since Rabindranath himself never addressed the question in his voluminous writings, and attempts by others to answer this question therefore are second-hand conjectures. I am inclined to think that Muslims, either as individuals or as a community, simply did not spark the poet's imagination. I also for one would be glad to leave it at that, rather than pick at this subject incessantly in order to 'clear' up the Tagore name. If there was a 'gap' in Rabindranath's imagination, so be it. It in no way lessens his immortal legacy of wisdom, beauty and language to us by a jot. //////The first place is Assam, next door to Bangladesh. //////The river's song is slow in the evening//////After many days//////Higgledy-piggledy rise the//////Sandbanks//////Blue ink from the jungle//////Streams into the river//////In the evening//////Slow seems the river's song.//////You can't tell if they are sick or fashionable//////They simply have no hair//////Winter sees hats//////Spring...their secret//////Of being solemnly sick.//////Homes are cardboard pop-ups//////Of lazy layouts of a space-hungry age//////But there's hair all over the page...//////They are all losing hair//////Either to chemo, or to Pantene or to Thyroid.//////Scalps seen and simple//////With the tile-trapped hair//////Being sucked up by Maria @ 5 bucks an hour//////Beats Time in its ploy to freeze the curls, the black thin threads//////Into permanent dirt...//////This is how history misses out on recording//////The loss//////The fad//////The stamp//////Of an infection, a fever and a death.//////All things must come to an end.

The real relevence of this name is being understood in this twenty-first century, as the high strategic value of this vast ocean is making it a theatre of maritime dominance of the Asian powers. Today's jewels certainly are trade, influence and power, a raison d'tre for these developing countries to modernize and expand their maritime strength and broaden their sphere of strategic influence. //////THE depth of water at the berthing/anchorage area of Chittagong Port is less than 10 meter. Normally, mother vessels of present generation require 16-18 meter depth of water to berth safely. Next generation vessels (within a decade) will require 21 meter and future generation of mother vessels may require 24 meter depth of water. As such, while improving the berthing facility of Chittagong sea port, we should cater for mother vessels of the future generation. In that case the depth of water at the berthing area of deep sea port should be not less than 24 meter. //////CHINA and India face contested border issues.

The volume is the outcome of a two-day conference on Development with Equity and Justice: Immediate Tasks for the Newly Elected Government organised by the CPD in Dhaka on March 28-29, 2009. The volume contains seven articles on a broad spectrum of areas that include macroeconomic management issues, particularly in view of the global financial crisis as also sectoral issues that include food and energy security, employment generation, boro production and restructuring of the jute manufacturing sector. A distinctive feature of the volume is that it also contains reports on the discussions held on the five papers presented at the conference which provide succinct summaries of the rich exchange of ideas that took place following presentation of the papers. ////// a collection of short stories by John Updike, is like an assortment of priceless valuables.
