Over and above, the population is increasing at the rate of- 1.17% annually. So all-out effort is necessary to increase the production for self-sufficiency.//////A picture published in The Daily Star dated 03-02-10 of street beggars has drawn my attention. It is stated that the Tejgaon zone of Dhaka Metropolitan police launched a weeklong drive against street beggars in a bid to reduce petty crimes and relieve city dwellers of horrific pestering by beggars. On the first day, police picked up over 100 beggars. But as the government shelters cannot accommodate them, they were freed on the outskirts of the capital and the drive ended. Is it believable that the government cannot make accommodation for beggars while going for huge expenditures like buying duty free luxury cars for lawmakers? //////The brickfield brings easy money. But it generally degrades the environment and human health.//////An earthquake, also known as a tremor, is the consequence of a swift release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are recorded with a seismometer, also known as seismograph. The moment magnitude of an earthquake is usually reported, with scale 3 or lower earthquakes being hardly noticeable. Scale 7 causes severe damage over huge areas. Intensity of trembling is calculated on the customized scale. At the Earth's exterior, earthquakes marked themselves by trembling and from time to time displacing the soil. Whilst a hefty earthquake epicentre is positioned offshore, the seabed at times suffers ample displacement to cause a tsunami or a fatal disaster. The trembling in earthquakes can also generate landslides and sporadically volcanic commotion. Basically, in its most generic sense, the term earthquake is used to illustrate any seismic occurrence whether a natural phenomenon or an incident caused by humans that produces seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused generally by rupture of geological faults, but also by volcanic movement, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear experiments. //////Chittagong is situated on the bank of the river Karnaphuli.

As stated, the dog with a broken leg came to NRC office and started offering voluntary service through checking entry of unauthorized persons into the NRC premises by barking. This caught the attention of the officials who appointed the dog as a guard. The dog is reportedly doing a wonderful job and the NRC authorities are even considering dismissal of their night guard!//////Rahman's news report, highlighting the Trust Bank's thrust on financing the biogas sector, is good news for energy-starved Bangladesh. However, I felt that the report was to an extent incomplete to be really attractive for prospective investors or motivators who can encourage their sources in the village level to go for it. His statement, and I quote was "A beneficiary will buy four cows with the money". It would have been better to state "A beneficiary can set up a biogas plant and also buy four cows with the money". That would have been more to the point. However, no mention was made of the repayment terms and the period of repayment, which are important factors for the borrowers.//////All the achievements of the Awami League government are being overshadowed by its burden student's front-- Chhatra League. Day by day it seems to us that the AL has no control over its student body. We do not want to see this any more. When the BNP was in power or Sheikh Hasina was in jail, what did BCL do for the party? Nothing. //////BNP Chairperson Begum Zia was the country's prime minister twice and now she is leader of the opposition in parliament. //////An educational institution is the place where students come for study and research activities.

Playing down the incident, she went so far as to say that this kind of incident happens. I think such an insensitive and partisan home minister has no right to stay in office any longer. Having banished all other parties from the scene, the BCL now fights among its own factions and our law enforcing agencies are continuing to give the ruling party a wide berth and in most cases acting like party activists. //////The print media on 4 February and the electronic media the day before had two lead news items which nobody wanted to see. One was concerning the tragic death of a kid under the wheels of a reckless bus and the other one was of the death of an innocent Dhaka University student falling victim to student politics. //////Dr. Toufique Chowdhury (54 years old) passed away on Saturday at 1:00am, February 6, 2010 at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Los Angeles.

They protested against injustice in any form.//////The national university authorities have taken an appropriate decision about first year honours admission in 2009-2010.

The events have been initiated by Pandit Tanmoy Bose, an internationally renowned musician, who has played with great maestros like Ravi Shankar and George Harrison. //////Far too often political leaders give short shrift to weighty questions. The home minister, for example, said the other day that the killing of an innocent Dhaka University student during a recent fratricidal mayhem among the Student League was "no matter", "ota kono byapar na." The minister for agriculture's recent sharp response to questions on the government's ability to utilise foreign funds does not exactly fit in that category of injudicious talks, but bears an uncanny family resemblance. //////Is it a coincidence that the attack on Chhatra League at Rajshahi University took place in the month of February, a month that we revere as Ekushey, a month that we remember for the BDR carnage? Is it a coincidence that Islamic Chhatra Shibir (ICS) dared to unleash an unprovoked attack on the student wing of the party in power immediately after the Fifth Amendment was annulled, which gave rise to the possibility of the extinction of religion-based politics? Is it a coincidence that the dumping of the dead body strikes a raw nerve that reminds one of the mutilation of the bodies of valiant officers who led different campaigns against the ex-Jamaati, Bangla bhai, and his men?//////A year has passed since President Barack Obama took office. Starting with the health reform, he embarked on an ambitious agenda. A year later, except for the passage of the stimulus package that saved Wall Street from financial collapse, his agenda remains in tatters. //////
