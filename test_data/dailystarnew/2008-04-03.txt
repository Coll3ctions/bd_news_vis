He has informed UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon of a growing sentiment in favour of a trial of war criminals in Bangladesh. That is a positive reflection of the thinking that appears to have come into government circles and surely will resonate with the people of the country. Additionally, the adviser's belief that Bangladesh's people will welcome the involvement of the world body in the trial only demonstrates the government's acknowledgement of the public demand for such a trial. It also reinforces our growing faith in the machinery of international law to bring to justice those who perpetrated the war crimes of 1971.//////AS a people we are forgetful. We forget a good turn done us by a friend as easily as we forget the transgressions committed against us. While the latter paints us in a good light, the former may cast us in the category of the ingrates. What is even worse is that we not only forget the benefaction, we suffer no qualms whatsoever in denying that the assistance was ever rendered at all. And this is what has happened insofar as the Indian contribution to our Liberation War is concerned. We have done everything to wipe out any reference of India to our liberation, particularly of the Indian soldiers, and any attempt to make amends for the error is castigated as anti-national. //////IN spite of the pledges of dalbhat that the alliance government made in its election manifesto in 2001, the grand plan remained an illusion.

It can no longer be ignored and allowed to go out of hand; for it directly relates to availability of drinking water for the large urban population of Dhaka.//////In Bangladesh, there are many types of core problems! One of these is malnutrition. Poverty is the major cause of malnutrition which results from inadequate intake of foods. That means it is mainly prevalent among poor children. The usual saying is that 'poverty is a curse', especially in developing countries. Actually it's not a curse, the main curse is our mentality. This curse can be overcome if the affluent realise that they have a duty towards society. //////Consumption of potato as an alternative staple for our country is really a good idea. You can find tons of statistics on its use in the western world as staple food.//////Far from the motherland and thousands of miles away, here in Fiji (popularly known as Paradise on the earth) we, a few Bangladeshis, celebrated the 37th Independence Day with great zeal and enthusiasm.

The answer to all is a resounding no! //////I wholeheartedly welcome the judicious decision of the Chief Adviser of the caretaker government of Bangladesh to amend the existing legal framework on dual citizenship of Bangladeshi Britons, so that they no longer have to forfeit Bangladeshi citizenship as soon as they become British citizens, unless they want to relinquish it voluntarily. Not having to reapply for retaining the Bangladeshi citizenship will, doubtless, be a privilege for the first generation Bangladeshi Britons to avert a bureaucratic quagmire replete with requirements, that oftentimes discourage them from venturing beyond a no visa-required (NVR) seal duly stamped on their host country passport before visiting the sending country as veritable outsiders looking in. It may, very well, generate a sense of entitlement among the post-immigrant generation in the Bangladeshi Diaspora and facilitate them to develop a transnational social field incorporating their country of origin.

While the people of this ruined country waited last night for their electoral voice to be heard, reports from high-level talks between aides of Robert Mugabe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai suggested they were edging closer to accomplishing the previously impossible.//////Signalling that it is ready for a showdown with President Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's new government has said "extra-constitutional steps" taken by him during emergency rule last year are not part of the Constitution as parliament is yet to endorse them.//////Democratic leaders returned from their spring break this week to declare that Iraq is in turmoil and that they will continue to try to force President Bush to end the war.

Apart from these are faces of slum children and bathing working women. Out of simple themes he creates something moving and beautiful.//////I first met Justice Murshed, most probably in the mid-fifties, at a national seminar where issues like interrelationship between nationalism and culture were discussed and debated. He spoke brilliantly. His talk displayed his firm grasp on many dimensions of the subject, intellectual breadth and range, and ability to develop his point of view through lucid logical arguments bolstered by quotations from great writers from several languages, many erudite references and wonderfully felicitous phrases. It was a treat to listen to him. One could easily see that he was interested in the subject he spoke. He spoke seriously and with conviction, and that there was true learning. I was also a participant in the seminar, and later he complimented me on my paper. It was most gracious of him and a source of encouragement to me.//////BEFORE discussing women's empowerment, let us glance over some facts on the economic and political decision-making status of women worldwide. Only 1% of the world's assets are in the name of women. Men in Arab states have 3.5 times the purchasing power of their female counterparts. 70% people in abject poverty across the world -- living on less than $1per day -- are women. Women's participation in managerial and administrative work is around 33% in the developed world, 15% in Africa, and 13% in Asia/Pacific. //////WITH over 60% of the Bangladesh labour force being employed in agriculture, accounting for 35% of the national GDP, it is a tragic irony that hunger and poverty are highest among those who grow food. //////SHAHIDUL Haque (who used the pseudonym, Shahidul Zahir), Secretary-in-Charge, Hill Tracts Affairs, passed away last March 23 at the age of 55, due to a cardiac arrest. //////Three five-storey buildings have been constructed at Chittagong Central Jail to ease the congestion of prisoners to a great extent.//////The finance ministry and the housing and public works ministry are at loggerheads over approval of the new organisational structure (organogram) of Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) with a full-fledged planning wing.//////Speakers at a discussion underscored the need for increasing cultural activities at regional level throughout the country and patronising the artistes working at grassroots level for developing the national culture and heritage.//////
