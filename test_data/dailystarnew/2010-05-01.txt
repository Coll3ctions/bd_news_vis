That these men called forth the courage to let their employers know and then let the world know that the pursuit of happiness in life came from sharing in the resources of the earth is a tale we celebrate this morning.

The Knights of Labour could successfully forge strong solidarity among the working classes all over the world by upholding its motto "an injury to one is the concern of all." //////THE spirit of May Day lies in the establishment of the basic rights of the working class.

This earthquake caused huge landslides in the Himalayas, estimated at about 45 billion cubic meter. Within a few years, most of the debris generated from the landslides entered into the Brahmaputra river through numerous tributaries in Assam. The fine fraction of sediment mainly consisting of silt and clay very quickly transported through the Brahmaputra/Jamuna river and deposited in the Meghna estuary area. It moved through the river slowly like a sand wave and caused significant changes in river morphology. Some recent research (by this writer) describes the responses of the rivers through widening and increasing of erosive capacity during the propagation of the sand wave. That was the main reason why the erosion along the Jamuna and Padma rivers was higher in the 1980s and 1990s than in the previous and later periods. //////IT is widely acknowledged that the negative effects of climate change are likely to hit the poorest in the poorest countries hardest.

The 'Zarigan' audience was cautioned that 'time is short (as climate is changing) and all must act before time runs out'.//////This Saturday we continue on with the Writers Block interpretations on beginnings. //////THIS eminently sound advice was proclaimed by Richard Ford in his book ////// (1847). Darkwood elaborates: Unless you are particularly agile, my recommendation is: If your eyes need massaging, then try rubbing them with somebody else's elbows instead. The chapter on 'Hostilities and Personal Security' cautions us as follows: No amount of prowess shown at the fathers' egg-and-spoon race at the school sports day can prepare you to outrun a cheetah, for example. Well, current perception of what constitutes 'hostilities and personal security' and the ensuing terror - is more likely to present itself in the form of today's body search and tomorrow's body scan all in the name of war on terror. This purchase left me CA$6.99 out of pocket versus its original pricing at CA$24.95.//////Whether and when to pull out or not the wisdom teeth  the debate still goes on.

However, the war-winning hero General Sarat Fonseka, the former army chief is in military custody on sedition charge.

The general apprehension is since the president has ordered the court marshal of his top general he is not letting General Fonseka go scot-free with his military rank and popular image untouched.//////THE Nuclear Security Summit discussed the safety and security of nuclear materials, and preventing its proliferation to non-state actors who could use them for terrorist purposes. While the al Qaeda was clearly identified, the Washington summit made references to the Iranians being the main problem. Iran, a signatory of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has been repeatedly condemned by the West for developing an illegal nuclear weapons program. The international community's concerns are accentuated by Iran's documented state patronage of terror groups like the Hamas and Hezbollah. India cannot dismiss these fears due to its own problems with jihadis in the subcontinent. Iran's linkage to Pakistani rogue nuclear scientist, AQ Khan, has further added to Indian concerns with the Iranian nuclear program. The Iranians have rejected these allegations. Accusing countries opposing their nuclear ambitions as hypocritical and organizing summits designed to humiliate people; Tehran launched its own nuclear summit titled Nuclear energy for all, nuclear weapons for none.

Sternberg presents a synthesis of intelligence, creativity, and wisdom in his book Wisdom, Intelligence, and Creativity Synthesized. He carefully examines each of these three domains and reviews the background work on them. Then he presents his own theories of intelligence, creativity and wisdom, which are sufficiently supported with research done by him and his associates. His theories are particularly useful for teachers who want to play significant roles to help their students become intelligent, creative and wise. Sternberg's theories of wisdom can be linked to the issue of social justice because wise people, according to him, should work toward a common good. //////A beautiful woman with flaxen hair, cornflower blue eyes and the most generous mouth, Christine Winters held an aura of mystery that drew men towards her like flies to honey. She had three men who sought her from the very early days of her growing up years. Ronnie, strange and quiet, wanted her in his own way without any words. Don was the rough and rugged and he made it a point to let her know that he would possess her one day. And there was Sam, a person who lived in the closest harmony with her and yet never spoke out of his dreams. It is said that a beautiful woman never finds peace of heart in true love for men fall for her only for the sake of physical beauty. Christine was a living example to the truth of this saying.//////
