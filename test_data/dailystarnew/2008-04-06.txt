With the state of overall education being a live public issue for the past many years, this latest bit of information only reveals what should have been obvious to all and why action on it should have been taken earlier. We cannot but begin doing that by noting the scarce or non-existent classroom interaction between teachers and pupils at present. And that is precisely where the problems begin. With such a staggering number of holidays, 137 days to be exact (apart from unscheduled ones owing to political agitation, natural calamities and the like), such interaction can only be wishful thinking. Whatever classroom engagement there is at present is abysmally low and does not even come up to regional standards.//////The impetuous raising of price of newsprint by local manufacturers goes down as a bad example of market manipulation in absence of any competition. Clearly, the manufacturer has cashed in on its hold on the monopoly market. The cost of newsprint accounts for 50 percent of the total cost of production of a newspaper; therefore, the price hike has actually struck at the core of the industry. We fail to understand when the previously imposed 30 percent duty on imported newsprint has been drastically reduced by the government, why must the local manufacturers take such arbitrary decision on grounds that are not justifiable. We protest the move with the strongest of words.//////CRIME and punishment have attracted the attention of the people from the dawn of history. While in the earlier years punishment was more connected with scriptures, the advent of modernism gave rise to the recognition by humanity that it is responsible for law, both political and moral, and, by extension, the state of the world. Even the constitution of the Nuremberg Tribunal was criticised on the grounds that without law to fit the cases the Tribunal would essentially pronounce ex-post facto political judgment. //////THE rich are different from you and me; they have the same airport. The first casualty of globalisation is identity. Every airport in the developed, or wannabe-developed, world looks the same: a confusion of corridors, conveyer belts, junk shops and a profusion of winding queues at immigration. You can recognise a nation from the look in the queues. There is faintly hidden arrogance on the faces of officials in receiving countries, and barely-disguised relief in the manner of passengers chasing some better horizon than their native land can provide. Delhi is somewhere in the middle, there is both ebb and flow. //////NEPAL is set for the landmark elections on April 10, with all eyes set on the voting that comes following a phase of uncertainty and instability, promising a new chapter for the nation. Contending parties have great stakes in the polls, and the balloting has special significance -- rather than just producing victors and vanished. The election atmosphere has already been marred by an acrimonious climate, and violence has raised fears. However, just ahead of the voting, things by and large still look conducive for a credible election. The electioneering has reached a crescendo, with all keeping their fingers crossed about the shape of things to come.//////While his predecessor loved to say during the last year of his tenure that the players should go into a one-day match with win in their mind, Jamie Siddons only hopes that his charges show some improvement.//////The executive committee of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) meet at the federation headquarters today to discuss election issues.//////South Africa Cricket Academy batsman Reeza Hendricks rode Nazmul Hossain's fiery spell to score a brilliant 131 on the second day of the four-day match against GP-BCB National Cricket Academy at the Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore yesterday.//////Rajbari, Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Khulna and Pabna advanced to the quarterfinals of the Pepsi Women's inter-district volleyball tournament by winning their respective matches at the Volleyball stadium yesterday.//////South Africa relied on their pacemen's disciplined performances to thrash India by an innings and 90 runs on the third day of the second Test here on Saturday.//////Sri Lanka clawed their way back into the second Test on Friday, snapping up six West Indies wickets in the final session to leave the match finely balanced.//////Newcomer Sewnarine Chattergoon has recognised the calming influence West Indies captain Chris Gayle brought to his first innings in Test cricket against Sri Lanka on Friday.//////Ishant Sharma is set to undergo a fitness test at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore on Sunday in order to determine his availability for the third Test against South Africa in Kanpur, which starts on April 11.

A reasonably well-off farmer in Baiddya Bari village in Fulbaria, Mymensingh district, he has been using hybrid seeds for the last five years in almost 7 acres of the total 9 acres he has. "I am worried if I am risking my children's farming prospects in the coming years. What will they do if seeds become unaffordable in the future, says Latif, lost in thoughts about the financial security of his family, even as the country grapples with low yields and a rising population. //////As I checked in at the Taj President, Mumbai, the smiling receptionist handed me the forms to fill in. I was tired, having awoken early to catch the flight to Mumbai, and of course the one and half hour drive to the hotel added to the weariness. The smile lifted the spirits as I looked around wearily.

So banning student politics may not be healthy for the nation at all. In the last few months a number of so-called intellectuals and non-intellectuals have written, arguing against student politics. The reality is that when big boys ''and big girls'' have failed to understand our politics and economics, it is the students who have shown them the way through theory and practice. There is definitely no question of using weapons, but why should student politics be banned to degrade intellectual and creative ideas? The same point applies in the case of teachers' politics as well. //////With April in place and a heated climate ahead, the menace of load shedding threatens to cripple life in Chittagong. The fluctuation in the supply is causing untold sufferings to people. With that has come the other danger, price hike of essential commodities, which adds to the peril people face. //////Those of us who recall the pre-mobile phone days will remember that it was quite something to have a telephone at home. People who did not would approach their neighbours if they needed to make calls. Some people would put their phones in boxes with secure locks on them. Nowadays anybody can have a mobile phone. But the self-important feeling of having a phone still remains. We are so much conscious of our phones and pay so much attention to them that it makes us forget simple manners and our respect for others. We see important people at important meetings stop or disturb the proceedings by answering calls on their mobile phones. With heads lowered they whisper unimportant things while keeping others waiting. //////Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla stadium is known as the home of cricket. Bangladesh Cricket Board has full, permanent control over that ground. As a result it is better placed to work for development of our cricket. //////I am an expatriate Indian Muslim working in Bangladesh for the last two years. Everyday I read articles about conditions on Bangladesh, especially about its worsening power and water situation and how nothing is being done to bring about a change in the situation.//////I am writing in response to the letter (April 2, 2008) from Dan Rees.//////I thank Syed Badrul Ahsan for his article, Our 1971, our allies and our truths (The Daily Star, April 4). I completely agree with him that we cannot deny the valuable contributions of the Indians during our liberation war. And hence the government, in inviting the Indian generals recently, has shown a great gesture. We cannot forget that in that time of distress, horror and unimaginable plight, it was the Indians who provided us with the necessary support. Had it not been for their help, we may have had to endure greater ordeal. //////Much is being said and done (?) about reducing the levels of graft-- an epidemic in Bangladesh! Definitely resisting graft is our moral fight, as reported by your Satkhira correspondent on 23rd March. //////It is certainly a matter of shame. Women in Bangladesh are not safe, though it is the 21st century. A report in a national daily on March 27, 2008 revealed that Taslima, who had been violated by a mill owner, died in hospital. If we look deeper, we can see that some very common factors have fuelled this incident. //////As good citizens of Dhaka, we all believe in a healthy environment, but often we sacrifice this by using too much water to keep our cars clean. Of course, we all want to have clean cars. However, do we realise that keeping our cars clean means using up a great deal of water? Even though cars get dirty quickly in Dhaka, if we save water, we will have more to use for households and businesses and maintain a green environment. We propose that the Dhaka city authorities enact a law relating to people washing their cars only one day in a week. But you might say, I want my car clean for a fancy occasion." You can plan your week to wash your car on the day of the event so it is clean the day you go to the special occasion. Even though windows may get dusty often, you can use your window wipers to clean them without wasting extra water.//////We know that trees are the elements which produce oxygen (O2) and at the same time absorb carbon dioxide (CO2). They thus balance the O2 and CO2 in the environment, which is very important for human beings and animals as well. But in Dhaka city, the number of plants and trees is coming down to zero gradually. We need O2 but we live in CO2. So, I suggest that we grow plants and small and medium sized trees on every roof in Dhaka irrespective of whether they are privately or government-owned. I also propose that we make it compulsory. At first people should be motivated. After that, perhaps from 1 January 2009, some penalty may be imposed on those who ignore the matter. A minimum number of trees must be grown as per space available on the roof of a building. In this way we can get some more O2. Without O2 we cannot but die.//////Nepal's government began air patrols yesterday and deployed thousands of police nationwide ahead of key polls planned for next week that will likely abolish the world's last Hindu monarchy. //////Zimbabwe opposition chief Morgan Tsvangirai claimed outright victory yesterday in presidential elections and warned that Robert Mugabe's ruling party would resort to violence to cling to power. //////President Bush celebrated Nato's expansion into former communist territory yesterday and urged further enlargement, highlighting differences with Moscow hours before final talks with outgoing Russian President Vladimir Putin.//////Political reforms in Pakistan are not only good for the country but also beneficial for US interests in the region, says the US State Department.//////Iran said yesterday it would not make any concession in exchange for incentives offered by the West to halt sensitive atomic activities. //////The United States says its stalled civil nuclear deal with India could still be done before President George W.

The protests by a few religious clerics surrounding the declaration of the policy by the chief advisor give rise to suspicions of political machinations. The responses of some members of the advisory council also suggest, at the least, a lack of cohesiveness or coordination in decision making by the Council of Advisors. These events have diverted us from considering the content of the policy and its continuity with previous state commitments, and from formulating an action plan.//////FOOD security, of late, has become a major concern for the country's intelligentsia and policymakers in the wake of unusual price hike of food items in domestic and international markets. The price hike is said to be the outcome of the reported slump in production of food items globally. However, there was no report of total unavailability of food items in the international market. //////MOST Bangladeshis do not know that two famous playback singers of Hindi movies in the 1950s and 1960s, the late Geeta Dutt and Suman Kalyanpur, are Bangladeshi natives.
