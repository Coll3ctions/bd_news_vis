The reason is simple: rarely in the past has a British cabinet minister, or for that matter any high profile western visitor, been as candid as Ms. Smith. The issue she talked about in Dhaka is one that demands the closest attention. The possible global links between terrorist groups are matters that have persistently exercised minds in Bangladesh at various levels of government and also among the general public.//////A prominent Bangla daily brings into focus the fact that despite food and employment crises, some 13 thousand metric tonnes of rice allotted under test relief and food-for-work programmes remain stacked in government godowns.

Those who are new to the game of semantics, please note that it's an excellent example of how all the right things can be said in the wrong context.//////THE November 2008 US presidential election is still eight months down the line, and yet people around the world are attuned to the primary election process in which two candidates are heading for a showdown in the Democratic party's August convention in Denver, with the prospect of unelected super-delegates deciding the eventual nominee a process that the party is trying to circumvent. //////THE higher prices of rice have rattled consumers and governments across Asia.

It appears the rice producing countries of this region are no longer capable of producing the quantity of rice required for feeding the ever increasing population, forcing them to stop their rice export. Re-fixation of the export price of rice at $1000 per ton abruptly, instead of $500, by India is a glaring example of how alarming the situation is. The cost of rice if imported at this rate will be not less than Tk.80 per kg. which the people of this country will never be able to buy. Undoubtedly, Bangladesh is going to be the worst affected country as it needs to feed over 150 million people whose staple food is rice, a large portion of which is imported. Therefore, it is high time short and long-term strategies are formulated and measures adopted to tackle the situation before it is too late. //////Acid throwing is one of the worst crimes.

Everybody believes that the war criminals who committed crimes against humanity during 1971 liberation war will finally face trial.//////It is nice to see erudite people belonging to the civil society taking note on the on going anti-corruption campaign and the processions etc. They can also take a stroll down the not so civil part of the city where children are burning under the scorching sun in the never ending line of BDR shops. If the mindless and overzealous jihad against corruption could be driven with some sanity and common sense, instead of making a media circus, these children could attend school, instead of saving some precious money for their poor parents. The advisers always preach transparency and accountability. Charity should begin at home!//////Rice is a staple that mainly supply carbohydrates in our diet. Milled rice has a high glycemic index and a poor source of quality nutrients such as essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Potatoes on the other hand are nutritionally much superior to rice. It contains nutritionally important vitamins, minerals and some important essential amino acids making its protein higher in quality compared to rice. Usually a medium potato (150g/5.3 oz) with the skin provides 27 mg vitamin C (45% of the Daily Value (DV), 620 mg of potassium (18% of DV), 0.2 mg vitamin B6 (10% of DV) and trace amounts of riboflavin, niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc. The fibre contents of a potato is almost equal to many whole grain breads, pastas, and cereals. It is an important component for heart-wise diet. In addition to vitamins, minerals and fibre, potatoes also contain many phytochemicals, such as carotenoids and polyphenols which were shown to have anti-cancer properties. Since potatoes are a good source of potassium with low sodium content, it reduces the risk of high blood pressure and stroke. //////Reading your reports about the difficulty of staffing and equipping rural hospitals reminded me of one of the better ideas to come out of Communist Russia - that every medical student whose training had been paid for by the state should spend the first two years of his or her professional life serving in the villages.//////We are expatriate students or you might say the most hardworking class of Bangladeshis. I came to this 'land of opportunity' (Australia) about four years ago. I came alone. //////We the people of Bangladesh depend on rice to feed ourselves. But the prices of rice along with other commodities are increasing rapidly. If this situation goes on one day the country will face a famine. A few days ago, a news report was published in various newspapers that the government was going to buy some new luxury cars for the advisers and the DC's. The decision came as a shock to us because the country is passing through a crisis. According to Dr. Akbar Ali Khan(Chairman of RRC) the money which will be spent for buying the luxury vehicles could be used to decrease the prices of rice and other household commodities. //////I believe the time has come to have a lively and frank discussion to understand the meaning of war criminal.

It is a place for trade and business. //////Most of the students do not understand what the real meaning of life is. I personally do not agree that it is very essential to study hard and get established--otherwise life will be doomed. In fact, these types of ideas compel a student to remain confined to one single world.

That would never be the case in Dhaka... they wailed, which roughly translated meant so much better they keep mega-malls open way late, in the hope that a few customers (like us) MIGHT go on an unplanned shopping frenzy...! All my explanations on energy conservation, examples of major cities from London to Bangkok to Singapore to New York where the evening rule applies, fell on deaf years. I can imagine their plight now since starting from February last year, the evening closures rule descended on Dhaka also. //////Sand sculptures -- the most common being sandcastles -- are an inseparable part of the beach culture around the globe.
