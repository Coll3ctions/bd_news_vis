But it cannot unilaterally take any action. Hence the onus is on the finance ministry and not BB. //////Two news items, recently carried in a leading Bangla daily, have brought to light massive financial, academic and administrative irregularities at Jagannath University.

Instead of healthy food, we are always giving them contaminated food which is very harmful to their health. I think this problem is not less important than Padma bridge. The government should stop the sale of formalin and other poisonous chemicals to laymen. If our industries need to use formalin, they should buy it from the government. And the government should sell these chemicals only to the designated persons of the industries. The government should also check that no harmful chemical is smuggled to Bangladesh from India.

But the consumers are not getting the benefit of lower price in the international market as yet. Is it not a sign of informal syndication of sugar refiners?

This is unacceptable because the place is not reserved for political or religious programmes. Bangladesh is a country of religious harmony, and we would like to see a peaceful celebration of Durga Puja. But does that mean the youth will have to suffer? There should be some designated places to build stages for Durga Puja. This way the children will have to suffer no more.//////We were greatly dismayed to hear the news that the United Arab Emirates has temporarily stopped issuing any kind of visa to Bangladeshis. Bangladesh received remittance worth around $ 12.84 billion in last fiscal year.

So the UAE government's step is very harmful for Bangladesh. The prime minister should immediately visit the United Arab Emirates and discuss the matter of national importance with the UAE authorities. We humbly request the government to take urgent steps on the matter.//////On October 14, 2012 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina unveiled the 3G service of Teletalk at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre saying that the government has made much progress in implementing its vision of "digital Bangladesh."

This is precisely what a recent art exhibition in the metropolitan's Gulshan area has endeavored to accomplish. The group art exhibition titled The Stilled Journey of Life was inaugurated on October 12 at the Institute of Art and Culture (IAC), a social advocacy institution that aims to use visual art as a tool of communication. The general theme of this art exhibition is to address and successfully depict the stillness of our lives caused by one of the inescapable issues afflicting our metropolis -- the debilitating traffic situation.//////Star Cineplex offers film lovers with the latest blockbuster from the Spider-Man franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man. The 3D movie that features Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man releases from today. //////What is the difference between a shopping trolley and a vice-chancellor? The original joke in Robert Wiseman collection says the shopping trolley has a mind of its own. If you ask that question to any student of Jagannath University today, he or she will readily disagree.

Every five years we choose the leader of the government and that of the opposition. The chariot or the 'can' is rolled on the highway till it stops. Theoretically, we are supposed to be either the beneficiary or the sufferer of their performances. Practically, we have suffered more than we have gained from their leaderships. This is a reflection on us as voters for the choice we made and the consequences we face of their deeds on which we exercise little or no control whatsoever till the very end of the term.//////I remember that day so well. It was a hot and humid Thursday. To be exact, it was July 20, 2000. I was with Mr. Hul Pany, the Chief of Protocol, a rotund happy diplomat. We drove into the palace grounds less than a minute before 11 am with the driver of the state limousine effortlessly easing to a halt at right angles to a ceremonial guard of honour.
