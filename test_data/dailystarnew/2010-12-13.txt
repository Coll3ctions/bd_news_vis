The losses incurred due to destruction and vandalism inside the factory has been immense. Not only were factories subjected to the wrath of the workers, the trouble also spilled on to the streets.

This situation is absolutely unacceptable. //////The good news about climate and its changing patterns and how nations cope with it is that there is fresh new ground for hope. What has transpired in Cancun is something quite removed from the stalemate and chaos which descended on Copenhagen at this time last year. Where miffed and shocked negotiators simply could not understand why nothing was working in Copenhagen, this time around matters appear to be rather under control. There is certainly nothing of the dramatic sort that has occurred in Cancun, of course, but after Copenhagen there appears to have been a conscious effort made toward avoiding the old mistakes.//////If the 3-1 series win over Zimbabwe was the ideal end to 2010 the Tigers had hoped for, the upshot of this success is far more important as they approach the home stretch of their World Cup preparations.//////When Tamim Iqbal goes after a spinner, skipping forward, eyes fixed on the immediate left and right of the sightscreen, he uses his full body weight to hit the ball as hard as possible and as far as it is permitted. The shot, admittedly one of his main weapons in his early days of international cricket, is an act of violence when you're the targeted spinner, a cause for nerves if you are at long-on or long-off and a reason to be joyful if you are in the crowd waiting for it to, with a bit of luck, fall in your hands.//////If you consider its location among chemical factories in one desolate corner of the city, the smell of fumes in its air, the unfinished eastern galleries and the thick seaside grass, there isn't much right about the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.//////The Wills World Cup in 1996 was the sixth cricket World Cup and the second to be held in the Indian subcontinent, with India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka co-hosting the showpiece event.//////Bangladesh's golfing sensation Siddikur Rahman bounced back in the fourth and final round but only to improve his position to finish joint 19th in the 300,000-dollar Johnnie Walker Cambodian Open at the Phokeethra Country Club yesterday.//////Bangladesh have been awarded the rights to host the 2012 Asia Cup Cricket yesterday after an executive committee meeting of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) at the Hotel Raddison in the city.//////The biggest footballing extravaganza for women in South Asia got underway at the seaside city of Cox's Bazar yesterday amidst much enthusiasm, fanfare, and some disorganization in the presence of the high priests of Asian and domestic football.//////Manchester City moved up to second place in the Premier League on Saturday with a 3-1 victory at West Ham as Newcastle beat Liverpool by the same score to get new manager Alan Pardew's reign off to a dream start.//////A brace by Sergio Aguero led Atletico Madrid to a 2-0 victory over Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday to put them back on track in the hunt for a European place following rivals Villarreal's shock 1-0 defeat by nine-man Getafe.//////German league leaders Dortmund picked up their seventh-straight win on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Bremen, while Bayern Munich were boosted by midfield star Bastian Schweinsteiger committing to the club until 2016. //////Bayern Munich fans had double cause to celebrate Saturday's 3-0 home win over St Pauli as Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger announced he had signed a contract extension until 2016.//////Nepal thrashed Maldives 6-0 in the opening match of the SAFF Women's Football Championship at the Cox's Bazar Zilla Stadium yesterday.

A rational figure could be Tk.500 for first offence, and for subsequent offence, say Tk.1000 may be a reasonable figure! //////The recent tilting of high-rise buildings in Dhaka and Chittagong reminds us of the weak foundation of the BNP. It is tottering at the very foundation under its current leadership. Many of its top leaders have deserted the party, or have been thrown out. (Syed Badrul Ahsan's col. in the DS of 24th Nov)//////Mahatma Gandhi once remarked, Those who hate others ultimately end up hating themselves. Pakistanis have proved that Gandhi was right. Pakistanis are supposed to be Muslims and yet the Sunni Muslims are slaughtering the Shia Muslims and vice versa.//////I would request the minister who commented 'Yunus is corrupt' to apologise not only to Dr. Yunus but also to the whole nation. He should look at himself and his party-men and only then comment about someone who at least brightens the name of the country. The newspapers that ran the headlines, 'Yunus siphoning off money' should also be held to account because there were no hints in the news under those headlines that Prof. Yunus pocketed the amount. //////Recently I came to know about two verdicts of the High Court on the issue of challenging the legality of new admission rules disqualifying the undergraduate applicants who did not studied 200 marks in English.

My purpose is to try to focus on a wider perspective -- the Malaysian model of democracy and development. //////Something is pretty troubling about the way America treats foreigners. It is understandable that the country will be concerned about its security, especially against a background of the tragedy which happened in September 2001. It is not understandable, though, why every non-American must be considered a potential terrorist, a purveyor of some of the most sinister ideas in the world. //////
