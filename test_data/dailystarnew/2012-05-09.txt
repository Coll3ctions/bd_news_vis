Money and muscle power have taken control of our politics. The political parties give more attention to money and muscle power to maintain their grip over the country.

I think some organised gangs are behind this. But unfortunately, there is no one to look after the problem. Recently, my wife was pickpocketed at Arong at Asad Gate.
