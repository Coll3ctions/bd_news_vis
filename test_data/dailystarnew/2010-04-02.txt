The pictures of young boys peppered in white powder in yesterday's issue of this newspaper tell us a tale that we wish were not there at all. And we say that because of all the endless litany of sadness we have come across all these years about the sufferings of the poor and the helpless. As our report puts it, one could be quite mistaken into thinking that these boys had just come through a snowfall. The truth is something else: they happen to be working for a balloon factory all day and well into the evening for a pittance, which means something between Tk. 150 and Tk. 300 a week at 14 hours a day. If ever there was reason to imagine man's inhumanity to his fellow beings, here it is. And don't let go of the fact that these boys are of an age when they should be playing with the balloons rather than helping to manufacture them. Such are the economic compulsions that often lay lives waste in this country.//////JUST how something so thoughtless, short-sighted and wasteful a project in brick, mortar and rods could be implemented across rivers and canals baffles one to no end!

Finally, the bees left the place but some examinees lost at least 20 minutes of their exam hour.//////First of all, congratulations for your four page special issue of March 24th highlighting the murderous vehicles and unlicensed drivers let loose in the streets of Dhaka! People die or are maimed for life; families are destroyed, the wage earner cut-down bringing untold misery for the family. Meanwhile, the killer driver at most has to suffer three years imprisonment if caught. Normally, he will obtain bail, and get lost to carry on his killer career in another city or town in Bangladesh!//////With the beginning of noxious summer load shedding has returned. We understand that there are problems which cannot be addressed overnight. But suffering masses should feel their hard days are coming to an end. With a few years outside the country, I am living in Dhaka since December 1971. Saw all the government handling the issues in the way they think right. But some of the problems became complicated than cured.//////I agree with the recent comment made by Mr. Olav Seim of UNESCO on the quality of primary and secondary education in Bangladesh. One of the major challenges in education sector in Bangladesh, for that matter in many Asian developing countries, is how to improve the quality of learning. We have been quite successful, mostly with the assistance of donors and government's commitment to increase the enrolment in primary and secondary level (the demand side). Our major focus should now be to find ways to reduce the level of dropout and improving quality of education to contribute to developing a good pool of human capital. One important way we may achieve this goal is through enhancing the student engagement in the learning process which is seriously lacking in our culture of education. Through the strategy of student engagement, the students will enjoy the learning and they will do it in a much more qualitative way than what they learn in the conventional, supply-driven and teacher-cantered learning environment. As the students enjoy learning in this way, the level of dropout will naturally fall. This means we have to work in the supply segment (capacity building of educators) and the environment side (policy and socio-cultural level). Our curriculum should be designed in such a way that it is updated and articulates the right learning objectives, output, pedagogy, assessment and, most importantly, the alignment of all these so that the students can see how it is going to contribute to the development of good human capital who will be able to use the learning to address the challenges they would face. In ensuring this learning environment, we also work on building the capacity of educators so that they are able to create the learning environment in which the student engagement is enhanced. The policy makers' vision is paramount in this case. They should pay high attention to facilitate changing the culture and environment of our learning and teaching.//////Bangladesh is a country of rich cultural heritage. Art and Music form an integral part of our life. Unfortunately, efforts to project the same to the music lovers and art connoisseurs have been frustrating so far. The people are deprived of entertainment. Anybody looking for traditional Bangla songs or dances will be totally disappointed since there are no permanent arrangements for the purpose. The other day I felt embarrassed as I could not find any such place for our foreign visitors. The tourists are totally disappointed and confused and leave our country with a poor image. It may be mentioned that all the big cities including those of the neighbouring countries boast of regular Cultural Nights depicting their culture and tradition. Tourists travelling through those cities even for a few hours are able to appreciate the rich cultural heritage. In our country, such shows are limited to some occasions only like Pahela Baishak, Rabindra Jayanti or on anniversary of some academic institutes/socio-cultural organizations. May I take this opportunity to request the Ministry of Sports and Cultural Affairs as well as private socio-cultural bodies to arrange Cultural Nights on a regular basis at least in Dhaka. Similar shows may be arranged at Chittagong, Rangamati and Cox's Bazaar initially on fixed days of the week. This initiative will also open windows to hunt otherwise hidden talents. Such arrangement will also provide as a source of entertainment in our monotonous life. There are scores of theatre houses/auditoriums across the country lying abandoned throughout the year. Fashion houses are mushrooming in great numbers. I hope they too will come forward and fulfil the vacuum in our socio-cultural arena.//////Monipur High School is located at Barabagh under Mirpur-2, Dhaka-1216. Two of my children are studying there. To drop them in the school every day we use a sub-lane located at the entrance road of a residential area. People from the adjacent areas use the approach road to go to Monipur School to drop their children. This is a very busy connecting road between Monipur and Barabagh. At the starting point of the approach road a local leader and his son have set up a wielding shop and few other shops and tea-stalls. The wielding worker does his work on the road which belongs to the city corporation. They occupy at least 20-30% road space keeping their wielding materials on the road and putting us in to deep trouble. During this time it becomes extremely difficult for us to go to school. The shopkeepers and some unruly boys tease the school girls while they pass this road and some time comment on the girls and young housewives. //////Better late than never! At last the government has declared the Saint Martin's Island an Environmentally Critical Area (ECA). During the last few years it was treated just like a public place. //////World's largest beverage company Coca-Cola recently entered into a fresh joint investment of US $ 12.7 million with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as a part of their global water partnership, the Water and Development Alliance (WADA). With this new investment USAID and the Coca-Cola Company will have committed a total of US $ 28.1 million since 2005 to support 32 projects ensuring supply of safe drinking water and access to basic sanitation in 22 countries worldwide, Africa to Asia. It may be mentioned here that more than one billion people live without access to safe drinking water and 2.6 with no access to basic sanitation. The WADA established by USAID and the Coca-Cola Company is committed to accomplishing lasting and sustainable solutions to global water challenges.//////I found it amusing that the law minister's given reason for the amendments to the ACC law is a desire to see that politicians are not 'harassed'. Frankly, I would have much more respect for him if he simply told the truth which is that no politician and no bureaucrat wants to be held accountable for corruption and hence, to them, an independent ACC is a huge threat. In fairness, this has nothing to do with the minister's political affiliation since former ministers of the previous ruling party believed the same thing. They want to go back to the days of the old Bureau of Anti Corruption which was a cruel joke, to be very charitable.//////On an average Eskimo people live the longest in the present earth, followed by the Japanese. The reason is obvious, the staple food of Eskimos is fish, and Japanese also take highest quantity of fish. Bengalis were called a fish-rice taking nation once upon a time. But the situation is different now. Thanks to the present government for taking up a mega-project of dredging 300 silted rivers. We hope fish production will be boosted if these rivers are used for fish cultivation. //////The Bangladesh government enacted The Mines and Mineral Rules (1968), and later it was amended. But it has a major gap, the legislators never tried to remove this gap in the law. The Mines and Mineral Rules defined the lessee/applicant for exploration licence and mining licences in its 3(a) and 3(b) section. This law permits the applicant or lessee to apply for exploration licence in any area over the country without considering the environmental and habitation issues. Both Bangladeshis and foreign nationals can have accessibility to apply at any time of the year for exploration licence without showing their capability to implement this project.//////I fully endorse the concern voiced by Mr. Niaz A Chowdhury on the above subject. Two day's back, while I was returning from Shingrawly, Shamshernagar, Moulvibazaar, I took this road. Although I had a very comfortable journey but as soon as I entered Tongi, I got stranded. It took almost one and a half hours to cross the railway level crossing located under the flyover bridge. On that hot summer day I saw the sufferings of the people, particularly the women and children. There was no traffic system, no police, no volunteer and everything was running with the formula of "might is right". The bus and truck drivers were so unkind to the smaller vehicles. //////It is an irony that after self-rule of 40 years, insofar as the average lifespan of Bangladeshis is concerned , we are told that the best is yet to come. More than poverty, what pains the people is the gross indifference and insensitivity of the ruling classes and politicians to their needs. Governance does not end with rhetoric on occasions. We need a strong political will and determination to achieve sustainable development.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////China said yesterday it was working for a "peaceful resolution" of the Iranian nuclear standoff, as Tehran sent its top negotiator to Beijing for talks on its disputed atomic programme.//////A car packed with explosives blew up in Russia's restive North Caucasus yesterday with the country on high alert after an Islamist group claimed the Moscow metro bombings and warned of more strikes.//////China's envoy to India Zhang Yan yesterday said that his country wants to have good relations with India and Pakistan, and added that Beijing does want its relations with one country to affect the other.//////India kicked off the national census of its billion-plus population yesterday with a 2.5 million strong army of census-takers fanning out across the country to conduct what has been billed the world's largest administrative exercise.//////Muslim scholars from around the world who met this week in Saudi Arabia's holy city Medina have denounced "terrorism" and appealed to "extremists" to repent, a statement said yesterday.//////Israel's military says it will not file any charges in the death of a Palestinian protester last year.//////A maritime watchdog yesterday issued an alert to vessels plying the waters off East Africa after five ships were attacked within 12 hours by heavily armed Somali pirates.//////President Hamid Karzai launched a stinging rebuke of the international community yesterday, blaming widespread fraud in Afghanistan's recent elections on embassies and UN and EU officials.//////Pakistani troops stormed militant positions and helicopters destroyed vehicles carrying insurgents near the Afghan border yesterday, killing 28 suspected militants and forcing thousands of civilians to flee, officials said.//////A UN probe into the killing of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto will not be reopened despite a suggestion that warnings issued by three heads of state on threats to her life be incorporated in the report, an official said.//////Pakistan's supreme court yesterday ordered the government submit a progress report within five days on efforts to re-open money laundering cases in Switzerland.//////General Vijay Kumar Singh, who on Wednesday formally took charge as the chief of Indian Army, had taken part in the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971. //////"Long before the introduction of written text there was drawing/painting.

And so it proved.//////IF you copy from one source it's called plagiarism, but if you copy from many it's called research. Last week, when the prime minister directed the telecom regulators to penalise illegal VOIP companies instead of shutting them down, there was a ring of that dilemma to what she said.

One can go to jail for pilferage, but not for plunder.//////IN Chittagong lives a very desperate community -- the Rohingya -- a religious and linguistic ethnic minority from Myanmar's northern Rakhine State, who have been fleeing state-sponsored persecution in their homeland since the late seventies. In 1991, when the population experienced widespread repression and abuse from security forces posted in Rakhine, a quarter of a million crossed the border to Bangladesh seeking asylum. Many of them still live here today. //////TODAY is Good Friday. Christians all over the world commemorate the death of Jesus Christ with due solemnity and earnestness this day.
