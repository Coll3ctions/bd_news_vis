On Friday, a well-attended and, needless to say, well-publicised convention made it clear that the SCF is today determined that the war criminals of 1971 are prosecuted and punished under the relevant national and international laws. It is a goal which surely resonates with the vast majority of the people of Bangladesh. All of us, naturally and for very good reasons, hold the view that the principles around which the nation waged the War of Liberation must be upheld as the core upon which we build our future.//////We are dumbfounded at the observation made by a supposedly responsible office bearer of Outdoor Advertisement Owners' Association about the lethality caused to pedestrians by fledgling rooftop billboards. He is quoted in the report as saying, "When a lot of people are getting killed in various accidents ... a few deaths due to billboard collapse are not something exceptional." It amounts to saying, so what if some people die from collapsing billboards!

And after nineteen years, the historic 7 March (1971) speech of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib, following Pakistanis' conspiracy not to allow Mujib to implement his people's mandate, the Six-point programme with which his party swept to the election victory made it crystal clear that the Pakistanis' domination and subjugation would soon be over. More so, when Bangabandhu, before the biggest ever meeting of Bengalees in the then Race Course Maidan (now Suhrawardy Uddyan) concluded his speech by a forceful declaration, Our struggle this time is for freedom, our struggle this time is for emancipation. The speech just struck the right chord with hundreds of thousands of people there and on the roof-top of each and every building around, (and in reality with the nation as a whole) and they echoed in concurrence in thunderous voice, Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu. Flamboyant and fearless, he delivered a poetic, mellifluously worded speech, unique in style and presentation; that also delineated the deprivations in all sectors which Bengalees had to suffer in the hands of the Pakistani rulers since 1947, and cautioned them by uttering, no more trampling down are dabya rakte parbana. To frustrate their evil design, he called upon his people to face the Pakistani military by saying,  Make every house a fortress and swoop on them with whatever you have. Bengalees were left with nothing short of 'the green signal for disowning Pakistan and for preparing, lock, stock and barrel, for achieving their own homeland, Bangladesh'. And Bengalees already imbued with their leader's directives of 7 March, and final call of 26 March, fought the 9-month long liberation war, literally in his name (though he was absent due to his being taken prisoner to Pakistan on the charge of high treason for declaration of Independence of Bangladesh), and eventually materialised their dream of independent sovereign Bangladesh, but at the cost of three millions lives. Bengalees paid too much price in blood in too short a time. Think about the importance of the speech on 7 March 1971 which is called by many as his swan-song. Verily, that speech was the prelude to splitting of Pakistan and emergence of Bangladesh. Hence the speech is a treasure trove, like all great speeches in the annals of history.//////I would like to thank DS for publishing a news item on March 19, 2008 regarding the regrettable condition of precious sculptures situated at DU.//////I vehemently oppose the proposal put forward by the Awami League recently on the issue of the government funding the political parties which secured at least 10% of the votes in the last parliamentary election for conducting the forthcoming national election. The political parties should conduct election with their own funds and the candidate should bear the expenses required for the purpose. The state's money is meant for meeting the expenses required by the state and the people. It has many other priority areas such as poverty alleviation, creation of jobs for the ultra poor, disaster mitigation, undertaking emergency programmes etc. The nation's other requirement is to address the issues such as food shortage, fertiliser crisis, electricity, gas, agricultural and human development and so on. Therefore, this request should not in any circumstances be taken into consideration.//////The circular of the 28th BCS has been issued at last after two and a half years of the 27th BCS circular, though it is supposed to be published every year. This type of gap is, however, not new in the process. In 2003, the circular of the 24th BCS was published after two and a half years of the 22nd BCS circular of 2000, if we do not take into count the 23rd special BCS of 2003. So, more or less a period of five years had elapsed without issuance of any circular. In contrast, the BCS exams held in the period i.e. from 2000 to 2007 covering the 22nd to the 27th BCS were the most controversial and allegedly corrupt. If we consider these two factors, it can be said that a number of meritorious students have failed to qualify in the BCS exams in the said period. It also means that the students who completed their graduation and post graduation in this period have failed to get the cherished jobs not for lack of their merit, rather due to the state of affairs. Though the circular of the 24th BCS exams was published by relaxing the age limit to provide scope to a greater number of aspirants, the scenario is quite different in the case of the 28th BCS.//////Our long-term national aim is peace and prosperity and the immediate aim is to hold a parliamentary election towards restoration of democracy. What I find is a change of priority by the caretaker govt. in our national agenda. No one will deny the fact that corruption has taken roots in all spheres of our life, that is why for the last few years we are being identified as the number one corrupt country in the world. The present govt. is found to spend most of their energy without focus on eradication of this evil and that too within a short period allotted specifically for the particular job of holding the national election. I find hundreds of people including politicians behind bars for corruption cases. Moreover, for these cases thousands of people are engaged in dealing with them with heavy pressure on the govt. exchequer. The newspaper reports show how the govt. administration, prisons, courts, police department etc. are engaged in dealing with the corruption cases. I don't support ignoring the corruption cases but would like to suggest the following which may be more beneficial for the govt. and the country as a whole://////Some of our prominent political leaders, especially the reformists of the last government and some eminent personalities are suggesting and seriously advocating formation of a National Government in place of the present CTG. Is this theory a part of our constitution, if not why they are suggesting such form of government in place of the existing one which is somehow constitutionally established? We remember the then Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia commented that Only the infants and insane are neutral. However, she had to accept the caretaker government and ultimately the constitution was amended. Our constitution is a sacred document. We should honour this document and run this country as it dictates. I believe those who are advocating for an extra-constitutional National Government are talking from the point of their own political standings. Most of these leaders are politically bankrupt, they do not have much public support.//////Following allegations of crimes committed by Bangladeshi expatriates, the Saudi government (SG) has decided to reduce the number of Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia dramatically and put restriction on issuing new visa. //////Understanding the behaviour and practice as well as ethics of welfare banking is still a weak point for the people who deal with the sector. The particular text and presentation on the subject to open up the merits and dynamism of welfare banking is yet to reach the grassroots level people. Although welfare based banks are facing challenges and adopting measures to explore its benefits, the overall results are not yet very good. //////Most criminals act within knowledge of police, says IGP (28 Feb, DS). But when policemen themselves become criminals, people are left with little to do. //////Bangladesh, as we know, is an over populated country. Our economy is mainly agro-based. Contribution of industry and service sectors is increasing but still it is not very significant. The agriculture sector is considered as overburdened with excess manpower. Unemployment and under employment is an acute problem here//////While in a country like ours eating fast food is a 'cool' thing, in the western world eating only nutritious foods is now regarded as 'cool'. The reason is simple, obesity is supposed to be a serious problem in this part of the world together with all the diseases it may lead to. In schools, children are not allowed to eat junk foods and fizzy drinks, they must have five types of fruits and vegetables along with plenty of water. Food choice is made strictly on health grounds. //////A lot has been said and written about Sheikh Hasina's treatment abroad. All experts in this regard concluded on one point only: Ear treatment has to be done in the United States as it is not available in Bangladesh. //////We are flummoxed about why the print media in Bangladesh is haemorrhaging us with updates on health conditions of our former heads of government and high-ups. It is neither appropriate in today's world to openly talk about one's health, nor is it worth a try to kindle compassion of a population that is now aware of many of their bizarre deeds. Moreover, our politicians are endowed with unusually long life span, and, therefore, we do not want to waste our energy on something that we do not have to worry about. //////In light of the recent performances of the Tigers since the Twenty20 World Cup right up to the just concluded South Africa series, one can only come to the conclusion that they are regressing rather than progressing under coach Jamie Siddons and captain Mohammed Ashraful. There has to be some accountability. Cricket is a sport where an impoverished nation like Bangladesh spends millions of dollars each year. Continued lack of performance cannot merely be shrugged off. Jamie Siddons has had enough time and opportunity to show at least minimal success since he took the reins of the Tigers but has failed miserably. Under him the Tigers did not win a single match, be it Tests or One-Dayers against New Zealand or South Africa. More alarmingly, they were not even competitive. These are very poor returns in the field of international sports.//////The report in The Daily Star (10th March) on a gift by Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz to former military dictator and president of Bangladesh Hussain Muhammad Ershad has drawn my attention. The gift is a Mercedes-Benz 350 car.//////You must have noticed that a number of foreign doctors, especially Indian doctors are working in Bangladesh. Some of them are working here in the name of technical collaboration and some of them are simply consulting individually. It is the law of the soil that any foreign doctor must have necessary registration from Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC). Not only Bangladesh, this type of law exists in each and every country of the world. We have no objections if some new technologies are introduced and hands-on training are given to our local doctors by the foreign physicians. But this is quite unacceptable that they are violating the existing laws and also some of them are working without work permit. The question arises, why should we need regulatory bodies like BMDC, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. If they think that Bangladesh should remain free for all doctors in the world who could practice here without registration, they should declare that and declare themselves non-existent. We do not need any impotent bodies being run with the money from public coffers.//////I am appalled to read that a scientific study of tigers involving radio-telemetry has been suspended by the Bangladesh government because of well-intentioned but entirely misdirected concerns. Adam Barlow who is the victim in this case is a capable wildlife biologist and a student of Dr. David Smith one of the pioneers of tiger research. The drug employed has been used in dozens of immobilizations of wild tigers in Nepal, India and Russia by myself and other researchers. Suspending such an important tiger research project based on mere apprehensions is unjustified.//////The main problem of Chittagong Hill tracts is complexity of land.

Such a drastic situation might not exist in Bangladesh, but neither is it so far away, with many of the population having to search frantically for safe drinking water. //////Malaria has been a major public health problem in Bangladesh.
