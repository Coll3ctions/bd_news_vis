The bigger truth, though, is that there is really nothing new or inspiring about the new men now in charge of the party.

By doing what it has done, the PPP has done little to convince anyone that democracy in Pakistan will benefit from the move.//////The news of proposed legislation about the formation of a Human Rights Commission being approved by the advisory council is salutary.

To carry on regardless in the face of such imminent and terminal danger requires special courage, for which no eulogy can be enough. //////As the dawn breaks in the New Year, everyone would love to forget the depressing sporting year of 2007 as soon as possible.
