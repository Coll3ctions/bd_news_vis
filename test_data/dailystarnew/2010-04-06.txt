No, don't be alarmed. This time no militant groups are responsible for the explosions. It is us -- you, me and them who are responsible for this. Let us analyse the factors behind the two explosions one by one. Let us talk about the first explosion. The first one is population explosion. The population of Dhaka city at the moment is well over 1 crore (government agencies might differ, but they cannot come with an exact figure either). It is increasing in a frightening proportion with nearly 3,000 to 5,000 people coming here on a daily basis to settle down permanently. //////THE on-going crisis in the energy sector because of a shortfall between demand and supply of both natural gas and electricity, though inherited from the 2001-2008 regimes, has now become a nightmare for the grand-alliance government under Sheikh Hasina. //////MANY western politicians refer to Bangladesh as a moderate "Muslim" country.

The country produces 1.7 mt and the rest is imported at a cost of 465 million US $. Urea is usually applied in prilled condition by hand. Its application efficiency is only 35 to 40 per cent. When it is applied in super granule form, its application efficiency is increased to 60 per cent. If all the urea could be applied in super granule form, then 1.15 mt urea could be saved. In that case only 0.05 mt urea needs to be imported.//////Lately the Earth has been quite active as far as her seismic behaviour is concerned. Let's have a look at the recent earthquakes since the beginning of this year. On January 12th, a magnitude-7.0 quake devastated Haiti and on February 27th, a 8.8-magnitude tremor hit Chile, shifting her largest city, Concepcion, at least 10 feet to the west! And a similar earthquake struck Japan on February the 26th, thankfully causing less damage. Then again on March 4th, a magnitude of 6.4 quake hit Taiwan followed by a 6.5 one on the very next day in Indonesia. And on March 8th a pre-dawn 5.9 magnitude earthquake rocked south-eastern part of Turkey. The recent surge in the frequency as well as intensity of the quakes, a calamity that comes out of the blue, has sent leading experts in the field worrying. However, the string of quakes over the last three months might well be a matter of mere coincidence. Prof. Bob Holdsworth, an expert on tectonics at Durham University, England says, I can definitely tell you that the world is not coming to an end. It is important to note that according US Geological Survey, on average there are 134 earthquakes a year that have a magnitude between 6.0 and 6.9. And this year experienced a hasty start, with 40 of such so far, more than in most years for that particular time period. But there is no geological connection between these recent earthquakes as these tragic natural events involved different tectonic plates. //////The "giggle" made by spotted hyenas may encode information about age, dominance, and identity, say scientists from France and the U.S.//////Scientists working in Madagascar found what may be the largest frog that ever lived, National Geographic News reported a year ago.//////Do the symbols carved in the stone above represent a complex written languageor are they merely religious imagery?
