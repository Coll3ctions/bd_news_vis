This common heritage was the product of over a thousand years of historical development and was the outcome of a long process of blending of indigenous and external elements.

These questions only further complicate the calculation of hawkish Generals in both the United States and Israel. //////Mahtab Beg was the Chairman of No.2 Satnola Union, adjacent to Ranir Bandor and Champakoli areas near Syedpur town.

Mallick did not have a diplomatic background, in that professional sense. But, as so often happens in history when nondiplomats are sent to speak abroad for their countries, Mallick proved the truism once again that scholars are almost always symbolic of their national heritage and history in the capitals they are sent to. And do not forget that Mallick served as Bangladesh's top diplomat at a time when it was necessary to let Indians, and others, know that a nation put to the torch by the Pakistan army through a nine-month war was finally ready, politically as well as intellectually, to claim its place in the global league.
