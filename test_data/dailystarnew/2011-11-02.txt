vindicated my conviction that the destructive machine of capitalism is sure to be burned down by the fire that was so far burning in the hearts of 99% people of the world who were exploited by the 1%

You get the feeling that the old values and ideals which punctuated politics in the old days have gone through a revival of sorts. Not in the past twenty years have we had the experience of a politician -- resolute, astute, untainted by suspicions of corrupt dealings, untouched by questions of impropriety -- take the country by storm through democratic means. //////Placidity of a kind follows in the wake of Selina Hayat Ivy's triumph in Narayanganj.

Obviously, the credit goes to the crafty storytellers, who with their relentless efforts have regaled us with the tale of yet another Arab dictator whose whims are as entertaining to readers as to the Western leaders. Although the task was a bit arduous in the beginning, things became easier for them, that is to say, for the Western media, when the Arab world got carried away by the so-called "Spring," the seemingly never-ending flow of which is yet to ebb. After that, the only thing left for them was to organise the narrative in a way so as to represent Gaddafi as a stereotyped villain who having stifled democracy for more than four decades set out on a killing spree. //////The High Priests of Hair have defeated the secret wig cartel.
