Iraq, a senior commander announced yesterday, making 2007 the deadliest year for the US military since the invasion four years ago. //////By inviting the Saifur Rahman-led faction of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to a dialogue on November 22, the Election Commission has created an impression of having taken sides. The EC's issuance of a letter inviting BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed to the dialogue does not convince us of the logic behind it. There are far too many factors that today make it hard for anyone to fathom the real situation vis-a-vis the BNP constitution. Bluntly stated, the constitution is very ambiguous, indeed confusing nature. //////A recent city page report in our paper has revealed that many of the traditional, affordable and convenient spots for drama rehearsals are gradually becoming inaccessible to the users. Notably the one or two rooms that were open to rehearsal by various groups, particularly at the Eskaton Garden High School and the Motijheel High School, became unavailable to them since the change of government in 2001. As many as 30 theatre groups, both old and budding ones, had been using the premises for the last 20 years. This was being done on mutually agreed terms with the rehearsals taking place during evening hours preceded by school activities up to the afternoon hours. To add to the overall paucity of space, only the other day, the Mirpur Town Hall which was a central place for staging shows and holding rehearsals after being in a bad shape for long has finally been bulldozed by DCC and that too reportedly at the behest of some influential people to make way for a 20-storied commercial complex. //////As the War of Liberation rolled on in 1971, Khaled Musharraf perfected the art of guerilla warfare against the occupation Pakistan army. He was a hands-on soldier, in that conventional sense of the meaning, and yet he had quickly proved adept in planning and employing all those hit and run tactics that have historically laid traditional armies low all across the globe. //////The comments made by former bureaucrat Shah Abdul Hannan, coming as they did on the heels of similar comments from the Jamaat-e-Islam Secretary-General Mohammad Mujahid, on our glorious Liberation War of 1971 should have triggered a tsunami across the political land mass of Bangladesh by now for the simple reason that there would have been no Bangladesh today had there been no Liberation War in 1971. There should have been country-wide agitation, with people protesting their remarks. //////While even coup-prone nations are gradually treading the democratic or at least constitutional path, Pakistan has remained unique for being run by a serving general as its "elected" president and without a constitution. The country's constitution has been suspended, modified and even replaced with draconian acts several times since 1958, in the name of defending Islam and sovereignty of the country.//////Imrul Kayes showed a rare brand of runs spree, slamming another swashbuckling century as Khulna secured a comfortable 56-run victory over Sylhet to maintain their hundred per cent success rate in the one-day competition of the 9th National Cricket League at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium yesterday.//////The national footballers refused to take any money from their outgoing Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin, who offered them a portion of his salary from the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF).//////The opening day match of the Challengers' Cup tournament between North and South, billed for a November 9 start, has been deferred by a day.//////Sachin Tendulkar has declined the Indian Test captaincy, citing personal reasons, two days before the national selectors are scheduled to decide on the position.

Johnson picked up only two wickets during the tour game in Brisbane, where he was out-bowled by his Queensland teammate Ashley Noffke, but he felt the pitch prevented him from unsettling the tourists with his short balls.//////Stuart MacGill has been given a clear run into the first-Test team after Brad Hogg was trimmed from Australia's 13-man squad in Brisbane. Andrew Hilditch, the chairman of selectors, watched Hogg bowl in the nets before making the decision, which was helped by the cloudy and damp conditions.//////The first time I got an inkling that Daniel Vettori might be captain material was in 2003. The Black Caps were touring Sri Lanka and were in the middle of a warm-up game. I had batted all day for a century. When stumps were drawn and I walked off, I expected plenty of praise from my teammates. I got it from some, but from Daniel all I got was a steely look and a lecture on how the way I had batted could cost us in the Test matches. It was thought that as Muttiah Muralidaran was the main threat to us, we could allow ourselves the luxury of playing particularly cautiously against him if we were positive against the others.//////Global news agencies said Tuesday they might be forced to cancel coverage of the first Australia-Sri Lanka cricket Test after organisers imposed unprecedented restrictions on the

any country. Generally it affects the routine life of people. And at long last President Gen. Musharraf declared a state of emergency in Pakistan putting an end to the speculative nature of reports about democracy and stopping the saga of turmoil that gripped the country for a pretty long time. Opposition parties supported by lawyers and some judges, encouraged by the support from Western liberal advices have been harping upon removal of Musharraf. Lavish concerns for Pakistani democracy from across the borders have made these stalwarts to raise the issue of uniform to its logical conclusion now. Musharraf has finally lost his patience to clamp emergency.//////It is extremely difficult to even comprehend today that the Awami League had a great leader like Tajuddin Ahmed. A combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence and selfless attitude to serve the nation quietly and with dignity has not been observed in any other leaders in our history. Sadly, our unfortunate nation has not been able to show enough gratitude to this leader both during his lifetime and after the tragic end of his life. Neither the killers have been punished, nor the government has given any sincere effort to this end. It is an insult to the gentle soul of Tajuddin that the Awami League brings out processions, wears black badges and screams for justice when they could have pursued and ended this matter to nation's satisfaction when they were in power. //////Few rivalries in cricket can match that between India and Pakistan. As Geoff Lawson so rightly puts it ; this series between the two teams (which started from Nov.5 in India), is indeed 'bigger than ashes.' And for fans in the subcontinent, particularly in our country, we simply love to see India playing against Pakistan-- be it one-day, Test or Twenty20 match.//////A write-up on what should be reasonable rickshaw fare, and what actually is paid came up in your columns a few days back. Small wonder, it is a far higher amount than the out-dated city corporation's published fare charts state. This is the factual reality and needs to be looked at in a rational manner, considering the stratospheric rise in prices of daily necessities. Rickshaw pulling is a labourious and demanding task, and so is the need for adequate nourishment for the ill paid rickshaw-puller.//////I just s`tumbled across some comments in an article published in the online edition of your newspaper. The article, "Of "civil war," hypocrisy and ageing quislings," written by Syed Badrul Ahsan, stated: "You might now raise the matter of Biafra, the eastern Nigerian province that decided in 1967 to go free and give itself a new name. For three years, until 1970, Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu's forces fought a gradually losing battle against the armed forces of the Federal Nigerian state. When Biafra collapsed, not many were surprised. Biafra, after all, had tried to secede, for no good political or legal reason, from Nigeria. It was this lack of a moral base that forced Biafra back into the union. In terms of history, therefore, the Biafra conflict is but a version of civil war waged between different segments of the population of a country."//////The caretaker government is doing a nice job. I don't know what others may think, I like this government. Being a student, my knowledge about politics is shallow. Only one thing I could tell about politics and its representatives is that it is a spoiled institution run by culprits. Once when I was in class six, I asked my mom whether I could be a politician. The reply was puzzling as she told me to wait and ensured that I would understand it myself, one day. Still politics is baffling to me. As I am an A levels student now.//////In July 1947, a referendum was held in NWFP which resulted into accession of the province to Pakistan. In November 1947, tribal elders opted to attach Tribal Agencies to Pakistan. People of Northern Areas won independence on their own and in August 1948 joined Pakistan. In 1948, Kalat merged with Pakistan when the Khan signed the necessary merger documents. Gawader was purchased from the Sultan of Oman in 1958. This was the final shape of the then West Pakistan which is still in tact. //////I am not at all annoyed with Janab Mojaheed's (Secretary General of Jamaat-e-Islami) statement that JI never worked against our independence. Then Janab, please clarify what did you and your people do at the time that we call Liberation War? I give you a lead you worked heart and soul for the Paki regime in the name of fighting infidels! And Janab Shah Hannan informed us of what you did not say. He thinks that it was a Civil War! You people have the courage to say such things demeaning the existence of Bangladesh now because Bangabandhu had the magnanimity to forgive you and for that you never bothered to say 'sukriya' and subsequently rode on the shoulders of other political parties to elevate yourself to the present status! You would do the job left unfinished of rewriting the history of Bangladesh that your alliance party in power in the last five years started, and if you people ever come to power, you would write a 'Naya Itihas' New History, to uphold that without JI Bangladesh could not have been liberated! //////While the caretaker government is already overloaded & stressed with many national problems, such as holding a free, fair & credible election, curving wide spread corruption, control spiraling prices of essential commodities, separation of judiciary from executive etc, suddenly a new problem crept in from the irresponsible statement of Jamaat-e-Islami Secretary General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed about their well known role in our liberation war. No doubt his comment deserves strong condemnation that is already pouring in from all quarters and probably Mr. Ali Ahsan is passing a hard time to digest these. //////The Daily Star Business page of 29-Oct carried a news item mentioning a meeting which involved Bangladesh Bank and the decision to introduce a uniform (know-your-customer) KYC form to make account opening and operating easy for the bank clients.

Obviously, this would increase investment in Sanchay Patra, but the circular should contain some clarification regarding the investment in joint names (husband and wife). If both the husband and wife remain to be the tax payers and the total amount of investment is shown in anyone's tax return, in this case the tax payer (husband or wife)should avail the benefit of tax rebates on profit earned up to 3,00,000/= (1,50,000/= +1,50,000/=)//////A few days back, I went to my home in Sirajganj. A childhood friend, who is a retrenched jute mill worker, met me. The CTG has shut down his mill. My friend has lost his job. He is in a very difficult situation. He cannot buy his daily basic essentials. His woes and sufferings are beyond description and day-by-day his wretched situation is getting worse. His family consists of four members. He is the sole earner of his family. He lamented that he could not manage daily meals for his family. Starvation, poverty, unemployment have made them ultra poor. Unemployment has converted him into a beggar. //////President Gen. Pervez Musharraf cites freeing Pakistan's media as one of his proudest achievements, but under emergency rule his regime is stripping those liberties away for fear independent news reports will further fan opposition.
