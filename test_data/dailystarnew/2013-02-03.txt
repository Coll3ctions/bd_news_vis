Bangladesh is hovering at over a 6% growth rate, which is respectable given the projected 2013growth figures of 6% and 8% for the global emerging giants, India and China, respectively. The 12-month average inflation in Bangladesh is now 8.74% -- down from its peak of 11% in February 2012.

The presidential election in the Maldives will take place in mid-2013. The country is poised at a perilous spot. The optimism of the first democratic election of 2008 was shattered by the events of February 7, 2012, when former President Nasheed stepped down claiming a coup after street protests. Politics in the Maldives, based on personalities rather than on effective policy reforms, prompts people with vested interests to switch parties for position and financial gains. These power brokers stem reforms that might de-stabilise the patronage network that keeps them in office. Democracy is also impeded by a negative political culture that prefers retaliation over rapprochement and suspicion over consultation. Given the minuscule civil society with only weak bargaining power, a long tradition of dictatorship and great inequalities of wealth, the country is tottering at the brink of a precipice. . . //////We live in an age of specialisation.

Fields of specialisation have narrowed to the extent that we not only have the standard macro or micro economist, but also behavioural economists, institutional economists, environmental economists. There are political pundits specialising in election outcomes or terrorism experts who are authorities solely on al-Qaeda or the Taliban! //////
