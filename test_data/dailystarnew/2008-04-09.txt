work to the unemployed in the rural areas is an appropriate strategy to address the miseries of the abjectly poor of rural Bangladesh. The plan seeks to ameliorate their sufferings during the lean period for about hundred days, to at least one person of an affected household.

Indeed, matters should not have come to a pass where the world body would need to ask Nepal's political parties to refrain from resorting to violence in the run-up to the voting. By all accounts, the elections should have been peaceful (they still can be that). But going by how the Maoists, now part of mainstream politics, have been conducting their campaign, there is today serious concern about the way the voting will turn out. The bombings as well as killings that have occurred in the past few days can only underscore the gravity of the situation.//////NAZIUR RAHMAN was for a long number of years a confidant of General Hussein Muhammad Ershad. There were a number of others who simply built their careers, or climbed to bigger heights of glory, by the grace of the man we know as Bangladesh's second military dictator.

of women who constitute around 50% of the population and the voters. Their contributions to the family, society, culture, economy etc. cannot be quantified and sometimes beyond comprehension too. //////Population explosion is a burning issue in our country. Over population is a grave problem and owing to its ill-effects, such as increasing rate of unemployment, scarcity of basic foods, lack of provisions for treatment, lack of space for accommodation provision, waning agricultural fields, depletion of forest areas, traffic jam caused by innumerable vehicles, all sorts of pollution, mugging, robbery, pilferage,illiteracy, unemployment and so forth, we are suffering as a nation.//////Humanity, in its quintessential form, can be defined as the feeling of being humane towards all people in society, irrespective of caste, creed, colour or religion. It is not only about showing sympathy and creating a sense of affection or compassion for them. But the word "humanity" also encompasses the notion of helping every person in times of need and extending a helping hand to pull them out of every pit of obstacles along with the inborn qualities of benevolence and friendliness, although some may argue that being humane is a recessive trait and is a completely biological term. The 21st century brings up the whole array of work and has created a busy life for us with time only for ourselves. Students are rushing to go to school or college, service-holders are in search of a taxi to get to their destination, and that is how the ongoing cycle of life takes its turn. The hectic schedules of life have made us robotic with no sense of generosity, helpfulness and all the other qualities that make a good man. //////Bangladesh is known for its natural beauty with the longest sea beach of Cox's Bazar, the largest mangrove forests of the Sundarbans and the greenery of the Hill tracts. In addition to these spots there are other venues that can attract the tourists. In spite of having so many spots with immense potential for tourism, the country lags behind other Asian countries, say, Thailand or Malaysia.//////The all-round success of our women's team against the visiting Hong Kong Women XI is a tonic for us; more so after the rout of our men's cricket team by South Africa. Congratulations to our lady cricketers for a well deserved victory. We hope to see them do better and better in future. Maybe they should arrange matches with the South African women's team if possible this summer.//////Thanks to the government for informally discussing the trial of war criminals with the Secretary General of the UN. We do not know the basis of such a discussion. We were given no hint that the issue might be raised by the adviser for foreign affairs during his current visit to the UN. If it was done with a purpose, we welcome the move, but we would expect the government to give full details of this action to the nation. The issue is of supreme importance for our survival as independent Bangladesh when the war criminals are receiving strategic support and cooperation from known and unknown quarters at home and abroad. //////If this is just early summer and we are having power cuts every half an hour, I'm dreading what will happen later this summer when it gets unbearably hot. I also want to know why not even a single power station is being built during the tenure of the CTG when it is needed on an emergency basis. We cannot stand still until election time, we still have to work and live. I am sick of hearing generators going off and on all day, this is not a civilised way to live in a capital city. If they had started last January, a power station would be finished in another year or so and would make some difference in 2010. If the current administration wants to prove their worth and gain the support of the people, they have to do more than putting the corrupt in prison. The masses don't care about that, they care about day to day life - food, shelter, power. They need to invest in a decent transport system, invest in the roads and highways, give us electricity to work and live in a decent way. In short, they need to improve the quality of our lives. I also fail to see why Bangladesh is so completely dependent on India for food supplies. There are other surrounding countries that can also supply rice and other essentials. //////The contradiction regarding the Tiger collaring in the Sundarbans is creating conflicting ideas amongst conservationists from different schools of thoughts. This has been going on for quite a while. It is time for the forest department to intervene and issue a public statement to clear this confusion, since they are the bosses who have given the go-ahead to Adam Barlow and his team to continue with the project. It is mandatory for the Conservator of Forests (CF) to come forward to dispel this confusion.//////Every multi-national or big company has social responsibility. From this responsibility, they donate money to the orphanages, hospitals, universities, schools, colleges etc. It helps them to build a strong base in different societies. I appreciate the companies which are carrying it out well. But the question of performing social responsibility needs discussion. We know that we lag behind in using the latest technology. We are still dependent on agriculture, but we have shortage of modern instruments for conducting bio-technology research. Besides, most of the universities have no modern lab facilities where students and teachers work on their research elaborately. We see that companies are more enthusiastic to donate their money in less important areas, rather than in productive and constructive fields. A few days ago, I learned that a private bank donated money for building an art research centre. I am not against the development of art and culture. But the most important thing for us now is to be self-dependent in agriculture. For this reason, we have to do more research on inventing new high quality hybrid seeds. We have to do more research on reducing use of insecticides, so that we can make our environment free from pollution. //////Living in Dhaka is so intolerable nowadays. There are many problems, but I will point out just one-- the billboards on the rooftop which are responsible for many deaths and injuries. These loosely held billboards become a source of worry when there is a strong wind. The Daily Star rightly highlighted this important issue on the front-page of its March 21, 2008 issue. According to this report, an unidentified youth was killed on 19 March in front of the Chandrima supermarket. From this report, we also learned that 3,000 rooftops billboards are currently installed in Dhaka city. These can cause fatal accidents any time. //////The demise of K M Subhan on the 31st December afternoon was like a bolt from the blue for many of us in the family. It is a shock we still cannot recover from.//////On March 26, 2008 I was terribly shocked to learn from a press report that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) would no longer recruit Bangladeshi workers in the housing and agriculture sectors. Saudi Arabian Labour Minister Gazi Al-Gosabi reportedly said-"The decision was taken in view of the fact that the quota fixed for Bangladeshi workers in the Kingdom was over". Good! Is this quota like those of the US DV quotas?!//////Development would not sustain if there is no planning behind it. And for a realistic plan that would be applicable for sustainable development, proper and authentic data is needed. In our country's context, if someone wants to gather any information about any matter, in some cases the data would not be at all available and in some cases the data would be available but may not be credible. I need some data urgently. How much land is used for rice cultivation and how much land is used for pulse cultivation, how much land is used for wheat cultivation, how much land is used for potato cultivation etc. And how much storage facility the country has as per the necessity of every agro-product? Somebody may answer saying, Yes, you would get the information from the authorities concerned. Yes, we can get the information from the authorities but the question is whether the information is credible and even if there is some credible and updated information, then is that being used properly for the greater benefit of our country's people? //////The politicians, beyond their so called norms and ethics of long inherited partisan politics, quite surprisingly unite on an issue when it comes to their own personal interest. The government has recently ordered all MPs of last parliament to leave the Nam flats. Let's not discuss the discretion or justification that triggered this order from the government . But after that, we were stunned to observe that our politicians, irrespective of their congenital conflict and confrontation, started to share the unified voice to retain their tenements. The nation observed the unforgettable and unforgivable ramification of our politics on 1/11 that pushed it to a prolonged uncertainly. We can legitimately ask, at this point of time, why our politicians fail to unite when it comes to the interest of the nation. //////The authorities responsible for Gulshan Lake - Rajuk / DCC have gone to great lengths to protect the people who bought illegal plots in the lake. Of course, corrupt employees have benefited which is why they want the whole matter to go away, it is up to the media to ensure that it doesn't. I think that both the buyers and the authorities need to be taught a lesson. All those plots should be cancelled without any discussion, so that buyers think twice before trying to grab lakes. The law enforcers need to immediately take a walk around the lake and take back the plots, dredging out any land filling. They also need to remove the shanty houses which are now filling land beneath them and building solid housing on top. We are yet to see the DCC and Rajuk doing anything about them, when our flower beds are being demolished for being one foot into the pavement with great vigour. The big crimes are being ignored, it just doesn't make any sense! As for filling in the lake for building the bridge, this is the most ridiculous thing I have seen, bridges can be built without filling in any land, we have many of them all over the country already. //////The easiest way to clean the dirty Dhaka city is to enforce a simple law. If the government decides to fine the owners of all shops, offices and houses who do not clean their premises and spread this message among the people through the media the whole city will be clean. The amount of money to be realised as penalty for lack of cleanliness should be at least Tk 2,000.//////Pakistan's new government will not negotiate with terrorist groups as part of its effort to pursue talks with Islamic militants, the foreign minister said Monday. //////Tamil Tiger rebels asked peace-broker Norway on Tuesday to pressure Sri Lanka's government to stop a military offensive in the island's north, saying a venerated Catholic church was at risk. //////The Shia "martyrs" of this hill village are normally killed in the dangerous, stony landscape of southern Lebanon, in Israeli air raids or invasions or attacks from the sea.
