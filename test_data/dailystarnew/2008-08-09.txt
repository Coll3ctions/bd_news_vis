According to the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2007, the gap between demand and availability of family planning methods is yawning. While in 2004 it was 11 percent, in 2007 it worsened to 18 percent. People's eagerness to adopt contraceptive methods far outstrips the availability of contraceptives. At the current rate, the unmet demand is likely to rise to 40 percent in the next 15 years, jeopardising the fulfilment of MDGs in terms of not merely containment of population but also halving the incidence of poverty by 2015.//////The August 4 elections to city corporations and municipalities have been held in a reasonably peaceful atmosphere but without great enthusiasm (probably due to existing emergency provisions). The first step in the revival of the electoral process has been taken. Its importance will be remembered for the use of the new voters list. For this, the Election Commission and those associated in preparing the voters roll deserve special recognition. It also demonstrated the people's overwhelming support for Awami League supported candidates both in the four Mayoral races (four out of four, with one being elected for the second time from internment) and in the nine Pourashava polls (eight out of nine).//////A Pakistani has said in a letter to a leading English daily at Karachi to recall the 10 million Muslim refugees who made immense sacrifices to make the country a reality, besides nearly one million who got massacred at the time of the partition.

We cannot reach out to those we love in times of stress and grief. One of her old friends had died in Mumbai and Tahira had found herself helpless in contacting her friends relations. //////The much talked about local government election to nine pourashavas and four city corporations finally took place on Monday, August 4, 2008. The election has been, according to election observers, reasonably fair, transparent and peaceful.

England lost Ian Bell and Alastair Cook early on, but thereafter the day was dominated by their newly appointed leader and Paul Collingwood.

With the glaring exception of Graeme Smith's first-ball reprieve at gully, everything that could go right for his side did go right, as South Africa contributed to their own downfall on a day that revealed just how fine the line is between success and failure in this most fickle of sports.//////Rampura Krira Chakra qualified for next season's Third Division Football League after their 1-0 win in the Pioneer League semifinal over Swadhinata Krira Sangha at the Bir Shrestha Sepoy Mohammad Mostafa Stadium yesterday.//////The Indian cricket board on Friday changed the itinerary of the four-Test Australian series later this year owing to a clash of dates with a key festival.//////Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has decided to call time on his international career, the German football federation announced in a statement on Friday.//////Scottish Premier League club Dundee United signed Sunderland striker Roy O'Donovan on a season-long loan on Friday. //////Dilhara Fernando, the Sri Lankan fast bowler who has just recovered from a leg injury, has been retained in the one-day squad for the five-match series against India and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.

There is no denying that the Bangladesh Police, as an organisation, can perform well if it is founded on valid organisational principles. The unpleasant truth is that with regard to our police, these principles were ruthlessly violated over the years, resulting in corrupt, inefficient and highly politicized police forces. Consequently, the police largely turned into agents of the political executive rather than as instruments of a democratic state.//////The South Asian heads of state -- in the 15th Saarc summit that ended on August 3 with the adoption of a 41-point Colombo declaration -- have agreed to start the operation of the Saarc food bank. The soaring prices of food grains across the world have emerged as a serious concern for most developing countries, prompting Saarc leaders to act decisively.//////A few days ago, a letter writer termed the Bangladesh education system as "poor," and it is a fact that science education is not up to par. There's a strong opposing view against the diversified primary education system, but the government drive to implement a unified education system in the secondary stage has failed. There are many more such problems, which make a national drive imperative. In this age of globalisation, we can see what others are doing. Several years ago, I reviewed the systems in Asian countries, and recently I have done that for twenty European countries. They are Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, the UK and Ukraine.//////It was Japan's prime minister of the time, Junichiro Koizumi, who in 2004 took a bold but much criticised initiative of sending Japanese troops to a mission that had not been authorised by the United Nations. Japan's Iraq mission, though symbolic in nature as the troops had to be provided protection by peacekeepers from other nations stationed in Iraq, helped tone down the criticism that the United States had been waging since the first Gulf war, which Tokyo did not take part in. Japan had to compensate for that failure, and a $13 billion check was the price the country had to pay. But the hefty compensation did not make Japan immune to criticism, and since then Tokyo has been reminded periodically about her reluctance to be an active player in global politics.//////A three-day SAARC conference on climate change was held in Dhaka from 1 to 3 July, where the ministers and experts of South Asian countries resonated the judicious demands of developing nations to adapt vis-a-vis the impacts of the climate change.

According to this definition, our environment consists of living plants, animals and microorganisms and non-living elements such as air, water and soil.

Although the Soviet Union and the West fought together against the Axis powers, they fell apart soon after the War on ideological issues that translated into a global struggle for power and influence. The so-called Cold War started; its beginning marked somewhat by Winston Churchill's Iron Curtain speech on 5 March 1946 in a small college in Fulton, Missouri, USA, where he said, "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent." //////The name Third World was coined during the Cold War to refer to nations that did not belong to the First and Second Worlds - First World being the Western countries, while the Second World was the Soviet Union and its allies. //////Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941), one of the most widely travelled persons of his age, visited Japan three times: in 1916, in 1924 and in 1929. It is worth mentioning here that Rabindranath's visits may be counted as five since on his away back in 1916 and 1929 he landed in Japan. Before him, we had some more people from the Bangla-language zone visiting Japan and writing on different aspects of the country, but Rabindranath's visit became a milestone in the timeline of Japan-Bengal, i.e., Japan-India relations. During his five tours the myriad-minded author met a huge number of people, from the prime Mmnister of Japan to lesser mortals, among whom were writers, artists, musicians, educationists, politicians, and journalists He delivered a good number of lectures and befriended a number of Japanese. All his lectures, explanations, references and related information have been bound in two covers by Supriya Roy, a dedicated worker of the Rabindra-Bhabana, the Tagore Memorial Museum and Archive and Research Centre of Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan, India.//////The book under review is a pioneering work in the area of corruption in public universities in Bangladesh, although corruption and public universities are both old institutions in Bangladesh. This work basically originated as a research report on corruption in the public universities sponsored by Transparency International Bangladesh and conducted by Muhammad Yeahia Akhter. The author himself is a professor at a premier public university in the country and has been working in the area of corruption studies in Bangladesh. Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) also is a very familiar and prominent organization working in the area of corruption. TIB has been working very sincerely in this field in the form of conducting research on corruption at the macro and micro levels in the country. It has focused on many nationally important institutions and organizations, such as the Chittagong Port, government ministries, departments, etc., and on preparing reports, publishing them and disseminating systematically gathered information to the public. Muhammad Yeahia Akhter also has done other work on corruption in Bangladesh and has published books on diverse issues in this area of national importance. The present work therefore is the result of a laborious effort on the part of both TIB and the author.//////One Hundred Years of Solitude is 'perhaps the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since the Don Quixote of Cervantes' --- Pablo Neruda//////A fortunate concatenation of circumstances has enabled this reviewer to know about and meet some of the most famous literary and intellectual personalities of Bangladesh and West Bengal since the 1950s. Among them is Syed Mujtaba Ali. And because of this chain of circumstances and blessed by good fortune, I was able to attend the wedding ceremony, in 1951, of Syed Mujtaba Ali with Rabiah Aly, who was my mother's friend and classmate. And then, only last week, quite by happenstance, I came across Golam Mostaquim, who presented me with his book on Syed Mujtaba Ali (first published in 1995). This memoir of Syed Mujtaba Ali by a 'civil savant' is an unlikely delight. Mostaquim is now a senior officer in the Bangladesh administration, but I have known him for long, as he hails from my ancestral home, the sub-divisional town of Manikganj, now a district headquarters. //////
