We believe by saying so she has struck the right chord with the public who expect to see an end to politics of confrontation and the beginning of a parliament turning into a centre of national affairs and activities. Interestingly, both the two major political parties have included some common but major problems on their election manifestos that were not solved by either of the parties when they were in power alternatively since 1991. We hope this time around, they will assist one another in removing those impediments to development. On their part, opposition lawmakers laid emphasis on discharging their duties diligently having full faith in and allegiance to Bangladesh. It is refreshing to learn that they have also pledged not to allow personal interests to affect their duties. //////PLANNING Minister Air Vice-Marshall (Retd) AK Khandaker gave an impression after Tuesday's ECNEC meeting that Annual Development Programme (ADP), 2008-09 adopted by former caretaker government in July last year would not be revised by the new government. Most of the projects envisaged in it will continue, with minor modifications, to ensure quality of implementation. In other words, the basic developmental rationale and prioritisation pattern of the ADP have met with an approval from the new government, somewhat a break with the tradition of trivialising, if you like, any work of a previous government. This is not surprising though, inasmuch as it was the product of a technocratic, rather than a political, government.//////OPTIMISTS hold the view that gross national happiness has to be accorded priority, now that an overwhelming people's mandate has been achieved. For happiness of the countless multitudes that enthusiastically exercised their choice at the hustings, the time has come to ask ourselves if we had too much government and too little administration; indeed too many public servants and too little public service and too many laws and too little justice? //////IT is generally agreed that the French have had a good European Union Presidency (till the end of 2008). Despite the conflict in Georgia and the continuing economic catastrophe on both sides of the Atlantic and other regions of the world, French President Sarkozy was able to handle emerging problems with a degree of maturity that had not been anticipated. In a manner of speaking it signalled not only his political renaissance but also underlined the need for the EU to have a strong political leadership. It is true that some of France's decisions were seen as unilateral and might have led to some coolness between the German and French governments but that should not be over-dramatised.//////IT'S time we look at ourselves. India is entering the 60th year of its becoming a sovereign republic. All citizens were promised justice, liberty and fraternity. It is a long story of failure in many ways. //////"People only remember the wins, not the close matches," Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful heaved a sigh in disappointment after their heartbreaking two-wicket defeat at the hands of Sri Lankan in the tri-nation final at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday. //////The Sri Lankan cricket team will leave for home with more questions than answers after the poor show by the much-vaunted top-order batting despite winning the Test series against Bangladesh and a tri-nation one-day tournament.////// -- //////Cricket, as in any other game, and that too in a tournament final, has no place for the cowardly. In a situation yesterday (Friday) from where Bangladesh would have recorded a sort of 'first' by winning a competition of big boys featuring the much-respected Sri Lankan Lions, the Tigers skipper Mohammad Ashraful opted to hand over the ball to series debutant Rubel Hossain in the penultimate over, while the poor pacer was still reeling from (surprise, surprise) batsman Muttiah Muralidaran's battering in the rookie's immediate previous over when the bowler went for twenty. How wise was that for a captain who basks in the reputation of scoring a fifty every twenty innings, and a hundred every forty? Or, am I being too generous?//////A first-half strike by Ismail Zahed gave Chittagong Abahani a 1-0 away win over Rahmatganj in the Citycell B.

The loss of McKenzie and Duminy left South Africa in big trouble, as they needed 50 from six overs with three wickets in hand, but Morkel and Johan Botha used the batting PowerPlay to perfection to get them home with three balls to spare.//////Virender Sehwag's match-winning 201 not out against Sri Lanka, and Dale Steyn's 5 for 67 at the MCG, which helped South Africa win a series in Australia for the first time, have been voted the best Test performances of 2008 by the Cricinfo jury. Sehwag's double-hundred won the prize for the Test Batting Performance of the year by a whisker from Graeme Smith's series-winning 154 not out against England at Edgbaston.//////India's schedule for next month's New Zealand series, announced Thursday, has raised questions over the lack of any practice match through the 48-day tour. An extra Test was included in the revised schedule -- comprising three Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 matches -- in place of the practice game that was originally scheduled, leaving no opportunity

It's not about WWII survivors or tragically flawed geniuses. It doesn't star Kate Winslet, Cate Blanchett, or Meryl Streep. Instead, "Slumdog" has no big-name Hollywood actors, a miniscule budget, and a good chunk of the flick was shot in Hindi. Racking up four awards at the recent Golden Globes, plus taking home five trophies at the Critics' Choice Awards, "Slumdog Millionaire" has become an unlikely front-runner for Oscar gold. So why has this movie, which as late as last spring looked like it might be released straight to DVD, become such a huge hit with both critics and audiences in the West? Here are a few reasons://////THE photograph of a woman in tears, watching helplessly as her car was being vandalised, was very moving. A report published on Jan. 11 last indicated that the students of Titumir college vandalised about 150 vehicles in an area spreading over 2 km. The people are certainly shocked at the way the students and some outsiders unleashed their rage at the unconfirmed news of death of a female student.//////IN his recent article, Mr. Muhammad Zamir suggested to use ICT for addressing the root causes of poverty (The Daily Star 20 December 2008). Indeed, over the last several decades, poverty alleviation has continued to remain the main policy agenda, and therefore the main recipient of the annual budget as well as the main destination of international support, in almost all countries of Asia-Pacific region. In spite of the sizable budget allocations, from governments as well as donors, no significant achievement has appeared in reducing poverty, or enhancing self-reliant capacity of the countries to reduce poverty on their own. //////SABRE-rattling by nuclear power Israel against impoverished Palestinians in Gaza strip with the aim of containing growing influence of Hamas is her latest bloody incursion. This barbaric act of aggression by Israel has evoked protests by Palestinians and Arabs around the world, while world community is regrettably witnessing indiscriminate bombardment by Israel against innocent people, including women and children. No concrete action by UN Security Council has yet been taken to stop bloodshed in Gaza because of Bush administration which has adopted dilly-dally tactics to allow Israel continue the incursion to destroy base of Hamas in Gaza strip. The same tactics was adopted by Bush administration when Israel invaded Lebanon to punish the Hezbullah in 2006.//////THE millennium development goal (MDG) calls for universalisation of primary education by 2015. The effort towards universalisation of elementary education in Bangladesh is really making impressive progress. But we are still facing severe deficiencies in the quality of primary education. This is because of gradual marginalisation of the government primary schools.//////WASTE disposal methods have rapidly been changed since last decade in many developing countries, and our country is also following the same way of controlled disposal of waste. Increasing amount of different forms of waste is coming out from different urban areas of Bangladesh; especially solid waste generation is mounting proportionately with the growth of urban population. Most of the wastes go to the specific places called Dumping Ground or Waste Ground, which are also scientifically known as Landfill Sites. //////PRESENT Social Safety Net Programmes (SSNPs) protect vulnerable people against economic shocks and have a bias for the economic approach towards livelihood, more preciously in the form of grants in kind or cash or some work provisions for food or cash. It has been conceptualized keeping in mind the economic issue like income generation, overshadowing other equally important aspects of life like water, sanitation, nutrition, education and health (psychosocial care) that are frequently affected by climate change. The solution is to redesign safety nets in Bangladesh in ways that would increase their benefit for poor and vulnerable households coping with disasters and climate change. Addressing new vulnerabilities from climate change requires diversification of safety nets in order to reduce risk and increase resilience of people across the country.//////IN Bangladesh forest lands account for only 17 percent of total land area that includes classified and unclassified state lands and homestead forests and tea/rubber gardens. In case of private forests, the data represent the tree-covered areas. Of the 2.52 million hectare forest land, Forest Department manages 1.52 million hectare which includes Reserved, Protected and Acquired forest and Mangrove forest on the newly accreted land in estuaries of major rivers. The remaining 0.73 million hectare of land designated as Unclassed State Forest (USF) is under the control of Ministry of Land. Village forests (homestead land) form the most productive tree resource base in the country and accounts for 0.27 million hectare.//////Tareq looked out of the window. The air was humid and the sky somewhat overcast, but he decided against taking an umbrella. As he picked up his keys his wife Latifa called out: Buy some ghee and sugar on your way homeI want to make some shuji for our guests this evening.//////In Henry Louis Vivien Derozio (1809-31) we have one of the originary figures of modern India, a legend since his precocious boyhood. In his five years (1826-31) as a teacher at the Hindu College he left his stamp on a band of young radicals who transmitted his influence to many more. Forced to resign by the College authorities, under pressure from irate parents, he launched a newspaper that spoke up for a beleaguered Eurasian community, but within months was snuffed out by cholera. It is as a poet, though -- the first published Indian poet in English -- that Derozio should be chiefly considered, especially now that there is a revival of interest in the earlier Indian English poets, signaled by the appearance over the past decade or so of a number of critical studies and anthologies. //////(Translated by Farhad Ahmed)//////Bangladesh has recently introduced a new combination vaccine that will protect its children against five killer diseases in one injection, including, for the first time, the deadly bacterium Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) that causes some severe forms of pneumonia and meningitis.//////Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) is a bacterium that causes serious disease in young children throughout the world.//////A new study from Bangladesh published in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal shows that routinely vaccinating infants against H. influenzae type b (Hib), a bacterium that causes deadly Hib pneumonia and meningitis, could save hundreds of thousands of children in Asia.//////Dr. Rana Hajjeh, Director of the Hib Initiative at Johns Hopkins University shared her views with Star Health in a telephone interview.//////Dr. Samir Saha, Head of the Department of Microbiology at Dhaka Shishu Hospital and Executive Director of Child Health Research Foundation in Bangladesh commented, With the introduction of Hib vaccine, we are now one step forward meeting the MDG-4.//////Bangladesh's Permanent Representative in Geneva described the recent and continuing Israeli military operations in Gaza medieval carnage in modern times in a special session of the UN Human Rights Council called to discuss the continued massacre of Gazans, including women and children, by the Israeli armed forces. Voices of condemnation of Israel's actions have resonated round the world but to no avail as Israel seems hell bent to annihilate Hamas' ability in future to launch rocket strikes inside Israeli territory no matter what it takes.//////On December 29, 2008 Israel started a large-scale aerial bombardment on Gaza strip to push back Hamas and halt its rocket attacks into Southern Israel. This unilateral Israeli step has initiated another war in the Middle East causing severe humanitarian crisis in the already war-torn and tainted region. For one more time, Palestine is flooded with bloodshed, atrocity and genocide by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Simultaneously, we have seen a more silent Arab World this time along with an all-time silenced United Nations and world community (despite their so-called diplomatic efforts). We are also the spectator of the US's blind endorsement to the Zionist government one more time. //////The current crisis in Gaza began with Israel breaking the ceasefire with Hamas on November 4, 2008. The five-month ceasefire was unsustainable for two reasons.//////WHEN he lived, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was a complex figure for those who observed his rise and fall. Thirty years after his execution by a military regime, he remains that way. There are his fans, largely within Pakistan, who have consistently believed that he is a shaheed, a martyr, in the defence of democracy. And then there are those who remain convinced that having ridden to power on the slogan of democracy, he did everything he could to bury it under his civilian dictatorship.//////IT takes a bold writer to tackle a hackneyed theme and repackage it in fresh wrappings so that the most jaded reader finds the story imaginative. For the most part, Kira Salak is that writer, giving us a contemporary version of Joseph Conrad's classic ////// (1903); engaging readers a hundred years after Conrad provoked his readers.
