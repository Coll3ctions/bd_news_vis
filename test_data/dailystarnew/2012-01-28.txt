I also surmised from her tone that she can't believe that she is in Dhaka, our favorite city, or worse, she might even have wanted to make me jealous about the fact that she was in Dhaka while I was stuck in frozen Boston. I felt a little painfor not being with her when she took her first breath on this visit to Dhaka, the air we breathed when we first met; for not being able to share her joy of being back in Dhaka, a city I love and know so well; accentuated by the gradual realization that she will go out of the airport and see Dhaka in its glory and feel its pulse, and enjoy the sights and sounds of Dhaka. All these happening without me by her side! Of not being there in Dhaka to partake of the pleasure she takes in being in Dhaka and losing herself in Dhaka. //////It was dark.
