In fact, the first meeting with the Workers Party of Bangladesh (WP) and subsequently with Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh (BDB) has opened a new window of opportunity for everyone towards resolving the ongoing political stalemate, especially centering around the issue of holding elections within the stipulated time. We believe both the government and the two political parties deserve a pat on the back for taking the first steps to set the ball rolling. It is now for the others to follow suit. This perhaps needs to be said that the entire nation was waiting for the dialogue to start, considering that it is something that the political parties have been demanding for quite some time. //////It is a typical syndrome with civic, industry monitoring and environmental bodies that the firmness with which they take a decision would invariably taper off into a whimper as the dusts blown by newspaper reports would settle down.

The distance between the island and Teknaf (the head of mainland) is about 34 km. It is said that in 1926, the District Collector of the British government Mr. Martin brought this island under settlement record following which the island was named St. Martin's Island. Local people call this island NARIKEL JINJIRA because of large production of coconut in the island. The north portion of the island is called Cheradia Dwip, because during high tide, this portion of the island is separated from the other and also considered as the last southern landmark of Bangladesh (Fig 1)002E//////Bangladesh faces a number of environmental problems due to its geographical location and setting, high density of population, poor socio-economic development, inefficient resource management and institutional framework. A study on Bangladesh state of environmental has been able to identify five environmental issues on a priority basis as points of national concern. On the basis of the methodology used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which is termed Pressure-State-Impact-Response (P-S-I-R) framework analysis, these key environmental issues have been critically analyzed. Some appropriate and necessary responses with regards to policies/programmes will be proposed so as to alleviate further environmental deterioration, thereby enhancing and modifying the environmental conditions positively, as well as improving the environmental quality of life in Bangladesh.//////There seems to be a great spurt of cultural activity in the city from literary, music and other events at the T2 Caf, I had written about earlier and last weekend, there was a well-attended panel discussion on ////// edited by Niaz Zaman and Asif Farrukhi.

I cannot presume to imagine/comment upon what anyone from Bangladesh might have to say about this, but from this my own perspective I think the book can go a long way towards generating a meaningful dialogue. //////One of the areas that the caretaker government has not turned its reformist glance at is the exorbitant taxes imposed on imported books by Bangladesh, as well as the indiscriminate way various governmental agencies apply it. It results in untold miseries for booksellers in terms of customs clearance and confusion about categories of books liable for taxation (textbooks on Shakespeare, for example, may be taxed by one not-too-bright customs officer while let go under a loophole by another). It also has resulted in an ever-diminishing supply of quality books into Bangladesh and a consequent pauperization of its intellectual and literate bases, never too strong to begin with. Good foreign books are in short supply. They have become hideously expensive, a situation that causes outrage when one reflects on the fact that Bangladesh has the highest tax rate on imported books in the whole of South Asia. How can the Nepalese and Sri Lankese (both in far more roiling national turmoil than us) pay less for the same book? And why? Additional outrage is fueled by the knowledge that such taxes were originally imposed by unscrupulous elements in the domestic book publishing industry by lobbying past governments in order to have a captive market for their products. While their protectionist efforts were directed at books from West Bengal ('if you can't match them, ban them' is the motto here), the indiscriminate application of such a duty meant that nearly all categories of imported books came under the ax. No amount of appeals to previous authorities, indifferent to issues of books and literacy, held hostage hand and foot by publishing lobbies, managed to have it even reviewed, let alone rescinded. //////For a moment I thought it was just another bundle of old clothes//////Until suddenly it made a movement//////As if to prove to itself that there was still//////Something living within.//////The nagging pains and physical limitations of the more than 100 forms of arthritis are common to millions of people.

India has proved itself to be one of the most vibrant democracies in the world. The US, on the other hand, emerged from the Cold War not as a country with unchallenged economic power and political influence, but as a superpower with unmatched military firepower. Many in the US felt that the country had overextended itself in international affairs at the cost of domestic issues and argued in favour of reviving the country's economic competitiveness, educational excellence and law and order situation. //////CURRENTLY, both the Israeli and the US doctrines are to maintain the status quo.

He was only fifty four. His death left us speechless in grief. A writer of rare quality, he was perhaps the most gifted storyteller of his generation. In fact he was one of the all-time best Bangladeshi writers of fiction. Like James Joyce, Manik Banerjee, Kamalkumar Majumder, Syed Waliullah and Syed Shamsul Huq, he was a writer's writer. Writing his fiction in the trend of magic realism, he emerged as the pioneer of this Latin American genre in Bangladesh. He was a bachelor. Poet Golam Faruq Khan, who was quite close to him, compares him with a tree of flowers which has fragrance but has no fruit. Let me assure Khan that Zahir the writer bore fruits which will live for a hundred years or more and fascinate writers and readers for many, many years in the future. //////Writing in English is no longer the patrimony of the Anglo Saxons. Under British colonial rule, English travelled almost the whole world, producing lots of writers in that King's language. The number is multiplying with the rise of postcolonial/diasporic consciousness. The situation is as if coloniser Prospero (The Tempest) is being rewritten by colonised Caliban with the same language the latter was taught by the former for utilitarian purposes. The Empire is writing back to its Centre (Rushdie). And thus is the number of writers in English rising across the globe. Bangladesh too is not lagging behind. The trend initiated in India by Raja Rammohon Roy and enriched by R.K.Narayan, Mulk Raj Anand, Nirad C. Chaudhuri et al has naturally flowed down to Bangladesh. This can quite justifiably be called 'English Writing in Bangladesh' regardless of any nomenclature. Adib Khan, Kaiser Haq, Razia Khan Amin and Tahmima Anam have emerged as the vanguard of this trend. //////I must confess to a certain weakness for works of fiction by women authors.//////This is a revealing biography of Amrita Sher Gil, who has remained a symbol of modern Indian art since the early twentieth century. Sher Gil's passionate intensity and devotion to art placed her at the core of aesthetics in the Indian sub-continent in the early 1930s. In her unfortunately short life, she blazed across the Indian art scene and challenged the landscape of Indian thoughts, feelings and imagination. She gave a touch of the modern to and a fresh look at Indian modern art. The book deals extensively with the ins and outs of the painter. One can easily finish reading it in one sitting owing to its soothing and alluring language. The writer has tried to draw on all aspects of Sher Gil's brief life in her engaging work. //////
