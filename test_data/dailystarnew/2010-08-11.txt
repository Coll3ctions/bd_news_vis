Whereas it used to be of one-hour duration it has now aggravated into between five and six hours. And, to top it off, the frequency of outages has accentuated with too many bursts of power snapping shut over a 24-hour cycle. If this is the situation in the capital city, what it is like in the rural areas can be easily conjured up. The ensnaring crisis is rooted in the deficit of gas supply to power plants and a growing mismatch between the demand for and the generation of power. The government sounds resigned to the unmanageability of the crisis. If that's so, then how confidence can be instilled in the people's mind about a possible way out of the crisis sooner rather than later? //////THE government circular banning the use of physical

Being furious Shahed swooped on his father and hacked him to death with the sharp weapon at around 10:30am.

The government has fixed it at Tk 3,000 after discussing elaborately with all parties concerned. But there is no logic to give them this enhanced salary from November 01.//////One way to get rid of load shedding in private houses could be use of solar energy by public houses. The government can bring some relief to common people's household by making mandatory use of solar energy in shopping malls, garment factories, educational institutions, banks, multinationals and other big corporate houses. For installing a solar panel in individual households is a costly affair, but these big profit-making enterprises can easily install solar panels and use energy from this source for their own consumptions. This practice will then reduce the pressure and demand on existing electric supply and can be diverted to individual households. This will also increase the volume of electricity users, especially in rural areas. //////The above caption could be a marvellous promotional slogan for a transportation company to proclaim their punctuality and level of service. But I have chosen the above to describe the ever-fleeting entity of our life, Dhaka, electricity. To be good to its name, it comes and goes with electrifying speed; and with a perpetual sense of regularity and punctuality.//////Good governance is the need of the hour, where there would be no political interference and the entire system should be so smooth that there would be no delay in delivery system. The civil society should be a participant and stakeholder in governance. To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage and kindness. What we choose to emphasize will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places -- and there are so many -- where people behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don't have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of the present, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvellous victory. //////This matter was reported in some dailies on 3rd August, based on BUET's report on the accident, where two public officials lost their lives! The report identified two major reasons for the head-on collision. One was poor roof safety design of the Pajero jeep assembled by Progoti Industries Ltd, a public enterprise. The other was related to lapses of the driver, who was although in the front, did not suffer a fatal injury! Also, the guard sitting on the front seat, beside the driver, escaped with minor injuries! //////I want to say something about Nimtoli inferno.//////Almost every day we see in the newspapers police charging batons heavily on people, irrespective of male, female, student, pedestrian, rickshaw/bus passengers etc. for maintaining law and order! //////Still we remember February 18, 1969. Professor Samsuzzoha of Rajshahi University was killed by the police when he tried to save his students from getting shot. February 18 is now observed as Zoha Day. He said to police, Your bullets will pierce my heart first, before they hit any of my students. //////Some days back, I took part in a discussion. A female student-- presently studying MA in English in Chittagong College-- opined, ''Actually, I want to marry such a person as would be more qualified than me.''//////I just could not believe my eyes when I read the news on Al Jazeera. It said that the soldier who was responsible for killing 5 people on the aid carrying ship heading towards Gaza is in the line for a bravery medal. Nine people were killed from close range, they were shot on their heads and their backs. When people all over the world are stunned by this cruel action and demonstrating against Israel, it is awarding bravery medals for killing innocent unarmed people! It is not an act of bravery but an act of cowardice.//////My grandmother is a respectable old lady who has seen many days, ups and downs and walked through the long way of the world. She always says "jar jar poshak tar tar." She is religious and does not miss her prayers. She went to hajj twice and intends to visit the holy land again. To me, her opinion counts and I have always admired her. And in my personal opinion, when it comes to lifestyle and attire, people should be given freedom to choose his or her own. //////This refers to the letter by Nur Jahan, on August 02. It is both amusing and sad to see the way our politicians change the definition of things according to the position of their party. It is not only hartal, our very expensive, national parliament also gets the same treatment from our politicians. When they are in the government they develop an extra-lubricated, honey-coated love for our parliament. But as soon as they lose the election and go in the opposition, they suddenly develop an acute phobia for it! //////The students of Chittagong University were protesting the hike in tuition fees. It is debatable whether they were doing right or wrong. But the way the university authorities handled the matter was uncivilised. Different newspapers published photos of police brutality on students including female students which is not expected in a university.//////One can go to downtown Dhaka from Uttara with only Tk 6.00 as travelling cost and comparatively within a shorter time. This was absurd to me till I travelled from Airport Railway Station to Kamalapur station by train on 13 July at a cost of Taka 6 only. This will be unbelievable to many in this time of high living costs. //////I refer to your article published on 3rd August. Firstly, I express my condolence for the families of the Secretary of the Women and Children Affairs Ministry, the BSCIC chairman, and hundreds of other families who have lost their loved ones in unnecessary tragedies on the roads of Bangladesh.//////Before discovery of the Bibiyana Gas Field, Titas was the biggest field in Bangladesh which started to produce gas from 1968. The initial gas in Titas field was 6.36 trillion cubic feet(TCF). 3.16 TCF gas has already been produced. Twenty-five percent of total requirement of gas in Bangladesh comes from this field. But now it is facing serious problems. The reservoir engineer and the reservoir geologist have detected the problem. The problem is that a huge amount of water is being produced during gas production from Well-14 which is known as seepage of water. At the beginning of this situation, the geologist assumed that the amount of water was not too much. But later it was found to be too much.//////The other day while I was going to WVA Friday clinic, Dhanmondi, I took a CNG auto-rickshaw. The roads were empty and I noticed the CNG driver's rough driving. While talking to him I noticed he was behaving abnormally. I asked him whether he was intoxicated or not, whether he took drugs to which he answered, 'I won't lie to you, you are a doctor, I take alcohol with my friends, but only in the night, so there is no problem now, you can relax Madam'. I asked him whether he smoked Cannabis (Ganja) to which he said, 'Yes, but don't worry, please relax'. I told him about the serious bad effects i.e. that it could lead to death. He replied, life and death comes from Allah-however, my wife is very good, she tolerates everything. At that point I wanted to get down from his vehicle-but no other CNG was available. //////The prime minister's decision to form a separate ministry for Bangladesh Railway is a pragmatic one. Certainly, this bold and timely decision in the backdrop of universal demand in the country will add another feather to her cap and therefore, she certainly deserves congratulations from the countrymen. We are now eagerly awaiting necessary legal and administrative formalities to form the ministry in no time so that it can start functioning as soon as possible. The bureaucracy is the only agency which can create impediment in implementing the proposal and therefore all concerned should be careful about it. The prime minister may kindly consider dynamic and dedicated leaders to head this important ministry to take charge of this most problematic transport sector and put the railway back on the track. We are eagerly awaiting prime minister's quick actions to implement her historic decision for the welfare of the people.//////Heartiest congratulations to A.H.M. Noman Khan on his being awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award 2010. This recipient of Asia's most prestigious award is an extra ordinary person who has proved that he speaks through his work, not through any other means, and that he works for the suffering humanity and not for self aggrandizement. //////The road pattern of Dhaka city is not planned. In planning stage, road network should be developed first before developing an area. If that is so then the road network planner can implement his/her plan. But in most of the cases the areas of Dhaka city have been developed without proper planning. Residential, commercial, industrial all activities are mixed in a area which is very difficult and complicated to handle.

And then, of course, there are those who feel that he ought to have been a dash diplomatic about it, seeing that Pakistan is these days in a difficult situation battling monsters of various sorts. There are the Taliban. There is the insidious ISI, always in the role of a parallel government. And now there are the floods. //////Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's visit to Dhaka on August 7 should not be considered only in terms of the $1 billion loan agreement signed.
