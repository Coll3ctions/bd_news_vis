Keeping that in mind, a walk from Jatrabari to Sayedabad is exactly what the doctors prescribed. The construction of the Mayor Mohammad Hanif flyover has narrowed the main road to such a limit that pedestrians must limbo through the frameworks of the under-construction monstrosity to avoid the approaching vehicles as well as the waterlogged potholes of the sidewalk. And all this while keeping a balance on the mud creases on the sidewalk due to constant drizzles in the past few days.//////At least 50 people were injured and production at five ready-made garment factories in Ashulia, on the outskirts of the capital, remained suspended yesterday due to clashes between police and workers.//////At least 107 people were killed in bomb and gun attacks in Iraq yesterday in a coordinated surge of violence against mostly Shia Muslim targets.//////The High Court yesterday extended by three more months its previous stay order on holding the Dhaka City Corporation (north and south) polls since the authorities did not implement or even replied to its earlier directives.//////Rapid Action Battalion early yesterday arrested Mahtab Khamaru, a key leader of outlawed militant group JMB, from Talgharia village in Bagmara upazila here. //////Cutting back on salty foods such as bacon, bread and breakfast cereals may reduce people's risk of developing stomach cancer, according to the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF).//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will pay an official visit to UK beginning tomorrow to attend the opening ceremony of London 2012 Olympic Games.//////The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday interrogated three top officials of Bangladeshi sub-agents of the New Zealand-based consulting firm Maunsell AECOM Ltd in connection with the alleged corruption in Padma bridge project.//////President Barack Obama paid emotional tribute Sunday to the victims and survivors of the Aurora cinema massacre, as the shaken US town held a tearful vigil for the 12 dead filmgoers.//////Police yesterday charged batons on the orphans of Natore Sarkari Shishu Sadan in Bonbelghoria area leaving 15 of them injured. //////We welcome the news that the government is considering restoring the common lowest slab facility for all consumers. This is an overriding issue which we think should have been addressed much before. With the common lowest slab withdrawn since March, consumers now are faced with a steep rise in their monthly electricity bills at a time when spiraling prices of essentials are adding to their woes. In the month of Ramadan, the situation has only worsened. Therefore, instead of merely thinking about it, the government must immediately implement it and restore the common lowest slab facility in order to relieve consumers of hefty electricity bills.//////The election of Pranab Mukherjee as president of India is important for a couple of reasons. In the first place, it is reflective of the clout the veteran Bengali politician has had on Indian politics, given his experience in government. In the second, it promises to be a marked change from how the presidency has been looked upon in the past five years under Pratibha Patil, against whom allegations of impropriety have been levelled on a fairly regular basis. Mukherjee's elevation to the presidency is also significant in light of the fact that he did not have the unanimous support of all political parties. His rival P.A. Sangma did not have a chance against him, of course. Even so, Mukherjee would have been happier had a wholesale consensus built up around him. There is too the belated support he drew from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.//////The Bangladesh anthem rang out and the red and green flag was hoisted at the Olympics, for the first and probably only time, as London 2012 officially welcomed the Bangladeshi contingent to the Games via an interactive Team Welcome Ceremony held at the Olympic Village in London on Monday.//////The mood in England ahead of the Olympics was significantly lifted yesterday.

What if he is cautioned that each emotional second will reduce money from his bank account? A fantasy indeed, but Shahzad Ferdous' text Shylock and Sycophants counts such imaginary helplessness of an individual-- seeking his self-identity in the time period, when globalisation is a talked about phenomenon.//////Actress Jotika Joti is busy with shoots almost every day.

To the rest of the country, Bashar is better known as "Bessho," (baby Bashar). Despite having lost three of his closest confidantes in what was undoubtedly an audacious attack inside one of the most heavily guarded sites in Damascus, the national security headquarters, Bashar hangs on to power defying the world. Both the serving defence minister and deputy defence minister and a former defence minister were taken out by a suicide bomb. This coupled with a string of top military leaders totalling some 24 generals defecting in the last couple of weeks had both the opposition and foreign observers believing Bashar was done for. Unfortunately, things are seldom that simple in the Middle East. Bashar still has his younger brother Maher al-Assad, commander of the army's Fourth Division, who has driven rebel forces out of a Damascus district. As long as Maher commands, Bashar has hope.//////Growing violence against Indian women, such as the aggravated sexual assault on a young student in Guwahati, has deeply shocked the public.

However, the principal strength of that struggle came from the unparalleled election victory of Awami League, led by its charismatic leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The popular support their leader enjoyed was unheard of in a Western democracy."//////As the first Chancellor of Buet, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman appointed Dr. Abdur Rashid as the first vice-chancellor of Buet in independent Bangladesh. Dr. Rashid was never an Awami Leaguer, he was chosen for his impeccable credentials as the best engineering mind in the country and a man of proven integrity and outstanding public service. It was a wise choice; Dr. Rashid ruled with humility and consensus and never permitted divisive teacher politics to vitiate the academic ambience of the university. He left behind a legacy of excellence and learning and service to the nation which, till the other day, was the pride of the nation. The choice was no accident. In 1973, Bangabandhu appointed the most outstanding Bengali physicist, Dr. Abdul Matin Chowdhury as the vice-chancellor of Dhaka University. Professor Chowdhury was never an Awami Leaguer either.//////I have not read a single book by Mr. Ahmed in the last seventeen or eighteen years, but I remember what I read before 1995/96. Surprisingly, his style remained unchanged, or so I guess from occasional viewing of snippets of his dramas and glimpses of teaser passages from his books posted online. So, on his passing to a different dimension I feel like saying something.//////How large is the Universe? How do we measure its size? How can we even think of measuring something that is believed to be boundless? The enormity of the Universe may be beyond our comprehension, but measuring its size is not.
