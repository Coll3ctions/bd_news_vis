Our politicians have made politics a 'synonym' for corruption. 'Buying' positions in the party hierarchy is considered to be the 'safest' and most 'lucrative' investment! While in power, party leaders along with their sycophants get, as it were, an OGL (open general license) to commit all sorts of corruption ranging from extortion to land-grabbing! Profiteering by hiking up prices is the be-all and end-all of our businessmen! In the government. offices, flattery or greasing the plam is a must for smooth movement of files from one table to another! For making 'quick money' our law-enforcers can anytime change from their role of 'protectors' to 'predators'! In our banks, share markets and financial houses, 'looters' are lying in wait for the 'booty'! Our highest seats of learning have become the 'hunting ground' for corrupt educationists! Transcending our national boundary, our corruption spree is now scaling 'international heights', thanks to some of our 'pious' high-ups!//////In recent years, the number of Internet users has increased tremendously.

Instead it was the product of a sequence of provocations, some mysterious, some obvious. It seemed to start in the US, then became magnified in Egypt and was brought to a deadly and sorrowful climax in Libya -- all on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. The cast of characters in this tragedy included a shadowy filmmaker, a sinister pastor in Florida, an Egyptian-American Islamophobe, an Egyptian TV host, politically powerful Islamist extremist groups and, just possibly, an al-Qaeda affiliate in Libya. The instigators and executors didn't work in concert; they probably didn't even know they were in cahoots.

That prediction may have a long way to go, but some people are using workers' interest as an excuse to squander public money. Every time we discuss loan defaulters or swindlers in this country, someone wants to give them reprieve because breadcrumbs falling off their tables justify voracious eating. //////The latest round of India-Pakistan ministerial-level parleys reminds one of the element of niggardliness in the subcontinent's culture that has given currency to quite a few sayings about the reluctant offerings of goat milk.//////The outrage is absolute in its origin, manifestation and backlash. The cause and effect relationship has already proven dire. With perhaps more to come, the reservoir of sanity has to overpower the sleazy video of insanity. //////Globally, Bangladesh is equally acknow-ledged as a country with high poverty and disaster vulnerability and as a good performer in disaster management. Bangladesh started its disaster management policy and institutional reform in mid-nineties but unfortunately did not gain much success in the policy front except the Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) first issued in 1997. By 2010, SOD -- the only government approved policy document the country had -- did not carry much legal value in absence of an Act. //////It is occasionally a peculiar coincidence that a very close friend of mine leaves this mortal world while my wife and I are away from the country. //////Revolutions can be exciting, but sometimes evolution can be even more powerful.
