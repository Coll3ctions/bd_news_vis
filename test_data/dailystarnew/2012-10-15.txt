The question paper leak of the 33rd Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) examination has brought before us some long-lasting problems which need to be resolved urgently.

The excuse was that BTV had bought the rights to telecast World T20 matches in Bangladesh.

Several times the replay of a dismissal was not shown because of BTV's commercial approach. When the matches were of less importance, such as South Africa vs. Zimbabwe, the advertisement level was tolerable. But when Bangladesh or other strong nations were playing, it seemed the match was being shown between the advertisement breaks.
