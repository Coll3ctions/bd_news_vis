trees damaged in the Sundarbans by Cyclone Sidr is welcome. With reports coming in from such places as Sharankhola and Chandpai about the machinations by individuals within the forestry department to dispose of the damaged trees, obviously with ulterior motives in mind, it is necessary that such severe measures be in place. It must also be borne in mind that the forestry department is on record as being an organisation where wholesale corruption has been the norm for years altogether. That makes the case for action to save the damaged parts of the Sundarbans that much more serious.//////The remains of Birshrestha Hamidur Rahman, has been brought from Tripura to Bangladesh after 36 long years since independence.

He did not quite succeed, as events were to show.//////Unending confusion grips opposition parties over assessing Musharraf regime Mark II, along with the scarcely neutral caretakers and the changes made under Emergency, PCO, and new media ordinances. It is a continuation of the previous government; it is sure to do what Musharraf wants.

God knows why. But common wisdom tells us that autocrats of all hues and colors use the nationalism card to trump democracy.

Villagers stayed in the village till 10:00pm, fighting to save their houses. When the houses started falling one by one, people started marching towards the cyclone centre forming a long line fighting the strong wind. I was carrying my infant in one hand and with the other hand I he was guiding my little niece. At one point I found my nephew Hasan following me to heels. As I had two kids to take care with my two hands, I could not look after Hasan. Forceful wind and incessant rain made everyone nervous. As soon we walked on the dam, a strong current of water wrenched away my niece from my hand. When I was looking right and left for my niece, I found Hasan was floating on the water. With one hand Hasan held a broken tree and in his other hand was my niece. When I got close to Hasan he said 'Uncle, my father is not with me, please do not leave me here, take me with you'. I assured Hasan that I would not leave him. We started walking again and soon we could see the cyclone centre just about 200 yards ahead of us. Suddenly something shook me violently and I was afloat. I took control, hugged the kids to my bosom and looked back for Hasan; he was not there. Next moment my eyes were set at a broken part of the dam. There was a whirling current of water and Hasan was in the eye of the whirl going down. I went to the cyclone centre, kept the two kids there and went back to the broken part of the dam to look for Hasan. I searched desperately for Hasan but could not find him, he was gone. Oh, if only I tied Hasan with me by a rope!  says Hasan's uncle Badsha while recalling the dark chapter of the Sidr night of 15 November 2007. At this point he threw a question at me Sir you are educated, you have studied a lot and have built this dam, still why does the dam break down? Can you not build a dam which will not collapse even during the mightiest cyclone or flood? //////I would like to thank The Daily Star for publishing the article "Time to rethink" by Afroza Ahmed regarding the next steps on handling the catastrophe of cyclone Sidr. //////In my roller coaster ride through life, of all my successes, our freedom struggle is the most pleasing experience, where I had the opportunity to take part.//////The promulgation of the amendments to the Army Act is alarming. These amendments give wide powers to military courts.

Antiquated laws that had lost their teeth through judicial reviews are now being resurrected and made punishable to be tried by the military. Trials will not be open to public hearings; lawyers will only be allowed to represent the accused in the capacity of a friend. Investigation will be carried out by military personal and ordinary rules of evidence will not apply.//////Every year thousands of people are facing road accidents. But successive governments have done little to prevent such accidents. Is it not a serious issue? How long will these continue? It is my earnest request to the Chief Adviser to cast a serious look at this matter. //////Frankly speaking, the government's mobilisation of relief activities and its handling of relief goods in the hurricane affected areas has fallen short of public expectations. Every day we see in print/electronic media how these vulnerable people are crying for help whenever they see someone. Now there is a growing danger of the outbreak of waterborne diseases due to non-availability of potable water. The situation may take a serious turn if proper care is not taken. The situation must be tackled with the participation of people from all walks of life. In order to do that I have a suggestion-- I think the government should right away invite the political parties and ask them to conduct and organise relief related works.//////Four Palestinian militants were killed across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday as Israel launched its largest operation in months in the south of the Hamas-run territory, medics and witnesses said. //////Pakistan's main alliance of Islamist parties was near collapse yesterday after cancelling a last-ditch meeting to resolve differences over a possible election boycott, party officials said. //////Sri Lanka's defence ministry has claimed its forces have killed at least 20 Tamil Tiger rebels in renewed clashes in the north, but came in for a fresh warning against seeking a military solution. //////India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has announced that Lal Krishna Advani will be its prime ministerial candidate in next general elections due in 2009.//////Cristina Fernandez was sworn in Monday as Argentina's first elected female president, completing a rare husband-wife transfer of power that the nation hopes will ensure continued recovery from an economic meltdown. //////Liberation War Museum's (LWM) weeklong programme on the occasion of our Victory Day began on December 10 at the museum premises.
