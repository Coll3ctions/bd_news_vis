Hasina is the daughter of the father of the nation while Khaleda is the wife of a former president and famous freedom fighter. Khaleda Zia owns two palacious houses (gift from government) in the posh areas of Dhaka city. Hasina lives in her husband's house.

His prowl as the most powerful Sultan that ever reigned in Pakistan, effectively silencing the voices of democracy, by rewriting the constitution, dismantling the Supreme Court, and using the military against his own people has ended up in the "caverns measureless to man/down to sunless sea: " So much for the denouement.//////Outrageous. What happened on the streets as Tarique fell in the bathroom cannot be condoned in any way. I wonder what will these goons called 'chhatra' do if Tarique is convicted and imprisoned or dies a natural death!! Are they going to kill everyone in sight and burn everything they can? I wish I could express my anger without any restriction at the way public properties and killing of people took place in the name of so called 'gonotantrik andolon'. May I ask, is Tarique Rahman's life more precious than the life of the person killed--don't call it an accident-- by the goons of the JCD? What is Tarique's contribution--as prime minister's son-- to our society, economy or country? What has Tarique done to bring change to our impoverished society? What has Tarique done to uplift the image of the country? The man who died for nothing at least contributed to the economy as a businessperson by earning his livelihood through hard work. But allegations are that Tarique only nurtured a group of cadres. If these and other allegations against Tarique are true, then I would not feel a fig of sympathy for him even if he is convicted and imprisoned. Tarique is not even a politician but a so called 'businessman' in his own words. It's time to call a spade a spade. Let there be no place for corrupt people--- whoever they are-- in society. We must introduce the capital punishment for corruption beyond a certain limit and for certain level of people. Those who proclaim to be our leaders should also be ready to face the consequences if they fail. We want a clean society for our future generation. Will our intelligentsia dare show us the way?//////Like everything else in Dhaka, the quality of life in the city has deteriorated fast due to many reasons. Looking around us, one will notice that Dhaka doesn't have sufficient number of parks where the next generation and the elderly people can go and have some fun and fresh air. I also think there is no data available in Bangladesh about the ratio of parks to population in the cities. But any sensible person can guess that we certainly do not have sufficient open spaces for the residents. Though the parks are considered the lungs of a city. This is especially true about a city like Dhaka which nests over 15 million inhabitants. //////Shahnoor Wahid's factual lament (August:19) on the brutal defilement of Dhaka city's scenic greenery is a sad document on where Dhaka has gone today. A nostalgic garden city, has been transformed into an overcrowded and polluted concrete jungle; all in the name of mindless development! Stately old trees have been murdered in cold blood; replaced by ugly high rises; coming up practically shoulder to shoulder. Even pristine areas like Ramna Green, and the model town; that was Gulshan (meaning flower garden in Persian) in the mid 1960's has now become a claustrophobic hotchpotch of trading, commercial and industrial (garments) high-rises, overshadowing and outnumbering the few residences that still linger on!//////A detailed report on the Bangladesh Film Archive was published in your daily on 22-8-2008 & 24-8-2008 entitled "Archives of Neglect".//////We read national dailies, watched TV, the people of the world also learned and saw with surprise and shock the tragic deportation of many expatriate workers from a poor country by a rich country like Kuwait.//////I would like to thank the media for providing us important news as well as creating contemporary, worthy features. Sometimes the media bring to light hypersensitive news. But the sad thing is that the media focuses on the incidents or accidents only after they take place. It is not playing any role in eliminating certain social evils like acid throwing or child labour. //////Almost all of us like to watch cricket. We have an international cricket team also. But we are ashamed of our cricketers. They are being defeated in almost all the matches. They go abroad and bring bad news for us. Some days ago they went to Australia. Why do they go abroad to bring disgrace for the country?//////To introduce myself, I am 75 years old, partially disabled and the senior-most member of Action on Disability and Development (ADD), a UK based international organisation promoting the rights of disabled people in 28 districts of Bangladesh.

Instead of doing Kalyan (welfare), they are deeply involved in harassing the landowners by debarring trucks with building materials to get access to this sector. //////Most people have no home of their own. The problem of housing is very acute these days. Some factors are responsible for this problem, such as: overpopulation, amalgamation of lands, accumulation of lands, poor distribution of lands and illegal occupation by the so called powerful people. The middle class people in the cities suffer from this problem tremendously. The problem has dehumanised the city people, especially the students of colleges and universities.//////Since the early age of Indian sub-continental history, the Hindus and the Muslims have been living in accordance with some norms and customs. As a result, some customs have been interchanged between them. Dowry is a custom of Hindus. On the other hand, in Islam a woman can inherit her father's property. //////What is really happening in Bangladesh? The heroes emerged in January 2007 and took the power over as, to them, the country had been destroyed by the corrupt politicians. Absolutely right! So they need to be punished. Yes, the money they have looted and sent abroad should be brought back and used for the development of the country. So, what was the process involved? The same old process...using power to arrest politicians, even some innocent leaders, which many people have termed as the balance of arrest drama. Arresting only politicians and sending them to jail, with no power given to judiciary. The same old story... mass arrest of opposition workers. So after a year what is the outcome? Release those who have looted money and sent it abroad? Release those who grabbed land, made the syndicate to control the market, ran a parallel administration which was more powerful than even the PM office? Release the men who had killed the opposition MPs including the most talented former finance minister? Release the elements who were actively involved in bomb blasts and even tried to kill the former PM? Release them because they are people like us, they cannot be criminalsdisgusting!//////Pakistan's army killed 40 militants in an airstrike that targeted a rebel stronghold in the country's troubled northwestern Swat region, a military spokesman said yesterday.//////A senior military commander warned yesterday that any attack on Iran would start a new world war, as Tehran pressed on with its controversial nuclear drive despite the risk of further UN sanctions.//////Chief Adviser Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed yesterday directed related agencies to make a national broadband policy which can ensure internet facilities quickly and cheaply to the people, as the country lags in the journey on the global information superhighway.//////Pressure mounted on Thailand's prime minister to resign as anti-government protesters occupied his headquarters for a fifth day Saturday and disrupted rail and air service in some of the country's popular tourist destinations. //////Britain has failed in its duty to stop the US from committing "shameful acts" in the treatment of suspects detained during the war on terror, one of America's most respected intellectuals warns yesterday.//////More than 300,000 people trapped in India's worst floods in 50 years have been rescued but nearly double that number remain stranded without food or water, officials said yesterday.//////A suicide car bomb exploded near international troops in the Afghan capital yesterday, leaving one wounded, while soldiers killed more than a dozen militants in clashes elsewhere, authorities said.//////Five million Afghans face serious food shortages with winter drawing near, but donors have put forward less than a fifth of the money needed to cope, development charity Oxfam warned yesterday.//////Predictions that Pervez Musharraf will have to flee Pakistan to escape treason charges have died along with the coalition that drove him from the presidency. //////Georgia wants the European Union to impose targeted sanctions against Russia's leaders, a top official said on Saturday, ahead of an EU summit on the crisis between Moscow and Tbilisi.//////Barack Obama and John McCain were to hold rival rallies in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania Saturday as the race for the White House intensified with McCain's surprise pick of Alaska's little-known governor, Sarah Palin, as his running mate. //////Hurricane Gustav swelled into a "dangerous" category three hurricane yesterday as it bore down on Cuba after ripping through the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica, killing 85 people.//////Terming the "cash-for-votes" scam as "incomparable and more obnoxious than Bofors", senior BJP leader L K Advani yesterday alleged it could not have happened without the knowledge and consent of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.//////Police say a land mine blast has killed at least 12 police officers in an eastern Indian Maoist rebel stronghold. //////Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday held deliberations with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and some other senior colleagues over the nuclear issue ahead of the NSG meeting in Vienna. //////Indian tycoon Krishna Kumar Birla, whose family empire spanned industries from sugar to newspapers, died Saturday at the age of 90, an aide said.//////The World Meteorological Organisation said on Friday it expects the ozone hole over Antarctica to be "normal" this year, two years after it reached record size.//////Taiwan plans to scale back its military spending in 2009 amid warming ties with rival China, it was reported yesterday.//////Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called on European governments yesterday to send more observers to Georgia, where fighting broke out this month, a Kremlin statement said.//////Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej has cancelled a planned visit to Japan next week due to the country's political unrest, according to the Japanese foreign ministry.//////Bold colours, novel technique, meticulous adherence to brush stroke, subtle expression of spirit and clear perception are the main aspects of Babul Mahmood's paintings.
