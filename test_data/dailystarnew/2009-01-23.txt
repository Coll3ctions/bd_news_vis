Although one and a half hours had elapsed since the voting began, only one ballot was cast at a polling booth at Phulbaria Govt Primary School in Savar upazila. //////Political interference and fear of clashes between candidates' followers were among the main reasons behind low turnout in yesterday's Upazila Parishad polls. //////Accusing ruling Awami League (AL) of massive irregularities in the upazila polls yesterday, BNP said AL proved it wanted to annihilate the opposition, which is nothing but a traditional characteristic of AL politics. //////The home ministry yesterday observed that upazila parishad elections were held peacefully across the country yesterday without major violent incidents. //////Awami League (AL) has claimed the Upazila Parishad elections were held peacefully across the country despite a few minor incidents.//////Several election monitoring orgainsations yesterday in preliminary findings said voters' turnout in upazila parishad polls was low and incidence of violence in polling centers overshadowed the bright achievements of the recently held national polls.//////Law enforcement agencies yesterday arrested eight people in connection with the sensational break-in at Bangladesh Railway (BR) headquarters in the capital on Saturday night. //////Bangladesh may qualify by this year for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) fund if it makes a little improvement in the fields of functional democracy, governance and economic policies and cutting corruption.//////President Prof Iajuddin Ahmed yesterday approved the '34th Annual Report-2007' of University Grants Commission (UGC) with 26 recommendations, including formation of separate wage structure for the university teachers and setting up a university teachers' training academy.//////Handcuffed to his hospital bed, indigenous leader Ranglai Mro, who was brutally tortured, has been waiting 15 days for his bail order documents to reach the jail authorities from the High Court (HC). //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday urged the Saudi government to increase their development assistance to Bangladesh and recruit larger volume of human resources from the country.//////A Dhaka court has allowed a petitioner to run advertisement in newspapers, inviting people or institutions to become parties in a case against Jamaat-e-Islami's ex-amir Golam Azam, current Amir Motiur Rahman Nizami and 34 others to declare them war criminals.//////Shakib Al Hasan has been named the top player of ICC All-rounder's ODI Championship Rankings this week following his sparkling performance with both bat and ball.//////The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday approved filing of eight corruption cases against 47 officials of Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited, formerly BTTB, on charges of illegally drawing Tk 14.13 crore and misappropriating Tk 17.26 crore.//////President Barack Obama yesterday signed three landmark executive orders mandating the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, shutting down all CIA prisons and banning the use of torture.//////A Chinese court condemned two men to death and handed a life term to a former dairy boss yesterday for their roles in the country's contaminated milk scandal, which ignited public anger and accusations of cover-ups.//////The United Nations urged Israel yesterday to reopen Gaza crossings as senior officials assessed war damage and the Jewish state warned it would strike again if Hamas rearms through smuggling tunnels.//////The reported mulling by LGRD and Cooperatives Minister Syed Ashraful Islam over formally empowering the MPs with a developmental role in the upazilas originally designed to play a pivotal role in the local government system has come as a big surprise and shock. The implication is that the amended ordinance whereby the previously assigned advisory and development role of MPs in upazilas was withdrawn through an initiative of the caretaker government is sought to be restored through another amendment. //////There is little question that Barack Obama faces a whole slew of challenges as he begins his presidency on a note of euphoria. In these past few days since his inauguration on Tuesday, America's new leader has happily demonstrated his determination to do business through living up to his campaign pledges. He has ordered prosecutors to halt all proceedings against prisoners held on Guantanamo, a directive that has been heeded by the military judges handling matters in what has turned into a symbol of notoriety. Obama's action is welcome, though many are disappointed that in the matter of those on trial on the island, proceedings have been halted for 120 days. Obviously, these individuals, many of them families of those detained, expected quicker action and so quicker justice to be done.//////NOW that the dust has settled and that we have an elected government in place, the time is right for a full inquiry into 1/11, whether on balance it was a good thing or a bad thing, what the interim government did right and what it did wrong, what lessons have been learned, and what are the implications for the future.//////MAX Fashions, a New Zealand based fashion company, with 38 retail outlets throughout the country, put up a three-story high billboard in which it called New Zealand a women's republic.

They do not care anyone, not even the UN resolution! Israeli atrocities crossed all limits. Israel deserves global condemnation.//////Since centuries freedom fighters have always fought the occupiers and invaders for their homeland. The occupiers have always termed the freedom fighters terrorists, that is what Israel is terming the freedom fighters of Palestine. Israel didn't exist before 1948, it was illegally settled on the Palestinian land with the help of western forces. If the Westerners were true friends of the Jews they would have provided or gifted a part of their own land to the Zionists. Grabbed or looted things cannot be a good gift!//////As the assault of Israel on Gaza strip that started on the Christmas eve lingered on, the death toll continued to climb. It reached a staggering figure of 850 in 16 days. In other words, Gaza has become a valley of death.
