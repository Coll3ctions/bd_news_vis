It was the sitar through which he spoke. And he spoke not through a laboured demonstration of determination to master the art, but through a spontaneous display of emotions that music often brings up in the one who lives and breathes it. //////Jagannath University (JnU) authorities yesterday expelled three students and cancelled certificates of two others for their involvement in the murder of Bishwajit Das during the opposition's roadblock on Sunday. //////Through interviewing eyewitnesses, The Daily Star has learnt the identities of three more Chhatra League activists who were involved in the killing of Bishwajit Das.//////Justice ATM Fazle Kabir is likely to return to International Crimes Tribunal-1, this time as its chairman, while Justice Obaidul Hassan is to lead Tribunal-2 where Justice Md Mojibur Rahman Miah could join.//////The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) yesterday urged the BNP-led alliance to withdraw the eight-hour hartal called for today and proposed holding dialogues to resolve political issues. //////The BNP-led 18-party opposition alliance is enforcing an eight-hour countrywide hartal from 6:00am today protesting against the arrest of BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and demanding restoration of the caretaker government system.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday urged garment factory owners to pay workers more and ensure workplace safety, as the apparel makers are making fortunes from the sector.//////Wal-Mart Stores Inc Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke said he sees no conflict between paying low prices to suppliers that source merchandise from overseas and being able to maintain safe conditions at garment factories.//////The Biswa Ijtema, one of the largest congregations of Muslims, will be held in two phases this year also, said Home Minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir yesterday.//////There will be no water crisis in the capital from today as the Sayedabad Water Treatment Plant is set to double its production.//////War crimes accused Muhammad Kamaruzzaman used to pick out detainees of a camp in Mymensingh for death as whoever he had selected disappeared later, a freedom fighter testified yesterday.//////The monthly pay order (MPO) facilities of three principals of three prominent non-government city schools have been suspended as they failed to give proper answer about returning or adjusting the extra money they charged for admission.//////The Anti-Corruption Commission is set to file a case against the people involved in the corruption conspiracy in hiring a consultant for the proposed Padma bridge project.//////After being chased allegedly by police and locals for ignoring a stop signal from a police check post, a man got drowned in the capital's Demra yesterday. //////Western and Arab nations sympathetic to Syria's uprising against President Bashar al-Assad gave full political recognition to the opposition yesterday, reflecting a hardening consensus that the uprising might be nearing a tipping point.//////The International Crimes Tribunal-1 yesterday cautioned prosecution and defence counsels and asked them not to bring any electronic devices into the courtroom.//////US doctors say they have saved a seven-year-old girl who was close to dying from leukaemia by achievement, a major international study showed on Tuesday.//////Republican lawmakers passed union-curbing "right-to-work" laws in Michigan Tuesday, prompting a rowdy protest at the capitol and outrage in a state seen as the heart of the US labor movement.//////Children with TVs in their bedrooms and their own mobile phones suffer significant falls in reading pioneering the use of an unlikely ally: a modified form of the HIV virus.//////The African Union condemned the forced resignation of Malian Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra, insisting that the army obey the authority of civilian powers, the pan-African bloc said yesterday.//////The UN yesterday called for an end to violence against children in southern Thailand following the "senseless and unacceptable" shooting of a baby girl in a region racked by nine years of unrest.//////Reactions from the fathers of the three among the killers of Biswajit Das have exposed how the politics of the day has been brutalising the young generation.

During any protest, blockade or hartal, anyone can be attacked, injured and even killed. Innocent pedestrians, naive foreigners and, yes, even the media people, who were manhandled while discharging their duties. This became apparent in the torching of a private television channel vehicle during Sunday's blockade and the assault of photojournalists from two national English dailies in Tuesday's hartal. And, while the vehicle was set ablaze by pro-blockade, opposition activists, the photojournalists were attacked by no one but a policeman. This goes to show that not only is no one not safe, but that no one is safe from anyone -- not the opposition's pro-hartal supporters, not the government's anti-hartal activists, and not even the law enforcing agencies who are delegated the duty of maintaining law and order and safety of all citizens. //////Following the end of the National Cricket League (NCL) this week, members of the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) ad-hoc committee are working on a second four-day tournament which will be contested between four franchises.
