Bangladesh benefited from low import prices, which helped to curb inflation. It benefited from increased market share for its RMG exports and has been able to position itself very well in the world market for RMG. Domestic factors also helped, including excellent agricultural performance and 'bumper' food harvests. Remittances held up -- and not just for Bangladesh. Overall, the world remittance market performed reasonably well despite the recession. //////ONCE again Dhaka has attained the dubious distinction of being the second worst polluted and unlivable city of the world by a survey conducted over 140 cities by the Economist Intelligence Group, an organisation associated with the UK based journal, The Economist. The finding of this survey reveals that Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe ranks the first position in the worst cities' category. Shockingly, Dhaka , once the hub of dream and optimism of the country, has already descended into a nightmarish metropolis. People here now feel like being driven away by an accelerating deterioration in the quality of life : clogged thoroughfares, eye-stinging smog, polluted landscapes and streets, vanishing parks and lakes, crowded yet unaffordable housing, overcrowded schools and colleges, also hospitals, polluting industries and spiralling crimes. //////Out of 1.54 million hectares of government managed forests in the country about 0.35 million hectares are hill reserves in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).

Nevertheless, this article would examine the legal implication of the Accord only from the procedural aspects of the 1992 UN Framework Conventional on Climate Change, rather than substantial contents. //////Couple of months ago, I got the opportunity of visiting Japan's largest coal-fired Hekinan Thermal Power Plant.

He was referring to not only the sweetness of the language, but also the profound use of connotation, pronunciation and the subtlety of our mother tongue. An Indo-Aryan language spoken by roughly 230 million people and ranking amongst the top spoken languages in the world on the scale of four to six, Bengali has a long tradition of absorbing the best of the foreign influences over the centuries and inter-mingling with the local dialects. //////RECENTLY I visited a bookstore. While I was rummaging through the books my eyes fell on the Archie and Classic comics. I was immediately transformed into another world, the world of my earlier reading. Other than textbooks I have always read what I enjoyed very much in agreement with L.A.G. Strong, who says in his essay, //////SAMUEL Beckett crossed the limits of decency when he compared TS Eliot to 'toilet', insisting that the reverse order of the letters of 'T Eliot' was what he wrote. The poet was thus an unfortunate victim of anagram. Eliot also received flak from other critics. He was accused of intentional complexity in poetry for perplexing his readers. Some even condemned him as unoriginal and plagiaristic. FW Bateson criticised his poetry as a manifestation of pseudo-learning. CS Lewis trashed his poetry as 'superficial and unscholarly', terming him a great evil. Ideologically, he was also charged with anti-Semitism. //////In last week's Literature section, two photographs clearly got mixed up.

Unicef estimates about 25-33 per cent of young Bangladeshi children at risk. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Unicef have given the utmost importance on it and launched a two week nationwide measles campaign in order to eradicate the disease from the country.//////The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is considered as a major health threat for women worldwide. The majority of cervical cancer cases, by far, are thought to result from chronic infection with certain strains of HPV. The virus can be hidden for years from a woman's immune system with no apparent symptoms  then awaken and create the deadly disease. This is called shy virus that puzzled scientists for many years. In 1983, Dr Harald zur Hausen of Germany discovered the association of HPV with cervical cancer for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008.//////Although epilepsy similarly affects men and women, health issues and concerns faced by women living with epilepsy is different from men.

In the Cairo speech on June 4 last year, he referred to Iran by its full name, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and said Islamic countries had been victimised by colonialism as well as the Cold War era struggle between the United States and the former Soviet Union.//////MS. Judith A McHale, US Under Secretary of State for Public Affairs, who was recently in Dhaka, is the senior most ranking US Government official to visit Bangladesh since President Obama took office in USA and Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh.

First, Nepal is in the last leg of the transitional phase as the May 2010 deadline approaches to submit the written constitution. This means the process of integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist combatants should also be completed by that time. While the written constitution would address the issues for which the insurgency was waged, the second would dismantle the infrastructure built to wage the insurgency. Normalcy should then return to Nepal.//////The U.S. Army has cleared the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) for use in Afghanistan, one day after two HIMARS rockets killed civilians in Marjah.//////"STORIES are not always innocent, states Chinua Achebe in his new essay collection, ////// Whether told by a colonizer, a correspondent on the news, or in a children's book, a story can be insidious, dispossessing, and difficult to un-root from collective consciousness when disseminated without care. To illustrate this point, Achebe recounts reading a children's book he bought for his daughter, in which a white boy's kite is caught on the wind and lands in a coconut tree outside an African village, where it is then solemnly worshipped as a supernatural object. Sacrifices are offered, and a witch doctor leads the village in a procession from the coconut tree to the village shrine. How do we understand the telling of such African stories by people who are not African? With great circumspection, Achebe replies, and with a keen eye towards the story's origin, and maker (Achebe went on to write his own children's books). Without such vigilance, he warns, we become intellectually complacent, and we run the risk of committing grave injustices absentmindedly.//////ON Thursday 11 February 2010, on a fading winter afternoon, Lauren Lovelace, director of the American Centre, orchestrated the book launch event of the University Press Limited Dhaka edition of ////// by William B Milam. //////Our National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam's well loved poem Jago nari bohnni shikha, written in the 1930s, is an estimable tribute to women's empowerment.

An eminent writer, Rokeya established a high school in her beloved husband's memory in 1911 in Kolkata.
