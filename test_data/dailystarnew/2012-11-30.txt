Yet we are now being told that the government has prioritised the highway expansion project and intends to complete it within a year. Going by newspaper reports, the Roads and Highways Department has completed 80% of the earth-filling work. Apparently, the project ran into a snag since present rules and regulations bar it from taking soil from agriculture lands. One wonders precisely why contingency planning was not done by our planners prior to embarking on such a crucial project. Whatever may be the case, earth-filling exercises remain unattended in certain sections of the highway, particularly Comilla and Daudkandi areas.//////The West Indies' tour of Bangladesh has so far highlighted the chasm between the two teams. In the two Tests, Bangladesh were competitive for some time before the tourists' superior strength decided the matter beyond all doubt. But when Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim and his opposite number Darren Sammy meet for the toss today at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium here for the first of five ODIs, both will know that they have reached their comfort zones.

Then they specially activated the transplanted neurons with optogenetic stimulation, a relatively new technique that combines light and genetics to precisely control cellular behaviour in living tissues or animals. //////It was awful that Jamaat-Shibir men could overpower police, snatched their rifles, and used those to beat them up. The more shocking news was, Jamaat-Shibir men tried to kill a policeman by burning him alive in Bogra on l2th November. And on 13th November, the Shibir men beat the cops brutally and tried to slit a Jubo League leader's throat in the city. The law minister also came under their attack. How come they could be so organized, frenzied and virulent? As we knew from the media and the police reports, they launched their campaign of violence to foil the war crimes trial. The message is all clear that they have both muscle and money to achieve their ends. Ideologically, Jamaat-Shibir is no different from the Islamist militants. The whole nation needs to rise against Shibir and their nefarious activities. //////Recently, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) said that our national parliament is getting ineffective day by day.

Bangladeshi people should be ashamed when a senior minister of the cabinet speaks in dismissive terms about an internationally reputed and respected person who is the lone Nobel laureate our country. The senior minister himself is a respected person of the country but we cannot respect him unless he comments decently. Another minister claims that anyone who loves sandwich and coffee can win a Nobel prize if he/she wishes so. This minister is another respected person and he deserves sympathy from each and every citizen of Bangladesh as he is the son of a highly respected person and first prime minister of Bangladesh in exile, who was killed brutally in Dhaka Central Jail 37 years ago in this month of the year. We all pray to Almighty Allah for his departed soul.//////That day while I was strolling along the road after offering my Asr prayer in the Masjid, I witnessed three policemen passing by on a motorbike in a leisurely pace.

If the traffic police do not follow the rules, how do they expect the public to follow the rules?//////An assembly charged with writing Egypt's new constitution began voting on its final draft yesterday, a process President Mohamed Morsi hopes will help to end a crisis which erupted when the Islamist gave himself sweeping new powers.//////India's government has conceded to opposition pressure to allow lawmakers a vote on allowing foreign supermarkets in the country, in a bid to end a parliamentary deadlock that has stalled key reforms.//////Nepal's president yesterday gave the restive nation's warring political factions six more days to form a national unity government to take Nepal into parliamentary elections next year.//////A major inquiry yesterday called for new laws to underpin a tougher watchdog for Britain's "outrageous" newspapers in a verdict that sets up Prime Minister David Cameron for a bruising political battle.//////Sri Lanka's main Tamil party yesterday demanded troops be withdrawn to barracks in the former rebel heartland of Jaffna after the worst ethnic violence since the end of the island's decades-long civil war.//////President Barack Obama and erstwhile Republican opponent Mitt Romney held a private lunch yesterday at the White House as they tried to move on from a bitterly personal election campaign that divided America.//////The main road to the airport of the Syrian capital Damascus has been closed and there have been no flights since early morning, as rebel groups reported fierce fighting in the area.//////Sri Lanka's main Tamil party yesterday demanded troops be withdrawn to barracks in the former rebel heartland of Jaffna after the worst ethnic violence since the end of the island's decades-long civil war.//////India is set to amend its hate speech laws following a public outcry over two women arrested for posting comments on Facebook after the death of hardline politician Bal Thackeray.//////WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up at Ecuador's London embassy for five months, has a lung condition that could get worse, the South American country's envoy to Britain said Wednesday.//////British oil giant BP was temporarily banned from winning new US government contracts Wednesday after agreeing to plead guilty to criminal charges in the deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.//////Two winning tickets - bought in Arizona and Missouri - share a $550m US Powerball lottery jackpot, the second-biggest US prize ever, organisers said yesterday.//////A Russian court yesterday ordered to ban access on the Internet to the videos of performances by the jailed feminist punk band Pussy Riot, ruling the films to be extremist.//////Myanmar riot police fired water cannon and tear gas at protesters against a Chinese-backed copper mine yesterday, injuring dozens in a crackdown hours before Aung San Suu Kyi visited the area.//////The Pakistani doctor jailed for his role in the US raid that killed Osama Bin Laden is on hunger strike, sources including a relative told the BBC.//////A French court yesterday cleared Continental Airlines of any crime over the July 2000 crash of an Air France Concorde but upheld a ruling that the US airline bore civil responsibility for the disaster.//////I strongly believe every Bangladeshi loves music.

I recognise the tremendous contribution of Bengal Foundation. //////Despite the blistering heat and the inevitable traffic snarl-ups of Dhaka, we inched our way in anticipation from the airport to the Dhaka Club.

His Father Enayat Khan was a sitar maestro. His family traces its pedigree back to the court musicians of the Mughals. Vilayat's father was recognised as a leading sitar and surbahar (bass sitar) player of his time, as had been his grandfather, Imdad Khan, before him. Vilayat was taught in the family style, known as the Imdadkhani Gharana or Etawah Gharana, after a village outside Agra where Imdad Khan lived.//////-Indian classical music has one of the most complex and complete musical systems ever developed.//////5 pm till 4:30 am next day //////SRA on Strings //////In a notorious passage in ////// written in 1957, Ayan Rand argues that all the passengers in a train filled with poisoned fumes deserved their fate. A Russian from a prosperous family who emigrated to the United States, Rand apparently believed that the poor deserved to die and the rich deserved unmediated power.

I already knew about Grameen Bank and its work to give microcredit to poor women in Bangladesh but as I studied Grameen more closely, it became clear that Muhammad Yunus and his colleagues had discovered a series of strategies that were absolute breakthroughs in addressing poverty. Years before visitors had begun arriving from around the world to study Grameen Bank and to take the seeds that had blossomed in the soil of Bangladesh and transplant them in their own countries.//////Setting up of a Banking Reforms Commission has become imperative to reform the banking sector and monitor activities of the commercial banks, including the state-owned banks, to make sure that they are working purely on the basis of banking ethics and business calculations.//////Fiber To The Home (FTTH) Council Asia Pacific, a nonprofit organisation, on Sunday organised a workshop on development of fiber infrastructure in Bangladesh.//////Facebook is telling its users to ignore rumors spreading on the social network that they need to post a statement to protect their copyrights of their comments and other materials.//////Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer defended his company's record on innovation and financial performance at the annual shareholders' meeting, but conceded that he should have moved faster to get into the booming tablet market dominated by Apple Inc's iPad.//////A Dutch court ruled on Wednesday that some of Samsung Electronics' Galaxy smartphones and tablets infringe an Apple patent in the latest round of the two firms' worldwide battle.//////Young IT professionals, with the help of sanitation experts will go for an intensive brainstorming and programming marathon session to develop innovative IT applications to tackle the poverty in Bangladesh. //////Kaspersky Lab has introduced Kaspersky Small Office Security (KSOS) in Bangladesh for the small office environments.//////
