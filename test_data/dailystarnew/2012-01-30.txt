It is widely alleged that BCL leaders are now engaged in rampant extortions in and around campuses. They are shamelessly involved in seat trading in student dormitories, unlawful admissions and recruitments in collusion with the administration! Their lust for money and power is the reason behind the creation of factions, groupings and counter-groupings. Their factional infightings have often resulted in loss of lives. In the latest such bloody infighting a student at the JU was mercilessly beat up and killed.//////The traffic management system in Dhaka city must be one of the worst in the world right now. The people behind the wheels don't really want to follow traffic rules and the men wearing the uniforms don't really want to bring the wrongdoers to book when they can make easy money by letting them go. But the prize for breaking rules most outrageously should go to the motorcycle drivers. These bikers don't stop at red lights, don't care about the safety of themselves or others, and the speed limit is none of their concern. They park wherever they want and they ride on footpaths showing utter disrespect to traffic rules. I am not saying there aren't any good and law abiding drivers, but the general picture is really horrible.//////Like other sectors, education is controlled by mediocre people. We have employed those people in the universities, colleges and schools who gave highest amount of donation or are affiliated with the ruling party.

Cramming answers from the notebooks have been causing to erode the creativity of the students. Small wonder now we find a few students who can write an essay on their own. //////After a fresh protest against the new government, the deputy head of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council (NTC) resigned recently.

They even smashed windows and forced their way into the NTC's headquarters, especially in Benghazi. It is learnt from the media report that in Benghazi the protesters are expressing their anger so vehemently that anything like it could be seen since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted.//////We are astonished by the remarks of Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Awami League general secretary and LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam concerning the torture of a Bangladeshi by Indian border guards.

We do not know when the Indian government will stop killing poor Bangladeshis, let alone apologise to us for its continuous disregard to our right to life. It seems that the Western powers will continue to turn a blind eye to India's injustice to Bangladeshis, as the country is their strategic partner in world politics. //////This is certainly a good sign that an Indian newspaper has criticised its government for its wrongdoing. We are also grateful to the TV channel which aired the incident and brought BSF's inhumane activities to our notice. They really deserve appreciation for their protest against violation of human rights. Their friendly attitude also proves that Indian civilians' attitude towards us is not the same as that of BSF or the Indian government. //////Every year hundreds of thousands of illegal asylum seekers, potential migrants and refugees enter Australia, Italy and many EU countries. But no one has ever been killed by the coast guards. Recently, the Australian opposition leader has called on their naval forces to turn about the boat that comes with illegal asylum seekers from Indonesia. But Australian naval forces denied his proposal saying that safety of human beings comes first. What great country Australia is!//////Why is the new minister so concerned about traffic jams, just like his predecessors, when the solution is simple and staring him in the face?
