For the most part, it is an inexperienced team. It will therefore be a big challenge for the government to deliver the goods in full measure to the nation. Even so, we wish the government well and expect it to bring about the changes that the people of Bangladesh so keenly look forward to. //////NOT very long ago in these very columns we had called upon the caretaker government not to approve the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) before addressing all its flaws that had been pointed out by the experts from time to time. //////THE new government that Sheikh Hasina will preside over as prime minister will need to hit the ground running. That will call for decisive action on the part of the prime minister and her colleagues in the government. And such action must be taken in those particular areas where public interest has been intense in these past couple of years. //////THERE is only one relevant question in an election year: who will win? The pundits have begun to get themselves into the usual tangle, most of the tangle created by the spin of bias. The right thing to do would be to admit that no one really knows, but that would reduce a column to just one sentence. Since pundits get their money from columns rather than sentences, this is an inadequate solution to their dilemma.//////ALTHOUGH Bangladesh's relations with India and Myanmar (Burma) are characterised as friendly and mutually supportive, there is room for much improvement in interactive relations in all sectors with both the neighbours. In the past, an inconsistency existed in the conduct of Bangladesh foreign policy. On the one hand, there appeared to be a set of policies, which were designed to turn the country into a cocoon, on the other hand, there was another set of liberal policies that tended to operate in a trans-national environment. //////The picture was all clear after the third day's play about what was going to happen in the second and final Test at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium. So everybody was all but confirmed about the outcome of this Test but there was only interest left to see whether the Tigers could show the same sort of contest, something they did in the second innings in Mirpur only last week.//////The focus was firmly on his captain with due to his hundredth Test match but it was Tillakaratne Dilshan who made the second Test against Bangladesh a memorable one in his career at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium yesterday. //////It was the day of the bowlers at the Shaheed Chandu Stadium here yesterday as 22 wickets tumbled on the opening day of the three-day practice match between the Zimbabweans and GP-BCB National Cricket Academy.//////A brilliant freekick by Chilean international Carlos Villanueva proved the difference between Premiership side Blackburn Rovers and non-league Blyth Spartans here on Monday as Rovers ran out 1-0 winners.//////Chittagong Mohamme-dan returned to winning ways in the Citycell B.

29 December can be regarded as free and fair. But the outcome of it is so one sided that the winning party may take the result as the 'Mandate' for them to do anything they wish not that they will but it is within their right. This is where Bangladesh is sadly lacking the benefit of a second chamber as in India, the USA and in the UK who can 'Moderate' the actions of the elected prime minister and the cabinet. A strong opposition also helps but here the opposition has been routed so completely, but still has the audacity to have already shouted 'foul'. That is really laughable, but worrying nevertheless. //////Congratulations to the CTG for organising a nice, peaceful and credible election. According to people, this is the best election they have seen in their lives.//////The landslide victory of the Awami League (AL) is welcome at home and abroad. People of Bangladesh wanted a change with a new dimension in the country's leadership. Most of the citizens gave their verdict against corruption, against sky-high price hike of foods and daily essentials. AL chief Sheikh Hasina should not forget her pre-election pledges. //////The UN has requested Israel to stop the deadly attack but Israel does not care, because there is a strong veto of the USA on Israel's behalf. It clearly proves the worthlessness of the UN. Processions and demonstrations are continuing throughout the world. The world is witnessing once again a large-scale condemnation against Israel's aggression after the end of Iraq war. Palestine does not have any air support, navy and enough arms. So why is Israel still killing hundreds of Palestinians daily? Israel is violating not only human rights but also international laws. //////Happy New Year and many congratulations on this historic victory. While you surely know the peoples' aspirations, as you prepare to assume the vast responsibility in the New Year, we would like to briefly reiterate what we, the ordinary people of this country, expect from the new prime minister and her new government, We would like to declare in very clear terms that we do not expect your government to fulfil all election pledges. Let it be very clear that neither we expect to receive free fertilizers and rice for Taka 10/kg, nor do we expect you to flood the country overnight with electricity and build all those highways and seaports in immediate future. We are much more realistic than the architects of the Awami League Election Manifesto are and we know that much of the pledges are over ambitious and it may take decades for a government to attain those goals. //////The Election Commission had earlier announced over TV and radio, that provisions would be available at polling centres for the elderly and handicapped voters, however this was just a hollow statement from the EC, as I could not cast my vote at our polling centre at BIT School in//////The grand alliance triumph is a historic and unprecedented landslide win. It is a clear mandate against corruption, plundering, killing, violence, terrorism and ineffective and incompetent running of government. It is also an outright rejection of the war criminals. This election sends strong and clear signals that the days of ignorance are over and the electorate is conscious and aware of its environment and wants to be a partner in the development of the country. The voters want the politicians to know that they are watching and will not hesitate to respond whenever they deviate. This election is a backlash against misrule.//////As expected, Khaleda, true to her intransigent nature, did not accept the results and came out with various unfounded allegations of voting irregularities, despite the nation's and the world's total acceptance of the election being free and fair. Minor irregularities and mismanagements compared to the magnitude of the total operation will hardly make any impact on the overwhelming verdict. Though her non-acceptance of the election result did not matter, had she accepted the result gracefully, her image before the nation and the world would have been brightened. An honest soul searching perhaps would help her and the party to identify their misdeeds and mistakes and help reorganize for future. But she preferred to defy the verdict of the nation. Perhaps she had sensed her inevitable debacle earlier. That is why throughout her election campaign, instead of offering countrymen better governance, she remained busy in delivering negative speeches which had no value to the general public. Therefore the public overwhelmingly exercised their franchise right and clearly spoke against her and her party through ballot. The misdeeds and lust for money of her sons and close aides allegedly under her direct protection and patronage knew no bounds. Crores of taka was allegedly siphoned out of the country through money laundering, by none other than her son, apparently with full knowledge of the administration as evident from the disclosure of the foreign governments which ultimately confiscated those illegally earned and transferred money. //////The much talked about election was held with the AL-led grand alliance's historic victory. So, of course, the ever-expected democracy has been restored, bringing back the derailed train on the right track. But it may de derailed again if and only if the present AL government fails to try the war criminals working as designers of conspiracy theories.//////I was prompted to write after reading Mridul Chowdhury's article What Sheikh Hasina should do now. In the wake of a mesmerizing election, the article aptly calls upon Sheikh Hasina to make good on the promises she made in the early hours of her campaign and take other steps which are long due in the interest of this country. //////The national election of 29 December was a remarkable event in the history of Bangladesh. More than eight crore people voted across the country. Every young male and female, man and woman, even the elderly people were excited and enthusiastic to restore democracy by giving valuable votes. People had to wait for the day for 7 years. So, after 7 years, when the expected election appeared before us, we could not stay at home. People came out simultaneously and went to the polling centres to vote. //////If I may state it correctly, Dr. Kamal Hossain deserves to be our next president, not Prof. Dr. Yunus, not Zillur Rahman, and definitely not Ershad.//////The international Red Cross yesterday warned that increasing numbers of civilians in the Gaza Strip are being killed during Israel's military offensive, locking the territory in a "full blown" humanitarian crisis.//////Wailing in grief, Salah Samouni banged his head against a wall inside the hospital morgue where the bodies of his three young nephews lay on the floor Monday.//////More than 150 children have died in the Gaza conflict and aid groups say the survivors will carry the physical and psychological scars for as long as they live.//////The UN Security Council will hold a ministerial meeting Tuesday to discuss an Arab call for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict in the Gaza Strip and for protection of Palestinian civilians, diplomats said.//////A Hamas delegation was in Cairo yesterday to discuss an Egyptian-proposed ceasefire with Israel, 10 days after the Jewish state's unleashed its massive offensive on the Islamists' Gaza Strip stronghold.//////Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Tuesday again sent a veiled warning to the Lebanese Hezbollah militia that Israel was ready to respond on its northern front if threatened.//////Sri Lankan troops were battling yesterday to flush out Tamil Tigers from the Jaffna peninsula after taking the rebels' political headquarters in the northern mainland, the military said.//////Anushilon Nattyadal of Rajshahi University staged "Shunagoriker Shondhaney" (in search of ideal citizens) at the Shaheed Minar Mukto-mancho on campus last Saturday.//////On January 3, noted Nazrul singer Dr. Nashid Kamal had a solo concert in Los Angeles, USA, says a press release.

Usually cultural programmes in our country are delayed for artistes or special guests who arrive late. At La Galerie, the programme too was delayed, for nearly an hour; this time not for the performer or special guests, but rather the organiser waited for the audience to fill up the venue. //////The air is thick with paranoia in "Doubt," but nowhere as thick, juicy, sustained or sustaining as Meryl Streep's performance as a distrustful nun in John Patrick Shanley's screen adaptation of his stage play.

Yes, there was a kind of apprehension as to whether the AL leadership would be able to keep the promises and live up to the trust reposed in them by the people who have given Sheikh Hasina free rein to move ahead through a silent vote revolution. //////AS many as 38 political parties contested in the national election 2008.
