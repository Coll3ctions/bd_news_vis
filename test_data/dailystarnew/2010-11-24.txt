Hartal will certainly not end people's miseries. //////The distribution of textbooks at the primary school level may not run according to plan. Obviously, it is cause for worry especially when one considers the fact that distribution is supposed to begin in the next thirty-eight days. One could suggest, of course, that this period of more than a month before distribution of the textbooks can get underway is good enough for everyone concerned --- the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB), teachers and pupils. The problem here, though, is that so far only 28 per cent of the textbooks have been sent to the various upazilas for distribution. As to the rest, no matter what the assurances are regarding a meeting of the target, there is the fear the distribution schedule may not be maintained. //////As the start of the ICC Cricket Word Cup 2011 draws closer, the renovation and modernisation works at five different venues in Bangladesh, co-hosts of the landmark event, have been ramped up.

Her release ended all the unending hours of waiting, repressed desire for freedom and doubt about her release. Though she looked a bit aged, she appeared fit and composed. Intelligent and focused, she utilised her time in detention by learning different languages. Her perseverance to utilize her prolonged time of detention positively, always nurturing a golden goal in her mind, is remarkable. Thus she has become the symbol of endurance and an indomitable voice of democracy in the face of persecution. //////Paharpur, widely known as Sompur Buddhist Bihar, which had once produced renowned scholars like Atish Dipankar, where the growth of Hinduism eventually led the way to Buddhist philosophy, has been an arcane monastery city to archaeologists around the world.

We know that they seldom mean it. The question is -- how long will this go on? They call for hartal every now and then for selfish interest. They are not worried that we suffer. The two major political parties are no different from each other in this respect. Now it is the time for the BNP to call hartal. //////It is a great news for the world that Suu Kyi, the icon of democracy has been released at last. After suffering for almost two decades, she has achieved freedom. Her popularity is not confined within the boundary of Myanmar alone. The whole world had been waiting for the release of this great woman. Through her constant sacrifices for the sake of the country, she has won the hearts of millions of people all over the world. //////Children are the future of the nation. But in the rural areas or urban slums they are suffering from severe malnutrition. Children from well-off families are brought up with balanced diet including supplement food for proper growth. But the plight of the rest, millions in number, is horrible. Their earnings are too little to buy staple food for their babies. They cannot even think about nutrition. A long-term plan can improve the situation. But we are in despair seeing the senseless argue of the political parties.//////After three months the cricket world cup will be held in Bangladesh. The authorities should remove all the billboards from roadsides and relocate the street beggars. They should clean Dhaka and Chittagong cities. We hope the BPC is aware of the matter.

We hope our government will ensure that we are not let down in front of the foreigners.//////Winter is the season of celebrations.

The steaming hot pitha made from ground-rice and date-palm molasses flavours the foggy morning.//////In most of the countries of the world films focus on the economic, social and political conditions of the country. These films are also earning international fame for their country. But our country is still lagging behind in this sector. We are only making movies which are cheap source of entertainment. But the good news is that some directors are coming forward with movies like "Made in Bangladesh", "Runway", etc. I think we should make more movies of this category.//////Can you see the earth crying in pain? Look around and you will see the polluted water and waste, and groaning trees everywhere. We still have time to change this situation. //////Global warming is one of the most discussed topics on earth today. It is defined as the increase in the average temperature of the earth's surface, air and oceans, and its projected continuation. The average temperature of the earth has increased with the increased emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Climate change is a consequence of heinous activities by humans. So, as the best creation of Allah, we should always be conscious about our activities.//////We are one of the least developed nations in the world. Still a lot of things have to be done the common man needs to be properly educated, food sufficiency has to be achieved, etc. In this situation we should all work for the progress of the nation. So why not work together? Our individual interest is futile compared to that.//////I inherited a small apartment six years back and I was getting house rent from it. I filed income tax return with the help of an income tax lawyer, though I was not required to pay it after retirement from a non-pension able job 20 years back, as I was surviving from the income of my wife and children. I was familiar with income tax, as I had to pay tax when I joined service in 1962. Since I got that apartment at no cost, the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax continued to raise many objections and ultimately its lawyer settled the issue through underhand deals.//////Of late, a letter published in The Daily Star has drawn my attention. The writer has said that there is no need to mention the name "Bangladesh" on the cricketer's jersey. What a ridiculous thing to say! Bearing the country's name on the jersey makes the player feel proud as well as confident in performing his task. Our cricketers are the representatives of our country. They should bear the country's name on their shirts. Besides, there is no cricket team in the world who do not have their country's name on their jersey. So, thinking about the deletion of the word 'Bangladesh' from the jersey is not a good idea surely! //////In an emotional moment at the Yangon airport, 10 days after her release from detention, Myanmar's Democracy leader Suu Kyi was reunited with her youngest son Kim Aris after a decade-long separation.//////The responsibility for finding peace after more than nine years of war rests with the Afghan people and not with the foreigners, the Afghan president said yesterday.//////The Dalai Lama intends to retire as head of the Tibetan government in exile next year as he looks to reduce his ceremonial role and scale back his workload, his spokesman told AFP yesterday.//////The United States vowed to defend its ally South Korea after North Korea rained artillery shells on its neighbour yesterday, killing two people and touching off widespread alarm in world capitals.//////A widening corruption scandal has exposed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as an honest but ineffectual leader whose failure to dominate has underlined India's weak political system, hampering strong policymaking.//////The promises countries have made to control carbon emissions will see temperatures rise by up to 4C during this century, a UN report concludes.//////India's attorney general appeared before the country's Supreme Court yesterday to defend Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against allegations he had failed to act over a massive telecom corruption scam.//////Indian security forces said yesterday they had killed 25 suspected Maoist guerrillas in the insurgency-riven central state of Chhattisgarh, while two policemen died in a separate land mine blast.//////Sri Lanka yesterday began investigating a claim that Tamil Tiger rebels executed 26 captured government soldiers at the height of fighting between the two sides last year, an official said.//////Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission will announce final results from a September 18 parliamentary election today, an official said, after long delays while fraud complaints were investigated.//////US President Barack Obama was shortly due to get a fresh intelligence update on the crisis sparked by North Korea's artillery barrage against a South Korean island, officials said yesterday.//////President Barack Obama faces uncertain prospects for re-election in 2012 as many voters question whether he deserves a second term, a new poll said on Monday.//////The plight of the world's last wild tigers "is close to catastrophe", Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin yesterday told an unprecedented summit aiming to save the animal from extinction.//////A four-day Japanese sculpture exhibition ended at Sherpur village under Sailkupa upazila in Jhenidah district last Sunday.

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party is an organisation in disarray every time it goes out of power. That has been the lesson we have learnt over the years.
