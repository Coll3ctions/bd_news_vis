In politics no one is an enemy forever or a friend in perpetuity. Politics is all about seeking new alliances, finding accommodations of other views, and often compromises. A politician does this not out of philanthropy, but with a long term goal of gaining or retaining power. A seasoned politician does it in a clever and adroit way, by subtle actions, and by articulation of words chosen carefully. A deft politician knows that rhetoric laced with venom does not win opponents; it even drives close friends away. But not in Bangladesh. //////
