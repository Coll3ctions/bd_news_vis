The appeal is as inexplicable as it is worrying. It is inexplicable because two years have already elapsed since the High Court issued its directives on the ETP in June 2009 and in all this period the authorities have done nothing but seek an extension of time for the work to be completed.

The Bangla medium schools follow Amar Boi as the textbook up to class-7. Each part of this book includes a chapter on one of the seven Bir sreshthos. A few schools teach a little of 21st February, 26th March and 16th December as part of general knowledge. The English medium schools follow only the book given from the board, that is, Amar Boi. Our students grow up not knowing much on liberation war. It is sad that after 40 years of our great liberation war, we hear from a student of class-1 that a clash occurred between Bangladesh and Pakistan in 1971. But how can we blame that kid when we watched a video on Facebook after Pakistan won the match at ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, held at Mirpur stadium, where a young man said with delight, That is past, we forgot it! If this is the situation today, what will happen after ten or twenty years? //////A growing frustration is brewing in the minds of the guardians as well as the students concerning the credibility of the schools and their teachers who are entrusted with the noble task of building the future of the nation. The guardians think that there is no point in spending a huge amount of money every month on the school fees besides spending almost double the amount in a forced manner in coaching centres for the same purpose. The guardians fail to understand why extra coaching is needed when the schools are paying their teachers for doing the same job. It may sound ridiculous, but the bare fact is that it is the teachers who insist the students to take extra lessons at their coaching centres, which are mostly situated at their homes, in order to excel and get better results in the examinations. It is reckoned that a school teacher, besides getting his usual salaries in the school, earns Tk. 1.5 lakh on an average per month by coaching students privately. In older days, teachers vehemently discouraged students about having private coaching saying that if they didn't understand lessons, they should ask them. What a difference between now and then! Now everything is evaluated in terms of money! Now teachers create such a situation that students are compelled to go for coaching or he/she will surely fail in the exam. I am certain that this practice would seriously impede students' ability in acquiring desired education. Can our authorities concerned ban private coaching for good? I would also urge the authorities to check if these teachers pay taxes properly. //////In the name of human rights, democracy, protection of human lives and property, the US and NATO forces are bombing on Libya killing hundreds of innocent people- men, women and children.

Has the student community any role to play at this yet another crisis created by the major political parties themselves. In fact, during the last two decades that the nation is professedly practicing democracy, a new form of crisis syndrome has become endemic in Bangladesh politics. It is characterised by an irreconcilable deadlock between the major parties--Awami League (AL) and Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP)--over the question of who would run the interim government that would hold parliamentary elections. And unlike the historic roles they played in the pro-democracy movements against military regimes of the past, the student bodies of today look rather docile and are, as it were, tied to the apron strings of their mother parties. //////Ibn Khaldun, the classical Arab historian, ascribed the great revival of the Arab spirit to "asabiya," a term that can be loosely equated to "group solidarity," a consciousness that rose above traditional loyalties like tribal identity and released the inspirational energy that made oasis dwellers and nomads into world conquerors. //////
