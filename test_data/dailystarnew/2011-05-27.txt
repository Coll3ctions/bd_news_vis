The scenario is not different even in the case of foreign aid. And as a result, billions of dollar worth of scarce as well as precious foreign aid has created a pipeline bulge. This is not just a sad commentary on the project implementation agency's capacity to absorb foreign aid, it does also give a rather negative image of the government.//////The good news, up to a point, is that the south-western districts of the country have been recovering gradually from the effects of the Aila devastation of two years ago. The bad news is that despite such recovery, a clear environmental threat now hovers over the region, especially Satkhira, Khulna and Bagerhat. As an exhaustive report in yesterday's issue of this newspaper notes, decades of shrimp cultivation have left the land in parlous conditions. It is now quite impossible for any agricultural crops to be grown on it. Aila destroyed all the shrimp enclosures in the region, of course. But now that a large segment of farmers previously engaged in shrimp cultivation are planning to return to their original occupation as growers of rice, the salinity of the ground, caused by intensive shrimp farming, has come in the way.//////China and Thailand won the boy's and girl' doubles titles after thrashing their respective rivals in the finals of the Bangabandhu Invitational International Youth Table Tennis Championship at the Wooden Floor Stadium yesterday.//////Title aspirants Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club missed a good opportunity to take a lead in the Grameenphone Bangladesh League when the star-studded outfit were held to a goalless draw by Feni Soccer Club at the Shaheed Salam Stadium in Feni yesterday.//////Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan will return home today after an enjoyable trip in the money-spinning Indian Premier League (IPL). //////Their campaign back on track with consecutive victories over Kolkata Knight Riders, a charged up Mumbai Indians would be eying an encore of last year's final with a win over Royals Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifier 2 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Friday.//////Former booter Abdul Salam Murshedy has appeared in the scene and bought a nomination paper to declare himself as a presidential candidate in the much talked about Mohammedan SC Limited poll which is changing colour everyday. //////Indian media yesterday carried a story on the uncertainty of the Argentina-Venezuela friendly match in Kolkata after the state government said that it is not possible to upgrade the pitch before the September 2 match.//////After rain washed out the entire first session and a good part of the second session of the first Test between England and Sri Lanka in Cardiff yesterday, the Lankan openers Tharanga Paranavitana (16 not out) and captain Tillakaratne Dilshan (18 not out) started off on the right foot by going to tea on 35 for no loss.//////Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club posted a 36-run win over Abahani in the final round of the 3rd Women's Club Cricket League at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday. //////After wasting two match points in the second set and feeling her confidence fading, Kim Clijsters let the match slip away Thursday at the French Open.//////In a setback to Sourav Ganguly, the Supreme Court of India on Thursday quashed the allotment of a 63-katha land to the former India cricket captain in Kolkata.//////Gautam Gambhir could miss the limited-overs leg of India's tour of the West Indies next month following the aggravation of a shoulder injury that was sustained during the World Cup final.

This represents its ninth hike in just over a year. At the time of raising the interest rate, inflation was cited as the primary concern for the economy. Similarly, a closer look at the monetary policy stance of China would reveal that the central bank has intervened four times over the past year to cool down the economy. This naturally poses a question as to why Bangladesh Bank (BB) and our policy makers in general are so hesitant when it comes to adopting a tighter monetary policy stance, which is so important for maintaining macroeconomic stability. //////Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony Thursday reported its third annual loss in a row but forecast a return to the black this year despite a

Government is planning to construct more flyovers throughout the city but I just wonder why decentralization remains out of discussion? From all parts of the country people are coming to Dhaka for survival, as most of the important offices, institutes, universities, and garment industries are still getting built here. Dhaka city suffers from pervading water pollution, air pollution, accommodation crisis, electricity crisis and what not, but who cares about decentralizing people or institutions? Without the eradication of the source of all these problems, how long can you protect this city? //////Industries and factories have been polluting the water bodies in and around Dhaka city for the longest time. It is clear that protecting the environment is not one of the top priorities. I am not even surprised. We, even me, pollute our cities with trashes. So how will the owners of these factories, with hardly any education be conscious about the environment, feel the need to protect the environment? The long term benefits are invisible, but short term gain in cash is not. It is up to us, maybe the government, to make sure that people with money and power realize the need for a cleaner Bangladesh. After the Digital Bangladesh plan, we should initiate a Clean Bangladesh plan.//////It is heartening to learn that the world's largest university exclusively for women has been opened in Riyadh, KSA. Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah inaugurated the SR-20-billion Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University (PNU) on May 15, 2011. With a capacity to enroll about 50,000 students, the PNU is the biggest women-only university which is indeed a symbol of women education and participation in the nation building process. Equipped with all the modern and digital facilities, the PNU is expected to impart higher education to the Saudi women and women from other Muslim countries. While sincerely appreciating King Abdullah's vision, I wish PNU's great success towards accomplishing its noble mission.//////Every year due to cyclone, heavy rain, tornado and flood millions of huts, bamboo/tin shed houses get damaged, blown off, and destroyed; thus the poor become poorer. Our land and housing developers are constructing hundreds of flats/buildings one after another for the rich people. The present cost of a house/flat in Dhaka ranges from taka 75 lakh to 1 crore and above. Do the middle class and poor people afford to purchase a house/flat in Dhaka? Why don't our public and private sectors come forward to build low cost houses/flats for the middle class and lower class people? Why doesn't our government seek financial help/loan from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, ADP and World Bank to mitigate the sufferings of our poor people?//////This interesting news item from Patna in India was published in the pages of a local English daily on May 18th. It adds a new twist to the saga of dowry demands; common in India! Usually these demands are for cash, land, furniture and often bi-cycle, motor-cycles or may be even a car depending on the wealth of the prospective bride's household! Portable Gen-Sets are a new item in the menu of dower demands claimed by the groom's parents, in power starved state of Bihar in India!//////I am really surprised to read the news in The Daily Star dated May 6, under the heading "Yunus removal upheld by SC" that "Dr Kamal said they still don't know on which grounds Yunus' petition was rejected." He also said, Any citizen has the right to move to the independent judiciary for remedy, if his basic rights are violated. But the High Court in its judgment said Prof Muhammad Yunus has no right to come to the court, I would like to ask our honourable judges what are the qualifications needed to enter the court?What are the disqualifications of Prof. Yunus? Is it because he is not a sycophant of Hasina or he has not looted money from the share market or is it because he is a Nobel laureate who has lifted the image of Bangladesh? Please note that these are my questions and do not put me in jail (considering these queries as contempt of court), because as a citizen of the country I need to know whether I have the sufficient qualifications to go to the court.//////The limited natural resources that Bangladesh is endowed with, lies mostly in the Sylhet region. Such as natural gas, tea garden, woods of rain forests, and abundant sweet water in beels and haors that we hardly get together in any part of Bangladesh. Also a large number of people who have migrated to the U .K. and the U.S.A are contributing greatly to our economy by sending remittances. Even the newly elected Bangladeshi origin British MP Rosnara Ali and US congressman Hashem Clarke are from Sylhet. But the rate of illiteracy, the growth rate of population is very high here. The gap between poor and rich is extremely wide. The madrassas are more in numbers which produce youths incapable of doing anything except religious rituals. The expatriates built houses which remain empty all the year. The govt. with the help of expatriates should take massive development plans for overall development of the region.//////I remember that about a month ago in Star Lifestyle, an article stated five reasons why people shouldn't use BOTOX. I read that article and the reasons seemed very appropriate and convincing. But to my surprise, despite the facts of the article I noticed all sorts of media doing eye-catching and influencing advertisements on the same beauty cream, giving reasons why it should be used. Now my question is that why this cream is not discontinued even after the solid proof that it is not suitable for use? And why is the media helping this product to increase sales, risking the results on the customers after using this cream?//////The arrest of the erstwhile IMF chief in New York for criminal charges shows that there is no diplomatic immunity in western countries for institutions like WB, IMF or UN bodies. This brings to mind various demands (a few years back) by such bodies for diplomatic immunity in developing countries including Bangladesh. No matter how much carrot is dangled before us in the name of development aid, we should give no diplomatic immunity to such organisations unless it is accepted worldwide as under the Geneva Convention.//////Misinformation has been a primary tool to mislead people by many. When it is used for political gains, I believe it is the duty of the media to point it out in the form of 'Fact Check'. It is routinely done in the media of western countries. I urge the media in Bangladesh both print and electronic to do the same. //////''I love you more than my soul''-- the line is presently used at random. Instead, we may use ''I love you more than I can say'' for our beloved ones. But the sentence 'I love you more than my soul' can be used only for Allah, the creator, as well as His dearest Rasul (SM).Once Hazrat Omar Faruk (R), the second caliph of Islam, said to our dearest Rasul (SM), ''Ya Rasulallah! I love you very much, but not more than my soul.'' Then our dearest Rasul (SM) said, ''Omar, you are yet to be a perfect 'mumin' (faithful).'' Then Hazrat Omar (R) said, ''Ya Rasulallah! Now I love you more than my soul.''And our dearest Rasul (SM) declared, ''O Omar! You are now a perfect 'mumin'." All of us should realise this.//////A news item was published in a newspaper that a Saudi mother defied ban on women drivers in her country to set an example for her daughter and her friends. The woman, a housewife in her mid 30s, drove non-stop for four days on the streets of the Red Sea city of Jeddah to defend her belief that Saudi women should be allowed to drive. Even not fearing the arrest she was offering driving lessons for other women. //////Almost about 4 years ago, when the apartment building where we live in was being built by a developer, I as one of the owners of the land insisted not to use the brick crushing machine, as it not only creates sound pollution but environmental pollution as well, to which the developer obliged even after bearing additional expenses for the job.//////The arrest of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on attempted rape and assault charges in New York on Saturday had the effect of a bombshell in France. Kahn was widely expected to resign from his post at the IMF and run for the French presidential poll in 2012. His arrest put an end to a brilliant career as an economist and a politician. Mr. Strauss-Kahn's downfall comes at an opportune time for the French right and extreme right. Never has President Sarkozy been so low in the polls. Kahn was the politician who would have been acceptable to France's centre-right.//////Ratko Mladic, wanted by UN prosecutors for war crimes during the Bosnian civil war, has been arrested in Serbia yesterday after a decade in hiding.//////World leaders called for Ratko Mladic to be swiftly sent for trial yesterday after the arrest of the long-wanted Bosnian Serb warcrimes suspect as survivors expressed their relief at his capture.//////Dozens of Yemenis were killed in overnight gun battles in the capital, government officials said yesterday, as fighting aimed at ending President Ali Abdullah Saleh's three-decade-long rule threatened to ignite civil war.//////1.

The programme was held on May 25 and 26. Enlisted artistes of the academy and invited organisations performed songs, dances and recitations.//////Theatre troupe Prangane Mor staged an adaptation of Kazi Nazrul Islam's lyrical drama Aleya. The show coincided with the National Poet's birth anniversary, but it was folk artiste Islamuddin Palakar, who was in the spotlight on the fifth day (May 25) of the ongoing 1st Dhaka International Theatre Festival. The other production staged that day was Shubachan's Mahajoner Nao, an insight into the life and songs of 'Baul Samrat' Shah Abdul Karim.//////Another end-of-the-world day was last Saturday. This time it was an American preacher named Harold Camping, who had calculated that the biblical apocalypse was going to begin at 6:00 pm on that day. He advertised it through 6,000 billboards and 55 radio stations. The preacher made sure the doomsday was not doomed for lack of an adequate campaign. //////It feels like the legendary Scottish King Robert Bruce (1306-1329), who secured independence of Scotland from the English hands and became the hero of his country. Once fleeing a battle and demoralised, he spotted a cave where a spider was spinning a web to connect one corner of the roof to another. Every time the wafer-thin creature would slip down the slope of the inner wall it would glide up again to start spinning from where it had left off. Its perseverance eventually paid.//////The leading development challenges of Bangladesh today include alleviation of poverty and environmental management in the context of rapidly growing population. Dhaka is the 8th largest city in the world, with a population of over 15 million. Population influx to Dhaka is very high. Frequent natural disasters -- flood, drought, cyclones, river-bank erosion -- destroy agricultural crops every year and force farmers go to the cities. People are pushed to the cities because of the absence of job opportunities in rural areas. //////I have visited the ashy remnants of the fire that destroyed their homes. Where the flames burnt everything they had, that was all that they could claim as their own. 14 houses in Ershadnagar slum on March 23, and 39 houses in Sattola slum on March 24 were burned down//////When you find your child making his first call, fiddling with your mobile phone, or tapping illegibly on your computer keyboard for the first time, all grown-ups around start to swoon and giggle and talk about him becoming a great computer expert or a prodigy. But jokes apart, there have been quite many children who actually grew out from mobile and computer fiddlers to real geniuses who work for or run big companies at ages such as 13 or 14.//////Speakers at a roundtable observed that the national budget for fiscal 2011-12 should focus on the vision of a Digital Bangladesh or it will remain just a slogan.//////Microsoft Bangladesh organised 'Microsoft Government Solutions Day' at a hotel in the capital on Wednesday.
