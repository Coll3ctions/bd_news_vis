Already, some lawmakers are demanding that the United States strike immediately with new penalties rather than wait for an uncertain multinational consensus.//////THE likelihood of the ruling Awami League preparing a plan of action to keep its members, particularly its wayward and unruly young elements, in check is obviously good news. We certainly expect it to come to pass. When indeed measures are in place for the party leadership to keep a watchful eye on the activists of the Chhatra League and Jubo League, it will be an acknowledgment on the AL's part of the damage caused to its reputation by its very own. In these past many months, unceasing reports of Chhatra League and Jubo League men interfering with tender formalities and engaging in extortion have not only embarrassed the party and the government but have also led to growing concern about the state of democratic politics in the minds of citizens. The AL's move to curb the misplaced exuberance of its younger camp followers has come rather late in the day, nine months to be precise. Still, we take heart in the fact that it's coming to happen after all.//////THE just-announced export target is higher by 13 percent than that of the last fiscal year closing down with a 4.5 percent shortfall from the target set for that year which was 10 percent higher than the target for the year preceding. The size of the export basket is projected at US$ 17.6 billion for fiscal 2009-10 as against the unachieved target of US$ 16.29 billion. Last year's export performance was evidently poorer because of demand deficit in importing countries owing to recession. Now, the higher projection of export has its foundation in signs of recovery read into the economy of the western world. //////IN the run up to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank scheduled for October 6-8 in Istanbul, a journalist and former student of the Bilgi University hurled a shoe at the IMF managing director Domonique Strauss-Kahn.

Taking care the luchi, oil was on the tissue and not on my fingers, I walked up to greet him.

To free the nation from the curse of illiteracy the government must initiate a policy, that is, to get any degree from a school, college, madrasa or university the examine must teach an illiterate person how to read and write Bangla. There will be no marks for this but results of the examinee shall remain withheld until he or she can make an illiterate person read and write. The same rule should be implemented for O' Level and A' Level examinees. //////The so-called vehicles are plying the hectic clumsy Dhaka roads emitting black toxic fumes here and there. The point is how to rein in the unscrupulous vehicle owners to keep the atmosphere pollution free. It is the same vehicles such as bus and taxicab with sordid, shabby and worn out sit covers plying under the nose of law enforcers flouting the rules. It seems nothing could stop them as long as there is a room for practicing venality. It's very common spectacle that bus, taxi drivers very often break traffic rules without being hesitant causing a deadly gridlock on roads. Coming to the second issue, it is like an ever lasting problem CNG and taxicabs ask for unusually high fares. It's been discussed many times in the print and electronic media to draw the attention of the authorities concerned but all attempts have failed. //////To improve the socio-economic condition of the country the goal of the government should be to empower poor rural women and men to achieve higher income and food security. So the following objectives should be taken into consideration.//////The guardians are seriously worried about the future of their children. Today the nation's prospect seems dark because of the drug menace. //////The situation of Marsh Arabs could only be described as an environmental disaster. It is also suddenly a hot story because the US personnel, now in the marshes, are trying to save the land. While the key media have waken up, the ecological society continues to keep its stunning silence. That silence became glaring during former US President Bush's campaign against Saddam. The "unnoticed" story is not so much the dilemma of the Marsh Arabs due to a strange duplicity of the ecological movement. Over time, accessible settlement photos show the previously green marshes have turned dry brown. Thousands of marsh dwellers have also apparently been killed since 1991, and hundreds of thousands had to take shelter on the streets. The United Nations reports that the Madans are now a refugee population. As a direct consequence of the Third River Scheme that the UN completed, the 5,000-year-old culture of the Madan is in grave danger. //////As a development professional working in the broad and key fields of Poverty Reduction and Rural/Agricultural Development for the last three decades, it has been a great pleasure for me to learn, share and work in association with major stakeholders including at least 25 overseas Professionals, Consultants and Expatriates in these lines. Undoubtedly, my learning has been immense and propitious and I was able to enrich my knowledge, expertise and professionalism significantly. Professionally I still have contact and communication with most of them electronically for obvious reason and quite often I read and review those professional exercises for both updating me and adapting to the current features of Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) aiming the set Millennium Development Goal (MDG) - an externally imposed Economic Strategy Plan for our agrarian economy devoicing peoples' participation. //////The South African team has never won a World Cup although it has arguably been the world's best team. People say they cannot hold the pressure in a critical situation and this may be right and this story continues for many decades as they lost all big games event when the opponents were not as good as them. Luck is also a big factor but still ill luck does not continue life long. //////Daylight Saving Time (DST) was introduced in Bangladesh a few months back. Accordingly, the clock was advanced by one hour. But it is now widely accepted that whatever benefits, if at all, that might have been derived out of this experiment, could also be obtained by advancing the working hours by an hour without disturbing the clock! //////To protect himself from the attacks by the ferocious animals man had to invent and use some weapons at the primitive stage. They then began using such weapons to kill those animals for the purpose of using them as food. But at the same time man started using weapons and arms upon one another as enemy for various reasons. //////It is known that Lalmonirhat, Nilpharmari and Kurigram districts are the poorest districts in Bangladesh and every year people of these three districts are affected by various natural disasters like flood, drought, cold weather, river erosion etc. Since a large number of people of these areas fully depend on cultivation, the natural disasters harm them a lot and unemployment & poverty plague them continuously. For the well being of these ill-fated people, it is necessary to create alternative opportunities for employment by providing electricity to all for irrigation, bank loan, small & medium size agro based industries, manpower export after imparting proper training, allocation of high quality & productive seeds and fertilizers in time etc.//////The other day I went to a bank booth of Dhaka Power Distribution Company Ltd to pay my electricity bill. I saw the above words on the top of the main gate of the DPDC Ltd office. It made me curious and I tried to read it again, but could not do it because of a sudden load-shedding at that moment. I was really delighted with the joke! The same thing happened in our village home a few months ago. When we started our dinner, the light went off. We had to use candles. The very interesting thing is that light came in only after we finished our meal. We all including our foreign sister-in-law were delighted! Load-shedding brought both cities and villages together to share its burnt. I believe because of many odds the authorities cannot keep the power supply at the desired level. The people are not happy with the words only, they want action. So without any delay, the government should put all its efforts in this sector with which entire economic activities, industrial and agricultural, are directly linked.//////I thank you for belatedly printing my letter. I am writing this letter as your reporting of 14 July 2009 has had a very serious effect on my food habits and has led to deprivation of essentials to my body. I am also requesting all the readers of this letter to please go through your coverage of 14 July 2009 and be judges of the matter themselves. Who, after reading this, would dare to consume these fruits, etc? I did the same and have not been since taking at all the fruits abundantly available and displayed prominently in our markets all over.//////The idea of magnetic levitation trains, mentioned in a letter published by you on 27th September, is very misleading. The statement, and I quote: "Magnet Trains run on power of magnetic fields created by electricity through wire, rather than electricity itself" is basically incorrect. The magnetic repulsion between the rails and the train eliminates friction, whereas motion is generated by friction between the wheel and rails in conventional electric trains.//////The R&D in the rich western countries for cheaper applications of products used in the third world countries is not the current culture.//////A notice has been published by the NBR in The Daily Star dated Aug 13, 2009 on the procedure to be followed by taxpayers in paying vehicle tax. Instead of making the entire cumbersome system of paying tax easier and trouble-free, they have added additional complications in the name of vehicle tax. Some such irritating features are shown here. (a) A separate pay order is necessary for paying vehicle tax. It means additional payment of bank charges plus transport hassle.
