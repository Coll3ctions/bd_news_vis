Like other children my children also love to eat coloured chocolates, sweetmeats, ice creams, soft drinks etc., some of which contain artificial dye. So I avoid giving them to my children. But many of my relatives and friends bring chocolates and ice creams for them. When my children take chocolates, I feel very helpless as I think they are taking poison. In my laboratory I have tested ice creams of some famous companies and some of them contain a huge number of bacteria-- much beyond the normal limit. //////I highly doubt whether the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC), would ever be able to cure Bangladesh from corruption. It seems to me that the authority may not even be a kosher institution within itself and yet, it is supposed to deal with the problems of corruption. How could we expect an authority to be a prosecutor, jury and judge all at the same time? Besides, where can we find such great flawless brave individuals, who will always do the right thing despite pressure from all corners? This was indeed a utopian and popular idea, to quick fix the corruption but it failed to account for the successful prosecution with evidence and subsequent punishment of the culprits. I am sorry I do not see the required quality and transparency with the current ACC and that is why it is destined to fade away with the new democratic government. No doubt, the ACC has exposed some cases of corruption but it also harassed a great number of people for no good reason. //////I am referring to an article entitled Turkey's Islamists show their hand, where intriguingly the writer launched a campaign of fallacy.//////Recently, the DS reported that the potential call centre industry in Bangladesh is facing a lot of policy hurdles. Indisputably, it's our bad luck because we are unable to take this great opportunity. All over the world this is a growing industry, especially in the developing countries.

How much percentage are we getting in this respect? //////The BNP Secretary General seems to be upset, about lawmakers asking for information about Koko's illegal money transfer and ex-PM's 400 pieces of luggage while going to Saudi Arabia! Both the facts are verifiable and possibly on record. Koko's money laundering and getting money from Siemens was public news in US papers.//////There was front-page news in many Bangla newspapers on 20 Feb. under the heading "kar katha shattaya". Many people, especially the ones who were charged, arrested and jailed for corruption were the most vocal against the ACC Chairman and DG. //////The term "Digital Bangladesh" has become a common one in our national life these days. We frequently hear of this term but almost all of us are ignorant of what it actually means. It has become so frequently used a term that it has affected all. In the near past the word "digital" was only used to mean something modern. //////The Bangladeshi ICL cricketers are still disallowed to play in any form of home cricket. Sri Lanka has already withdrawn the restriction on their ICL cricketers. If BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) gives them the permission to play in all forms of cricket, then our national team will become stronger. We must not forget that Alok Kapali, Shahriar Nafees and Aftab Ahmed played very well in ICL. //////It is just more than a month that the AL-led grand alliance formed the government after its landslide victory in the last general election. Against the opposition & some media reports & criticisms, Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, told that it was too early to make any comments on the achievements of her government. This is very true but as the proverb goes that morning shows the day, the common people are losing their hearts. Look at some news headings from DS in the last few days which are: School shut as AL men occupy it for jatra, BCL dissolves JU unit after gunfight, MPs shout, bang desk at JS , local development to sink in MP meddling, panic spreads as law enforcement slackens, gun-running rampant along SW borders, truck looted by Dinajpur BCL men, gang kills man & loots truckload of rods in N'ganj, mob clashes with BDR over smuggled goods etc. We see nothing bright!//////Reading your Ekushey edition, I was struck, once more, with the strange contradiction between the genuine feeling for the celebration - its history and meaning - and the shame that admits how badly your mother language is often spoken, especially by the young. Professor Serajul Islam Choudhury, in particular, spoke of this and the resistance to Bengali-speaking that exists among some who prefer English. //////My heartiest congratulations to the Election Commission for appointing its own officers as Retuning Officers in the December 29 election for the first time in the history of the Election Commission.

But this has meant some important questions have remained relatively unexplored. //////THE ongoing global economic crisis is having a devastating impact on all export dependent economies, whether manufacturing or primary product exporting.
