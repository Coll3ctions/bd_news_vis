Teachers queued up with flower bouquets to congratulate the two senior officials who took office that day on being appointed by the new government. The angst of the students can be well understood since many of them had come from peripheral townships to attend classes. They are reported to have complained aloud that no notice was served earlier about teachers having to attend such an 'unofficial' programme of greeting. Indeed it was a glaring act of irresponsibility on the part of the teachers of the prime educational institution of the country which must adhere to a strict routine to break out of the sessions jam cycle. The teachers could have assembled after class hours to go and congratulate the newly appointed colleagues. //////THE new Al-Led dispensation has set off with a jerky start amid a spurt of dismal events on several fronts. It may be recalled that soon after AL's assumption of power in 1996, turbulences erupted across the country. As then, so also now, the government refrained from putting up a conspiracy theory, not even a veiled one, thus showing signs of maturity. //////FOREIGN policy is not made in a day. The smiles in Delhi when President Obama cautioned Pakistan that non-military aid would be cut if it did not curb domestic terrorism were premature. It is military aid to Islamabad which should be of concern to Delhi, but the government has become so dependent on the US that it gets pleased with very little. An inaugural speech can only have markers that will be fleshed into policy. But amateurs in Delhi have rushed to judgment where professionals fear to tread.//////IT is not that much, but nevertheless it is a sign of growth of a decent and sophisticated political culture in the country, that BNP has decided to join the inaugural session of the ninth parliament on January 25.//////Under foggy conditions, low scoring matches were the order of the day as the Premier Division Twenty20 cricket began at different venues across the country yesterday. //////The Australian Open was blown wide open Sunday when top seed Jelena Jankovic crashed out while Roger Federer was forced to mount a memorable comeback to beat Tomas Berdych.//////Australia must win on their national holiday on Monday to keep the five-match series alive following another nerveless chase from South Africa in the third game in Sydney on Friday night. Apart from the 2-1 disadvantage, the most troubling thing for the hosts is that they don't feel safe with any total.

They are resorting to violent means to intimidate the students who follow other ideologies. Chase and counter case, indecent slogans, violent clashes --all these have become common phenomena in some of our public universities and colleges. Needless to say, it is the common students who have to bear the brunt of this spate of violence on campus.//////Almost every day a very eye catching , ornamental advertisement appears in the daily newspapers on the Jamuna Future Park, that strikes my mind. Do we really need such a large supermarket and amusement park in our country? //////I fully appreciate the DS editorial of 12 Jan under the caption "Demonstrate Zero Tolerance to Vandalism". In fact, this culture of vandalism by students started in our country since our independence. This culture took the present shape in course of time. Initially, some fortune seekers, especially the political leaders, trade union leaders, group leaders of teachers of different ideologies of politics in universities and colleges down to the school levels used the students as their mini-musclemen for their personal or small collective gains. //////We the students of session 2003-2004 of Dhaka University would like to request the respective departments of our university to publish our graduation results as early as possible to enable us to appear in the 29th BCS exams. It is a golden opportunity for us that we have got the circulation of BCS. We are enthusiastic enough to participate in this competitive exam. But we are still not sure whether our results will be published before March 2009.//////While many consider George W. Bush a very bad US president, the point is highly debatable. George W. Bush's position in history is not different from that of Robert Clive in British history. I have met many English men and women but hardly any one of them spoke unkindly about Robert Clive's activities in Bengal in 1757 and afterwards. Like Robert Clive, George Bush was an empire builder. As a shrewd politician he created facts intelligently and mobilized American people behind him to occupy Iraq. Now the long term presence of the US in Iraq in order to exploit its vast oil resources is a fact that nobody can deny. Like Robert Clive, he has set up stooges who pay lip service to the Iraqi national question while serving wholeheartedly their US masters. Without Bush, this interest of the US big business could not have been achieved. Only a little over 4,000 US soldiers had died during the last six and a half years in Iraq. More people die of car accidents in the US per year. Under certain circumstances, democracy has to be established through the barrels of gun. Bush realized it and had successfully implemented democracy in Iraq, even at the expense of more than one million Iraqi lives. //////The national election 2008 was a great challenge to the EC and we the Bangladeshi people have seen how they completed their task successfully. According to local and international election observers, it was the fairest election in the history of Bangladesh. //////This is in response to the letters of Rafiqul Islam and Mahboob Hossain on this topic. I agree with the first point of Mr. Rafiq that Israel has no right to be in the Middle-East at the first place, but strongly disagree with his second view. He said that Hamas is to be blamed for the bloodshed taking place in Gaza. But I don't agree with you. As mentioned by Mr. Mahboob Hossain, no economic activities took place in Gaza during the six-month ceasefire period with Israel. According to the ceasefire conditions, Israel was supposed to gradually ease the blockade to which they had subjected the Gazans since June 2007. But they didn't do that and so Hamas had no option but to fire rockets at Israel to press home their demands. So Hamas isn't to be blamed for this bloodshed.//////Everybody is all praise for the youthful cabinet that the new prime minister, Sheikh Hasina has presented. We also praise her for her courage, swiftness and worldliness. She has not turned into a Devi aloft beyond the common people. Her respect shown to Zillur Rahman, the elderly politician, is remarkable. //////US President Barack Obama did not waste a moment after the oath taking ceremony and he got down to work immediately. Faithful to his election pledges he has turned the page of the black chapter of G.W. Bush and started a new one. Obama ordered the closure of Guantanamo Bay prison within a year and banned the practice of torture in terror interrogations.//////With the changes of time things in the world are also changing proportionately or disproportionately that is, things are never static, they keep on rolling a universal phenomenon.//////It was anticipated that Israel would declare a unilateral ceasefire so that Hamas would not be bound to stop launching rockets into Israel. It was anticipated that both Israel and Hamas would be the winner as it has happened. For moderate forces to overcome extremist forces, the moderates must be able to provide their population with what they most need. In the Palestine case, the end of Israel's siege of the Gaza strip and its occupation and colonising of the remaining Palestinian territories (West Bank) is the most needed thing.//////Once again the tainted face of our student politics is revealed with its true colour and this time it appears as post election violence in different universities. Student politics in the last two decades hardly relates to well being of mass people.
