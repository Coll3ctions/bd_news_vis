Does the government really want to establish its control over Grameen Bank? We need to wait for some time to get the answer. The motive of the government would be clear in its next move. Everyone will admit that GB is the creation of Prof. Yunus. He struggled a lot for the establishment of GB. The success that Grameen has seen is only because of the charismatic leadership of Prof. Yunus. No one can think better about Grameen Bank than Prof. Yunus. So the government should value the opinion of Prof. Yunus in selecting the next leader for this Nobel winning organisation. Prof. Yunus has become an international icon. Many famous people and organisations are coming forward to materialise his concept of microcredit. Is it not a matter of pride for us? Bangladesh is the homeland of microcredit. Almost one third of the population is involved in microcredit and it would not have been possible without the passive support of Bangladesh government. It would be unfair to deny the contribution of world famous MFI organisations like Grameen Bank, ASHA and BRAC to our rural economic development. These organisations are working in many countries of the world. //////It is needless to point out that undernoted bus stops are one of the major contributing factors to the unresolved problem of gridlock. Bus drivers seem to consider any place a potential bus stop wherever they can pull over. Nowadays, bus drivers are pulling over at any place, on any part of the road without taking into account the hindrance in the traffic flow. Moreover, besides creating traffic blockades, the buses leave their passengers no choice but to get off at the middle of the road putting their lives to risk. A recent accident in which a university student was the victim was primarily due to this haphazard offloading of passengers. This is also one of the reasons that people prefer private transport to public transport. Therefore I would sincerely ask the authorities concerned to take necessary steps to relieve the citizens of this peril.//////A Dutch contractor and millionaire Johan Huibers has made a replica of Noah's ark following the proportions laid out in the holy Bible.

Look for safe places inside and outside the buildings where you spend time. //////The recent blackout in India is one of the worst cases of power grid failure the world has ever seen. The massive power failure left nearly half of India's population without electricity for two days. Although there maybe many reasons behind this large scale load shedding, one cannot deny the fact that the electricity consumption through home appliances has risen sharply in recent years. Air conditioners, washing machines, personal computers, laptops, smartphones have become almost necessities instead of luxuries. Power systems are designed to handle a specific amount of load, if the load exceeds the limit, the system is sure to crash.//////The aim of the Liberation War was to get an exploitation-free Bangladesh where everybody would get a job based on merit. But it is very shocking that the meritorious students are being deprived and discouraged to contest in the government job due to the quota system. If this system continues, one day the country will become a land of inefficient people. Therefore, I urge the government on behalf of the students to end this discriminatory quota system and give all of us equal opportunity in the job market.//////Most of the English medium students don't read Bangla novels. I was among them, but when I read Humayun Ahmed's novel 'Himu Rimande', I started getting interested in Bangla books.

But he will always be alive in his books and in our hearts.//////A last page photograph, of a multi-storied building, was published on 7th August, in a local English daily.

In recent weeks, the focus has been on the Haqqani network, fundamentalist fighters along the border who have longstanding ties to Pakistani intelligence and have conducted deadly attacks on American troops and officials in Afghanistan.//////The question on everyone's mind is, how does the prime minister work? This crops up as a natural reaction to seeing her commit blunders, one after another, and getting entangled in her own devices. Are these of her own making or is she being led up the garden path by vested quarters or the government comforting itself by avoiding due diligence? //////Recently, in the BBC Hardtalk programme, our prime minister proposed the formation of an interim government during the next general election with the participation of the opposition. As expected, the opposition leader summarily rejected the proposal.

However, it would have been perhaps more appropriate to engage in a dialogue with the opposition about the proposal, rather than announcing it in a BBC programme.//////The Amazing Thailand" and "Incredible India," are two good examples of how to promote a country internationally to improve its image despite poverty, hunger, political upheavals and economic problems.//////Google on Wednesday took another step in its quest to merge the Internet with the real world with Maps and put itself at the heart of mobile gadget lifestyles in the process.//////A Facebook page that depicted Aboriginal people in Australia as drunks and welfare cheats has been removed after a public outcry.//////South Korea's Samsung Electronics said it had launched a super-size version of its Galaxy Note smartphone, the latest salvo in its battle with Apple for the multi-billion-dollar handheld market.//////Computer Source Ltd has recently launched a new model of laser printer, Lexmark E260dn in Bangladesh market. //////Apple Inc's new version of its iPhone and iPad software will not include a pre-loaded app for Google Inc's popular video website, YouTube, Apple said on Monday.//////Asus has released X44HR laptop in the local market.//////South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co said on Thursday it has not considered acquiring Research In Motion or licensing the embattled BlackBerry phone maker's new mobile operating system.//////
