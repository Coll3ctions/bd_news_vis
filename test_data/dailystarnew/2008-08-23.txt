It needs little convincing also that the process of the police investigation, and the way other investigations related to it were handled, was politically motivated, and subsequent developments have clearly pointed to the alleged role of the then home minister. This was a blatant effort to influence the course of justice a cognizable offence under our law. //////IF the incidence of under-trial prisoners languishing in jail indefinitely is an abysmal travesty of justice, then that of juvenile crime suspects detained in jail would be patently repugnant to all civilised sensibilities.

The caretaker government is yet to make major and effective electoral reforms in order to keep criminals out of the political arena. Politicians with criminal records are back in the realm and continuing politics in their cynical ways, in spite of the fact that allegations and revelations about corruption and scandals have badly shaken many people's belief in them. The worst thing is that we live in a contaminated moral environment. We fell morally ill because we became used to doing something different from what we promised.

Like the earth, the moon is a sphere which is always half illuminated by the sun, but as the moon orbits the earth we get to see more or less of the illuminated half. During each lunar orbit (a lunar month), we see the moon's appearance changes from not visibly illuminated through partially illuminated to fully illuminated, then back through partially illuminated to not illuminated again. Although this cycle is a continuous process, there are eight distinct, traditionally recognised stages, called phases. These phases designate both the degree to which the moon is illuminated and the geometric appearance of the illustrated part. //////Capacity refers to an organisation's ability to achieve its mission effectively and to sustain itself over the long term.

Tiny beads of sweat formed on Bobby Uncle's forehead as he craftily navigated the big hooded vehicle. Much to the amusement of passers-by who looked on with unabashed curiosity at the strange contraption making its way through the brick-paved alleys, he continued to struggle with the giant steering wheel. Short and thin, he seemed dwarfed by the car he drove. It was the kind of motor car they had only seen in a cinema hall. Usually, a donkey cart or, if there was a special festival, a small taxi would occasionally grace their streets--but to see an actual bright and shiny motor car make its way down the narrow paths of their neighbourhood was not just cause for curiosity, but an actual thrill.//////Pakistani writing in English is something we in Bangladesh are not generally aware of. There are several possible reasons for it. One is the troubled history between Bangladesh and Pakistan, which has over the decades seemingly hardened, tragically enough, a cultural divide that was the basis for the 1971 split, and has institutionalized a natural disinclination to enquire too closely at what Pakistani Anglophone writers are up to. Another reason is far more material: the simple unavailability of the works of Pakistani writers and authors--here one is talking about those Pakistani authors that are published in Pakistan itself. The odd work published outside Pakistan, in the UK and the USA, does make its appearance in our local markets, but even these have been available on so limited a basis that it has proved impossible to make an informed judgment or opinion on the quality of their English language output. Or even to acquire a general familiarity with them. The biggest reason of all undoubtedly may simply have been the overall domination of the Indians in the field of South Asian writing, whose forward momentum ever since the publication of Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children has dwarfed and overshadowed, aside from some Sri Lankese authors, the output of writers from the other countries of the South Asian subcontinent. //////Sunil Gangapadhyay, in a lecture given in a function arranged by the little magazine ////// said that our fiction writers have not yet fully explored the richness of rural Bangladesh. He mentioned William Faulkner, who never wrote about anything outside the purview of his town and its two-mile expanse. Prasanta Mridha's fictions make a strong case in point.

Ask anyone who has seen Kanon Devi's movies or has experienced the mellifluous quality of her singer's voice. The answer will be instant and insistent: in Devi subsisted a world of images, a canvas that could well be taken as symbolic of what life ought to be.//////Contemporary writer Amitav Ghosh is reputed to be one of the most scholarly practitioners of the distinctive genre known as Indian writing in English --- one of the finest writers of prose, profoundly knowledgeable and a traveller in the physical and metaphysical sense. ////// comes with a delightful blend of different people trying to settle matters of the heart.
