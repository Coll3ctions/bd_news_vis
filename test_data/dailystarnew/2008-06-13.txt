from four primary school teachers' association. //////The demand for the formation of a national commission to ensure the rights of Bangladesh's indigenous people makes sense. And it does that because of the large scale deprivation they have been subjected to over the decades stretching back to British colonial times. The irony is that even in an independent Bangladesh, where attitudes ought to have changed positively regarding the rights citizens across the board are entitled to, discrimination toward the many ethnic minorities has persisted. It is a matter of deep embarrassment for us and will remain so until concrete steps are taken toward redressing their grievances. That is a strong message coming out of a workshop organised by the Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights in the city on Tuesday.//////It was almost a year ago that the current government faced its first existential crisis. Back in August 2007 it seemed as though the fate of the government might well end up hanging on an umbrella that was opened at an inopportune moment at a football game at Dhaka University. That incident led, eventually, to street riots that at one point looked like they might spiral out of control before the government was able to restore order and authority.//////AMUSING as it is, the most colourful name of any war in history is that of the War of Jenkins's Ear.

Every year 90 million people are being added to the global population, increasing the demand of food. Therefore, there is high demand of food. However, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned that the present stock of food all over the world would last only 57 days. This food crisis is happening because of overpopulation and natural disasters ruining crops and grains. Another problem is the cultivation of bio-fuels. Food grains have high demand for producing such fuel. African countries, too, are producing bio-fuels on 4 million hectares of land. The European Union and India are also planning to produce bio-fuels. The cultivation of bio-fuel has a global impact on food crisis. Another problem is global warming, which has reduced the cultivation of croups significantly. The vital information is that out of 50 least developed countries 41 are food-importing ones and Bangladesh is one of them. So, our agricultural production has to be boosted to face food shortage in the years ahead.//////Discovering Bangladesh is surely enlightening. Henceforth, it should be challenging too. With tourism taking its toll on the flora, fauna and cultural identity of exotic Bangladesh, local populace across tourism pockets of the country should extend the onus of sustainability of the destinations on visiting tourists through responsible tourism. //////Our country is a not bigger than Wisconsin , a small state of the USA and is home to nearly 150 million people, that is, half the total population of the USA. This country is already heavily overpopulated and we just cannot take any more new mouth to feed. Our family planning activities are very lax and it does not give us the impression that any family planning activity worth the name is going on in the country. We just cannot afford to allow our population to grow unchecked.. It is high time that we, like the Chinese, adopt the one-child policy. If we do not take drastic measures in this respect, then the country will ultimately sink under the weight of its own population. Poverty and malnutrition have direct relationship with the growth of population. While dealing with family planning we must also ensure that poverty is tackled at the same time.//////Who doesn't like when it rains in Dhaka? When the sky turns grey just before the rain, and the cool rain comes down, who doesn't like to see the world around transforming into a fresh one? But that is not the end of the story. Right after the rain, the city dwellers face the unending problem of water-logging. Commuters bear the brunt of it, and also the drivers.//////Very recently, the head of the interim govt., Chief Adviser Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed, addressed the nation on political developments i.e. election and other issues. In his speech he said the govt. would sit with the political parties soon to discuss various issues. He did not mention which issue would come up for discussion. //////In less developed countries, it is difficult to introduce and maintain free market conditions, that is, supply (goods and services) should be more than the public demand.//////It is not only astounding but shocking also to learn how even 'highly educated' people can be so irrational in respect of viewing administrative, social and economic problems such as the rickshaw menace in Dhaka city. In the letters captioned 'Regulate Number of Rickshaws' by Nasreen Khondkar and 'Rickshaw-free Capital' by Mr. Sikandar Ahmed, both have lamented the possibility(!) of a rickshaw-free Dhaka city and advocated for the so-called convenient tricycle without least mentioning how untrained rickshawallahs, totally ignorant of the traffic rules, run amuck on the highways and main streets of the capital city wherever they are. Nasreen Khondkar has mentioned European cities and also Singapore where the number of motor cars has been controlled and bicycles are in abundant use. Mr Sikandar has cut a joke on Mr. Rahat's suggestions for introducing mass transport system (MTS). Both of them seem to be oblivious of Kolkata, the biggest city of our neighbouring country, where rickshaws have been removed from the main streets, not to speak of highways. Nasreen has wailed on how she could walk the distance from Neelkhet to Dhanmondi which is less than a mile or two. Does she know that people both male and female in our neighbouring country walk miles to go to their respective destinations? Mr. Sikandar has jeered at the introduction of MTS. Does he also feel shy to stand in a queue to collect a ticket and travel in a bus? We people in this capital city perhaps would feel better and more comfortable had there been bus-stops at every door-step. How callous and irrational! Isn't crowding the city with countless rickshaws telling on the law and order and other civic conditions? Moreover, they say more than 60% of our population has gone down below the poverty line. Now, does she, an economist, suggest those people also should come to the capital for rickshaw-pulling as there are no other alternatives for self-employment? Of course Nasreen Khondkar's suggestion to introduce bicycles and providing lanes for it is not very difficult to implement. It can be done simply by removing manually-driven and small motor vehicles from the highways and main streets and introducing wide-bodied, double-decker buses and sky-rails. But none is for that; instead they run after metro-rail. What a joke! They have even failed to implement DUTIP in the last 6/7 years! God knows when responsible people will come to their senses.//////The Gono Forum had their chance to unveil their political plan during dialogue - A National Unity Government. Of course currently they want that to happen after the general election. This has two major political implications. Number one : the ensuing election might be held without popular participation and therefore would not get legitimacy from within and outside. Then the option of a National Unity Government would be mooted out, and those who participated in such an election and won seats would be considered as the components of such a government. The number two: the election is deferred indefinitely and the present CTG would be replaced by political leaders of like minded parties to form a National Unity Government under the cover of the CTG to make an exit door for this CTG. //////We do talk of a effective legal system and judiciary in Bangladesh. The people deserve that. //////In the first place, I would like to clearly mention the fact that I've by no means any hope about our politics and the politicians. Still, being a conscientious citizen of the country I have the right to voice my thoughts pertaining to the welfare of the land I was born and brought up in, and am still living. //////In recent years, a very small number of cottage ceramics industries have come up producing handcrafted, hand painted stoneware and porcelain decorative products. The range of products includes mugs, vases, showpieces tableware etc. with high quality, exclusive designs, both western and traditional. Eighty per cent of ceramic decorative products are imported from China, Thailand etc and the ones which are manufactured here are also sold as imported because of quality. The costumers should buy more local products which will encourage the local industry to develop and contribute to the economy. We urge the caretaker government to assist these SMEs to expand rapidly for employment generation.//////Biodiversity is the multitude of different living beings in a particular ecosystem or on the whole earth. Biodiversity can be seen and studied at different organisational levels: genetic and ecological. It touches upon both native environments on land and sea as well as agricultural and other man-made surroundings. //////After the longest and most expensive nomination race, Barack Obama made history by capturing the Democratic nomination as the first black candidate. On defeating Hillary Clinton, the 46 year-old Barack Obama will now face a five-month campaign against a 71 year-old Republican Senator John McCain, a Vietnam prisoner of war and staunch supporter of the US led war in Iraq. On the other hand, Barack Obama opposed the invasion of Iraq, called for an early troops withdrawal and is in favour of settling Iran issue only through diplomatic means.//////On Friday(6/06/08) I went to a boutique shop at Banani. After picking my chosen Shalwar- Kamiz I put my things in the booth to pay the price for the things I intended to buy. I stood in a queue there where two English women were talking in between by putting their things in the counter. The cashier was having a slight problem with the computer, requested me and others to wait for a while. Meanwhile, I was talking to the manager about the beautiful set-up of the shop. Suddenly, one of those two women grumbled very rudely how long she would have to wait to pay a small thing. All of us became really surprised at their behaviour . Seeing their attitude the shopkeepers became embarrassed and I became apologetic on their behalf for their unintentional delay.//////The United States put up 10 billion dollars to rebuild Afghanistan yesterday as world donors responded to a funding appeal from President Hamid Karzai but warned more must be done to fight corruption.//////Sri Lanka's military is poised to capture the leader of the Tamil Tigers and is surging towards his jungle hideout, the defence ministry said yesterday.//////The United States defended itself against charges its forces killed 11 Pakistani troops in an incident Wednesday that threatened to worsen already tense ties with its key war-on-terror ally.//////Israel joined a new round of Egyptian-brokered negotiations on a proposed truce in and around Gaza on Thursday after deciding to give the talks one last go while preparing for military action if they fail.//////A few hundred baht here, a few thousand rupees there -- a major UN report released yesterday said "petty corruption" is a massive drain on Asian economic growth and hits the poor hardest.//////Maintaining that it is committed to the Indo-US nuclear deal, the US on Thursday sought to push the ball into India's court saying it was for the country's leadership to decide on the pact.//////As the ////// strums out its entrance and the artiste breathes life into Tagore's words ////// you can immediately sense her conviction.
