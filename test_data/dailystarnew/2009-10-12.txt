There is a clear reason why. In these past two years and more, the degree to which the ACC was empowered to handle acts of corruption (and that was per courtesy of the caretaker government) was without question something that rekindled hope among people about the future of democratic governance. To be sure, the ACC has not been above criticism and has indeed been condemned for some of its more controversial acts. But what surely cannot be denied is the principle upon which it has been working since early 2007. Whether the body will continue to wield that kind of authority in the future now depends on what the present political dispensation means to do about it. If reports of a possible clipping of the ACC's wings turn out to be true, all one can say is that it will be a regressive move that can only impede the nation's journey to a full and meaningful democratic order.//////WE cannot but be concerned by the reported buildup of large number of Myanmar military force in very close proximity of our border. This is in addition to the Nasaka or the Myanmar border force whose strength has also been increased manifold.//////NONE would dispute the generally held belief that North Korea and Burma have the two most oppressive regimes in Asia. They rule over two of the continent's backwater, and that's no coincidence whatever. Notwithstanding the many common features they, however, have stark differences between them. No foreign leader of distinction cares to pay court to the ruling generals of Burma in their weirdly grandiose new capital of Naypidaw. In sharp contrast, even Bill Clinton, one of the world's most recognisable celebrity statesmen, makes pilgrimage to Pyonyang.//////THIS is what we saw in a photograph. The mother was addressing the US investors in New York last month, and the son was sitting next to her. She was the prime minister of Bangladesh, but who was he other than being her own son? We have reports he went there as an advisor to the prime minister. This newspaper published a report on September 26, which described him as "prime minister's son living in America." If Dr. Pangloss in Voltaire's ////// were amongst us, he would have reiterated that we are living in the best of all possible worlds.//////MANY eyebrows will surely be raised on reading the title. Let's try to work out the sums. It's reported that in 1995, there were about 35,000 private cars and jeeps. By 2009, that number exploded to a massive 200,000, and still more are being added every month. Why? Most people, riding the additional 165,000 cars and jeeps, were riding rickshaws earlier. When the roads they had to pass through became off-limits to rickshaws, these people had no other option than to buy cars, even if that needed selling property or taking loans. Policymakers thought that taking rickshaws off the road would give the limited number of people riding cars the freedom to roam about unobstructed. They could not realise that so many had the capacity to buy cars.//////Holders Mohammedan survived a scare to move into the semifinals of the Citycell Federation Cup with a 5-4 shootout win over minnows Shuktara Jubo Sangsad at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Substitute Martin Palermo's close-range finish deep into injury time earned Argentina an unbelievable last-gasp win over Peru in Buenos Aires just minutes after Diego Maradona's men looked to have suffered yet another World Cup qualifying setback.//////Bangladesh Under-19 coach Minhazul Abedin said his boys are ready to produce an improved performance in the longer version of the game against their English counterparts during the month-long home series that starts with a two-day practice match at the Fatullah Stadium today.//////The National Team Manage-ment Committee (NTMC) of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) yesterday sought five weeks to prepare the national players for the SAFF (South Asian Football Federation) Championship to be held in Bangladesh from December 4 to 14.//////Bangladesh A were beaten by Maharashtra Cricket Association by five wickets in the first T20 tie of the two-match series at the Poona Club in Pune yesterday.//////Italy scraped a draw against the Republic of Ireland to join Germany, Denmark and Serbia as the latest teams to secure 2010 World Cup places on a drama-laden penultimate batch of qualifiers on Saturday.//////Ivory Coast qualified for the 2010 World Cup by drawing 1-1 in Malawi on Saturday and Cameroon moved closer to joining them with a 3-0 triumph over Togo.//////New Zealand held an unrelenting but distinctly unlucky Bahrain to a goalless draw in the first-leg of the 2010 World Cup Asia/Oceania play-off in Manama on Saturday.//////Holders Italy needed a little bit of luck to qualify for next year's World Cup finals and coach Marcello Lippi hopes some other omens will point towards a successful campaign in South Africa.//////Novak Djokovic captured his third ATP title of the year at the China Open on Sunday, outlasting giant killer Marin Cilic of Croatia in a blistering baseline battle, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).//////"I can't believe I have done that," said an ecstatic Alfonso Thomas, who hit two boundaries in the last three deliveries of a thriller to steal and seal victory for Somerset in the Champions League encounter at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Saturday. In a rollercoaster of a match, Somerset just about managed to hold their nerves courtesy a 50-run partnership for the eighth wicket between Thomas and James Hildreth to get past the line off the last ball of the match. The equation came down to five runs from three balls with one wicket left when Thomas sliced a full toss from Scott Styris -- who had taken two wickets in the final over -- to the deep point boundary before bringing up the win with another carve over point.//////Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson believes the problems that derailed the first half of his Ashes summer have made him a better player. Johnson suffered serious lows in England -- losing his accuracy, having his place under threat and a family dispute which became public -- but after the ICC Cricketer of the Year award and a starring role in Australia's Champions Trophy triumph he was confident of where he was.//////Bangladesh under-16 booters squandered chance after chance as they went down to Chinese Taipei 1-2 at the Pannad Stadium yesterday to bow out of the AFC U 16 Championship Qualifiers. //////Indian boys and girls will be playing as favourites when the Prime Bank ATF Under-14 Tennis Tournament gets underway at the National Tennis Complex in Ramna today.//////Jo-Wilfried Tsonga put an end to Mikhail Youzhny's dramatic run on Sunday to become the first French player to win the men's singles title at the Japan Open tennis tournament.//////Top business leaders have backed the pre-shipment inspection (PSI) firms, saying the government cannot get rid of the system right away.//////Bangladesh has lost its number one position to China in export of denim jeans and cotton trousers to US market due to less competitiveness, said industry insiders.//////Local energy-efficient light makers may get a chance to participate in the bid to supply 10.5 million bulbs, as the state minister for power hinted at easing bidding conditions. //////Government employees will have to wait another month for a new pay scale, as Finance Minister AMA Muhith said yesterday it would come along with the final salary structure for the judicial service.//////Commerce Minister Faruk Khan said yesterday a stimulus package for the garment sector is likely to be announced anytime this month.//////AIMS of Bangladesh, an asset management company, has started announcing the net asset value (NAV) of mutual funds on a weekly basis instead of monthly disclosures.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina directed authorities to take steps to make all places of natural beauty and religious and historic significance in the country attractive to local and foreign tourists.//////More thrust on diversification of jute products may ensure a significant pie of the global market for Bangladesh, a programme was told yesterday.//////When Bangladeshi labourer Abdul Karim was laid off from his shipbuilding job in Singapore because of the global recession, he did not expect to find the same sort of work at home.//////The interest rate cycle has turned in the Asia-Pacific region but increases in benchmark borrowing costs will be gradual in order not to nip fragile economic recovery in the bud, analysts say.//////Asian currencies ended the week generally up against the dollar amid greater optimism in the region and continued low interest rates in the United States.//////Sri Lanka's small stock exchange has become one of the world's top performing bourses as investors reap the peace dividend from the end to the island's bloody ethnic conflict.//////India's top vehicle maker Tata Motors raised 750 million dollars Friday from investors and said it would use the funds to repay debt from the purchase of British car icons Jaguar and Land Rover.//////AirAsia Bhd was named the Best Asian Low-Cost Carrier while chief executive officer Datuk Seri Tony Fernandes was named Travel Personality of The Year by leading Asia-Pacific travel news publisher TTG.//////Zem Jute Mills Limited at Muslimbagh under Boda upazila in Panchagarh district restored production from Saturday morning after a four-day closure.//////AB Bank has appointed KAM Majedur Rahman as new deputy managing director with effective date from October 1, the bank said in a statement.//////Oil exporters in the Middle East and North Africa region are expected to increase their international reserve positions by over 100 billion dollars in 2010 as oil prices rebound, the IMF said on Sunday.//////Iran is probing the 7.9 billion dollar privatisation of a state-owned telecoms company after allegations one of the buyers was linked to the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, media reports said on Saturday.//////The US government's focus on domestic issues amid a severe recession is hobbling efforts to restart the stalled Doha round of global trade talks, Indonesia's trade minister said here Saturday.//////Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) will shrink 7.5 percent in 2009, President Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview released Sunday, after earlier government predictions of an eight percent drop.//////Local inter-bank FX market was slightly subdued today as the international markets were closed.

A large number of farmers and agriculture officers took part in the function.//////Mr. Mamoon's letter (5 Oct) deals with the most important problem facing the country in the foreseeable future. The government and donor agencies must rectify the shortfall of birth control pills and artefacts with renewed vigour. Mr. Mamoon mentioned other problems and suggested solutions with which I totally agree. However, as a member of Optimum Population Trust (UK) and its various parameters to support a viable healthy population I would say that the optimum population of Bangladesh is in the region of 30 million rather than 100 million. By the same parameters optimum population of England is calculated to be only about 20 million and no more!//////As I travel through the city early in the morning I have to put my palm on my nostrils in an attempt to guard against the foul odour that wafts its way from a trashcan or a pile of rotting waste lying beside the road. And I am talking about the environment of the port city which still retains its green look. The situation is even worse in the capital. According to the recent news reports, the capital city alone produces 3556 tonnes of solid waste everyday--a staggering amount by any standard.//////The committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize likes springing surprises. When Kenyan environmentalist Wanggari won in 2004, the committee explicitly linked peace with concerns about the state of our planet's ecology, a concept that was familiar in environmental circles but rarely discussed elsewhere. Bangladeshi banker and economist Dr. Yunus won it in 2006 for his efforts to alleviate poverty thus promoting peace through the use of microcredit schemes. Now the prize has gone to a sitting U.S. President just eight months into his first term. Both Maathai and Yunus told TIME magazine that Obama was a great choice. //////After a lull of 16 days (Sept 18-Oct 03), Dhakabashis are back on square ZERO as far as the traffic mess is concerned. From the Prime Minister down to the humble traffic cop, all are trying to minister to this plague that is strangling life in our so-called metropolis. Your second editorial in today's DS (5-10-09), still speaks of the pipe dreams of STPs, DUTPs, DITS etc, etc ad nauseum, that are years away even if implemented right away.//////The stakes could not be higher! Argentina was in serious danger of missing the next year's World Cup Football, South Africa 2010. On Saturday, October 10, Argentina were facing Peru at the Stadio Monumental, Buenos Aires.

My congratulations to a sturdy vocalist like him. I also appreciate Dr. SN Mamun for the way he took a stand against NBR's activities. Definitely, this is an illegal imposition of VAT by NBR and the NBR officials not only being jealous of us, they are also trying to abolish the business minors through this process of VAT collection. //////BGMEA was seeking Tk three billion from the govt to pay Eid bonus to the workers. It is because the BGMEA has been spoilt by the govt. and the society because it lays the golden eggs. So easy to ask from the Treasury; and then create law and order situation, if this appeal is rejected.//////Bangladesh is a developing country and it has many problems. In order to manage these, our political parties should come to some kind of consensus. Nowadays they are accustomed to blaming each other, rather than coming to the point. //////It is surprising that so many eyebrows are raised when one argues in favour of establishing a secular constitution, which was originally the case post independence. If I may humbly take the liberty of defending such initiative within the scope of this letter, then it is important to point out that secularism embodies two important principles. First, it presents a case for neutrality towards every religion. Second, it promotes prohibition of religious associations in state activities. Hence, neither a secular constitution prevents a good Muslim from practicing his religion in harmony, nor it makes our nation any less peaceful for believing in our respective faith. //////Your front-page report on the matter published on October 6th has at least opened the door of possible open-pit coal mining in Bangladesh. //////Recently, in a bid to write the biographies of some of our first generation cricketers (for Wikipedia), I was searching through the pages of www.cricketarchive.co.uk. I was looking at the scorecards of different 1st Class Matches played in erstwhile East Pakistan during the 60's. With great interest I was reading how our local heroes (Halim Chowdhury, better known as Shahid Jewel, Shamim Kabir, Raqibul Hasan, Daulat-uz-Zaman & others) combined with the Non Bengali players like MA Latif, (Maharashtra born East Pakistan Captain) or Nasim Ul Ghani (Delhi born Pak Test player). Together, they played against the likes of Zaheer Abbas, Mushtaq Mohammad, Majed Khan & others. //////My friends abroad hear me complaining about the traffic in Dhaka constantly and they don't get it. Actually, unless one lives in Dhaka or its suburbs, you cannot even begin to imagine the monstrosity and hopelessness of the situation. There's absolutely no solution in sight and most of the people are rendered captives to the issue. I live at Green road and from my balcony every day, I witness a severe gridlock that lasts for hours ! There are a few hospitals in this neighbourhood and sometimes even the ambulances are sitting with their sirens on in this never-ending flow of traffic. If you are a patient in the ambulance or waiting for one - a prayer and a priest might be your only hope. //////I have been utterly flabbergasted by seeing a photo of an emaciated rhinoceros in Dhaka Zoo recently. I have also come to know that this photo was published in a newspaper in Malaysia as well.
