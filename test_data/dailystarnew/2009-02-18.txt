I came to know from the story of the report that the female garments workers of a factory at Banani in Dhaka are not allowed to use sandals during their lunch break so that they cannot go far away. It is very tough and tormenting to walk barefoot on the rough pavements. The factory authorities argue that if the workers are not allowed sandals, they will return to their work in time! Such type of treatment is very barbaric and inhuman. We all condemn this strongly. This behaviour reminds us of the infernal days of slavery. We know that the garments workers contribute a lot to national economy. They toil to keep the economy stable. But unfortunately they are treated very badly. They do not get their dues. Their salary is very poor and even they do not get their salary in time. Sometimes they need to take to the streets to realize their wages. The working conditions are not conducive at all. Actually, they work in sweat shops. The owners as well as the government do not address their problems sincerely. They are always neglected. Actually, the owners need to ensure their rights to enhance their productivity that will be a win-win situation for the workers and the owners of the factories. The NGOs and human rights groups should come forward in this regard. //////Last week I had to go to Dhaka. As a newcomer to the city, I was able to notice the strange smell of the drinking water.

Bush with a little caveat. It is true that Bush left the office not only with the lowest approval rating, but also with a lasting damage done to the United States and the world community, in general. Particularly, he has done more damage to the Islamic countries including Bangladesh than any other US president, except, probably, Richard Nixon opposing our liberation war in 1971. Ironically, it is the US Muslim community that brought Bush an arrogant, unintelligent and ignorant individual - to the White House. It is still debated among the American Muslim community that had 537 Florida Muslims including Bangladeshi-Americans, not voted for this mediocre Texan, the US Supreme Court could not have made him the president. After a series of flawed recounts, 537 votes separated Bush from Gore, but we may never know the actual number. Although the Democratic party contender Al Gore won the popular vote in spite of the Muslim rejection, he lost the presidency due to a controversial loss in the electoral college votes resulting from a number of unfavourable and unfortunate events including the 20,000 or so discarded butterfly ballots, the irregularities in counting the votes through entire Florida and, ultimately, the refusal of the five supreme court justices to recount the controversial Florida county votes. In the aftermath of the election, the first independent recount was conducted by The Miami Herald and USA Today. They found that if all votes where the intent of the voter was clear were counted properly, Gore would have won, using any consistent standard for 'clear intent of the voter'. That's a different story.//////Pakistan's military yesterday vowed to hold fire and respect a controversial agreement signed between the government and militants to enforce Islamic law in the violence-torn Swat valley.//////The number of Afghan civilians killed in armed conflict rose 40 percent last year to a record 2,118 people, the UN said in a new report Tuesday.//////Leaders of the ruling coalition parties in Pakistan have expressed their anger towards terrorists and also on the violation of Pakistani territory by the United States.//////Sri Lanka's cornered Tamil Tiger rebels have intensified conscription of child soldiers, some as young as 14, the United Nations agency for children said yesterday.//////Pakistan dispatched a pro-Taliban cleric to talk peace with militants in the former tourist haven of Swat yesterday, a day after it agreed to a truce with the extremists and pledged to implement Islamic law in the region as part of a widely criticised deal.//////Washington sent Special Forces into Pakistan last summer after intercepting a call by the Pakistani army chief referring to a notorious Taliban leader as a "strategic asset," a new book has claimed, suggesting that former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf indulged in double dealings during his tenure.//////The global economic crisis and the threat of terrorism have combined to deliver a rude awakening to India's dream of continued peace and prosperity after successive years of sustained growth.//////Warning of "anarchism" if his Maoist led government is toppled, Nepal Prime Minister Prachanda today appealed to the fragmented communist parties to join hands to thwart the designs of the opposition.
