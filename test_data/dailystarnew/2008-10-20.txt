Chittagong is a happy augury not only for the women of Bangladesh but also for their counterparts in Asia who are presented with the unique opportunity of studying under the same roof.

Through a companionship and intellectual interaction they will develop a modernist vision of Asia and work for its implementation.//////The attack on the office of Dhaka University (DU) Vice-Chancellor ostensibly by some madrasa graduates was an exceedingly audacious act that evokes condemnation from every quarter. We are appalled to learn that about 200 students went berserk and vandalised VC's office when their demand for cancellation of a DU decision of not allowing admission to students who did not study Bangla and English carrying 200 marks each in their higher secondary or equivalent courses was not met by the VC. Though the VC assured them that the authorities would look into the matter in future since the decision for this year has already been approved by the deans' committee, the students refused to relent. They not only ransacked the office right before his eyes, they even threatened him of not letting the university run smoothly if they were not given admission. //////AFTER having met Vladimir Putin for the first time, President Bush claimed that he could look into the Russian leader's heart, and found a good man in it worth doing business with. Such hope soon came crashing down when American and Russian interests clashed violently in the Caucasus.

The two leaders of the two major political parties want a guarantee that they will win the election. I will not be surprised if they suddenly demand that the chief election commissioner resign but I hope I am wrong. The meaning of democracy covers something more than holding an election. In the last three elections, we saw the elected prime minister as the centre of all power. The defeated party collectively punished the whole nation with hartal and violence. I am not a politician, I've never been involved in politics in my life. Maybe that's why I don't understand the language of Bangladeshi politicians, but I do understand that a strong democratic institution is far more important than this type of election.//////The nation has never before faced this in history-- the 1/11 and its aftermath.//////Thanks to Abdul Kuddus Rippon for his informative letter on//////The article by Md.

Some 50,000 children in China are reported to have fallen sick, with many deaths, as a result of consuming melamine-laced powdered milk. To date, not a single documented case of such poisoning has been reported in Bangladesh. It would appear that further testing is called for in order to establish fully whether brands which we have trusted and used for decades could be implicated in such a criminal practice as adulteration. //////So, it's election time.

This is a very relevant question for the country as a whole.//////The letter from AS Islam, retired professor of Botany of Dhaka University, illustrates yet another reason why a 'unified system of education' could be a disaster. Thank you, Sir, for exposing the awfulness of at least one of the 'approved textbooks' in your subject and chilling us to the marrow at the prospect of not only the pupils in one type of school but all Bangladeshi pupils being exposed to the ghastly mistakes, the outdatedness and the sheer boredom of SOME badly written, illustrated and printed school textbooks. //////Basic democracy may be suitable for the people of Bangladesh. //////In our education system, there is the culture of rote learning from primary to university level. Examination system is also based on rote learning and friendly to rote learner. This culture does not develop students' cognitive capacity, thinking ability and creativity.

With a few exceptions, teachers are selected on the basis of academic results and, consequently, they also encourage rote learning. //////Laskar's write-up on the subject in your October 6 issue is only a very temporary phenomenon.
