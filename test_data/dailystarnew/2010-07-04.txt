If police are the public face of the government then it is a very scary face indeed that the citizens are watching recently. The latest incident of death of a man Mujubar by name under inexplicable circumstances has allegedly happened at the hands of the Darussalam police in the city last Thursday. The man was picked up from the Savar area the same day in the afternoon by a group of policemen and by night his body was found floating in the Turag river bearing torture marks on his lifeless body. According to the brother of the deceased, the policemen had allegedly demanded money from him for his release but when he failed to give it he was beaten to death. This stands corroborated by Iqbal, the deceased person's son who described in a prominent Bangla daily how the police treated his father: "They handcuffed him, gave him blows, kicked him, choked him in water by the river side, asked him for money, which his father said he didn't have, before hauling him up on to a boat." The police, however, denied all allegations of beating the person to death and rather branded him as a drug peddler. //////Anew suicide attack in Pakistan further demonstrates the increasing vulnerability of the country at the hands of religious extremists.

All over Pakistan, in these past three years, no fewer than 3,400 people have been killed in such attacks, with the security forces proving powerless to prevent such violence.//////David Villa scored

Most of the government hospitals in city areas have been under the control of a good number of brokers, who are one of the major reasons behind the plight of patients. For instance--a few weeks back a watchman from our building went to a hospital in the city for treatment since he was suffering from TB, lever disease and bronchitis. He went to see some doctors hoping to be treated well in that hospital, but his all hopes had been shattered when he experienced the horrible ordeal on that day. After he had arrived at the hospital when he tried to communicate with the hospital authorities concerned, he was intercepted all the way by a group of brokers and told to wait. He started waiting and found those people who told him to wait were whispering with each other. A few hours later one man came to him and heard about the diseases from the watchman. Afterwards he (victim) was given the promise by that broker to make the provision to help him get proper treatment. Then it was nothing but just waiting as the poor helpless watchman was under the process of being swindled. At the eleventh hour he had been briefed as to how he (broker) was going to get the treatment done through undergoing a cheap surgery by the very next week on the rooftop under the open sky of that hospital, when the doctor would be available. Listening to the broker exhausted feeble poor watchman came back home with a distraught face at the end of the day. He was sobbing during telling this awful tale of swindlers some days before his death. However, I would earnestly request the authorities concerned to intervene and make things better. //////The World Cup which is regarded as the biggest soccer event in the world started its month long journey last month. //////Will this massive craze of torturing women in our society ever come to an end? Why is it that when women's rights are discussed we always find ways to back out by simply saying, We're working on it or I think women have been given much more respect and rights than before through our initiatives or campaigns? Where do we, women, actually stand in a country like Bangladesh, where a single woman is left all alone to fight her battles while some elite people in our society are too busy running their so called social campaigns? A survey conducted by Bangladesh Health and Injury brought to light that over 2200 children commit suicide every year--which is almost six per day, of which four happen to be females. Even in a country like Bangladesh with a moderate economic growth and the increasing awareness among people, we still turn a deaf ear to the cries of the women not only in the most primitive of areas but in the city as well. //////As a cricket loving man, unless otherwise busy, I do not miss any international fixture in which Bangladesh is featured. I did not miss the last four games, two Tests in England and two ODIs of Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. I am writing this letter not because Bangladesh lost all last four games, I am writing this letter just to say something to the Bangladesh cricket officials about performance of our players. As a commoner fan, without having much technical knowledge, I noticed the Bangladesh players are as talented as others, but I found in them some serious psychological problems.//////I am gratified that at last I have got a response and from a lady foreigner at that, to the 69 letters I have written on the subject over the last 2 years and 9 months.

The AL has accepted the defeat gracefully. But do they learn anything from this debacle? Will they take little pains to organise the party rank and file? Will they choose cleaner, better and approachable candidates for Dhaka city and other forthcoming elections? MPs and ministers should come down to earth to meet the people.//////Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), the technological study leader of Bangladesh, is enervating its reputation through some of the undermining activities during the past few years. The pioneer university was once again shut down over an amateurish behaviour of its students! The reason behind the scene is too ridiculous to explain and one may be surprised but the truth is truth. It is a pity that BUET was closed several times over such untoward and unwanted incidents. //////Recently, one issue made all sensible citizens of the country worried.

Very recently two Bangladeshis were injured at Bisnakandi stone quarry on the Gowainghat border in Sylhet. The injured were Nasir Uddin, 30, a resident of Bisnakandi, and Lilu Miah, 28, a resident of Bagaiya at Gowainghat in the district.//////At the CRP, Ms. Valerie is trying to give mobility to the paralysed persons with the help of her dedicated physiotherapists. Our health minister himself is an eminent orthopaedic surgeon. //////Withdrawing scripts from the National University, Gazipur, I reached Chandura to catch a Lalpur bound bus. The bulky bag limited my movement and peace of mind. Anxiety to have a bus and concern for the safety of the bag and inexperience led me to fall into the trap of the ticket middleman. They took from me the money in full but I found myself in the lowest class of bus. The crammed bus was always uncouthly noisy with constant haggling of the conductors over the fairs. A passenger was also beaten in the counter but the weak labourers could not protest it. The years of hard labour, low payment and humiliation has made them expendable. The rough appearance of the labourers speak volumes of their abject condition. Lack of education, consciousness has prevented them from making the best use of their minimum means. The bus we were travelling on presented us the worst kind of travelling experience. It halted frequently to board and onboard the passengers. Passengers swore and shouted at the conductors and the driver but to no avail. The reality is the money they get from the passengers is very little. While good buses charge 300 taka for travelling from Dhaka to Rajshahi, this dilapidated buses take only 100, 80 or even only 50 taka from a passenger. //////The Fitra system for Hajjis means the Hajj Agent will collect Hajjis at a rate much lower than the rate declared by the government. They generally allure the intending Hajjis telling that their accommodation at Mecca will be very close to holy Haram, and the Hajjis fall in their trap and what actually they do is take them to Mecca and keep them in a house near to holy Haram and after three or five days the Hajjis are taken to Medina Sharif and from there they are escorted to Mina just on the 8th day of Zilhaj and after five days of Hajj rituals at Mina, then to Arafa, Arafa to Mujdalifa and then again to Mina. Thus all the formalities are closed and the Hajis are kept in a house near to Mina at Azizia or Shirsha from where the distance of holy Haram is not less than nine to ten kilometers. Then the Hajjis of this Fitra system face a great problemthe problem is to cross the big way to come to the holy Haram and engage themselves in Ibadat.//////The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications has recently proposed to the government to create a new ministry for railways (DS:23.06.10). I praise this proposition as it was overdue and a long felt necessity. The railway has huge manpower, huge land property and resources and enormous prospects. But as has always happened in all pristine departments in our country; lot of unnecessary, worthless and political elements in the name of workers and experts intruded into the organisations. The same has quintessentially happened in the railways. Umpteen times the railway tried to sell out its property, especially precious lands to the private parties and sometimes they succeeded. Though the railway is a losing concern of the government, yet the luxurious lifestyle and benefits taken from the government and the organisation by the officials and some union leaders will tell the real story of its dilemma. //////Amnesty International urged India to investigate recent killing of civilians in Kashmir yesterday, as thousands of troops enforced a strict curfew in parts of the revolt-hit region.//////The new US commander in Afghanistan has called for civilian officials and the military to make a "united effort" to tackle the nation's nine-year conflict.//////The European Union urged Sri Lanka's government on Thursday to cooperate with a UN panel probing alleged war crimes during the country's civil war.//////A Maldivian court has extended the house arrest of two key opposition lawmakers amid a dragging power struggle between the country's president and parliament, an official said Saturday.//////Shops and offices were shut across the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore in a protest strike over twin suicide attacks on an Islamic shrine, which killed 43 people.//////US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has ordered a tightening of the rules covering the US military's dealings with the media.//////New Australian leader Julia Gillard vowed yesterday to provide "solutions not slogans" on the sensitive issue of boatpeople as she works to shore up her position ahead of looming elections.//////A couple detained in the US-Russia spy scandal confessed to being Russian citizens living under fake identities, prosecutors said, as they prepared to reveal new evidence of the 11 suspects' alleged conspiracy against the US government.//////Interim leader Rosa Otunbayeva has been sworn in as president of the troubled republic of Kyrgyzstan.//////Iran has moved radar to Syria that could provide early-warning against a possible surprise Israeli air attack against Tehran's nuclear sites, a US defence official said on Friday.//////Amnesty International has challenged the official Chinese version of events in Xinjiang a year ago, when nearly 200 people were killed in ethnic clashes.//////The United States and Poland yesterday signed a deal on a future US anti-missile shield in Europe which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said would help ward off threats from Iran.//////At least 13 people were killed and nine others suffered severe burns in northern Nigeria when a tanker truck carrying fuel exploded after skidding off the road, road safety officials said on Saturday.//////The door to Nato membership remains open for Ukraine but the strategic ex-Soviet state does not need to choose between Russia and the West, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in Kiev Friday.//////Heavy rains unleashed by Alex, the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, caused the deaths of at least seven people in northeast Mexico, the Nuevo Leon state governor said on Friday.//////Indian police said yesterday they had killed a top Maoist leader during a gunfight with the rebels in a densely forested region of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.//////Nato forces accidentally killed two civilians, including a woman, and wounded another during an operation against Taliban militants in southern Afghanistan, the alliance said on Saturday.//////The United States voiced hope Thursday that all sides in Nepal would pull together after the prime minister resigned, saying it was "vitally important" to make progress in the peace process.//////At least 14 people were killed and four others were injured when their minibus fell into a ravine in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, an official said yesterday.//////Renowned dancer Shibli Mohammad will be one of the main judges on an upcoming reality show to be aired on ETV Bangla, Kolkata.
