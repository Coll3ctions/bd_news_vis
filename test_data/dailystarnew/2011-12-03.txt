This time also on the issue of holding the next general election under political party government or caretaker government the two parties hold diametrically opposite views. At least, as of now, there is no sign of either one budging an inch from their entrenched position.//////If it had been only another item on the continuing agenda of economic reform, the decision to permit foreign direct investment in retail would have been taken at least two years ago. Dr. Manmohan Singh's government has been in its favour from the moment it was sworn in seven and a half years ago, but was thwarted by the Left, without whose support it could not have maintained a majority in the Lok Sabha during its first term. That is understandable. No sensible government risks its survival for the benefit of a multinational's bottom line. But 2009's general elections changed the arithmetic of the Lok Sabha dramatically, and with it the algebra of policy manoeuvres. However, the Left's decimation did not alter a basic fact: that opposition to retail FDI cuts across partisan lines. The government has majority support in a compliant cabinet, but not in the less obedient Lok Sabha. The coalition that governs India is now split, although not broken.//////The unilateral Indian move to construct a dam at Manipur to regulate flow of the river Barak and generate electricity, despite opposition from upstream state Manipur and downstream country Bangladesh, has been made without any discussion with the government of Bangladesh as required by international law on common rivers. //////Realising Digital Nation" is the slogan of eAsia2011, an international event on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Development being held in Bangladesh (Dec 1 to3).

The event will also commemorate the 40th anniversary of independent Bangladesh and celebrate the progress of Digital Bangladesh agenda of the government. //////Climate change is a global challenge which affects all nations, some more than others. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries of the world to climate change. It is a threat to social and economic stability and sustainable human existence. There is no doubt that climate change affects the fundamental requirements for health -- clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secured shelter. //////The seventeenth conference of parties (COP17) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) got underway in Durban, South Africa on Monday 28th November with a colourful Zulu dance and powerful speech by the President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma. The presidency of the COP was officially passed on by the Foreign Minister of Mexico who chaired COP16 in Cancun, Mexico last year, to the South African Foreign Minister who will now chair COP17 for the two weeks in Durban.//////Briefly the definition and causes of climate change (CC) are: [1] increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission following industrial revolution; [2] increased GHGs level in the atmosphere; [3] more heat energy from sunlight absorbed by increased GHGs and reemitted in the atmosphere; [4] overall increase in the temperature of the planet; and [5] changes in the precipitation and wind pattern along with the temperature. It is proven that the CC is the results of greenhouse effects (GHEs) evidenced by intensified natural disasters, melting of polar icecaps and rising up of sea levels. Most of the world's population lives near coasts, so any changes, which might cause sea levels to rise, could have a potentially disastrous impact.//////The major outcome of the Sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (CoP-16) was establishment of Green Climate Fund (GCF) to combat climate change. The Transitional Committee (TC) consisting of 25 developing and 15 developed countries met four times in last seven months under the leadership of three co-chairs from Mexico, Norway and South Africa, and two vice chairs from Australia and Singapore under the framework of Cancun Agreement. At the end of the last meeting held in Cape Town, South Africa, the TC has prepared the report covering four thematic elements including objectives and guiding principles, governing instruments, operational modalities and monitoring and evaluation to be presented before the parties at the CoP 17. The report was sent with disagreement of the USA and Saudi Arabia, and reservations of some countries such as Venezuela and Columbia.//////The first time I had to judge books formally was when I became a member of the jury for the Commonwealth Writer's Prize in 2004. I was thrilled to be adjudicating such a prize, even though I was judge only for the Eurasia region (there are four regions in this competition: Africa, Canada and the Caribbean, Eurasia, South East Asia and the South Pacific; the regional winners are eventually considered for the award later). However, I soon found out that while the idea of being a judge is thrilling, the judging process itself is quite demanding. If my memory serves me right the three of us in the Eurasian jury (Professor Sanjukta Das Gupta of the University of Calcutta, and Maya Jaggi, of the literary page of the British newspaper The Guardian, were my co-judges) had to read 108 books in just about four month's time. I remember that while I had set out to devour all the books initially I soon found comfort in Bacon's worldly-wise observation of ways of managing one's reading in his classic essay, Of Studies: Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested, that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence, and attention. Adopting Bacon's method, at the end of my reading I could claim that I had tasted about fifty books, swallowed about thirty-five or so of them, and chewed and digested the rest. The books that I read really diligently and with rapt attention were of course the ones I had short-listed. When we met as a jury in Kolkata's Tollygunge Club we brought along the best of these short-listed books. Then in one day of intense negotiation we chose the winners from them: Mark Haddon's brilliant book about an autistic child, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, we agreed merited the Best First Book Prize while Caryl Phillip's sensitively rendered tragic tale of an African man's death in an English village, A Distant Shore, impressed us as the book most deserving of the Best Book of the Year Award. I should add that the process of arriving at these choices was not an easy one. After all, there were at least a few other works in our individual short-lists that had their claims to be made the best book in these two categories, though we certainly did not feel the same way about all of them. But it was a great feeling to be present in the delightfully preserved Bengal Club of Kolkata where the winners were announced. And as jurors of our region we felt vindicated in our final choices when some months later our selections were announced overall winners of the Commonwealth Prize in the Best First Book and Best Book of the Year categories at the Sydney Literary Festival later that year.//////This is the way the world ends, warns one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. It ends not with a bang but a whimper. //////Shojib is surprised to see the door unlatched. The door creaks as he pushes it open. The midnight breeze blowing across brings in a sweet smell as he stands on the balcony. The lights of the dining room are switched on, and from the balcony he sees sleepless Rehana in a crumpled up sari standing in the middle of the narrow corridor that connects the dining space with the balcony. For a minute or two they keep looking at each other with their eyes wide open. Then she walks clumsily to him and leans her body against his broad shoulder. He gets a feeling that a roach is slowly creeping up from his feet. Holding her straight by his hands, Shojib mutters: What happened? Why didn't you sleep? //////Teenagers in Asia receiving treatment for HIV are showing early signs of osteoporosis and children as young as five are becoming resistant to AIDS drugs, an anti-AIDS group said recently, urging more attention be given to young HIV patients.//////For centuries, people have known that exercise remodels muscles, rendering them more durable and fatigue-resistant. But very little thing was known whether it helps to keep brain fit or not. To learn more about how exercise affects the brain, scientists in Ireland recently asked a group of sedentary male college students to take part in a memory test followed by strenuous exercise.//////Myofascial Pain Syndrome is a chronic form of pain that affects muscle (Myo) and connective tissue surrounding muscle (Fascia). It involves some sensitive spots of the muscle called myofascial trigger points. These trigger points are painful when touched.

Sunlight exposure and certain foods, like oily fish, eggs and enriched milk products are good sources of D.//////The world is haunted by its own making nuclear weapons, though this argument makes sense but the growing complexity of international politics, nuclear weapons being inseparably linked, does not allow the strategists to think of a world beyond nuclear shield. This debate has grown bigger with the Obama administration's dismantling of the last US biggest B53 nuclear bomb, a Cold War relic 600 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Though the US is considering this development as a milestone in President Obama's mission to rid the world of nuclear weapons and the end of the era of big megaton bombs, the world is not naive enough to accept such claim, rather some thinks of it as a strategic approach to increase US moral authority to take actions against Iran, supported by a subsequent IAEA's report claiming to find evidence of nuclear weapons development by Iran. //////Myanmar has been trying to diversify its foreign orientation in the context of rapidly-changing regional geopolitical dynamics since the military dominated Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) assumed power in November 2010. It has recently witnessed significant political developments which moved the country from the 'policy of isolation' towards a 'policy of engagement.' Political developments include the recently enacted bill in parliament allowing citizens to protest peacefully, initiatives to resume dialogues with other political parties and release of political prisoners. As a result, Myanmar, to some extent, has elevated its position in International Politics. Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) agreed that Myanmar would chair the regional bloc in 2014. These changes have already given an indication that the country wants to realign its foreign policy breaking its long phase of isolation for decades. It also gives an assessment of which direction the country might take in the coming months and years.//////Russia has launched a military partnership project with its Cold War ally Cuba, amid rising tensions over US plans to deploy an anti-missile system in Europe.//////Since the liberation of Bangladesh there have been three critical periods in the history of our country. These were 1975, when the Father of the Nation was assassinated in August and then General Ziaur Rahman took over power in November, 19891991 , when General Ershad's army backed government was toppled and democracy was 'born again' with general elections held in 1991, and 2007-2008 when the army and some countries backed a caretaker government into power. Krishnan Srinivasan, who was India's High Commissioner to Bangladesh from 1989 to 1992 , wrote his memoirs , which was published in 2008 , which covers the 1989-1991 era.//////Ernest Hemingway's ////// is a classic work that brought him the 1954 Nobel Prize in literature. It has been translated and read in many different languages. It is a book that is familiar, at least by name, to almost anyone who has had a primary education. Growing up, I too heard a great deal about this book. Frankly, I wondered what all the fuss was about. It was met with the reply, as all kids will know, that I was too young to understand. Eventually, I decided to read the book and discover for myself.//////Poetry is an ageless experience. There is about it a timelessness that you cannot quite ignore. And that is because poets, being the unacknowledged legislators of the world they are, in Shelley's famous formulation, transcend time and space to ensure their commonality of passion about life and all that it is reflective of.//////
