Koirala was a political figure who came in the mould of those remarkable for their role in a reshaping of history. Like so many others dedicated to the principle of politics being a trust and a call to duty in the service of people, the late Nepalese leader upheld certain norms and values he considered essential for the growth of progressive thought. That his was an indispensable presence in Nepal's history was proved conclusively when he brokered the deal which was to put an end to the conflict between the state and its Maoist rebels and thereby inaugurate a new phase in the country's evolution to democracy. At a time when few people believed that Nepal could wriggle out of what then seemed to be an intractable problem, Koirala did not lose faith in his belief that better days would dawn.//////Strong tail-end batting got Bangladesh to 419 eventually but the second Test match is far from over as England ended the second day solidly despite a few blows.

It is not only a problem for Bangladesh but rather it is a global problem. Poverty, overpopulation, gender-based discrimination, lack of consciousness are the reasons among others behind women and child trafficking in Bangladesh. Uneducated and vulnerable woman and children deprived of financial, legal, social support and opportunities become victims of internal and cross border trafficking. //////The trial of war criminals has now become one of the headlines in our newspapers. There are speculations from various corners whether the trial is against a particular political party or against the real war criminals. However, the people of our country are awaiting a trial which will be held after a scrupulous scrutiny, justice and impartial investigation. In this trial, our government should not misuse the political power or vested interests of some people or group since it may cause defamation, irreparable loss or punishment to some innocent persons or groups. Any injustice may lead to trouble. //////This is the third time I am composing this letter because every time I tried to relax and compose this letter, power failure occurred. I am pretty much sure that not only me but people of all around the capital city are too much annoyed with the number of times the power failure occurs in a day. This electricity problem is hampering the activities of our daily lives and rather than solving this crisis, our government is busy changing names of institutions. Is this the real meaning of Digital Bangladesh? We always had this electricity problem and so far none of the previous governments paid special attention to it. //////I am very shocked at the incident of mugging in Gulshan-2 on 9 March. But it is a very common incident in our country to cheat the foreigners. Should it not be stopped?//////A qualified teacher is crucially important for quality education.

They were not allowed to come outside their homes. But now they are engaged in all types of jobs. They are working in factories, schools, banks, universities, armed forces, and so on. //////National Parliament House is the heart of a country, particularly for a democratic one like Bangladesh. It is expected to be a quiet and disciplined place because the destiny of the people and the country depends on the decisions and discussions made here. But it is a matter of profound regret and shame that the parliamentarians have made this place no better than a 'Fish Market'. Sometimes it seems that a 'Fish Market' is far better than this place! This is really shameful for us as a nation. The MPs, whom the general people chose to speak for them, use vulgar, nasty and uncontrolled words as if they are fighting with their enemies in a battlefield! This has been so common a matter that now we see it almost in every session of parliament. //////The speaker of the Bangladesh parliament believes that the leaders of the treasury bench and the opposition should play an effective role in maintaining order in the parliament which plunged into pandemonium last week due to the unruly behaviour of some lawmakers from both the government and the opposition. If the top leaders are active to this end, I strongly believe that parliament will be more functional and dynamic, and will run smoothly, he added. During the nearly hour-long interview at his parliament office, Mr Hamid touched upon issues ranging from parliamentary affairs, code of conduct for the lawmakers, political culture, parliamentary debates and so on.//////BCS is a very competitive exam for the participants and also a very important national issue as the officers selected through this exam play a vital role in national strategy building in future. So, a fair selection of the officers is essential. It is a rigorous exam and also a lengthy process. Almost two or more years are required to get the selected candidates appointed after the date of circulation. This lengthy process brings a question about the fairness of the selection procedure. Only a single paper objective type answer sheet (computer readable) takes more than three months! Then the written exam results another 3-4 months. After the written results are published, a few candidates are selected for viva voce. And it is a matter of great regret that even six months after the viva was held, the results have not been published. //////Recently, a news report was published that Bangladesh offered to host a regional summit on environment conservation and carbon emission cut. Bangladesh is the most affected country across the globe by carbon pollution caused by the developed and industrial countries.

It came under the rule of East India Company in 1765.This district was established as Tripura district in 1790.It was renamed Comilla in 1960.Chandpur and Brahmanbaria subdivisions of this district were transformed into districts in 1984.//////Are international umpires really that blind or was it another plan to swindle Bangladesh and make England win? During the second ODI between Bangladesh and England, I believe Bangladesh played a perfect match and outplayed England in every aspect but they were still short because the umpires made terrible and obvious mistakes. Was it deliberate or are they just reckless? //////The industrial base of Bangladesh has been expanding in the last two decades. Mentionable development has been achieved in garment, cement, textile, steel, sugar, paper, pharmaceutical, ship breaking, shrimp culture etc. Manpower export has already been proved a positive factor for the economy. In addition to the garment industry, information technology and ship building industry have tremendous potential and are developing fast. To operate the existing industrial ventures; to expand the industrial sector and to export technical manpower abroad Bangladesh needs huge technically educated manpower at diploma and undergraduate levels. //////Nowadays govt officers are assaulted by ruling party's student leaders. It happens when govt officers are performing their duties. There is no such example in any other country, not even in African countries.//////Who the government is for? Certainly not for the common and poverty ridden people. The government has completed about one and a half year but their activities and performances do not exhibit that they are acting as per there election pledges. In the last election, the present government got the popular mandate for their pledges to the nation which seem to be unattended now. A good number of important projects need to be implemented immediately but the government is not paying any heed to those. There are a series of assurances, commitments, plans and policies, fund allocation for various development works but execution of those development works is being ignored and nobody can say when those works will be complete.//////Thanks to Allah, at long last the government has given in to the demand of the general mass regarding the clock issue- an issue unnecessarily created by them. The unfortunate part of this drama is the govt was adamant on their decision without caring for people's opinion, so much so that the prime minister herself very strongly declared in the house that her govt would not change their decision and let people who disagree adjust themselves to the new set-up. It sounded so undemocratic and dictatorial!//////It is quite common to see that banks are contributing to the economy both by accelerating the wheel of economic growth and taking a huge number of talented people as employees who are best of the best in terms of academic qualification. As banks go through rigorous selection test to recruit their employees and offer lucrative salaries, in most cases, banks ask for people who possess extra ordinary academic results and other track record as is shown in the recruitment circular of various banks. In selecting qualified candidates, no doubt, banks are following the right recruitment procedures. However, as a student, what makes me dumbfounded, by observing some recent circulars, is confusing and discriminatory as a means of selecting candidates for written test. In recruitment notice, banks mention that candidates having 4(out of 5) both in SSC and HSC exams need not apply, creating discrimination between students who appeared in SSC exams in 2001 and 2002the years when elective subject was not added (and still not added) to the total GPA and the student, who got results after adding elective subject to the final pointappeared in the exams afterwards. Even, the candidates who sat for SSC exams in 2001 experienced same discrimination in their HSC exams held in 2003. //////Afghanistan's hard-line vice president expressed hope yesterday that an upcoming national conference will lay the foundation for peace with insurgents as a dozen civilians died in separate bombings in front-line provinces.//////Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has expressed the hope that the upcoming strategic talks with the US on March 24 in Washington would 'successfully achieve concrete results and tangible goals'.//////A remote-controlled bomb attached to a bicycle yesterday killed three people and wounded 14 others in Quetta city, capital of the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan.//////Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi yesterday didn't appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which has summoned him for questioning in connection with a 2002 riots case.//////In a stunning disclosure that once again confirmed the nexus between Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and banned militant outfits, a former ISI official, Khalid Khwaja, has claimed to have arranged at least five meetings between the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif and al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.//////India successfully tested yesterday a new "manoeuvrable" version of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile it developed with Russia, a report said.//////A petition has been moved in the Lahore High Court (LHC) seeking the registration of a first information report (FIR) against US President Barack Obama and other top American officials holding them responsible for the death of hundreds of innocent civilians during drone strikes in the country.//////UN chief Ban Ki-moon slammed Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip during a tour of the war-battered coastal territory yesterday, saying it was causing "unacceptable suffering."//////Thailand was mired in political deadlock yesterday as demonstrators used their own blood to create a giant piece of protest art and rejected the government's offer of talks designed to end their rally.//////Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, locked in a tight battle with his main rival to form Iraq's next government, yesterday called for a manual recount of votes cast in the country's March 7 polls.//////President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative party was bracing for a massive setback yesterday as frustrated French voters cast ballots in regional run-off elections likely to favour the opposition left and to set the stage for the 2012 presidential race.//////A new research has shown that as the earth's average temperature rises, so does human "heat" in the form of violent tendencies, which links global warming with increased violence in human beings.//////An advertisement for a new luxury train service embarrassed India's rail ministry yesterday by placing the country's capital, New Delhi, inside the territory of arch-rival Pakistan.//////Thousands of people gathered in Kathmandu yesterday to pay their final respects to Girija Prasad Koirala, the former Nepalese leader who helped bring a decade-long civil war to an end.//////British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour party promised a crackdown on lobbying by ex-ministers Sunday after some of its lawmakers were caught in a newspaper sting, just weeks before an election.//////Scientists said yesterday they had made a nanotech device to strip salt from seawater, paving the way to small-scale or even battery-powered desalination for drought-hit regions and disaster zones.//////Osama bin Laden's son Omar said on Saturday that al-Qaeda's North Africa branch should keep out of his family's affairs, after it accused Iran of mistreating his siblings stranded in Tehran.//////Thousands of anti-war protesters took to the streets of the US capital Saturday, on the seventh anniversary of the US-led war in Iraq in a show of frustration widely ignored by the media and public.//////"Teen Number Chokh" (by renowned writer Samaresh Majumdar) -- staged by Lokkrishti, a visiting troupe from India -- was the first play at the weeklong (March 19-25) Dhaka Padatik-UCB International Theatre Festival 2010. //////A Philippines-born pianist, now a resident of New York, playing the music of brilliant Polish composer and pianist Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in New Delhi?

After all, the book is centred around the thesis that free market fundamentalism and Breton Woods Institutions' imposition of their prescriptions in the wake of the 1997 Asian Crisis, forcing the afflicted governments to sell off many state owned enterprises to Western companies, had nothing to do with Bangladesh. These were done when these countries were reeling from the effects of disasters or upheavals. //////ECONOMIC growth (rise in GDP) is always deemed to be desirable as an outcome. Economic growth means more output, employment, income and, in consequence, more wellbeing for the people. That is why most nations strive to reach the higher growth path. Economists used to "worship" growth once, till they realised that growth could not be an end in itself; it was a means to an end. In other words, economic growth is necessary but not sufficient for people's welfare.//////THE streets of Bangkok, one of the most attractive and beautiful tourist spots of Asia, are once again witnessing tens of thousands protesters wearing red shirts, which has a significant meaning.
