Even so, Bangladesh could benefit outsourcing jobs in the near future, which could be difficult if a Republican was in power. Because it is observed that with the Republican Party government, the USA becomes more conservative in its policy. //////It is surprising what Khaleda Zia mentioned at Ramu. It is true that local and district administration could stop the attack if they had performed their duties properly. So it can be said that the administration didn't play the expected role. But that does not mean that the government has attacked the Buddhist temples and houses in a planned way. I think it is not true at all. Khaleda Zia's accusation really surprised me. //////Coal is a fossil constituted basically of carbon plus elements like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. Coal is the world's largest source of energy for the generation of electricity. But it is also one of the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2), a green house gas. There are more than 2300 coal-fired power plants in the world of which nearly 620 plants are stationed in China. A coal-fired electric power generation plant emits around 2000 pounds of CO2 for every megawatt-hour generated. This pollutes the environment. Coal-fired power plant releases a lot of mercury and other harmful chemicals into the air which can seriously affect human health particularly of children.//////I would like to thank all of Bangladesh who has been praying for Barack Obama to be re-elected. Your concern, support, and kindness during the US election period have really supported me and being with many of you this morning at the US Embassy sponsored Election Gaily and your enthusiasm for Obama really touched my heart. I am constantly touched by the people of Bangladesh as they have shared the US's good and bad times, but more than anything else for their kindness and enthusiasm.//////Currently one of the major issues of our country is our safety. It has degraded over the years, and now it's down to policemen committing crimes. Illegal possession of firearms, kidnapping, snatching, murder, drug trafficking, etc., are rampant all over the country. This happens mainly due to bribery, corruption, lack of surveillance and negligence on the part of the law enforcement agents. There are more than a hundred of such cases all over the country. Many village people have started to look after the security of their villages themselves instead of depending on the police. Our police must be neutral. But in many cases, we see the opposition's processions are attacked, whereas those of the ruling party are not. They often harass and punish innocent people instead of the real culprits because their names are the same. If law enforcers want to earn the trust of the citizens, they must work hard to ensure people's safety.//////This relates to your cartoon and Habib's front page lead report published on 12th. November on school admissions. In my opinion, except for the physically handicapped, admission quotas at all branches and levels of education must be abolished. After all is said and done, it ignores the right of the capable persons' access to education. We may call it all children's fundamental right to the three Rs! Only merit and mental capability should govern the criteria for admission to all educational institutions at all levels. There should be no interference from any quarter whatsoever. This should be classified as a criminal offence, and anyone doing it should be taken to task! There should be no quotas whatsoever, except for tribal and other excluded children as allowed by the relevant laws only. Under no circumstances, it should be considered a right or entitlement.//////Mobile phone is one of the wonderful inventions of science. This incredible technology has made our life easy. But the negative uses of mobile phone may bring many troubles to our life. We will not find one mobile user who has not received unexpected calls from unknown numbers. A group of mentally sick people find entertainment in making such calls. Girls are the main target of these unknown callers. If we contact the mobile operators, they suggest that we should avail their call blocking service for a certain fee. But there is no getting away because they call from different numbers. It seems that these unknown callers help the operators make more profit. If we seek help from the law enforcing agencies, they show indifference. //////Non-Government Schools//////A Hamas rocket killed three Israelis north of the Gaza Strip yesterday, drawing the first blood from Israel as the Palestinian death toll rose to 15 in a military showdown lurching closer to all-out war and an invasion of the enclave.//////Secretary of State Hillary Clinton yesterday said the Pacific "is big enough for all of us" as the United States pushes for a more visible military role across the region to counter China.//////Myanmar pardoned hundreds of prisoners yesterday under a mass amnesty criticised by pro-democracy activists as a cynical ploy to curry favour ahead of a landmark visit by US President Barack Obama.//////Russia yesterday warned nations backing the Syrian opposition against President Bashar al-Assad that they would be violating international law if they started supplying the rebels with weapons.//////President Barack Obama Wednesday angrily hit out Republicans gunning for the US ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, who is under fire over the militant attack on the US mission in Libya that killed ambassador Chris Stevens and three other US staff.//////Mitt Romney said President Barack Obama won by showering "gifts" on women, African American and Hispanic supporters, in his first published remarks since conceding last week's election.//////Signaling his much-speculated bigger role in the party, Rahul Gandhi, the scion of Nehru-Gandhi family, was yesterday named the head of India's ruling Congress' coordination committee for next parliamentary elections due in the year 2014. //////A 14-year-old Tibetan boy died after self-immolating, state media said yesterday, the tenth person to set themselves on fire since the eve of a pivotal meeting of ruling Communists last week.//////Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's new cabinet was sworn in on Wednesday at the national assembly and officially took up their posts, in the absence of eight contested nominees.//////Mumbai police stepped up security yesterday to prevent any unrest as Indian firebrand politician Bal Thackeray was reported to be in critical condition at his home in the city.//////British energy giant BP yesterday said it had agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion in US fines related to the devastating 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, including a record $4.0 billion to settle criminal claims.//////The four-day long Bengal-ITC SRA Classical Music Festival is just a few days away.

Maasranga Television is the telecast partner while abc radio is the broadcast partner. Ice Media Limited is the media partner of the festival.//////How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man?" asks Bob Dylan in the opening line of his famous song "Blowing in the Wind." The song asks many more "hows" as it goes along, but by the time it gets to the last "how" you think of our finance minister before you know. The words transform in your subconscious mind and turn into a chant verging on rant: How many times must a man say sorry before you call him a joke? //////The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China concluded on November 14 after making some amendments to the CPC Constitution.//////From the state to celebrity to institution, twisted minds either commit horrifying crimes, all under the wraps of normality, or abet in them. The "sewer of deceit" is scarcely laid open in real-time. It is either unraveled posthumously, or through deferred autopsies, if you like. In both cases, at best diminished traces of forensic evidence would be available to go on with. An exercise in moral rage whose potency has long expired as the victims had suffered quietly. Belated moral platitudes cannot heal the wound, but only reopen it.//////Unesco continues to remain in high esteem in the eyes of all concerned with education, science and culture throughout the world, even in the face of "crippling" fund cuts by the USA. The specialised agency of the United Nations enters 68 years today. It was thrown into severe financial crisis in October 2011 when Washington cancelled its grant on the issue of full membership of Palestine. Unesco was forced to slash spending, freeze job hires and cut programmes after the US fund cut, which made up 22% of its budget. The organisation, which promotes global education and supports press freedom among other tasks, started the year with a deficit of $150 million out of $653 million in its budget for 2012 and 2013, To cover up the deficit, UNnesco, under the leadership of Irina Bokova, the 60-year old former Bulgarian foreign minister and the first ever woman Director General, created an emergency fund to obtain cash, primarily from other members. She managed to raise $69 million, including $20 million each from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as smaller donations from countries including Turkey, Indonesia and Algeria. It has also received specific project funding from countries that have particular interests in certain fields. However, it fills gaps, but not in the long-run, Bokova said.//////Earlier this month the British Prime Minister David Cameron co-chaired a meeting of the UN High Level Panel to help shape the future of international development. The panel agreed its main focus should be on eradicating extreme poverty. At the United Nations in September, the prime minister had called on the Panel to produce a bold and ambitious plan. He is convinced that this generation can be the first to eradicate absolute poverty by putting in place the building blocks that take countries from poverty to prosperity: the absence of conflict, corruption and injustice, and the presence of property rights and the rule of law. //////Francisco Pizarro and his men capture Inca Emperor Atahualpa.//////Dell, a progressive 60 billion dollar US hardware company, has started its operations in Bangladesh as Dell Bangladesh. //////A top Samsung executive said Wednesday that the South Korean electronics giant had no plans to follow Taiwanese firm HTC in seeking a settlement over its patent disputes with arch-rival Apple.//////Microsoft Corp's new Surface tablet - its challenger to Apple's iPad - had a "modest" start to sales because of limited availability, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told French daily Le Parisien.//////Nokia has unveiled plans to offer a free maps app on rivals' devices.//////Computer Source Limited (CSL), has introduced Fujitsu Lifebook LH772 in the local market.//////World Cyber Games (WCG) Bangladesh 2012 ended on Saturday with the promise of future events from the next year on regular basis. //////A two-day South Asian Carriers' Meet (SCAM) 2012 begins today in the capital.//////I-Station Limited and UBM India, a part of UBM PLC, UK jointly organised second edition of The Bangladesh CIO Summit on November 8 at the Ruposhi Bangla in the capital.//////Qubee has introduced a limited edition package for the users who looks for good volume, decent speed and affordable price. //////
