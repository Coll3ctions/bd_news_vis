Naturally the city police were at their wits' end to fight crime and ease movement of traffic with their limited manpower and technical resources. //////THE men who raped a young girl in Faridpur recently and had the scene recorded on video and distributed in public have not yet been hunted down. This is inexplicable failure on the part of the police. Are we then to suppose that because the scandal has centered around a poor family it is all right to ignore the matter and pretend that it will be forgotten soon? It has been days since the incident took place and yet the local administration has seen little reason to move against the accused. On top of that, the police kept the victim's father confined at the police station in Charbhadrashon for fifteen hours after having picked him up to identify the houses of those who had allegedly raped his daughter. The situation has now come to a point where the father of the victim is now in fear of the police. And, of course, there is the shame that hangs over his poverty-stricken family.//////THERE was no war-like situation in the month of August in the year 1975 in Bangladesh.

These two cities have experienced severe water-logging for the last decade or so. Even a little rain causes a serious problem for certain areas.//////Almost every year, most parts of the country are being inundated after a sporadic or spasmodic cloudburst for some time during the rainy season. And the consequences are well known. But is it indefensible? If the government tries its best, it can certainly mitigate inundation of the regions, urban as well as rural, at least in part. //////The dowry system is the most contemptible as well as abused custom in our society. This heinous system is corroding the moral fabric of society. It has created never-ending troubles. It has become one of the major reasons of suicide of a large number women. Starting off with the best of intentions, it has now degenerated into a money making scheme, making despicable both the giver and the taker of dowry. There is no provision of dowry in Islamic rules. //////With unalloyed support for independence and strong opposition against the barbarism committed by Pakistan in 1971, India, no doubt, contributed much to the establishment of Bangladesh, showing great neighbourly approach to the war-stained people of the latter nation. With the passage of time, the relations, however, between the two countries have been termed as a 'complex' one, as there has been fluctuation, if not bitterness, between them. //////At present there are eight double-decked buses for the students of JNU. But these are not enough for the students. So, the students have to waste their money and valuable time using public transport. //////The necessity and popularity of mobile phone, makes it part of our daily life. People mainly use this handy device for the purpose of communication. But now it has become a popular medium of entertainment too, as some advanced technology like MP3 player, mega pixel camera, video recorder, Internet connection etc have been added to it. Especially, the young generation or teenagers show much interest in such mobile phones. //////The Awami League govt has initiated a number of sector-wise reforms. The prime minister in keeping with her election pledges has already announced that Rangpur would be the next division. It is only decentralization that can improve the socio-economic conditions of our people. It is only natural that for all practical purposes all the five southern districts namely Faridpur, Madaripur, Rajbari, Shariatpur and Gopalganj be incorporated within the fold of Barisal Division. This would minimize the sufferings of common people who have to travel all the way to Dhaka for legal and administrative purpose.//////We feel enriched and proud that we have many renowned, top class and famous writers, editors, columnists, journalists and press reporters in our country.//////Bangladesh, being a third world country, other nations' influence is always predominant here. As we need financial help from the developed countries to finance our development works and to build infrastructure, it is necessary to look forward to them for help. Because it is not possible to run development works with our limited resources. Consequently, taking the chance foreign countries' representatives meddle in our internal politics. //////I could not help but notice the letter by Mr. Sikander Ahmed in The Daily Star on August 14,2009 and honestly, I can't say that I am surprised. As I have previously seen on many occasions his letters here that ONLY support the existence of rickshaws in Dhaka city roads. //////Bangladesh is developing itself through thick and thin although many of us are not satisfied with our pace of growth from 1971 onwards. As we are famous for deficit budgets, we need assistance from international banking giants like WB and IMF. We have seen their suggestions for governing our state which in many cases have stood against our collective interest.//////What is more disquieting now for the city dwellers than the frightful traffic jam? And it is not beyond the knowledge of the Communications Minister. Horrible, from Shyamoli to Gulistan, a path of 4-5 kilometres and a journey of half an hour at best took two hours by bus. The other main thoroughfare, Old Airport Road, especially from Jahangir Gate to Sheraton Hotel always sees the dead jam that many times the DS brought to the notice of the authorities through vivid pictures. But it is quite disheartening and dismaying that the new government with over six months in office could improve upon nothing in matters of traffic management, nor it is observed to be wrestling with the problem to reduce the commuters' awful plight. //////The success in making an educated nation lies in the ability to offer free access to education, both at the intermediate and higher level. In our country, though we need to get the nation educated, the situation is bad for a number of reasons. One of those is paramount and poses a grave threat to the whole education system---that's admission trade. During admission season, our national dailies' headlines become replete with the news where we get the real picture of admission trade in which the student wing of the ruling party takes the position of market leader. Worse still, the trend is getting worse with the passage of time and the amount of bid depends on the status of the educational institutionfor example, while Dhaka College hoodlums demand Tk 50,000, in Sylhet or local districts the amount is Tk 15,000-20, 000. Maybe not all young politicians are involved in this virulent practice, but it undermines the education system as a whole.//////Digital Bangladesh (DB) implies a science-based Bangladesh where all activities of governance, commerce, education, health etc. will be processed by information technology. The election manifesto of the Bangladesh Awami League pledged "Vision 2021", i.e. a vision to build a Digital Bangladesh by the year 2021, the year of the golden jubilee of the independence of Bangladesh. This visionary approach of AL's manifesto is considered one of the major factors that attracted a large number of young voters to vote for AL-led grand alliance.
