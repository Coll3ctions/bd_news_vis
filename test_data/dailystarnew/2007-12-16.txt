The emergence of the sovereign state of Bangladesh in 1971 was not a run of the mill affair brought about by political negotiations around a table. It was an achievement arising out of a concerted war of national liberation, in which tens of thousands of men and women in the Mukti Bahini in particular and the people of Bangladesh in general put their lives on the line as they sought to send the Pakistan occupation army and its local collaborators packing. It was a war forced on us and over the nine months of it 3,000,000 of our fellow Bengalis were to die; 200,000 women would be raped by Pakistans soldiers; 10,000,000 would seek refuge in India and whole villages and towns would be left ravaged.
