With the devolution of powers on to a well- structured local government system yet to be effected, any step to bring the top administration within the close proximity of the people away from the capital is to be welcomed. Some of the previous governments had tried it with a lot of fanfare mostly ending up distributing favours to ruling party followers. This government has only a greater reason to be holding cabinet meetings outside the capital because there is no parliament now with the grievances of outlying districts getting known at the centre of power.//////It was panic time in the capital on Saturday and Sunday that saw a large segment of citizens buying kerosene stove responding to the announcement of the administration that supply of gas would remain suspended for next 48 hours.

According to former US president Clinton: "This places personal security very close to water, food, and shelter on the continuum of basic human needs." //////THE ghoulish kidney transplantation racket unearthed near Delhi, with ramifications across the nation, has shocked the public. Amit Kumar alias Santosh Raut's operation involved 3 hospitals, 5 diagnostic centres and 10 laboratories, and more than 50 accomplices, including doctors and nurses, "spotters" and touts who would lure potential donors with the promise of jobs, and thugs who would force them to part with their kidneys. //////THE Democratic Party's two remaining candidates have become so cordial toward one another that you could easily believe there are few substantive differences between them. At last Thursday's debate, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton heartily agreed on most issues and added that they were having a wonderful time chatting with one another. The Republican race, by contrast, is bubbling over with tensions and personal animosities. Watch any encounter between John McCain and Mitt Romney and you can almost see the smoke steaming out of each one's ears.//////There was no short of excitement on the first day of the three-day inter-club players' transfer for the Premier and First Division Cricket Leagues yesterday, but one incident marred the spirit of the game.//////Victoria Sporting Club produced a heart winning performance in yesterday's Protiti Pharma Victory Day Club Cup match but that was not enough for Abu Yusuf's inexperienced boys to collect full points against Mohammedan Sporting Club.//////Mohammad Rafique took four wickets but could not prevent Team C from losing to Team B by 83 runs in the third practice match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday.//////Persistent rain ruined an intriguing first match in the triangular one-day cricket series when the game between Australia and India at the Gabba was abandoned here Sunday.//////New Zealand's fragile batting order was left with even less depth with Scott Styris announcing his retirement from Tests and first-class cricket.

Just as the beauty is in the eyes of the beholders, it appears that the rule of law is too in the desires of business and political groups- depending on the day's need. //////I am writing about the reform proposals of the PSC that have been sent to the establishment ministry for review without any kind of recommendation for cancelling the quota system. It has disappointed us as well as questioned the government's initiative to bring changes for the better in this sector. It is undeniable that without honest, meritorious and competent officers in the administration you cannot ensure good governance and upgrade the prevailing service system. //////More than two and a half years have already passed, no BCS circulation has been given! The new boss of the PSC, a former cabinet secretary and veteran bureaucrat, assured the job seekers of holding a fair BCS exams after necessary reformation of the PSC. But PSC has been reformed in some areas, excluding the quota system. No step has been taken against this illogical system. The PSC is going very slow. No headway is seen. The job seekers are eagerly waiting for the BCS exams. But PSC is silent in this regard. So, the young generation is depressed and it is not unlikely that a large portion of this segment will suffer from moral degradation. //////The business community and the down-to-earth experts (having not so high degrees in economics) warned the present caretaker government time and again about the impending food shortage, possible rise in price in the international market and appealed for quick action. The importers wary of 'wholesale anti-corruption' and anti-hoarding operations were not much eager to import rice in large quantity. The TCB was sidelined and the BDR was entrusted with the job of import of rice and the result was inevitable. //////Now that the winter is here, I wonder why the condition of the Dhaka roads (not to speak of the rest of the country) is so horrible. There hardly has been any rain during the last few months and yet we have not seen any activities to repair those roads. I am sure that once the rainy season starts, there will be activities for the "poor" roads, which in fact will be in June, when the scope of the present budget will come to an end and, as such, there won't be much scrutiny (at least that is what the people concerned think ). However, in the present context, things are different. I hope no one gives Sidr as an excuse which seems to be the norm!//////Everywhere in the world, especially in Asia, Africa and South America, governments are using the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in enhancing sustainable development. Bangladesh that lags far behind in this regard needs to put the ICTs at the heart of all of its advancement programmes and strategies. These technologies can also expedite the country's progress in economic, social and political spheres. The traditional methods of growth and development will be replaced by the latest technology-based ways of development. And one development is e-governance, if we talk about the Electronic Governance (e-governance) of any country, then at first we must know about the appropriate definition or concept of Electronic Governance (e-governance). The term e-governance can be defined as efficient and effective use of modern ICT technology with a view to establishing good governance. From the management and technological perceptions, the e-governance can also be defined as Electronic State Management System based on information and communication technologies (ICT), including the Internet technology, CRM sectors, TCP/IP protocol and various kinds of attributes. The ultimate objective of e-governance is to establish good governance. The attributes of good governance can be identified as follows: a. Honesty b. Efficiency and Effectiveness (in terms of time, space and money) c. Justice d. Reliability e. Participatory Democracy f. Accountability g. Accessibility and Transparency h. Equity i. Vision in decision making. Many countries of the world are now using the e-governance, and are benefited very much. Now Bangladesh is going ahead of other developing countries of the world. And I think if the Bangladesh government implements the e-governance then it will help the country in real terms. //////When the whole world is shocked about the way B. Bhutto has been assassinated on the soil of Pakistan, here in Bangladesh some of us tend to have a different view.//////Mr. Elahi is ill informed. Indian subcontinent has a much hoarier tradition of democracy. Alexander got toughest resistance from Katha, Youdheya and Malla republics. These were never headed by a king but were republics and elected representatives to run the government. They never surrendered nor capitulated like Porus, who despite all accolades heaped upon him, became a vassal of Alexander. Vajji Sangha of Lichhavis, two thousand five hundred years back, on Northern bank of the Ganges in modern day Bihar state of India was one of the most powerful republics of Indian subcontinent and was antithesis to the so called grand kingdom of Magadh. Like all republics, ancient and present, it fell to internal dissensions. Democracy is ingrained in the subcontinent in the form of Panchayats in all villages, which is a truly direct participatory democratic institution. No king or potentate created it. It came out of the genius of the people of the subcontinent. More importantly, it works. No one in the subcontinent needs proof that democracy is the best system for larger good of the majority. The tragedy is that this remains unfulfilled due to the majority being bewitched by inaction. Coming to Kleptocracy, in the absence of a widely awakened public kleptocracy cannot be avoided. Take the example of India, for the last 17 years it is not ruled by a dynasty, at-least in majority of the states of India. But Kleptocracy rules. It is neutral to political shades, sex, religion and leftist or rightists. Antidote to Kleptocracy is democracy where people have the right to speak and to be judged by an incorruptible Judiciary. It is not to be in the subcontinent, because the good people decide to sit at home and kleptocrats rule the roost.

During his recent tour of Europe, General (retired) Pervez Musharraf did the exact opposite. According to him, Pakistan's people are "ill disciplined," "tribal" and "feudal," and certainly not ready for modern democracy. Pakistan's politicians, in his view, are "corrupt." //////Yet another elegant structure is being demolished in the old part of the city because of lack of sense to preserve the historical buildings and inaction of departments concerned of the government.//////There was a time when Tantibazar was one of the posh areas of the city.
