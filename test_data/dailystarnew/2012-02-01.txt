What has come to be known as Ekushey was, however, already in the making even before the establishment of Pakistan in August 1947. In July 1947, barely a month before India was partitioned by the British colonial administration into two independent states, several leading Muslim scholars rather inexplicably suggested that Urdu be the lingua franca of the new state. That view was, however, opposed by reputed Bangalee scholars, whose view was that since the Bangalees of Pakistan's eastern wing would constitute the majority segment of the country's population, it was only proper that Bangla be adopted as the language of the state. For his part, Dr Muhammad Shahidullah, writing in the daily Azad published from Calcutta, stated that having Urdu as the only language of the state and pushing Bangla into the sidelines would only undermine the interests of the Bangalees of Pakistan.//////India's External Affairs Minister SM Krishna may come to Dhaka on February 15 to assure Bangladesh that his country is committed to fulfilling all bilateral agreements and decisions made since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India.//////Police yesterday pressed charges against former leaders of Satkhira district unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) in connection with a case filed against them for violating a girl on January 4. //////Air raids struck al-Qaeda elements in southern Yemen overnight and killed 15 people, including a long-hunted militant leader, tribal chiefs said, adding that extremists responded by killing two soldiers yesterday.//////Israeli troops overnight detained a Palestinian man among those freed from prison last year in exchange for the release of a captured Israeli soldier, Palestinian sources said yesterday.//////We are upbeat about the decision to open a liquidity-swap window for extending financial support to the Saarc member countries.

It is that Iran's existence as an Islamic state is a miracle, given the repeated aggression and embargo imposed on it. Another miracle is that unlike Iraq Iran is not becoming an easy target of the imperialists. Enjoying relative political stability, Iranians are united under one Imam inspired and directly guided by Imam Mahdi who they believe is in occultation. Though these religious facts are beyond comprehension for western writers and thinkers, it is very much there. I cannot resist the temptation of quoting the famous line from Shakespeare: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. //////Veteran Indian social activist Anna Hazare termed his anti-corruption campaign as the second freedom struggle of India.

Each year thousands of people are affected by E.Coli bacterium by eating contaminated beef and other food products. Infection with these lethal bacteria cause severe diarrhoea, dehydration and kidney problems which often lead to death of children and elderly people or long term health problems.//////I am concerned with the recent decision of BCCB to send our national cricket team to Pakistan. When the world cricketing nations have boycotted playing in Pakistan due to security reasons, I am astonished at the BCCB's decision. I presume it's more like a barter trade that Bangladesh will send its team to Pakistan and in return Pakistan will support Bangladesh candidate in the ICC presidential race. What I gather from my friends in BCCB is that this decision has been taken at the whim of its president who is aspiring to take over the ICC's highest job. Why are we making our innocent players a sacrificial lamb for the personal gain of the BCCB president?//////The other day while I was riding down the main road from Ibrahimpur to Mirpur 14 on my motorbike in the evening, I noticed a very young boy, probably below 10 years of age, clinging behind a running rickshaw ahead of me. This type of scene is very common, so I didn't pay much attention to it. When I was about to cross that rickshaw, I noticed there was a woman on the rickshaw and the boy suddenly put something on the back of her head and swiftly opened the zipper of her handbag. It happened so fast that I was puzzled. And as soon as I realised that he was a pickpocket, I yelled to draw the lady's attention and tried to catch the kid. But I failed as he quickly ran away.//////Television can be a source of knowledge and education for children if they are properly guided by their parents.

Something of the pungent, something of the exciting has come into our politics. Of course, politics has always been exciting in this country, but of late the excitement has taken a dimension you do not and will not see replicated elsewhere around the world. A newly elected mayor -- and we speak of Comilla -- had his large vehicle block the path of a rickshaw the other day, the better for him to come out of it and land a few good punches on a lawyer riding that rickshaw. Of course, as is always the case, the mayor (and he has not yet been sworn in) denied that he had assaulted the lawyer. Why would such a good man do that?//////The virtues of salt are infinite, both in diet and language.

The opposite, //////, is still an accusation that stings, although contemporary values are determined by mercantile attitudes rather than ancient oaths. In today's job market, one is more loyal to the next salary than word given to the company you kept.//////While observing the 63rd Republic Day of India on January 26th, the Acting High Commissioner for India, Mr. Sanjay Bhatacharyya, held a reception at a local hotel in Dhaka followed by an impressive cultural presentation. //////Terrorism has become a global threat for humanity and has a pernicious impact on normal life. It has a serious effect on a range of fundamental human rights. Effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing objectives which must be pursued together as part of a state's duty to protect the people within their jurisdiction. Efforts to address the human rights implications of terrorism and counter-terrorism measures have tended to focus on the protection of civil and political rights, along with economic, social and cultural rights. //////Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty," Mother Teresa. //////
