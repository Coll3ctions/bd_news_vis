Not only has the worrying trend of mob violence become a common occurrence in recent days, but in this particular case, the role of the police has made it even more alarming. According to witnesses, the law enforcers actually verbally encouraged the mob to kill the boy. If he was in fact a robber -- as police have claimed but which locals have said is unlikely -- then it was the job of the police to arrest him, not let the mob beat him to death, thereby taking the law into their own hands. //////In what must be the most blatant violation of government rules and environmental laws by agencies of the government, the Rajuk, the DCC and the Rapid Action Battalion have been filling up portions of Ramchandrapur, Baunia and a channel of the Buriganga.

Not an easy task. When I heard about him for the first time, a friend told me that he is a prince of Bangladesh.

I knew only a few people and did not understand the structure of the organisation -- neither the fight about petty points at the general assembly, nor the value of each of the delegates. I remembered the prince remark, but didn't dare to ask him if he was a prince or not; actually I never asked him that. But I observed: whatever he did, he did in a princely manner.//////Actor Mahfuz Ahmed has scripted several TV plays.

A common question from skeptics and science-based thinkers ask, How could anyone believe that? Sometimes people do believe false and even weird things. In fact, the brain is a belief engine.

Indeed, we do not like to admit that we are wrong. //////In the years between 1996 and 2000, the task group Medical physics in developing countries of the German Society for Medical Physics (DGMP) arranged five seminars/workshop in Dhaka on medical physics with the physics department of BUET.

Seasonal dark streaks on some Martian slopes could come from briny water, American and Swiss researchers suggest in the Aug. 5Science. Still, the researchers haven't actually detected any water, frozen or liquid. Nor can they explain how the water would be replenished in the dry, harsh Martian environment.//////Recently, NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), mission has detected orbiting the Sun in loops around the plane of Earth's orbit. Before getting into details, let's explain what Trojan is in the realms of astronomy. A Trojan is a minor planet or natural satellite (moon) that shares an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but does not collide with it because it constantly lead or follow in the same orbit as the planet. Prior to this latest discovery, it was known that within our own solar systems, Saturn has the most known Trojan satellites: Saturn's moon Tethys has two Trojan moons (Telesto and Calypso), and Dione also has two Trojan moons (Helene and Polydeuces). In the scientific community, it was a long-held belief that Earth should have Trojans however their discovery was a sternly challenging one since they are relatively small and appear close to the Sun from Earth's point of view. According to Martin Connors of Athabasca University, Canada, who is also the lead author of the paper on this discovery that appeared in the July 28th issue of the journal Nature, These asteroids dwell mostly in the daylight, making them very hard to see. But we finally found one, because the object has an unusual orbit that takes it farther away from the sun than what is typical for Trojans. WISE was a game-changer, giving us a point of view difficult to have at Earth's surface. //////NASA's solar-powered Juno spacecraft lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 9:25 a.m. PDT (12:25 p.m. EDT), Aug. 5, 2011 to begin a five-year journey to Jupiter.//////A bonnethead shark, part of the hammerhead family, reaches a record age in captivity.

It is used largely in space, but also on Earth. It can be achieved by the use of different forces, in particular centrifugal force and (for short periods) linear acceleration. The creation of artificial gravity is considered desirable for long-term space travel or habitation. It allows for ease of mobility, and helps to avoid the adverse health effects of weightlessness in the absence of gravity.//////
