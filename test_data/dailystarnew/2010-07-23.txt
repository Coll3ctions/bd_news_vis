A nation's constitution is a crucial document responsible for helping it chart its course to the future. That is why we believe that the move to bring about the necessary amendments to the constitution vis-a-vis restoring its original form is a serious task that must be approached pragmatically. In its essence, the 1972 constitution, for all the changes that have been wrought in it over the years, remains a fine document for the country. The liberal democratic principles it enshrined through its various articles have by and large given us reason for hope about our future.//////Death of a woman while undergoing diagnostic test at a private clinic at the Dhanmondi area of the city has again raised the disconcerting question of safety standards in our hospitals. The mayhem that the unexpected death of the woman set off among her relatives leading to vandalisation of two clinics in the area and beating up of doctors was, however, an undesirable sequel to that tragedy. But there is also little room here to make light of the attending doctors' responsibility to come up with a satisfactory explanation for the unwarranted death. //////Prodigious spin propelled by an abnormally strong wrist and an iron resolve forged in bitter acrimony over his unique action took Muttiah Muralidaran to unprecedented heights in world cricket.//////It was a case of the glass half-empty or half-full.//////Having survived a second-half scare, titans Abahani edged past Sonali Bank 2-1 in their penultimate match of the Green Delta Insurance Premier Division Hockey Super League at the Maulana Bhasani National Stadium yesterday.//////Umar Amin again belied his reputation as a part-time medium pacer to help Pakistan remain on top in the second Test against Australia at Headingley here on Thursday.//////At the start of his final Test, he was eight wickets short of entering territory that no other cricketer had. He began his last day in Test cricket needing two, and took one. His partner threatened to take everything else and he could do nothing but keep on bowling, and wait. The umpire denied him a palpable lbw. VVS Laxman, who kept him at bay for so many hours, ran himself out and there was only one wicket left to take. He waited and perhaps even fretted. He nearly ran out the last pair himself, twice. After 23 wicketless overs, with perhaps growing doubt about whether it would come at all, the moment arrived, and Muttiah Muralidaran was there, where no man had gone before. The long wait for the 800th wicket only exemplified the toil that went into the preceding 799. And by the way, Sri Lanka won his farewell Test too, by ten wickets for the seventh time.//////World bowling record holder Muttiah Muralidaran was given a presidential send-off on Thursday after he retired with 800 wickets in the bag.//////At the start of the 59th minute in the Uruguay-Germany play-off for bragging rights for the third place in the World Cup, a strange thing happened. It was strange, because for the duration of the month long extravaganza in South Africa, it had not been spotted, and if anyone cares enough to look through the archived footage one day, it is well worth a wager that claim will stand the test.//////German prosecutors opened Thursday a preliminary probe into allegations French footballer Franck Ribery had sex in Munich with a prostitute knowing she was under 18.//////Chelsea have reportedly made an offer for Benfica's 20million-rated Brazilian World Cup midfielder Ramires. //////Steven Gerrard has hinted he will stay at Liverpool after the Reds captain revealed he was delighted by the club's capture of England midfielder Joe Cole.//////English soccer giants Manchester United beat the Philadelphia Union 1-0 Wednesday in a scrappy game against Major League Soccer's newest team.//////Brazil will name a new national team coach to replace Dunga in the next few days, a spokesman for the country's football confederation (CBF) said on Wednesday. //////The semifinal lineups of all 11 categories in the Southeast Bank National Boxing Championship were completed yesterday when 28 players moved into the round of last four from their respective categories at the Mohammad Ali Boxing Stadium.//////Bangladesh Rifles emerged champions in the Pubali Bank Premier Division Kabaddi League after registering a nerve-wrecking 24-23 win over Bangladesh Police at the Outer Stadium Kabaddi Court yesterday.//////Beximco Pharmaceuticals clinched title of the 5th Ascent Corporate 5-A-Side Indoor Soccer Tournament with an emphatic 3-0 win over IIDFC at the STM Hall of Scholastica School in Uttara.//////The stockmarket regulator for the first time has fined the two bourses Tk 1 lakh each for flawed computations in indices and starting trade before transaction hours.//////Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh dropped by 36 percent in 2009 mainly due to the global recession, according to the World Investment Report 2010 released yesterday.//////Members of the minimum wage board yesterday agreed to bring non-grade workers into a grading system. //////BSRM Steels Ltd is set to expand its production capacity to meet growing local demand.//////Bangladesh for the first time is sending 281 seasonal workers to Sweden where they will pluck wild berries during summer.//////The minimum wage structure for the garment workers in Bangladesh does not meet local or international standards, according to a government report.//////Fresh regulatory moves on single borrower exposure shook up share-trading yesterday, leading stocks to a steep fall.//////Transcom Foods, the franchisee of international restaurant chain KFC for Bangladesh, launched its seventh KFC outlet in Mirpur, Dhaka yesterday.//////The government should ease tax payment procedures and reduce hassles for payers, said speakers at a workshop in Sylhet.//////Khan Brothers Shipbuilding has signed a Tk 31.25 crore loan agreement with Rupali Bank to finance the shipbuilder's capacity building.//////In line with unaudited half yearly accounts as of June 30, the company reported net profit of Tk 128.54 million with earnings per share (EPS) of Tk 51.25 against Tk 78.96 million and Tk 31.48 (restated) respectively for the same period of the previous year.

The arms include billhooks, cleavers, daggers, long knives, iron rods and hockey sticks. However, none was arrested during the drive. Police teams along with members of HSTU academic council raided different dormitories of university and recovered the arms. The university was closed sine die on June 30 after the general students launched agitation demanding punishment to 15 students for violating the discipline of the university.//////The govt. distributed nearly 19 crore textbooks among the students of primary and secondary levels at the very beginning of this year. Those books were distributed free of cost with a view to ensuring education for all. Moreover, most of the textbooks are now available as online electronic books. It is obviously a praiseworthy action of the present govt. But the fact is that the students aren't interested in reading textbooks. They pay more attention to reading guidebooks available in the market. Hence, the creativity of the students is being greatly hampered. A textbook is a manual of instruction or a standard book in any branch of study. They are produced according to the demand of educational institutions. As the students do not read textbooks, they are not aware of the textual facts and they answer questions incorrectly. Although the govt. banned all kinds of guidebooks and notebooks, the publishers did not pay heed to it at all. //////In our country both the state & individuals establish industries & business houses of various trades.//////Hartal does not solve any problem. Rather it breeds more and new problems, confrontations and lead to sufferings of the people. Hartal costs a loss of taka two thousand crore countrywide a day. How many hartals have we observed during last two decades? According to a national Bangla daily (Bhorer Kagaj 26/06/2010) the Awami League has enforced 311 days and BNP has enforced 295 hartals.//////The Daily Star has published at least two letters referring to modesty and dress code for women, which might reduce the incident of teasing (?). The dress code of any nation is inherited by cultural practice and is part of social norms and changing style. It is not necessary to challenge the freedom of choice of an individual as long as it conforms to civility and is publicly acceptable. //////The report on the matter was published in most dailies on 11th July. The cost figure was indicated at around US$867 million in total, covering both foreign exchange needed and also the equivalent local taka, that is needed. This comes to Taka 606.9 crore (based on 1$=Tk70). If we consider a liberal interest rate of say 5 percent for financing this expansion, based on repayment period of say ten years, the additional cost of refining will be around 20 paisa per litre on the total refining capacity after expansion to 4.5 million ton annually!//////Load shedding is a serious problem in Bangladesh for a long time. Students are facing a lot of problems as even the IPS is not being fully charged. As a result, when load shedding is taking place in different sectors of Uttara, the IPS is running. The buildings using generators are not in a better condition. The generator is consuming a lot of oil. Oil is a non renewable source of energy which is quite costly.//////For many Israelis, the very thought of non-violent Palestinian protest goes so far against the grain as to be incomprehensible, lethally suspicious, a violation of a bedrock narrative. //////The 12th July last marked six months since a devastating earthquake shook the coast of Haiti. Former US President Bill Clinton who is also the President of Clinton Foundation recently visited Haiti to see for himself the situation and to supervise the relief and reconstruction works undertaken by the Clinton Foundation and other international agencies there. President Clinton in a recent e-mail wrote: Despite the challenges, I remain committed to helping the people of Haiti build back better. Through the Clinton Foundation, as the United Nations Special Envoy for Haiti, and now as the co-chair of the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission along with Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, I will continue to strive to help the Haitians build the nation that they desire and deserve.//////Who was the richest Indian in history? According to Forbes magazine, it was late Nizam Osman Ali Khan (1886-1967), the ruler of the princely state of Hyderabad, whose wealth, in the purchasing power of the inflation-adjusted US dollar terms of 2008 would have been the stupendous sum of USD 211 billion dollars. The world's richest man living, Bill Gates pales in comparison, as he is worth only USD $56 billion, about one fourth of the Nizam's wealth. By the same yardstick the personal wealth of the present King of Saudi Arabia was a plain USD 30 billion.//////The PCP article (18 July) is very lucidly and cogently written. I congratulate Engr. Nurul Islam for this. As mentioned by him in final analysis, the full veil is not an Islamic requirement but has developed as a survival technique for women in a predatory society ruled by ruthless warlords in the Middle East. //////Till now I had no concrete idea about the meaning of illiterate. The other day at a public place somewhere in Houston, Texas, I happened to notice a person staring at a notice board trying desperately to figure out what the sign says. //////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////Top US diplomatic and military officials warned yesterday of fresh attempts by militant groups to push nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan into a military conflict.//////North Korea has denounced a new set of sanctions imposed by the United States in an attempt to stem Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.//////Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas yesterday said he would decide in the next seven days whether conditions are now ripe to proceed to face-to-face peace talks with Israel.//////Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in February 2008 did not violate international law, judges at the UN's highest court said yesterday.//////A daughter and some of the grandchildren of former South African president Nelson Mandela were attacked by gunmen in Johannesburg as they returned home from a weekend birthday party for the 92-year-old statesman, police confirmed yesterday.//////Lebanon plans to file a complaint about Israeli "espionage" at the United Nations, according to the country's information minister yesterday.//////Southern China was lashed yesterday by its second typhoon in a week, with shipping and flights disrupted by heavy rain and strong winds, state media said.//////Two global health agencies joined forces here yesterday in a campaign aimed at averting 200,000 deaths each year by co-infection from TB and the AIDS virus.//////A weeklong group art exhibition, titled Colour of Life, is now on at Zainul Gallery, Faculty of Fine Arts (FFA), Dhaka University.

Once again the brilliant actress takes on the challenge of directing a play. This time she will direct another single-episode play titled Shunno. Additionally Suborna herself has dramatised the play. Traupa Majumdar and Jitu Ahsan will perform the lead characters in the play.//////A three-hour movie takes up to five hours to watch. Clothes must be ironed at least one hour before one is ready to go out. The microwave doesn't always work, so a hot meal is as chancy as a roll of dice. Between power cuts, favourite television shows are rare to catch. The last charge bar blinks on the mobile phone, while the user is worried sick about recharge. Tide may still stick to its guns, but time has lost its place in life. Now, even time has to wait for its hour to come.//////What happened in Kampala is just the beginning!" So warned Abu Zubayr, the leader of al-Shabab, which claimed responsibility for the bombings in the Ugandan capital that killed more than 70 people who had gathered to watch the World Cup soccer final. //////THE first prime minister of free Bangladesh" -- a phrase, associated with great honour and dignity. Yes, Mr.Tajuddin Ahmed, who happened to be the first prime minister of free Bangladesh rightly deserved the honour and dignity as stated above. He was a leader of great ability and farsightedness. //////AFTER Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman it is perhaps Tajuddin Ahmed, his closest aide, who can be termed my favourite Bangladeshi politician. His intelligent and thoughtful role all through March 1971 turned him into my favourite hero. //////Tajuddin Ahmad -- the first prime minister of Bangladesh was born on July 23, 1925 in Kapasia under Gazipur District (then Dhaka). Today is the 85th birthday of this great man, who is termed by many an "unsung hero." Maybe he was not totally unsung, but the song is almost always sung in a low voice, with much less volume than it deserves. I greatly admire this man as the executant of our national liberation, while I regard Bangabandhu as the organiser (1966-1970) and Moulana Bhasani as the dreamer (1957) of the liberation. //////Imagine you are sitting in your living room, looking at your friend's new photos on Facebook. Old friends start to send instant messages, and you have your email account open on a different window. Other links are also open, where you are browsing for information. Your television is also switched on and your cell phone rings, you pick it up, and while conversing, you try to read and send a text message. Looking obliquely from the corners of your eyes at the computer screen and someone enters your room and you finish your important family talks.//////The number of people using Facebook hit the 500 million mark on Wednesday, meaning one in every 14 people on the planet has now signed up to the online social-networking service.//////Still wondering which smartphone to buy? Which could best assist you in office work and provide best entertainment service at a time? Those, who are thinking of iPhone is the best solution, think again. //////Bangladeshi Arafat Jani made sure that the team returned home from the WCG 2010 Asian Championship with something to smile about after the younster bagged the bronze medal in FIFA 2010 play. //////
