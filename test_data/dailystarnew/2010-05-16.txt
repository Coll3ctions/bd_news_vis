We regret the error.//////THE police action on some of the taxicab drivers in Farmgate area on Thursday following requisitioning of their vehicles deserves to be condemned in the strongest of words. On the day, some policemen stopped taxicabs randomly on the road to requisition them, and beat the cab drivers when they resisted the move. What is most appalling is that the police personnel almost denuded one cab driver during the scuffle that followed. Eight drivers were arrested and sent to Tejgaon Police Station and the very act infuriated other cab drivers, who grew in number, and staged a demonstration before the police station on Friday for their release. Here again policemen used batons to disperse them when the cab drivers raised their voice against such 'illegal and whimsical' requisition, which caused them financial loss and harassment. //////THE government is planning to make education free for all, right from primary school and all the way up to the university. There is little doubt that the move is a good one and will resonate with public expectations. We appreciate the thought behind the policy which, we understand, is yet in the process of being shaped. However, we also feel that there are some practicalities which must be considered before such a policy is put in place. From such a perspective, we need to raise the question of why the necessity for free education must arise at all, especially at the public university level. More to the point, there should be a fundamental delineation of the education process that will enable the country to produce not only scholars but also experts and technical hands at the practical level of society. In today's world, where practicalities are as much significant as idealism, it is important that besides promoting university education steps also are taken for the provision of well-defined technical education to those who may not be drawn to higher education.//////Bangladesh's disastrous campaign in the Robi Asian Games Hockey Qualifiers took one more tumble as they went down to Singapore 0-1 in their clash at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.

Price action was extremely volatile in both currencies. The euro fell to a one-week low on Thursday, as looming fiscal tightening requirements in the euro zone outweighed the benefits of an aid package aimed at shoring up euro zone bond markets. A $1 trillion rescue deal hammered out at the weekend by global policymakers had eased investor worries a Greek sovereign debt crisis will spread. However, concerns about the ability of fiscally weaker states to make necessary budget cuts and about the impact on growth continue to weigh on the euro. Passage of the rescue deal has boosted risk appetite this week, providing a temporary floor to the single currency. However later in the day, the euro had given back earlier gains to trade down 0.3 percent versus the dollar bringing last week's 14-month low back into focus. The dollar was up around 0.1 percent against the yen. Versus a basket of currencies, the greenback was up 0.3 percent at 85.038. The index hit a 1-year high of 85.268 last week. The Australian dollar trimmed gains to trade up 0.5 percent at $0.8980 versus the US dollar. Australian employment data came in stronger than expected earlier, pushing the currency back above $0.9000. Analysts said interest rate rises from the Reserve Bank of Australia may be limited by external factors, potentially capping further Aussie gains. Sterling fell 0.3 percent versus the dollar, hit by a fall in risk appetite and as UK trade data showed the deficit widening more than expected in March.//////The first ever directory on biographies of women leaders of Bangladesh in different sectors, 'Who's Who: Women Leaders at a Glance 2010', was launched yesterday. //////Around 20 lakh children die of waterborne diseases in the country a year, said physicians and researchers at a discussion yesterday. //////The health sector of the country is suffering from an acute shortage of manpower, which has only 0.58 skilled health workers for every 1,000 people, speakers said at a seminar in the city yesterday. //////BNP Secretary General Khondker Delwar Hossain asked the party leaders and workers to take all necessary steps to make Dhaka divisional rally of the party a big success.//////Detectives yesterday arrested five people on charges of robbery at two jewellery shops at the Muktijuddha Super Market at Mirpur in the city.//////Over 100 people, including women, were injured in a two-hour clash between rival villagers over a trifling matter at Ujirpur village in Baniachong upazila yesterday.//////The European Union is likely to sign an agreement with Bangladesh, Cambodia and the Maldives to assist the three countries to combat the adverse impact of the climate change.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday greeted her new British counterpart David Cameron expecting the historic and warm ties between the two countries to strengthen further during his tenure.//////Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique yesterday said the free flow of information should be ensured in all sections of the administration for the socio-economic development of the country.//////Seven people were killed and five others injured in separate road accidents road accidents in Comilla, Sherpur and Barisal in last two days.//////Taxicab drivers kept their vehicles off the roads for the third consecutive day yesterday demanding punishment to policemen involved in Thursday's atrocity against the cabbies. //////Both the pass rate and the number of GPA-5 achievers in this year's SSC examinations under Chittagong Education Board have increased, compared to the previous year. //////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia held a meeting with the party's joint secretaries general and organising secretaries at her Gulshan office in the city last night.//////More than 200 doctors staged a sit-in at the Central Shaheed Minar in the city for two hours yesterday protesting the attack on Dr AKM Rafiquddin by unknown criminals.//////People of 17 villages under Batiaghata upazila of Khulna district are taking shelter at safer places as new breaches have developed in Batiaghata Protection Embankment which may collapse anytime.//////Robbers beat up members of four houses and looted valuables at Joka-Pukuria village under Ghior police station in Manikganj early yesterday.//////Observing faults and inadequate safety measure, experts at Barapukuria coal mine have apprehended that a large-scale disaster in the mine might occur in future if any effective measure is not taken immediately.//////Two people were killed and over 100 others injured when a severe nor'wester lashed the city and other parts of the district on Friday evening.//////Two people were killed and over 100 others injured when a severe nor'wester lashed the city and other parts of the district on Friday evening.//////Rajshahi Education Board has achieved 85.61 percent success rate this time, the highest in the last 48 years. //////Hundreds of erosion victims and landless farmers are cultivating various crops on vast tracts of the dried up river beds and char lands in the northern region.//////Parents of Azmeri Sultana Limu, who was killed in a road accident only a few days ago, burst into tears when they heard that their deceased daughter got GPA-5 in the SSC examinations.//////Two children drowned as they fell in a pond in Kanchua upazila in Chandpur yesterday.

Two of world's large rivers the Ganges-Padma and the Brahmaputra- Jamuna flows through this country. These rivers carry 2.4 billion tonnes of silt annually. The navigable route has been reduced by 2000km in the last 25 years due to siltation. At present the navigable route stands at 3800km only. So the government of Bangladesh decided to dredge rivers to increase navigability of the river at a cost of Tk. 11,472 crore in two phases. In the first phase, 23 rivers will be dredged at a cost of Tk 4201 crore in 3 years and in second phase 53 rivers will be dredged at a cost of Tk. 7271 crore . The project work will be completed in 8 years starting from now. The government expects 89 % assistance from donors. But work will begin now with our own resources.//////The canal is more than 100 years old, flowing just beside Saadat University College, Karatia, Tangail, one of the first five university colleges of the country. This canal connects Karatia haat (village market) which is the biggest village bazaar of the country. But regrettably this 100-year old canal is about to die only because of some local unscrupulous land grabbers who have been gradually eating up this canal. This photo was taken on 7 May 2010 and it shows how they have been filling the basin of the canal. This tin-shed market is owned by a member of Karatia Union Parishad which is totally illegal.//////Cutting down trees on a large scale countywide is not new, but very recently it has drawn the attention of the people.

Among the 'non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)' aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is famous for its quick pain reducing anti-inflammatory property. Aspirin has the ability to prevent blood from clotting which helps in reducing coronary heart disease events and stroke. This wonder drug also helps in preventing colon cancer, dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's disease). A latest research found that aspirin is capable of preventing breast cancer during the early stages and can control further spreading of cancer after surgery.//////Throughout the country, Tagore's 150th birth anniversary is being observed with great enthusiasm. He is the creator of many masterpieces of literature. I revere him for his immortal songs and short stories, especially Chuti, Shasti and Kabuliwala. In Chuti, he portrayed the life and tragedy of a restless teenager named Phatik. In Shasti, he raised his voice against the negative effect of feudalism and in Kabuliwala, he depicted fatherhood.//////There should not have been any controversy on the money the former Prime Minister legalised during the caretaker administration which allowed everyone to bring their hidden money in the light by paying some penalties or taxes. The former prime minister legalized a huge sum that meant she had some money which was not white. This money possessed by anyone is called "black money". I believe, the prime minister's charges against the former prime minister of "whitening black money" are not wholly unfounded.//////Many roundtables on the upcoming budget have been arranged by different NGOs. At first the core concept of budget should spread to the grassroots level. Then the budget turns into mass budget.//////Trial of the war criminals or crime against humanity as you name it, is now the national demand. Being far away from my home land, I have the opportunity to follow the process in the media and offer my humble reactions to show my respect to 3 millions of people killed during the war of liberation in 1971; and thousands of mothers and sisters raped and tortured in the same period; not to speak of 10 million refugees taking shelter in India. The above is a historical fact. //////It is a serious problem for city dwellers. //////Our family living in Canada decided to shift to Bangladesh for filial piety. Both of my father-in-law & mother-in-law were suffering from old age complication with other diseases, needed someone of their children to be beside them. What I am writing now is not a complaint, but I thought what we saw in Canada should be brought to the notice of the hospital authorities. In the hospital doctors and staff are seen to do everything with cordiality, and sincerity while I was in the hospital in Canada. I simply want our hospitals to improve their standard of services at par with other countries. Due to lack of such desired level of services in our country a large number of patients go to other countries spending huge foreign exchange.//////The news published in your daily on April 26, 2010 stating that Japan would provide five water purification mobile desalination plants is no doubt a welcome development. People living in the coastal belts have been suffering from drinking water crisis due to salinity and after any natural disaster this problem is compounded. Only the sufferers can realize it. As I was Upazila Nirbahi Officer of Shyamnagar Upazila under Satkhira district about three years ago, I saw the untold sufferings, especially after two major disasters i.e. 'Sidor' and 'Aila'. After Aila the water bodies of this upazila were submerged by saline water except a few ponds located around the headquarters. People had been screaming for drinking water. Instantaneously we set up a plant for filtering water in our upazila headquarters and supplied it to different corners. The district administration also supplied water transported by lorries. Satkhira Jubo Academy supplied water in the whole of upazila setting up plants in the headquarters. Oxfam, GB Ganoshastya, Assistance Eau Et Environment, a French NGO, established plants for supplying water. //////From time to time people of different classes, professions and occupations require various kinds of information, facts figures, statistics and guidance on different subjects and matters. //////We understand from reports that the present government is pretty determined to rehabilitate the scores of landless people around the country. It is believed, the process is already on to give away landed properties of Dhaka Nawab and Bhawal Raj Estate to the landless poor people. Land & Properties of over thousands of acres of both Nawab and Bhawal Raj Estate are at the sole custody of the government since abolishment of Zamindari act in 1952. The Nawab Estate owns land and properties in Dhaka, Savar, Narayangonj, Comilla, Keranigonj and Barisal etc.//////I have no grudge against somebody's wearing a suit even when the Temperature of the Country runs between 33 to 34 Celsius (figure obtained from the Met office). //////At present load-shedding is a common thing in our country. It hampers our social and economic development greatly. Misuse of electricity and insufficient production are the main causes of it. This problem is going out of control day by day. We cannot think of a happy and care-free life because of this problem. The govt should take necessary steps against it. New laws may be passed to tackle it. People should be made conscious of it. Meetings and seminars may be arranged focusing on the bad effect of it. Thus if we try honestly, this problem will disappear from our country one day.//////The emergency standby diesel generator of the Wasa pump located at Rashed Khan Menon Sarak, opposite Janakantha Bhaban, did not operate in case of electricity failure till end March 2010 leading to scarcity of water. Fortunately, the LGRD Minister and the AL general secretary declared deployment of the armed forces from April '2010 and thus the Wasa generator became operative leading to solution of water problem around this locality. What a success story of Wasa water supply!//////The bus route from Uttara to Bishwa Road cater to those who live in the areas such as Uttara, Azampur, Khilkhet, Uttarkhan, Dokkhinkhan, Nikunja, Kaola etc. Mostly salesmen, small entrepreneurs, students, teachers, Advocates and the stuff of the district court travel on the route. The journey is too long and traffic jam makes it more miserable; the people cannot concentrate on their work properly after making such a journey. Seating bus service which charges a fixed fare can reduce the pain of the commuters. It is very difficult to get a seat in the local buses which are available on the above route.//////A few days ago, one of my friends came up with a smiling face saying that he had just watched a Bangla film. My other friends stared at him scornfully, and it seemed as if watching a Bangla film was a crime.
