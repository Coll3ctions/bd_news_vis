Signing of the treaty was a historic move on the part of the then government that indeed brought about peace in the insurgency-ridden region. We nonetheless regret that the accord's status of implementation is far from satisfaction. This fact over the years has as well as creating a split between Bangalee settlers and indigenous people widened the gap between PCJJS and UPDF. //////The Bangladesh batsmen are well on their way to confine 2011 as their worst year in recent memory after yet another sub-100 score in the five-wicket defeat to Pakistan yesterday.//////Another meek surrender by the Bangladeshi batsmen to versatile Pakistan bowling attack in the first one-dayer of the three-match series simply compelled home team skipper Mushfiqur Rahim to bring up the same old question regarding Bangladesh's progress in the highest level of the game.//////Their cricketing brothers might be getting a bit of stick from Pakistan on home soil but the Bangladesh football team can draw inspiration from their own run of success against their sub-continental neighbours on a football plain whey they kick start the SAFF Championship at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi today.//////Mushfiqur Rahim remarked after the five-wicket loss to Pakistan yesterday that he hadn't seen much "home advantage" since October.

Countries having international rivers need to follow the international laws on sharing the river water.//////A study conducted by the US researchers reveals that babies born weighing less than 1.8kg could be more prone to developing autism than children born with normal weight. It is a very bad news for us because the number of underweight children in Bangladesh is very high. I have learnt from a report published in this paper that Bangladesh's progress in reducing prevalence of underweight children has become static at about 40 percent since 2000. Doctors say that low birth weight brings many complications to the babies. We know that maternal malnutrition is the main cause of low birth weight of the baby and that malnutrition develops due to lack of diversified and animal protein-riched food intake. //////As the world watches the unfolding of Arab Spring in the Middle East and West Africa, I cannot stop thinking what would happen if Bangladesh's youth occupy Shapla Chattor and demand the end of the misrule by the two parties. None of the two major political parties goes through leadership change; probably it is also true for the marginal parties. //////I have long thought that one would consider recruitment only if there aren't enough qualified personnel to discharge the duties in one's company. But recently, I've noticed that the government appoints first and then decides on what functions the new ministers may discharge.

As usual, the spectators were inspiring the BD team from the gallery by waving flags, showing posters of Shakib and Tamim, displaying placards with inspiring words and cheering when the Pakistan wickets were falling down. But I noticed that a few Bangladeshis were supporting the Pakistan team! They were waving Pakistani flags, drawing Pakistani flags on their cheeks and cheering at their success. //////The political scenario of our country is very pathetic. After 40 years of our so-called independence, we still have to worry about our education sector. When will our people become literate? Our fate or future is beholden to the two political families. The people are bound to cast their votes for the two parties. This situation must change.//////In 2007 I visited the office of Narayanganj Municipality regarding LGED-UGIIP implementation. I saw in the face of Selina Hayat Ivy, glowing with strong commitment and determination. I hope, as the first city mayor, she would seize the opportunity in a better way in order to bring back the old glories of Narayanganj. The local citizens should not also miss the opportunity to extend their cooperation to get the best out of her.//////The government has been insisting on how the DCC split is aimed at catering to the needs of rapidly expanding Dhaka city. The city corporations just have to scale up their operations and efficiency to handle the growing population everywhere in Bangladesh. Global experiences suggest that mushrooming of regulatory/administrative units lead to only higher corruption, not efficiency. The government really needs to communicate a logical strategic vision for the split.//////Alliance MPs could not get chance to oppose the bill; appointment of 2 administrators by this week//////Britain urged Europe to isolate Iran financially as EU foreign ministers gathered to agree sweeping new measures against Tehran due to fresh concerns over its secret nuclear programme.//////Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak yesterday ruled out a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities "for the moment," in remarks to public radio, but said that the Jewish state would keep all options open.//////Some call the country Myanmar, others call it Burma, but for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on a landmark visit, there was a better solution -- call it nothing.//////Amnesty International has accused Saudi Arabia of conducting a campaign of repression against protesters and reformists since the Arab Spring erupted, in a newly published report.//////Malaysia's parliament yesterday adopted electoral reforms including several demands made by leaders of a mass rally that alleged poll fraud.//////Nepalese health workers have culled hundreds of chickens and ducks following the first reported outbreak of bird flu in the capital Kathmandu, a government official said yesterday.//////In a move that may allow more highly skilled immigrants from India and China to obtain the so-called green cards faster, the US House of Representatives has passed a bill modifying the visa system.//////Marking four decades of independence, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) is holding a month-long 'Bijoy Utshab' (Victory Day Festival) -- featuring a number of cultural programmes at its premises. //////Dhaka Theatre's widely popular monodrama Binodini sees its 100th show today (December 2).

She is accompanied by eight Bangladesh musicians. //////IT can be placed anywhere between a slip of the tongue and a purported leak when Awami League General Secretary Syed Ashraful Islam recently said he knew that party nominations were being sold for money. For all practical reasons he has put his money where his mouth is. More so in a society where everybody knows everything, but nobody likes to talk about it. //////THE Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2011 was released by Transparency International yesterday. In a scale of 0-10, Bangladesh scored 2.7, which is 0.3 higher than in 2010, and occupied 120th place among 183 countries compared to 134th among 178 countries in 2010. In terms of ranking from below Bangladesh is placed at number 13, one step higher than last year. In the same position as Bangladesh are Equador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Mozambique and Solomon Islands.//////AT the outset, I am tempted to recall a Swami Vivekananda anecdote as follows: A brick was seen on a road and as walkers passed it by, none cared to even look at it, let alone remove it for pedestrian convenience. But when a man stumbled over it hurting himself, people took notice of the incident bending over him in sympathy. The obstacle was removed by a collective decision underlining the virtue of organisation in human affairs. That is the essence of the story; in detail though, I may stand corrected. //////IN 1800, only 3% of the world's inhabitants lived in urban areas. In 2008, the world's population was evenly split between urban and rural areas. It is argued that the 21st century will not be ruled by superpower America or emerging power like China, but by the city. This, according to Parag Khanna, a geo-political expert, is largely due to time, technology and population growth that have accelerated the advent of this urbanised era. //////FREEDOM fighter Zinnat Ali could never have thought of such a tragic end to his life. He was a senior school teacher and a modest person according to the people who knew him at Barisal. Most notably, he was a freedom fighter who fought bravely for the liberation of the country. But that reputation did not help him from not being murdered. What was his fault? He stood against and protested the stalking of his teenage daughter. But stalker Rupam Dey Anik and his friends did not like this act of bravery and stabbed him to death. He even phoned Zinnat Ali's daughter to be sure whether her father had died or not after the incident. //////The British Government invites four Indian leaders, Nehru, Baldev Singh, Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan to obtain the participation of all parties in the Constituent Assembly. //////Asia's mega ICT event, e-Asia 2011, kicked off yesterday at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in the capital.//////ICT analysts yesterday said broadband services should be technology-neutral and medium-independent -- wired or wireless. //////Local and international health experts yesterday called for using modern information and communication technology to take healthcare services to the rural people in a cost effective way. //////Galaxy Y, the latest from Samsung's Galaxy series, is set to be released in the local market from this week, says a press release. //////GPIT, the first offshoot company of mobile operator Grameenphone, has recently been awarded two certifications by the International Organisation for Standardisation -- ISO 20000 for IT Service Management and ISO 27001 for Information Security Management System.//////
