student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), following the latter's notorious activities across the campuses, has been received with mixed reaction by people in general. We would like to believe that it is not merely an expression of disgust but one of determination to cry a halt to BCL tyranny that has been wreaking havoc as much on higher education as people's confidence in the credibility of the ruling party and the government. //////THE reported move by the government to have local Members of Parliament play a major role in the management of non-government schools and colleges is rather disquieting. It is so because of the negative consequences such a move may have on these institutions where a proper and efficient administration is concerned. In this respect, it is the past record of non-government educational institutions under political management that we are reminded of. And we cannot but say that the record has never been a good one given the propensity of political figures on the management committees to give a partisan colour to the running of schools and colleges and thereby inject controversy into the entire process. //////THE month of March commemorating the first days of the struggle for liberation in a series of elitist formal gatherings in the capital gave the beleaguered Awami League government a feel good commercial behind which it could conveniently take refuge from the ugly realities that have befallen the dispensation ever since it took charge. Though commoners like us enjoyed no access to the elites' celebrations, we did commemorate by reminiscing about those glorious days. However, the reprieve was soon over. //////THERE are two ways of seeing Varun Gandhi's anti-Muslim speeches in Pilibhit, where he's contesting as a BJP candidate.

About the recommendations of the round table, I would like to add a few ideas which can be introduced by the government to increase protection against fire disasters.//////The Dhaka city environment with scarcity of safe drinking water, fresh air to breathe & the mosquito menace is almost a hell for many of its dwellers except a very few fortunate people. One has to just see the state of the rivers; Buriganga & Shitalakhya to realise the extent to which we all are so indifferent to allow such dangerous level of pollution. Polluted air with unabated mosquito breeding everywhere are examples of total failure of the civic authorities.//////Markets, bazaars, pharmacies at every street corner. But how do I get there? There's the option of taking a rickshaw, but that would cost money. What about taking the car? Don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam. Or there is another option...walking. Yes.

After his talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Obama said This is not an American mission, this is a NATO mission, this is an international mission. These words reflect the fact that the US definitely is seeking more European help in dealing with its war against Afghanistan. In other words, Obama is basically trying to convince the European nations to pledge sending more troops into Afghanistan. And if not military troops, Obama expects that they will at least provide more non-military aid in terms of helping to train the Afghan army and police; sending civilian experts to assist the Afghan government and providing financial aid to run these schemes.//////I have passed the 28th BCS preliminary. I noticed in some daily newspapers that the PSC is going to start the 28th BCS written exams from April 30. On the other hand, HSC examinations will start from April 16. In the past, the PSC never took the BCS written exams during public exams(SSC and HSC), because some of the candidates are now serving in non-govt colleges. Most of the teachers of non-govt colleges will be engaged with the HSC exams. //////The state minister's comments on the corruption charges against some politicians are an eye-opener to the people.

At the very beginning of the summer, the clock time is to be advanced one hour and at the end of the season it will be set as it was. //////We went to visit Shalbon Bihar (Maynamati, Comilla) on Friday, 27th March 2009. We hired two microbuses from Mymensingh to make our journey. This was the first trip for all of us to Shalbon Bihar. Naturally, we all were very excited to have a close look at this renowned historical place. We reached Shalbon Bihar at 12:30pm. We got down from the bus hurriedly to buy tickets for the entrance. When we reached the ticket counter we found it closed, nobody was around. Upon checking with the guards at the main entrance, we were surprised to know that the tickets won't be available till 2:30pm. And we also noticed a signboard on the right side of the gate where it was written that the gate would remain closed from 12:30pm to 2:30pm on Friday. I would like to ask the authorities-- how have you introduced such a timing on the weekly holiday? To add to this, when we tried to visit the museum in the afternoon at 4:45pm, we found it closed too, as the man in charge was not around. //////It has been reported in an English daily that police wants magistracy power in the metropolitan areas. The concept is against the principle of separation of judiciary from the executive. We think the provision will break the fundamental principles of justice that policing and magistracy should not be vested in one authority. Bangladesh throughout its 38 years of journey has passed and practiced undemocratic norms of legal and policing functions. We can see the emergence of district police officer as equal to district magistrate, an issue which never came up for compromise in the past. The police department has already earned the privilege to be equal to the executives. Now they are asking to share the judicial powers as magistrate. The question is how one looks at it. The dictators, and undemocratic governments will always look for support from the law enforcing agencies and would always agree to enhance their power and privileges violating the fundamental principles of justice. I do not know what provision exists on this issue in a democratic country like India. Nevertheless, I think the principle should get precedence over individual needs. The issue needs to be reviewed at all levels of the government.//////Studying without aid is one of the most effective approaches to prepare for exams. It enhances not only the personal study skills but increases the ability to handle some critical study-related issues. Though it is quite difficult for some students, it can be fruitful if they stick to it. //////May I make a modest suggestion to help in the slow and essential process of holding the owners and drivers of vehicles accountable for how they are driven? In the UK, the backs of many trucks, buses and other vehicles on the road display a telephone number and a notice 'Driven well? If not, report to....' After all, bad driving not only threatens life and limbs but the profits of a business //////Bangladesh has started negotiation with Russia to set up two 1000mw nuclear power plants. This is most welcome news for all of us. Nuclear power is the cheapest, cleanest as well as one of the most sustainable power sources. But there are two important tags attached to such projects. Initial installation cost is huge and secondly, and perhaps most importantly, safety aspects are very important. For a poor but densely populated country both aspects need careful study. Cost-wise may be Russia will give a better offer but as far as safety is concerned perhaps we should consider the French power plant as an alternative. France has the most advanced nuclear power technology where almost 80% of their need is met by nuclear plants with an enviable safety track record. Our policy planners may search other alternatives as well. But we must keep in mind that safety comes first, particularly when we deal in anything nuclear.//////As I travel to the southern parts of Chittagong, I can see acres of waste land --tracts of land lying idle. There is little sign of green--the landscape looks almost grey. In the past, the farmers used to grow crops in those lands during this time of the year. Unfortunately, the scene of lush green paddy field is now a part of the memory. In fact, one can see only caked earth covered with dead stubbles and weeds.//////President Barack Obama yesterday launched an effort to rid the world of nuclear weapons, calling them "the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War" and saying the US has a moral responsibility to lead as the only nation to ever use one.//////North Korea has once again created an international crisis by launching a rocket, once again thumbing its nose at a world community wondering how to deal with the rogue communist state.//////With North Korea's rocket launch, Kim Jong Il has the world exactly where he wants it: with all eyes on Pyongyang and its defiance of demands by the US, South Korea and Japan to cancel the firing.//////As Indonesia heads to legislative elections this week, Islamic parties in the world's largest Muslim-majority country are facing the daunting prospect of their worst election showing yet.//////European leaders enthusiastically praised President Barack Obama's new Afghan strategy at a Nato summit Saturday but held their ground on a central disagreement and offered only military trainers and extra security forces for upcoming elections.//////Asserting that UPA is not disintegrating, Minister for External Affairs Pranab Mukherjee today said that it "was very much intact while at the same time the NDA is breaking.//////Pakistani and Afghan officials were Sunday preparing to send home the bodies of 46 Afghans found crammed into a truck container believed to have been bound for Iran, officials said.//////The trial of the suspect charged over the Mumbai attacks would start soon as the court being built for the case was nearing completion, the special public prosecutor said yesterday.//////The American UN official kidnapped in Pakistan two months ago was released unharmed yesterday, ending the most high profile hostage ordeal for a Westerner here since Daniel Pearl's 2002 killing.//////Six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs in Rajasthan have joined the Congress, giving the ruling party a majority in the state assembly. //////India yesterday welcomed the introduction of a bill in the US Congress which links financial aid to Pakistan to the condition that it stops supporting terror groups active across the border.//////The new Afghan policy of the US will remain ineffective and further multiply problems for the Nato forces until a solution to the war was found through political means, governor of Pakistan's restive North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) has said.//////Chief of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant outfit Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, who is the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai terror attacks, has moved the Lahore High Court challenging his detention.//////Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met a US congressional delegation on Sunday, the official SANA news agency reported, amid warming relations between Washington and Damascus.//////US President Barack Obama promised on Sunday to take the lead in global efforts to tackle climate change, which Europe has long accused Washington of failing to address seriously.//////Increased military spending by China and India is forcing other Asia-Pacific countries to modernise their armed forces despite the severe impact of the global financial crisis, experts say.//////Lifting out blackened jewellery and bottles of whiskey, Cambodian troops comb through the wreckage of a village destroyed in a bitter battle with neighbouring Thailand.//////With Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt out of contention, social activist Nafisa Ali was on Sunday announced as the Samajwadi Party candidate from the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat.//////Sanat Kar is one of the noted figures in Indian printmaking.
