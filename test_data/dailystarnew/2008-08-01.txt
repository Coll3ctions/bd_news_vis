It has onerous responsibility to prove its efficacy, not just because the experiment is getting underway in the country for the first time with no experience to fall back on but also owing to the huge load of mercy petitions it will have to dispose of without undermining the integrity of the justice system in any way. //////THE crisis resulting from the agitation by Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait has clearly taken a turn for the unsavoury. With the Kuwaiti authorities deporting as many as a hundred of the workers, with the very real possibility of more such workers being forced to come back home, matters get extremely awkward for relations between the two countries. Conditions ought not to have come to such a pass, given that the workers, at their wits' end, were only agitating for better wages and living conditions in the state. As far as issues of this kind go, it should have been the responsibility of Kuwait to look into the workers' grievances and so prevent the crisis from taking a bigger shape. That has unfortunately not been done. And what is certainly unacceptable now is the deportation measure.//////ONCE I read something striking about conspiracy theories that they were like a black hole, which sucked in everything, irrespective of origin or content. Last week, that black hole sucked in words from London that the Awami League president held a series of meetings with Jatiyo Party leaders in the city of Big Ben. Ding dong, they talked about working together in a grand alliance. That is if they met.

We saw them at Kamalapur Railway Station and in many places at night. But after the caretaker government took charge of the country, the scene radically changed. The number of homeless people increased manifold. Now I see them everywhere in Dhaka. The other day when I was crossing the street in Mirpur at about 12:00pm, a middle-aged woman was sleeping there on the island. Any time I pass through Karwan Bazar, in front of Prothom Alo office I see people sleeping or lying on the footpaths.

Rather, they have consumed the power from the power generation units to fulfil their individual needs on different occasions. The outcome is - we all get to share the limited power supplies which the country still generates. //////The regime of autocrat President Ershad was a dark chapter of our political history, no doubt, but his initiative to introduce 'decentralisation' was a praise-worthy move. Everything is in Dhaka, but that cannot bring about optimum benefits for the country. Everyone is rushing towards Dhaka for job, education, business, marketing etc. And so, Dhaka is now on the verge of death. Other regions of the country are underdeveloped to a great extent. Now it is high time to rethink the matter seriously for the country's benefit.//////Politics is growing like business.

Recently, the CEC even expressed frustration as very few good people came forward to participate in the polls. //////What is going on even during the period of interim non-political government?

This man could have been your son, brother, nephew or even father. But he gets no justice because the state has decided to kill him, As long as the victim is not your relative, you might be thinking the act of crossfire is a great way to get rid of criminals?

As I am a candidate of 28th BCS, the matter haunts me all the while. So I am expressing my personal view here again.//////The CEC recently said he is disappointed that good people will not be participating in the municipal polls. And the Chief Adviser has appealed to the people to elect good candidates. Now, where will they get good candidates? //////Well done BTTB. You have got front-page coverage after quite some time in the most widely circulated English daily of the country for your unholy acts(News item - The DS, 22nd July,08). You should be grateful to ACC Task Force for this. Their relentless digging to unearth your misdeeds over the years resulted in this "Honour" being conferred upon you. Who cares about shame, stigma etc? Those were old schools of thought. Taka 6 lakh for maintenance of each car is nothing. After all, don't these mechanical transports require maintenance? Money is no problem. Taxpayers are there. So, money had to be spent to keep each vehicle flawless, spotless, shinning, so that BTTB officers' children, grandchildren, friends, relatives, in-laws did not have to face slightest bit of embarrassment while riding in cars. Now you have a worthy successor BTCL. They have reduced the number of cars by 22%. A remarkable achievement indeed! We see old wine in new bottle with an old stopper at the top.
