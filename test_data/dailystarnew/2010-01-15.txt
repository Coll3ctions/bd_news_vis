And that is what has been happening. Governments across the globe as well as international and local relief organisations have been quick to answer the call. Bangladesh for its part is despatching medical teams to the ravaged country. With more that 100,000 people dead in Port au Prince, the capital, and elsewhere in the impoverished country, it is easy to imagine the totality of the destruction. The casualties will likely be a lot more than what is being estimated at this point. It is the sheer scale of the devastation that is mind-boggling. Almost all buildings in the capital have collapsed. The United Nations office has come down on sixteen of its employees, including the head and deputy head of the mission.

It is indeed nice to see the mobile operators self affluent to have got the ability to afford several company-owned cellular towers. However we, as a nation, should feel pity for letting go the huge area of arable agriculture land. Technically, a single cellular tower can be used by several mobile operators for covering their network in a particular segment.

Moreover, the establishment and use of individual cellular tower remain under-utilised. //////Education is the backbone of a nation. And education is the basic element of human life.
