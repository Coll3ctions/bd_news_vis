First, it was Maldives, now it is Nepal, each out-doing the other, to publicise the desperate need for environment protection and containing global warming!//////The earth is getting warmer day by day and we are going to be in deep trouble. Nowadays the climate change has become a thorny issue across the world. On account of the melting of icebergs in Antarctica zone is that the large part of the earth may be extinct by the surge of water within 50 years unless proper steps are taken. For this, the world leaders have assembled in Copenhagen to convey the message of its grisly affect upon the earth and to be alert regarding it. And it is reported that Bangladesh is now at a vulnerable juncture. //////We were deeply shocked at the sudden demise of one of our alumni, the celebrated photography icon, an ardent nature lover Dr. Noazesh Ahmed.//////The people of this country never put so much trust in any person other than the prime minister's father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Malibu Raman. //////The matter of using enormous ornamental chairs for leaders has been a shameful culture in our country for years now and so, it was with a sense of relief that we saw our prime minister rejecting this unseemly seating arrangement for a more normal chair at par with other signatories at a public event recently. The leaders probably do not ask for this special /preferential treatment. It is more likely the result of over-enthusiastic arrangements made by obsequious sycophants, there being no dearth of them in our society. We only hope that good sense will prevail and we the public will be the spared the agony of watching leaders sitting on grotesquely designed throne-like seats while others around take a lower seating position. //////One can proceed in one's creativity only on the basis of one's cultural moorings. Science grows indigenously. Understanding requires connecting to a previous experience a reference point. Suppose you are asked to explain the feelings that you develop if you live on the moon. You obviously cannot tell because you simply do not have that experience. Advanced, sophisticated technology has been made a basic need for scientific research today. As a result, the environment of research and the day-to-day environment of the vast majority have been divorced. Einstein, Dalton and many others did not have at their disposal any sophisticated machinery. Their approach was totally deductive.//////Do you hear them? They are everywhere around you. Bullet separated souls from bodies, nothing more. Struggle and inspiration is flowing with the same force and power since 1971. //////Different people are giving different opinions from their own angles on the just concluded BNP Council which the party could hold after 16 years and that too, to meet the requirements of EC.//////Before the Eid-ul-Azha festival I tried to collect two bus tickets for Paikgacha, Khulna, to observe the holy religious festival with our relatives there. The fare was heavily enhanced, yet I could not collect it then. So, I had to go home to meet my old parents three days after the festival, providing the same exorbitant fare. I asked them the reason behind the high fare. On the plea of paucity of passengers they took away the extra amount of money from me. But I saw the bus full of passengers that day too. While I was coming back to Dhaka on 9 December i.e. 11 days after the Eid, the number of passengers was the same, but yet I had to pay the same cut-throat fare. //////Good governance and running of the country depend on the fair play of the political parties, mainly by the political party forming the government and the political party in the opposition. Their fair play shall establish peace and prosperity. People can leave in peace and happiness. So it is very vital to make the political parties practise fair play within some sort of boundary lines and some set conditions. In this respect, the Election Commission is the guardian who can set some rules and disciplines to monitor and control the activities of the political parties for good governance and running of the country to lead the country to peace and prosperity. A political party or any member of the party crossing the boundary lines and breaking the set rules will disqualify as the party/members. It needs some machinery to chop up unwanted/ unwarranted activities of the political parties. Against this backdrop, the provisions of the Representation of the People's order (RPO) was adopted which portrays the people's rights and desires. Tolerance and decency will be developed in the political culture and criminal activities and extortions will be banned. But we observe that the country's politics seems to have regained its old look, intolerance, unlawful activities by ruling party men, low observance of democratic practices within major political parties and parliament boycott by the opposition party. //////Perception is an important fact. Who are you? Are you a boy or a girl? People view you as a male or female and this view is very important in our society. By using this view, our society thinks, identifies, categorizes and defines each other. But in our society, there are some people who do not have any identity such as male or female! Apart from male and female, there is another form of human being- the transsexual. In our country, there are also the transsexuals. Here, they are treated like a foreign being, a freak of nature! But if we look at the UDHR (UN Declaration of Human Rights), it is clearly noted that all people are same, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Everyone has the right to life and liberty. It was my good luck that I could meet with the transsexuals for completing a research work. Before starting our research work, we had a strong belief that the transsexuals are very rough in nature. We thought that they are very much aggressive, quick-tempered and cranky. But after meeting, I understand that they are very much decent, well mannered and friendly. Since they have to face misbehaviour from the common people around them in every step of their life, they sometimes make aggressive and rough behave. They are helpless people because they do not have any secure place to go, any honourable work to do. They do not have even the right of the freedom of movement. People always tease them. They think that this type of odd-looking people have no right in society. They are simply a trash for the society. They cannot do any good thing for the society. But this is a wrong notion. Transsexuals are also human beings. They have some fundamental rights. Like others, they have also the right to freedom of thought, freedom of expressing opinion, right to property, right to work etc. If the government of our country gives proper attention about their development, it will be easy to change the miserable life of the transsexuals. We should realize their sorrows and help them make their lives easy.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.
