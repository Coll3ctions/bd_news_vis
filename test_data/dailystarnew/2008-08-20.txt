The military-backed caretaker government has won all cases so far in the fast-track special courts but failed to cross the next hurdle when top graft convicts challenged the verdicts in the High Court.//////The Awami League (AL) yesterday sought appointments with the chief adviser and chief election commissioner (CEC) for immediate talks on holding of the parliamentary elections and upazila polls to "clear growing confusion over the polls".//////The most obvious and truly heartening meaning of Pervez Musharraf's ouster is that democracy is the best form of government and it is the only one that people prefer. There have often been talks of this or that country, or people not being ready for democracy. Such views are archaic, self-serving and devoid of all lessons of history. People everywhere prefer freedom and the political system that has been found, over and over again, to fulfill that irrepressible aspiration of the people is democracy. However, flawed democracy was and remains the best option for people everywhere. A lesson that we in Bangladesh have learnt the hard way and one that we are determined to preserve under all circumstances.//////The government initiated the process to mark hillsides and valleys, where landslides are possible, as "Red Zones", evacuate people living in those areas and bring those areas under afforestation. //////The Anti-corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday pressed charges against Harris Chowdhury, political secretary to former premier Khaleda Zia, his family members and five others in a case filed for amassing wealth worth Tk 85.88 crore illegally.//////Dubai-bound Bangladeshi jobseekers are being scammed with fake visas more than ever, but the authorities are yet to take any effective measure to remedy the situation. //////Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) will bring up the issue of killings of Bangladeshis by Indian Border Security Force (BSF) at the director general (DG)-level talks with BSF beginning in Dhaka tomorrow. //////While China's gymnasts completed one of the most dominant Olympic performances ever with more gold Tuesday, defending football champions Argentina thrashed Brazil 3-0 in one of the biggest mismatches between the two South American rivals.//////The government today starts its nationwide open market sales (OMS) to stabilise rice prices ahead of the month of Ramadan.//////Passengers and crew of two aircraft--a Thai Airways Boeing 777 and a Biman DC 10--were unhurt when tyres of the planes burst while landing at Zia International Airport (ZIA) in Dhaka and Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong yesterday. //////Twelve more government officials have applied for the Anti-Corruption Commissions (ACC) permission to seek exemption from prosecution in return for confession of corruption to the Truth and Accountability Commission (Tac) .//////August 19th was a unique day in the life of Musharraf.

The fact that huge chunks of mud from a hill descended on fourteen homes, part of a slum, and took the lives of two families would be called by fatalists as an act of nature against which people have hardly any defence. But in reality this was courted, thanks to fiddling with nature and imprudent choice of site for habitation with commercial interests thrown in. There is here the very critical question of how we have in these past many years ignored the rampant felling of trees, indeed the indiscriminate destruction of forests, that has gone on everywhere and especially on the hills in the south-east of the country. //////CERTAINLY Beijing Olympics have lived up to its hype. From the opening ceremony to the many disciplines of sports since Aug 8, 2008, the world has been left wondering at the excellence of human performance where records have tumbled by the day. Individuals and teams have competed to the limit of human endurance and the best have come out with honours. In this regard several individuals and countries have stood out because of their extraordinary feats not accomplished ever before.//////IT is a most healthy thing when a dictator leaves office quietly, having first acknowledged the idea, however reluctantly, that he is not wanted any more. When Pervez Musharraf had his soldiers commandeer Pakistan in one of its more infamous moments in October 1999, he certainly could not imagine that the politicians he was sending packing would come back to banish him into the woods. But that again was quite natural, for men who seize power by means foul often forget the way history works. That is how they make themselves suffer and their nations go through agony. //////GEORGIA'S President Mikhail Saakashvili was nave enough to believe that he could take on Russia on the issue of break away South Ossetia. His American-trained officers commenced military operations to integrate South Ossetia with Georgia on the very day when all world leaders focused their eyes on the opening of the Olympics in Beijing (August 8). He hopelessly miscalculated the situation in South Ossetia.//////A smear campaign is intended to tarnish the image of an individual or political figure. Smear campaigns in the United States are as old as the republic. In the 18th and 19th centuries, political parties did not care to buy advertising per se, because they were owners of the newspapers. Political parties used to publish their own house journals, in which they dug up or invented dirt about the other side. Parties also circulated pamphlets attacking opponents.//////Two quickfire goals from Sergio Aguero powered defending champions Argentina into the Olympic final as they put the sword to South American rivals Brazil in a 3-0 win at the Workers' Stadium on Tuesday.//////India one-day captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday conceded it was not easy to read Sri Lanka's unorthodox spinner Ajantha Mendis.//////A second half strike by Rokonuzzaman Kanchan gave Muktijoddha Sangsad their first win in the Citycell Federation Cup with a 1-0 defeat of Khulna Abahani at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Christine Ohuruogu's remarkable return from a year long ban for missing three dope tests was capped here on Tuesday as she added the Olympic 400 metres crown to her world and Commonwealth ones.//////After their narrow loss in the first warm-up game against the Australian Institute of Sports (AIS), the Bangladesh cricket team will want to give a much improved display, particularly in the bowling department when the sides meet again at the Gardens today.//////Ever brighter, ever tighter - hot pants for the sprints, ringed socks for the long jump, "whole-body condoms" for swimming.

A country like Bangladesh is far away from the concept of "Human Rights". When there is an occasion to say something in social gatherings, educated people like us speak a lot about human rights and what can be done to improve the condition etc. But honestly speaking they themselves don't know what it really means. //////The Indigenous people from all over the world celebrated the "International Day of world Indigenous people" on August 9 every year. The Day was declared as such by the UN General Assembly on December 23,1994. This year the Day has been celebrated with the theme " The Economic and Social Rights of Indigenous People". UN Secretary General Ban Ki -Moon in his special message on the occasion of the Day has mentioned, "Indeed the sufferings of indigenous peoples include some of the darkest episodes in human history". Needles to say, the indigenous people suffer oppression, grave human rights abuses, even the threat of extinction in this country. For example, this year on the night of April 20 some land grabbers attacked indigenous people in Rangamati. They set fire to Indigenous people's houses and continued to occupy their lands forcibly. But they too are citizens of this country. //////The whole set up of modern Olympics is such that only rich nations can hope to win anything of significance, because the preparations, training, sponsorship and proper facilities require enormous expenses. The ancient Olympic ideal of involving only the athletic field events and individual competitors have given way to multifarious team events on land, water, ice, etc, and recently some strange events like synchronising swimming, diving have joined the list.//////Our medicare system is in dire need of patient-centered reform, not broad expansion. Working closely with McGill University Health Centre as a student of Health Science, I can attest that Bangladesh medicare is shabby. It views care primarily in terms of money and the number of people technically covered. Patients are often told which doctors they may see and which treatments are permissible. Medical decisions, perhaps our most personal, are often made by bureaucrats, rather than doctors and patients. Positive reform requires fundamental change that puts patients first. Incentives must be offered to contain costs, but our city based private clinics' health care system is incapable of providing patient - centered change. Instead, we should reform our national tax policy to ensure it makes financial sense for all Bangladeshis to be insured. The system needs to be overhauled so that insurance is owned and controlled by the patient, regardless of who is paying the bill.//////I would like to know if any census was done on the number of people killed during our liberation war of nine months. If no census was done before, it is better to do this immediately. It is necessary for any nation to know the actual history and the number of martyrs. It can be done by collecting information from each family residing in a ward (which has to be divided into several units to collect correct information) and side by side a history also can be prepared as to how and where these people were killed (this can be collected from their family/friends/local government records). //////Note the paintings behind the cycle rickshaws, and look at a Zen painting. Too many additions in one painting, and minimum use of ink/paint, strokes, and time. What is the difference between additive art and subtractive art? Look at the other. The latter looks simple, natural and attractive. Why? One reason is the interactive reaction between the artist and the viewer --the latter completes the picture in his own way, and is happy. Zen art is sort of timeless. A consumer product independent of cultural differences of the users would sell more (subject to budgetary limitations). //////I think enough is enough. In the last three months, there was hardly any day when the newspapers did not write something about SAU. We have another 26 public universities, which are running with so many problems. Please highlight other universities as well to develop their education system and research facilities. //////Indians are good in English. That's why India is now an emerging tiger in the world. We can't ignore this reality. Therefore we hope that our coming government will come up with a definite policy on English education.I would like to make some suggestions regarding methods to develop communication ability in educational institutions. //////I'm talking about a prominent politician. The intransigence of this person and her party led to the pre-1/11 turmoil and still they are trying to create so many impediments in the way to the next general election in December. Most surprisingly, she is now dictating terms to the government for her release. Her secretary general issued a 72-hour ultimatum to release her (already expired !). She refused to be a voter if not released unconditionally and wants her sons to be sent abroad for treatment; she even wants the govt. to recast the EC according to her wish. //////I am living in Australia for the last couple of years. I have seen that all businessmen sell their products at a discount rate on the eve of different occasion like X-mas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and so on. But in Bangladesh the situation is different. Businessmen wait for the occasion to earn extra money by increasing the prices of commodities. I think that they are getting ready for the upcoming Ramadan, Eid and Puja. They know that people have no alternative to buying goods from them. People of Bangladesh can sacrifice money but they cannot sacrifice their festival. Businessmen know this weakness of the people and increase the prices of commodities. As a result, people are compelled to pay the extra money which is really unfair.//////I think a lot of interesting events and characters are emerging in our political arena. These can easily be produced as live comedy serial in the media networks. I am sure this would be popular and commercially viable, and our aesthetic values would receive a new dimension. Our talented drama scriptwriters might consider this. Here are a few ideas://////I am feeling very happy with the news of Bangladesh winning a silver medal in the Beijing Olympics for its national anthem.//////I would like to thank Mr. M.A.S. Molla for his article enitled Political psyche against upazila polls (Aug. 14, 2008). I completely agree with him. However, I want to add one more point. This is the politics of grabbing the local politics by some central leaders. Bypassing the local party members' choice, they want to nominate personally over-loyal local leaders for the upazila elections. We remember the very recent event of nominating the candidate for Rajshahi Mayoral election. Actually, the present central leaders are the barriers. They are not willing to practise democracy. That is why, during the last four decades, the natural progress of our democratic leadership has been in decline.//////Transparency international of Bangladesh says that incorporation of general people is a must to make the movement against corruption a success. It is not possible for a single institution to curb corruption, and corruption will be rooted out from society if the organisations ensure transparency and accountability. It is essential to incorporate the young generation into the movement as their ideas are important to stamp out corruption. Besides, awareness about corruption will be raised among the mass people if the anti-corruption activities and programmes are put in the website.//////I'm an ordinary citizen of this country. Whatever I do, directly or indirectly, I try my level best to do something better for my motherland from my humble position. In fact, many people are trying to do the same thing, mostly unrecognised.//////According to a High Court (HC) order, the government has declared August 15 as the National Mourning Day. There is no need to mention why the day is significant in our life. However, this day is being observed differently by the political parties, which is indeed painful.//////This is a well-written piece and quite timely. But what is not stressed is the current half-heartedness of the traffic police. Even a year back they used to act against the traffic light violators. Now mostly they remain unconcerned. Another common practice is the deliberate deviation from the colour of traffic light sense. This develops a lack of alertness in the mind of drivers. If every time I find that I can go on when the light is red (under police prompting), I fail to react when there is no police. This is human nature. Another factor is the rampant practice of using the footpath for everything else but the pedestrians. Buildings are sloping away their fronts so that pedestrians cannot walk there and cars can be parked unhindered.//////Once we heard that Bangladesh is floating on gas. The policy makers were so confident about the storage of gas resources that they were considering exporting gas to neighbouring countries. But unfortunately in a few years we have started facing shortage of gas. Supply of gas has been prohibited to newly established industries. The government has informed us that before 2011 it's not possible to provide gas to the newly set up industries. Recently, we have been informed that the load shedding at Chittagong is the highest in the country. But in Sylhet we are not far behind. The main reason behind this is the shortage of gas supply to the electricity power plants.//////Top leaders of the ruling coalition in Pakistan yesterday again failed to arrive at a decision on the reinstatement of judges sacked by former President Pervez Musharraf and skipped the issue of future of the ex-military ruler.//////A suicide bomber blew himself up yesterday at a hospital in a northwestern Pakistani town that has been plagued by sectarian violence, killing at least 23 people, police said.//////Pervez Musharraf's departure from the presidency is unlikely to have a significant impact on how Pakistan's nuclear weapons are controlled. //////Georgia's Interior Ministry yesterday dismissed a pullback of Russian military vehicles from the city of Gori as a "show" and insisted no pullback was under way.//////The coalition government used Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's visit to Washington last month for convincing US President George W Bush to stop supporting his old ally, Pervez Musharraf.//////The dictator has gone.

The programme included roundtable discussion, festive procession, ////// (fair), art competition and recitation of prose and poems with the call of establishing social and economical rights of indigenous people. //////A total of 47 recent art works of leading artists of Bangladesh and India are on display at Galleri Kaya. The six eminent Bangladeshi artists include Aminul Islam, Murtaja Baseer, Qayyum Chowdhury, Rafiqun Nabi, Ranjit Das and Kazi Rakib. From India are five renowned artists: Bijan Chowdhury, Kashinath Salve, Prakash Bhise, Gautam Partho Roy and Sukhomoy Majumder. The exhibition is titled Rhapsody. //////Many underprivileged children have excelled in theatre, music, dance and recitation. Behind the scenes, several cultural organisations have targeted this section. In their ranks is the Feni-based Shukonya, which largely addresses itself to the girl child. //////The 59th birth anniversary of playwright Professor Selim Al Deen was celebrated at Jahangirnagar University (JU) on August 18, according to a press release. To mark the day, a procession was brought out that started from the Department of Drama and Dramatics premises at 10 am. Professor Mohammad Muniruzzaman, Vice-Chancellor of JU; acting Registrar Abu Bakar Siddique; theatre personalities Nasiruddin Yousuff, M. Hamid and Jhuna Chowdhury; Dr. Aminul Islam, Chairman, Department of Drama and Dramatics; Professor Afsar Ahmed of Drama and Dramatics and others took part in the procession.//////Guess who I bumped into today? None other than famous filmmaker, fashion designer, poet, artist, music lover and social worker, Muzaffar Ali himself. At a function organised by The Richmond Fellowship Society, India, Delhi branch, he talked about the challenges of dealing with mental health and the need for organisations such as the Society which is now setting up a new halfway home and day care centre, called Vishwas (trust) in Greater Noida (on the outskirts of Delhi).//////IT was very refreshing to read Fozia Akhtar's article on the captioned subject in this newspaper. The article discussed the negative consequences of privatisation, particularly for developing countries. While a debate on privatisation is nothing new, it is particularly relevant and timely for Bangladesh. //////THERE was no electricity at our place in Karachi this afternoon, but it was cool so we hadn't turned on our little generator. "Aren't you watching our president's speech on TV?" asked a friend on the phone. On came the generator. Live on Geo, the TV channel that spearheaded the media boom under Musharraf, was the president in a dark western suit and tie (rather than the high-collared sherwani that leaders tend to don when trying to appease nationalist or religious forces).//////PRACHANDA has become the first republican prime minister of Nepal, ending months of political deadlock that followed the sacking of the unpopular king Gynendra and the abolition of the 240-years old monarchy. Lawmakers in Nepal on August 15 voted in former rebel Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal who took the name "Prachanda," which means "the fierce one," when the extreme poverty of Nepal drove him to take to violent politics. //////THERE was a heated debate the other day on the Internet. "Asian comedians are retarded," complained Wah Jai on Asian-Central.com. "They give Asians a bad name. Anyone who finds them funny are only laughing because they make fun of the Asian stereotype with the retarded accents they have."//////From now on children living with their detained mothers in the Dhaka Central Jail will get a chance to visit parks and other recreational centres.//////The city has lost another children's playground as the authorities have planned to build residential quarters for Ansar members at the place.//////Despite its immense popularity, the cable television industry is still facing nagging complaints from consumers and scrutiny from the authorities.//////
