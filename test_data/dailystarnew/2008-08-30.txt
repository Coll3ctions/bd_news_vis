Kennedy, the late US president once said. Given the condition of our roads, it is not surprising that Bangladesh has been so slow to develop. With maintenance aspect totally ignored and drainage system abysmal, the roads in Dhaka city present a horrible look. Despite the fact that huge fund was allocated in the past years towards building new roads or improving the already poor condition of the roads, nothing tangible has come up.//////The grand edifice of Islam stands on five very strong pillars (Rokons) viz: (1) Kalima (faith), (2) Salat (daily 5-time prayer), (3) Siam (fasting), (4) Hajj (pilgrimage) and (5) Zakat (the poor's due). Fasting or Siam is, therefore, one of these strong pillars. Siam is an Arabic word which means fasting, abstinence from food and drink. But when considered from the point of view of Islamic terminology the connotation is something more, something broader.//////Plants, animals and microbes together constitute the essential natural biotic community of any sustainable ecosystem. Decomposer microbes are usually in plenty where the producer plants and consumer animals live together in harmony. But we the humans, known as the most destructive animal species, did not let most of the plants thrive well and thereby caused extinction of many animal species as well. //////When I was born, a nurse at the Holy Family Hospital laid me beside my mother and smilingly said, Your daughter is very fair. When she grows up, she'll be so pretty that nobody will be able to take their eyes off her. My mother was overwhelmed to hear it; that moment was one of the few happiest ones of her life. She used to tell this story at dinnertime on almost all my birthdays, her face lighting up with joy. However, as I grew up, my complexion started turning darker and darker. Then mother would tell the same story with a certain melancholic strain in her voice. //////(Lines from an old, old song)//////On a drizzly November afternoon we set out for Sweden. Stefan (the hubby) and I thought about driving to the airport and leaving the car at the airport parking. Driving is a darn easy job for me these days. Couple of years back when GPS was freshly seen on the shelves of handful of doohickey stores and a few gutsy gadget inquisitors was testing them out I joined them. Previously a timorous driver, I now cruise through the interstate routes, catching up with the occasional change of radio stations as the car radio goes out of range from town after town. I love it, and do not get lost any longer. But Stefan and I ditched the idea of driving to the airport and instead chose the yellow line, the Q train, since we were only two blocks from the station and had little luggage. Aboard the plane we survived the airline rations and the parody of pretend night, morning and then almost pretend breakfast as if we had a whole evening, night and morning all in seven hours. //////She wakes up screaming blue murder://////the monsters in her heart are//////as sad and solitary as water in a stagnant pond.//////The Daily Star invites submissions to its forthcoming Eid special issue of both fiction and nonfiction pieces.

No longer a toddler, he or she is less likely to throw a tantrum and should be more willing to cooperate - children of this age want to please their parents. Preschoolers also want to do things themselves, but they are willing to learn from mom and dad. This give-and-take creates opportunities for parents to teach kids about healthy food choices in new and exciting ways.//////Researchers have transformed ordinary cells into insulin-producing cells in a living mouse, improving symptoms of diabetes in a major step towards regenerative medicine.//////Major inequalities in health and life expectancy persist worldwide, according to an independent World Health Organisation commission which recently called for all countries to offer universal health care.//////Drinking water that contains disinfection by-products at regulatory cut-off levels does not appear to raise a pregnant woman's risk of delivering a small baby or delivering prematurely, new research shows.//////Earlier we have been talking about the good effects of fresh fruits and vegetables.

The inaugural programme was held on August 28 in a hotel in the capital.//////AFTER resignation of President Musharraf, it is disappointing to note that Pakistan's politicians are divided as ever. The PPP and PML (N), the two largest parties in Pakistan are deeply split on national issues. PPP is led by Bhutto's widower Asif Ali Zardari and PML (N) is led by former Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. //////INTERNATIONALLY the US presidential elections between the two candidates, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, reflect all spheres of the US administration. The current American president is a lame duck who cannot conduct any substantial domestic or international policy.//////SENATOR Obama has chosen Senator Biden as his running mate during the Democratic convention now underway in Denver. Many outside the USA and particularly in Bangladesh will be disappointed that it was not Senator Hillary Clinton on the ticket. Has Obama made the same mistake that Al Gore did in 2000 where the choice of the Vice-President was crucial in the ultimate result in a very closely fought election?//////INDIA and Israel exist in a hostile environment, encircled by inexorable adversaries and a militarised regional milieu. Both countries have fought wars and witnessed crises in every decade of their existence and both are nations confronting external and internal security threats due to terrorism. Israel pursues its uncongenial anti-Islamic stance, while India pursues the path of a secular state to reconcile its large minorities and each country has adopted significantly different strategic approaches to combat terrorism.//////The war for Bangladesh continues to be a major concern for people intrigued by the history of the Indian subcontinent. And then there are people, notably in Pakistan, who would rather look away from the 1971 story largely because of the deep embarrassment it still causes them. For one thing, the war signified a break-up of Pakistan through its eastern wing reasserting itself as the independent republic of Bangladesh. For another, it was a military defeat for an army that had always prided itself, however delusionally, on its bravery in the battlefield. In 1971, that bravery was sorely tested before the Mukti Bahini, the Bengali guerrilla army, and then the Indian army towards the end of the Bangladesh struggle for liberation.//////Milan Kundera's ////// is an exploration into the philosophical concept of lightness, used in ontology and associated with existentialism. Nietzsche's doctrine of eternal return is used to illustrate lightness. The idea, according to Kundera, is 'a mad myth.' Its reverse shows that 'a life which disappears once and for alldoes not return is like a shadow without weight.' Life's 'horror, sublimity and beauty mean nothing.' //////Shaheed is the nickname of Anwar-ul-Alam, who is one of the two great heroes of Tangail Mukti Bahini during the War of Liberation in 1971. Shaheed was the deputy commander and civilian administrator of Tangail during the war. History bestowed upon him the great task of leading the war in the area, a job he accomplished with great wisdom and selflessness. The military commander of Tangail Mukti Bahini, Kader Siddiqui, depended a lot on this intelligent man.//////There is a certain pleasure in reviewing works on Lalon and his songs. This work on the mystic by Haroonuzzaman is a rare publication. The book only reasserts our feelings of debt to Lalon. His songs have always enriched and nurtured our souls and minds. It is certainly true that Lalon's is one of the most talented and philosophically insightful minds as revealed in oral and textual traditions. He disseminated his ideas in mind-boggling songs, through a remarkable multitude of musical compositions. The main musical instruments ////// and ////// for Lalon music are easily found anywhere in Bangladesh, for the culture he upholds defines the quality of life here.
