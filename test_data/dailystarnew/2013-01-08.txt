During this normal cycle, a parcel of warm air will float upward in an ambient atmosphere of colder air. If temperature drops steeply, the atmosphere becomes unstable, causing air from near the surface to rise quickly and be replaced by cooler air sinking from above. In the process, the air will carry pollutants with it and disperse them at higher altitudes. The unstable condition is desirable because it leads to a relatively pollution-free lower atmosphere. Occasionally, air temperature will increase with altitude, resulting in colder air near the ground and warmer air above it. This is called temperature inversion - collusion between pollution and weather that creates warm-air lid over cooler air. It can occur anywhere from ground level up to few thousands of feet into the atmosphere//////The Higgs boson, dubbed the 'God Particle', has been much in the news during 2012.
