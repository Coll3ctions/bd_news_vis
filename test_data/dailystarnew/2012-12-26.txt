Is it the gifts for children under the tree, the lights on the tree or in the windows, the cards in the mail, grand dinners with family and friends, stockings hanging in the living room, and shouts of "Merry Christmas" to those who pass us on the streets? Is this really Christmas? For many people Christmas is a time of sorrow. They don't have the extra money to buy presents for their children, family, and friends. Many are saddened at Christmas time when they think of their loved ones who will not be able to come home for various reasons. //////A good job is rarer than a golden deer in our country. Many people of our country are unemployed. Nearly 1000 candidates apply against a single government post and bank job. So the probability of getting a good job is very little. A jobseeker has to drop a lot of applications for getting a job. Most of the jobseekers are from financially insolvent families, but they have to spend a big amount for each application (pay-order, etc.). It is a matter of great sorrow that many talented applicants can not apply for jobs due to poverty. On behalf of all jobseekers, I politely request the employers to reduce these fees.//////I fully agree with American citizens that there should be a gun control law, especially for psychologically challenged people. As much as I have seen, the psychologically challenged people usually do such things. James Holmes, the 'Batman Shooter' was mentally ill, but had easy access to firearms which allowed him to go on a crazy massacre. In the Connecticut incident, Adam Lanza was also mentally ill. These acts were strictly condemned by the US government and the whole world. The USA really needs to control the spread of firearms. Also, a child took a gun with him to school to protect himself. And anti-Islam extremists fired at a Sikh temple thinking that they were Muslims. The USA now needs to ponder these tragedies and take due action. Perhaps each person who owns firearms should go through a mental test. Or perhaps firearms should be banned for civilians. We can only hope that they take a decision which would prevent this kind of tragedy.//////Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra came to Bangladesh on a two-day official visit recently. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina received her and introduced her with the cabinet members. //////We are very much encouraged by the news published in The Daily Star of December 19, 2012 that a peace model placed by our prime minister Sheikh Hasina has been approved by the UN General Assembly. We hope that her government itself would care to follow these proposals. Her peace model underlines the removal of injustices including repression; absence of rule of law; inequality and economic disparity; deprivation and poverty; lack of transparency and accountability in governance; denial of secularism and multi-ethnicity; negligence in equal rights for women and the marginalised, etc. //////The gruesome murder of the poor tailor Bishwajit during BNP-led 18 party alliances-enforced blockade on 9 December, 2012 was heartbreaking. Everyone watched on TV and read in newspapers how he was mercilessly beaten up and hacked to death by Chhatra League cadres. Why had the hardworking youth Bishwajit Das (24) to die? It is said the murderers mistook him for a Shibir cadre. But even if he was Shibir cadre, would such killing in broad daylight by some political cadres be justified? Who gave the so-called political party cadres have the right to take law into their hands and kill people? Bishwajit died even after he was taken to government hospital. Reports say he did not get proper treatment at the hospital. The death of innocent Bishwajit shocked us all. Both Awami League and BNP have to bear the responsibility of Bishwajit killing. It is high time we created congenial democratic culture among all the political parties by uprooting the politics of criminalisation. //////As I face the prospect of Christmas in hospital with a knee in plaster, may I appeal to architects and builders - and to the managers of apartments and offices, clubs and schools - to pay attention to the hazard of unmarked steps? I have had sessions with the managers of hotels in various parts of Asia where I have gone on holiday and, like most people, they have all professed ignorance of this aspect of 'health and safety' which, in many such countries, is not much of a priority anyway...//////We have come to know that the information ministry issued an internal order and circulated it throughout the country, asking all ministries, departments, semi-government organizations, autonomous bodies and directorates to subscribe only five national dailies.

To mark the anniversary, the Boishakhi family along with invited guests cut an anniversary cake at midnight. Information Minister Hasanul Haque Inu appeared as a guest on a live talk show titled "Hot Seat". //////Behind art, music, prose, poetry, cinema and all other forms of entertainment lies the miracle of creative minds. These great minds have the powers to turn your thoughts into a whirlwind that takes your imagination beyond the limits you ever knew. They can land you in a pensive mood that keeps you preoccupied about thousand life-stirring thoughts that never crossed your mind. The musician can create a merry tune that has the grumpiest soul tapping and dancing on the streets. And the read of a great novel can even change the course of your life! Fairy tales like Snow White, Rapunzel, or fantasies like Superman or Spiderman stir up the first ever imagination of children. To keep our civilisation growing stronger we can pray to the Creator to send us more great minds like Rabindranath Tagore, William Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf or Vincent Van Gogh. If science and technology make life easier and safer, the creative minds feed our spiritual beings -- they keep us smiling and crying, keep our love and compassion alive. //////There are certain classes of people who think that military rule or martial law is imposed in a country when politicians make a mess of things.

Putin, publicly distanced the Kremlin from Syria's president, Bashar Assad, announcing, "We are not concerned about the fate of Assad's regime."

Successfully navigating this alphabet soup can be quite a challenge for both students and parents in the process of selecting the most appropriate courses and the route to place at a good university.//////Like most of us, Muzharul Islam had feet of clay, but unlike most of us, he lived a noble life straining to be the best he could be. He came into my life when I was most vulnerable to his unique brand of nobility and after decades of prolonged -- mostly furious -- debate about competing ideologies, he changed my life. Muz had that effect on others as well, but I felt it uniquely because he loved his countrymen more than any of the rest of us seemed to be capable of loving ours. He was a man of the people in every imaginable way, notably at times when such a posture didn't do him a lot of personal good.//////
