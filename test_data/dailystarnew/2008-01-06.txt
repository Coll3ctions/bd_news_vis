Nearly two weeks have elapsed since then. Their already long period of detention is that much more extended, for how long, nobody can say with any degree of certainty. //////A roundtable on our endangered power sector and what needs to be done about it in the national interest emphasises once again an issue of vital public concern. In the past many years, the inefficiency as well as corruption that has sapped the strength of the sector has left the country reeling from its effects, to a point where the nation is still paying a price. One cannot but agree with the participants, many of whom echoed the views of large sections of the public when they referred to improper utilisation of natural resources and unbridled corruption in the power sector as realities we must now contend with. With power shortage now well over 2000 megawatts, it is not unnatural that industrial production in the country will be directly affected.//////The assassination of Benazir Bhutto has dealt a serious blow to the re-emergence of democracy in Pakistan and the country's return to stability. Echoing global sentiment, Brussels based International Crisis Group in a statement said: "Pakistan's military backed interim government is not in a position to carry out a fair investigation into the assassination. The United Nations Security Council should meet urgently to establish an international commission of enquiry to determine who ordered and carried out the killings. Given the long standing connections between the Pakistan military and jihadi groups, this would be the only way to carry out an impartial and credible investigation." //////That soaring rice prices are hitting households below the belt is not a secret in a market economy and a society with media independence. Media independence has both a good and a bad side -- depending on how one looks at it. It is good because it keeps a government awake and updated so that riots and rumours do not cost popularity of the government. That is why it is said that democratic societies with press freedom rarely face famines. //////Events in two countries in South Asia, in contrasting fashions, hogged headlines not only in the region but also in the international scene in 2007. Interestingly, one event took place early in the year, which was talked about as a positive issue, while the other at the fag end of the year caused severe adverse repurcussions. //////After a fascinating day's cricket Bangladesh finally imposed themselves on New Zealand and showed some much needed fight that could yet revive a tour that had been largely disappointing until Saturday. The Tigers bowled New Zealand out for 357 and then in their second innings trailed by just 72 runs with all wickets intact thanks to a record 148-run opening stand in 39 overs from Tamim Iqbal and Zunaed Siddiqui. With three full days to go the first Test could be thrown wide open if the tourists can bat throughout day three, a prospect that is no longer an improbability.//////Nayeem Islam and Mohammad Shahjada converted their over-night half-centuries into hundreds as Rajshahi tightened their grip on Dhaka at the end of the second day of the tenth and final round National Cricket League match at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday.//////South Africa successfully chased down 185 runs on the fourth day of the second Test to win by seven wickets, levelling the three-match series with West Indies 1-1 at Newlands on Saturday.//////Matthew Hayden batted in pain to give Australia an outside chance of a record-equalling 16th Test victory over India in the second cricket Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.//////FIDE Master Abu Sufian Shakil is in third place of the Masters Chess Tournament 83rd Hastings Chess Congress along with 11 other players at Hastings in England on Friday.//////Wari's Anwar scored the solitary goal in his team's 1-0 victory over Dipali Jubo Sangha in the Metropolis Senior Division Football League at the Bir Shreshtha Shaheed Sepoy Mostafa Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////BKSP earned a convincing 3-1 victory over Bangladesh Navy in the day's lone match of the Dhaka Bank Victory Day Hockey Competition at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////Harbhajan Singh spiced up his feisty rivalry with Ricky Ponting, revelling in a first-ball dismissal of the Australian captain on the fourth day of the second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.//////AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini admitted on Saturday that he is worried about the European champions' dismal home league form. //////American superstar Venus Williams fired a warning shot ahead of the Australian Open Saturday, crushing one of her main rivals Maria Sharapova in Hong Kong with a ruthless display of power tennis. //////David Beckham trained with Arsenal for the first time on Friday as the England midfielder tries to maintain his fitness for international duty.//////Arsene Wenger admits the FA Cup could jeopardise his hopes of winning the Champions League but the Arsenal manager is determined not to disrespect the competition's heritage.//////Sir Alex Ferguson has rubbished speculation linking Cristiano Ronaldo with a shock move to Spanish champions Real Madrid.//////The national team may be an embarrassment, but England's Premier League has been voted the best in the world in a survey.//////Avram Grant insists Chelsea are not considering a bid for Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov.//////Barcelona wants to win matches by playing an attractive game, the club's coach Frank Rijkaard said Friday, one day after his Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o argued winning matters more than style.//////Hamburg's Dutch international Raphael van der Vaart revealed Saturday that he will not be renewing his contract with the German side and sees his future more at Italian club Juventus.//////Match umpires did not hear any alleged racial abuse of Australia's Andrew Symonds during the second cricket Test against India, match referee Mike Procter said Saturday.//////The script was almost written the moment he played on after making 62 in Melbourne when he appeared set for a big hundred.//////Ricky Ponting will need to take a big risk if Australia are to equal the world record of 16 consecutive wins.

In Bangladesh, nothing of that sort seems to have a place, especially with the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD)the lone government agency that has lately earned so much of ill-repute due to unbridled corruption amongst its rank and file. //////Mr. A.N.M. Nurul Haque, a columnist of The Daily Star in his article published on December 4, 2007 has very rightly advised the government to be serious about austerity to overcome the fallout of cyclones, floods and rising oil prices. It is not difficult to understand the gravity of the situation if we just have a close look at the devastation of the cyclone Sidr that has affected 69 lakh people of 16 lakh families, damaged crops of 4.62 lakh acres of farmland, killed 4.68 lakh cattle-heads, ravaged 12.08 lakh homesteads, razed 1355 educational institutions to the ground, destroyed 1654 bridges & culverts and 848 kilometers of road and ruined 800 dairy & 2000 poultry farms.

Memorable are the laudable sacrifices of life of Bangladesh police in the theatre of the liberation war, and the contribution of the devastated force to the restorative efforts of the new Bangladesh government. It is certainly a calumny that the police occupied first place in corruption for consecutive five years in the Transparency international report. We cannot deny the state of acute corruption in Bangladesh. People want criminals and corrupt persons in chains, and the police to perform their duty honestly. //////Justice K.M. Sobhan belonged to the class of the courageous and the principled. It is a matter of record that when the Awami League returned to power in the general elections of 1996, many expected him to seek reinstatement as a judge in the Supreme Court. It was an expectation that did not reach fruition, for Sobhan was averse to the idea that the new government place him back in a position that had earlier been seized from him by a military government.
