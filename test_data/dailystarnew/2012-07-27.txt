The first round of assault was unleashed by interns against members of the press on July 22 when they had gone to report on an alleged case of maltreatment of a patient. What is disturbing is the fact that medical college interns had ganged up to assault pressmen who were merely doing their job. The second round of attack that came on July 25 was a much more organised one. It is interesting to note that this time round, interns and doctors were allegedly aided by ruling party student activists and the unruly mob broke into the makeshift reporters' office set up in DMCH with the intention to do bodily harm and damage property. It is disturbing that the incident occurred in the presence of law enforcement officials who were silent spectators to this orgy of violence. //////Our heartiest congratulations to Syeda Rizwana Hasan for winning the Ramon Magsaysay Award known also as the Asia's Nobel Prize In fact she is the 11th Bangladeshi to be awarded the prestigious award, highest of its kind in Asia, for her role in protecting the environment.
