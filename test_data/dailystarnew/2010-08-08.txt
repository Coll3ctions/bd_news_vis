The step that the government have taken in the meanwhile relates to fixing prices of edible oil at the factory gate and those of sugar and meats like beef and mutton. The price of bottled soyabean oil has been left unfixed. And, sellers have reportedly made it known that bottled edible oil will be pricey, because its supply to the market has been reduced, presumably by the dealers.//////The suicide attempt by a mother in Kamalapur area in the city and subsequent deaths of her son and daughter leave us marooned with the question: what psycho-social factors had worked in collusion to push a mother to the path of self-destruction in a manner that was most horrific? We know there is no straight answer to explain the complexity of the situation but social thinkers and researchers ought to find out why there is a sudden increase in the tendency to take one's own life, particularly by married women, that again after killing their own children. By no means it is a healthy sign for a nation that aspires to build a just and peaceful society for every citizen.//////Venkatsai Laxman overcame back spasms to hit an unbeaten 103 as India defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets in the final Test on Saturday to draw the three-match series 1-1.//////The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is likely to appoint former South African all-rounder Lance Klusener as the new bowling coach for the national team while Julien Fountain, a professional English cricket coach, as the fielding coach.//////World record holder and Olympic champion Usain Bolt crashed to his first defeat in two years on Friday when America's Tyson Gay won their eagerly awaited 100m clash at the Diamond League meeting.//////Kevin Pietersen rode his luck as he closed in on his first Test century since March last year here on Saturday.//////Saiful Bari Tito has been named coach of the Bangladesh team for the upcoming 16th Asian Games by the national team management committee of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) yesterday.//////Sri Lanka have left out left-arm seamer Chanaka Welegedara and batsman Thilina Kandamby for the tri-series, which begins on August 10 in Dambulla.

From the very beginning the tuition fees of the private universities were high, but it has become a routine to increase the tuition fees every year. Most of the private universities don't even have their own campuses. But the tuition fees are raised regularly. //////Recently, the government fixed the minimum wage of a garment worker at BDT 3,000 per month. It is an increase of BDT 1500 per month. It looks like very high increment on paper. But would any economic expert give a breakdown of BDT 3000 to prepare a monthly household expenditure for a worker within this fixed amount? I am interested to know how much would be spent on housing, on food, on clothes and other incidental expenses including medical expenses for a single person. I have not included any recreation expenses because those are not for the workers, as they are not considered humans by the owners but parts of machine. //////Some people come to Dhaka only to get treatment in Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The number of doctors and nurses is very few compared to the number of patients. Hence, the patients are deprived of proper treatment. The beds are always booked and the new patients have to lie on the floor. According to a news channel, the cleaners and other staff replace the doctors at night and carry out operations even. The condition is same in every government hospital. This is the reason why rich people don't go to government hospitals for treatment. Many TV channels and many newspapers have tried to show the problems of these hospitals, but still no change has occurred. Thus, the poor patients suffer a lot and often die due to lack of care.//////It is not the right way in which the garment workers are protesting against the declared minimum wages. It is extremely shocking for the whole nation that they vandalised a number of shops and lots of vehicles as part of their protest. Protest should never be violent and destructive causing a huge damage to public property. All demonstrators could have gathered in front of the relevant ministry to express their demands. //////In Muslim countries like Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, Malaysia, the first name of a citizen is Arabic and the last name is based on their own cultural background. For example, the Iranian govt took an initiative in 1960s and successfully re-established Persian culture in naming. Only in Bangladesh our names, both first and last, are Arabic.//////A staff reporter's front page comments on the subject was published in a local English daily on July 25th, quoting the views of Mr. Moudud Ahmed, which was apparently sensible, logical and fair. However, his proposal about 'equal representation' from the opposition was in that context illogical!//////The letter from one of your readers on July 31 is spot on and quite relevant in our global village. In Bangladesh nicknames are fashionably added at the end of a person's name quite regularly. This would not matter if such persons were confined to their native places, as local customs would clarify what is the real name and what is the nickname. But with prosperity most people travel abroad nowadays for business, for jobs, for education, etc and there the problem of family name or last name arises. In all European countries and other places where European civilisation prevails by descent, last name of a person is his/her family name, for example- Smith, Blair, Brown, Sarkozy, Merkel, Putin, etc., showing a family connection by which name his/ her ancestry and their movements can be traced over hundreds of years.//////Dhaka has a population of 13 million. Not only that, it is one of the densely populated cities in the world. The traffic congestion of the city is increasing day by day as millions of people are living here, without any proper plan made by the DCC authorities. Already the city authorities have taken many initiatives to solve the problem but all the measures have failed. The govt is thinking about introducing elevated expressway, metro rail and many modern facilities. Statistics show that the most populated cities in the world have such kinds of advanced modes of communication. But Dhaka has no such modern communication system. //////All the recent hue and cry from various people about our constitution, following a landmark verdict from the country's highest court, apparently indicates that they are ignoring a major factor concerning the issue while trying to guess the future outcome, and it is the NAME of our country. The name of our country itself clearly bears the suggestion on how to solve an issue pertaining to the Constitution which is the basis of governance. It is good news that a parliamentary committee of experts has been formed after the court verdict to sort out ways on how to proceed with its suggestion, and at the same time it is unfortunate as the opposition has refused to co-operate with it thinking that the committee itself is going to finalise the changes. It is bemusing why and what makes the opposition think like that. As far as my knowledge is concerned, the constitution of a state dictates the basic fundamental principles by which it is to be governed; and therefore, it is understood that no government can direct its 'Director' on how to direct (changes /amendments) simply because it is having a majority in parliament. People of the republic have selected and elected their representatives to form a parliament for planning, organising and running the day to day business affairs of the state, but not to manipulate or reshape the State's basic pillars. //////In the last three decades, we have observed the two major political parties making below-the-belt remarks about each other's leader. A political party is defined by others, and defines itself, as much by its ideology as by the leadership it decides to have. It is rather self-serving for any party to insist that its rivals and detractors should not discuss about its leader. A debate about leaders, their flaws and their merits is at the heart of democratic give and take. Leaders do bring value addition to their parties. In fact, most of our political parties are increasingly becoming leader-centric. //////The seventh amendment to the constitution, which legitimises HM Ershad's takeover of power and the acts under his military rule, could have the same fate as the fifth amendment, said Law Minister Shafique Ahmed. The seventh amendment ratified the proclamation of martial law and other regulations, orders and instructions by Ershad between March 24, 1982, and November 10, 1986. A writ petition, filed on January 24 this year, challenging the legality of the amendment is pending with the High Court. We are yet to know the fate of this writ petition.//////Palli bikes have eased communication. //////The sewerage line of Wari residential area is more than half a century old. It has damaged, collapsed, blocked and become inoperative in many places. Dirty and stinking water and human excreta overflow the manholes and float on roads, streets, lanes and by-lanes and nearby municipal drains polluting the different localities.//////It appears from the media reports that some people have sought the help of higher courts relating to tenants' grievances against landlords. As a small flat owner, I was earning Tk. 5,000/- per month in July 1989 when the highest pay was Tk. 6,000/- per month as per the Pay Commission. Today I am getting Tk. 18,000/- per month while the highest pay as per govt. scale is around Tk. 60,000/- per month. In the above context, what should have been the rent of my flat? On the other hand, the flat can be sold at Tk. 50,00,000/- (fifty lakh) and thus I can earn Tk. 5,00,000/- (five lakh) comfortably as interest by keeping the money in banks. What should be my choice when I come to look for a good tenant, pay bribe to officials of income tax, Wasa, land revenue, DCC etc. etc. //////Reformulating the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) is a need of the hour. It is indeed one of the pledges of the government made before the last elections. It is really good thinking by the govt that it must protect its civil servants before they are put into trouble. So, before filing any case against the govt servants, the ACC should obtain permission from the govt. Otherwise, the ACC could file cases against innocent officials resulting in their harassment both socially and financially. //////At a time the rate of interest on Sanchay Patra was 16-22%, the monthly expenditure of a moderate family was Tk.15,000/-. Now the rate is 10.35-11.25%, when the monthly expenditures of an old individual is over Tk.20,000/-. If the sale of Sanchay Patra is limited only to old ones ( 58 years and above), females, disabled, orphans, the rush of purchase will come down. Then the idle and the ill earned money shall go to share market and private enterprises.//////The Honourable Prime Minister declared that she would cut off all relations with this student organisation.

With the 150th birth anniversary of the Poet coming up in 2011, world-over Tagoreans are preparing to pay a befitting tribute to the far-sighted poet who, amongst other things, was the first to promote the practice of dance within the educated gentry of Bengal. The staging of 'Tasher Desh' with the support of Shadhona--A Center for Advancement of Southasian Dance and Music, is part of these preparations. //////Kumar Bishwajit was the celebrity guest at last week's DS Caf.

Having been, for many years, at the forefront of Bangladesh's efforts at the international level to protect our interests on intellectual property matters, I find it important that the facts be placed before the public.//////Reform, especially political party reform, was a buzzword that baffled our country's people during the previous caretaker regime. Some of that government's advisers, along with some members of different political parties and civil society, emphasised the urgency of political party reform. Ironically, that advocacy distorted the very connotation of the term "reform." //////Women have been doing noteworthy work as journalists in our country as well as elsewhere during the last decade. But their number in both print and electronic media in our country is less than expected. We need to recognise the challenges and explore the opportunities for women to encourage them. //////
