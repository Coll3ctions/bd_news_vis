No one can deny that of late threats, intimidation and extortion through use of mobile phones have risen to quite an alarming degree. These crimes vary in nature but in the end leave those affected in various degrees of distress. In the first place, it is generally young women who are the targets of unsolicited calls, to a point where these calls turn into harassment. In the second, sometimes families are the recipients of calls that leave them in a state of agitation. In the third place (and this is the worst), individuals are often threatened over mobile phones and generally asked to pay the caller and his associates a toll, failing which those at the receiving end might be in trouble. In such instances, the callers take care to hide the numbers of the phones they are calling from.//////THE task of Monthly Pay Order (MPO)-listing, that is, putting schools on the government's payroll under the present education minister Nurul Islam Nahid has proved to be a roller-coaster ride this year. And the delay caused has been due mainly to the complaints made by the MPs to the prime minister, under whose instruction her political and education adviser prepared another list incorporating the demands of the MPs. But that list, too, was found to be controversial for what they said it accommodated instances of alleged fraudulence, inclusion of institutions chosen by opposition BNP, and, even Jamaat MPs. The education minister was again asked by the prime minister to prepare another MPO list, which was submitted on June 16 last.//////England were in firm control of the first one-day international against visitors Bangladesh at Trent Bridge here on Thursday.//////Germany coach Joachim Loew hailed Spain as masters of the football universe and expressed confidence that they would beat the Netherlands in Sunday's World Cup final.//////German newspapers have lamented the country's 1-0 World Cup semifinal defeat by Spain and wondered what happened to the scintillating performances that had dispatched England and Argentina with such counterattacking flourish.//////Spain have confirmed they are no longer underachievers at world stage when they reached the final of the World cup for the first time by masterfully orchestrating the fall of the Mannschaft at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Wednesday night.//////Holland captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst has said that his last competitive match, at the World Cup final, will be the most "beautiful game" of his life.//////BOOK EARLY//////Booking early has its advantages, but booking too early can backfire.

Unfortunately, there was no indication, that at what level of intensity (in the Richter Scale of 1 to10)), this devastation is most likely to occur.

Then they boldly add that the kind of clothes women wear these days in public places invite harassment. The question generally arises what do women wear in public places? Other than few exceptions in the posh zones, what do women wear in public places? Fourteen female students committed suicides in Bangladesh in the last few months. They were teased, harassed verbally and physically while they were going to their educational institutions. If indecent clothing is the reason, then can someone answer how these unfortunate girls wearing school uniform provoke men ?//////There are many women scientists in the world who are credited with discoveries and advances in a wide variety of areas of science. Women scientists have made a difference in fields of biology, medicine, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, and research. //////Two letters appeared on 30 June on this very important and sensitive subject. Not for any religious edict or guidance, but just as a survival technique it is true that simple modesty like covering the hair while going out on daily work or attending an educational establishment will identify a young woman as modest and she is very unlikely to be a victim of eve teasing. //////I am very keen to know whether the government is seeking loopholes of law for using them against those who differ with its opinion, because //////The government is always defending this war crimes trial issue to condemn any act of the opposition. If that is so, why not make it more transparent and visible to justify the defence? The news reports coming from various quarters are very uncoordinated and disconnected to find out exactly what is the status of the trial process.////// Expedients, are for the hour, but principles are for the ages. //////My workplace is very close to the airport from where I hear the roaring of both civil and military aircrafts all day long. Along with that, we the North and South sides are chosen for take off and landing respectively. May be the growing skyscrapers on the south side of the airport, i.e. Banani, Gulshan and Motijheel C/A, are the reason that made the former ZIA such a handicapped airport. Such a functional diminution of an international airport in no way adds to the safe movement of aero-vehicles in and out of it. In addition to that, a new trouble has been added to the system --the ear blasting noise of the jet fighters. //////I was wondering why the government had been so lenient to the Jamaat till its top leaders were arrested that too on the flimsy ground of hurting the religious sentiment of the public. The Jamaat justifies their Islamic authenticity by the amount of suffering they undergo at the hands of the incumbent. But they should keep in mind that people all over the world were and are being persecuted not necessarily for their belief. As far as I have studied Islam, the Jamaat-e-Islami is not on the right track because they deliberately hide some key facts of Islam. One of them is the special significance of the Ahle Bayet we Sufi Muslims so strongly believe in. Besides, in violation of the Islamic tenets, the Jamaat believes in their dubious version of democracy. As they vacillate in theology, they are seen veering to this party or that party for their support. So people cannot have confidence on them. This is the very submissive nature of Jamaat that prevented them from supporting Bangladesh's freedom movement. I think it is the Jamaat's cardinal crime. //////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////Maoist rebels have carried out a wave of attacks in India, killing seven people including five policemen.//////Corruption in Afghanistan has doubled in three years since 2006, despite pledges by the government to clean up graft in one of the world's poorest countries, according to a survey released yesterday.//////The United States is set to deliver three billion dollars worth of equipment aimed at countering Taliban-made crude bombs used in the Afghan war, a US official said yesterday. //////A Sri Lankan cabinet minister yesterday said he was on a hunger strike outside the UN office in Colombo to protest against a panel set up to probe alleged rights abuses during the island's civil war.//////The Indian government yesterday appealed for parents in Kashmir to keep their teenage sons indoors after the deaths of several young men in violent protests over the last month.//////A string of attacks against Shia pilgrims in the past three days killed 68 people in Baghdad, security officials said yesterday, exposing the continued ability of insurgents to inflict bloodshed.//////Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday called the United States a global dictator and lashed out at Israel after arriving in Nigeria to meet fellow Muslim leaders at a summit.//////Europe agreed yesterday to allow the United States to tap into banking data for terrorism investigations after securing safeguards to protect the privacy of European citizens.//////Police will again question an ex-accountant of France's richest woman to verify her allegations of secret donations to Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential campaign in 2007, judicial sources said yesterday.//////French doctors have carried out a successful full-face transplant -- eyelids, tear ducts and all -- on a 35-year-old man, the hospital where the operation took place confirmed yesterday.//////A weeklong group art exhibition, titled 'Tone-One One Six' opened yesterday at Zainul Gallery-1, Faculty of Fine Arts (FFA), Dhaka University.//////Rural bard Duddu Shah was one of the disciples closest to Lalon.
