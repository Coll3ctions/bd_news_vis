We have advanced to 83rd position from our earlier placing at 91st (which was back in 2008). We certainly feel encouraged but at the same time we might as well remind ourselves that this new report comes against a background of elected, democratic government in Bangladesh at this point of time. The 2008 report was prepared in light of the country being under emergency caretaker rule. Naturally, therefore, the general feeling is that in the current democratic dispensation we should be finding and indeed do find our state of politics at an elevated level.

The pictures of disfigured dead bodies and the mass killing sites are stark reminders of the heinous crimes the collaborators committed just two days before our victory, obviously with a motive to make the new nation crippled. They had also involved themselves in the genocide the Pakistani occupation forces carried out during the whole period of our Liberation War when three million people were killed. They were the members of Rajakar, Al-Badr, and Al-Shams and belonged to Jamaat-e-Islami, Nizam-e-Islam and Muslim League. //////Chinese is the most dominant amongst the ethnic Mongolian languages in Asia. It is also a language spoken by the highest number of people in the world. There are about 30 different Mongolian Sino-Burman languages spoken by the Adivasi or indigenous people of this country, but their condition is pitiable. //////The news published in The Daily Star on 12th December stated that our capacity of power generation is 6000 MW but only 4300 MW is being produced.

Investigation is now going on. Haiti is in a big crisis. The international community must come forward to save Haiti from this disaster.//////Undoubtedly, Shahrukh Khan is one of the most famous heroes in India. Recently, he along with his troupe performed gorgeously in Dhaka. The event was organised by some private organisation. Definitely, the cultural heritage and costumes of our country are pretty different than that of Mumbai. We must keep in mind that foreign cultural elements are gradually infesting our showbiz. People are more willing to accept foreign films, songs, etc., being exposed to them. Thus, our native cultural products are being neglected. //////I am just ending my university life. The most painful experience of my university life was living in the dormitory. //////There has been no follow-up news on the interesting and important news report by Shamim Jahangir on the matter since last reported in your daily on 4th November. In our national interest, I feel as far as the report goes, we should take up this offer to set up an experimental 10MW power plant, based on coal gasification of the rather deep Jamalpur coal seam; which lies 500 to 1000 metres below the surface! Given the depth of the coal seam, possibly power generation by gasification should be a cost effective option for power generation, rather than mining it, in my opinion.//////On December 18, 2010 I attended the 60th Anniversary programmes of Holy Cross College as a former student.

The great occasion ended with the hearty meal and unforgettable photo sessions.//////The PCP article (19 Dec) on China's economic development and taking out 500 million people out of poverty is indeed very interesting.

This is the main reason for China's prosperity and this is why it is bound to lead mankind in near future in the global village.//////There are many educational institutions in urban areas. Most of the institutions are situated in the buildings used for commercial purposes, with markets, shopping centres, etc., adjacent to them. And there is no playground in these institutions. //////China's ambassador Zhang Yan has said the relations between China and India is fragile. I appreciate him for his aptness in choosing correct diplomatic adjective and obviously for his outspoken remark. India should take it positively bearing in mind that an outspoken enemy is better than a reserve friend.

Moktadir Dewan Shanto coordinated the album.//////Art should not be fettered by geographical boundaries, said renowned Bangladeshi painter Abdus Shakur Shah.

An ardent feminist and social activist, she is deeply involved with Biplabi Nari Shanghati, a socio-political organisation working -- among other pressing issues -- for women's rights.//////Wikileaks rendering of commandeered official communications between the US State Department and its embassies world-over in their website will be viewed in different ways depending on which side of the fence one is on. Although most of the cables deal with analyses, some based on assumptions, some on local assessments, and yet many on shared information of diplomats of other countries on similar errands, some indeed have helped to reconfirm the geo-strategic aspirations of the only superpower on earth. No wonder the US government has given Mr. Assange the new appellation "high-tech terrorist." //////The recent exchange of invectives between two major political camps targeting each other's patriarchs is an ominous sign of acerbic politics corroding into its foundations. If Awami League is trying to vilify Ziaur Rahman and BNP is trying to undermine Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, it only shows that our bankrupt politics has nothing left to do but abuse its own stalwarts. Even a better analogy: a prodigal son having spent all his money is going after family treasure.//////If any reminding was necessary, torture in custody on political grounds and directions was a reprehensible feature of the BNP Jamaat Alliance Government. I know this for a fact and can vouch for it first-hand based on my own personal experience as can I am certain, individuals such as Muntasir Mamun, Shahriar Kabir, Mohiudding Khan Alamgir, Bahauddin Nasim, BSS and Reuters Correspondent of that time, Enam and a vast number of others.//////In the aftermath of the WikiLeaks disclosure of US diplomatic documents, we are all nervous and wondering when the other shoe will drop. The reason for us being concerned about leaks is very simple. We have all in our lifetime written many emails, letters, memos, and what have you to the White House in support of various causes, some popular and some unpopular. //////A Microsoft top official has linked the overall growth of a country with its IT infrastructure related to broadband penetration, and how new devices are used there.//////Anis went to attend a Christmas party in Gulshan. But unlike others, he felt he wasn't enjoying the occasion. Rather than becoming a party pooper, he left the place and before returning home in Dhanmondi, he decided to spend some quality time with his friends. But for that, he had to call a number of people to know their whereabouts at that moment.//////Apple Inc has joined a growing number of U.S. companies that have severed ties with WikiLeaks, removing an application from its online store that gave users access to the controversial website's content.//////Asus, a leading computer manufacturer, has introduced its latest notebook and motherboard in the local market, said a press release.//////Microsoft Corp is working on a version of its core Windows operating system for devices such as tablets, according to media reports on Tuesday, and the company said its Windows Phone 7 software is making headway in the booming smartphone market.//////
