I remember in the 1996 edition, the entire Indian team was dependent on him. In 1999, came Ganguly and Dravid to ease some burden but yet expectation from Sachin was sky high. In 2003, India started gaining some balance and in 2007 despite their poor campaign, they were pre-tournament favourites. And in 2011, they had players like Gambhir, Kohli, Raina who could carry the weight. It takes time for a cricketing nation to reach the top spot. Arjuna Ranatunga said in an interview that he and Arvinda struggled for 16 years to finally become champions in 1996. Our media should not put undue pressure on our national cricketers. The hype they create raises too many expectations. Patience will pay for sure.//////The livelihoods of millions of people in coastal areas are getting from bad to worse day by day. They are living below the poverty line. There are three reasons behind their untold sufferings i.e. i) Natural calamities like cyclones, tidal bores; ii) Poverty, unemployment, lack of medical care and treatment; and iii) No easy or suitable means of communication from coastal area to upazila/district headquarters.//////BD govt. has taken a bad decision; the CNG price is now Taka 25 per cubic meter. Govt. officials said that they would not consider lowering the price for the rich people. Last caretaker govt. increased the CNG price from Tk. 8.50 to Tk. 16.75. My question to the present AL govt. officials-- what will you do for the poor people of Bangladesh with this extra revenue income? Govt. will earn 5 thousand crore taka by increasing this CNG price. It said that the CNG price is still lower than that of India and Pakistan. It is absolutely wrong information. I think by utilizing this opportunity, some people will make extra profits by increasing the transportation cost and food price. The govt. is taking big projects such as Elevated expressway, Padma Bridge etc. They are not interested in implementing small projects for the benefit of poor people. I request the rich people; please try to avoid using CNG. Please use other fuels at least 4 days a week for your cars to stop the corruption. //////Mamata Banerjee storms Bengal and makes Buddhadev say goodbye to his long 34 years of ruling in West Bengal. Mamata express railed the Leftists off the track on Friday, the 13th of May 2011. Thus, the glossy red color of the Leftists will no longer shine in the corridors of West Bengal as it will be taken over by the green of Trinamool. It seems that the screaming of Ma, Mati and Manush by Mamata has really helped trinamool in getting a landslide victory for her party. But it will be interesting to see how they counter hungry millions of West Bengal at present and also in the future. Although Leftists consider politics as their religion, their prayers were unheard by their voters. Democracy, which has got many wings, will have to be catered well by Mamata in order to make her party do well. Let us all keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best. //////I am a resident of Dhanmondi, I have a small business in Shahbag. Like other days, this morning I got up early and went to the local bus counter. When I reached the counter, I found a small crowd there. Some people were quarreling with the ticket seller. After a while I understood that it was because of the hike of the ticket prices. The ticket seller said that the price of CNG has almost doubled and they had no other option but to raise the ticket price. The people were flabbergasted by this sudden notice. However, the question is why and how did the country suddenly fall into such a gas crisis that it led the authorities to hike the price? The bus owners, CNG/taxi drivers, and even rickshawallas (though they have no business with CNG) took this opportunity and charged high fares. I think it is just the beginning. The food prices will rise soon because of CNG price hike, which was seen in the past.//////Bangladesh Bank implements fiscal policies and is the watch-dog over institutions dealing in money. To date they have performed admirably.//////We have learnt from various media outlets that WikiLeaks founder 39-year-old world-famous Australian hacker, Julian Assange has been awarded with the Sydney Peace Foundation's gold medal. The organization, affiliated with the University of Sydney, said the prize was awarded for his 'exceptional courage in pursuit of human rights.' It is a prestigious honor which has previously been won by Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama. //////We have seen two significant as well as shocking resignation events published in The Daily Star on 13th may. One is about Nobel laureate Prof. Dr. Muhammad Yunus who brought Bangladesh back to the seat of glory again in 40 years after Independence. Perhaps this unlucky man has forgotten that we already have lost all sense of shame as a nation. In fact, this is an example of personal envy and a conflict between power and fame. And, we all know that power has won the race ultimately. Dr. Yunus is now a global personality. So our expatriate citizens will fall in an embarrassing situation in the days to come. Another resignation event is about Honorable Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman who has been ignored for the two consecutive times in appointment of Chief Justice. Everybody knows the reason behind this. But this is not a good practice at all and an impediment to establish an independent judiciary in its true sense.//////It is alleged that Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, out of frustration and deep anguish, once said, "Everyone gets gold mines, I have got thieves mines." But I wonder what he would have said about the present condition of the country if he was alive. The thieves' mines are also producing robbers, murderers, rapists, hijackers, swindlers and criminals of all sorts.//////It is a well known fact that Dhaka city boasts the fewest number of playgrounds; five or six in Dhanmondi, three in Gulshan and Banani, and six more in the rest of the city. I happen to play football in one of those fields. Lately, playing football has become a hazard. Why? It's really hard to play football if cars are constantly coming inside the field to park. Why are cars parked in a playground? Because the local goons have a lot of power, and none of them really plays football, so the best thing to do is to earn some money by securing the field as a parking area. What should we do? Play while the field can still support sports?//////It is speculated that to avenge the death of Bin Laden, two suicide bombers have carried out a deadliest bomb attack on the paramilitary force academy at Shabqadar, that lies on the boarder with Afghanistan, about 35 km. northwest of Peshawar. The attack killed almost 69 cadets and many civilians and destroyed many vehicles. It is seen that Pakistan military has recently become the target of Taliban, as Pakistan army had lodged a long war to wipe out Taliban extremists from Pakistan. We strongly condemn this heinous act of killing unarmed people in the name of religion.//////I am of the view that the Bangladeshis need, among other things, increased exposure to written and spoken English. The Daily Star and other English-language dailies are dependable and cost-effective forums for facilitating, in part, such an exposure. To this end, The Daily Star, for instance, could allocate more space to editorial page columns and articles written by Bangladeshi writers. The increased spending could be sustained by known as well as novel revenue generators. As and when more write-ups get published in The Daily Star more frequently, this is likely to encourage people to keep writing in English. In today's world, we need ease, comfort, confidence and poise in English like we need oxygen in our body.//////Ahmed's analytical and incisive, though rather emotional article on the matter, published in your pages on May 11th; is a 'must read' material for the decision makers in our government. The writer rationally states that punitive action against Dr. Yunus can in the long run be harmful for Bangladesh as he is the blue-eyed boy for those in the world who matter; naturally led by the USA; with the EU nor far behind! Ominous days lie ahead for us!//////Killing of innocent people particularly children by any quarter is equal to an act of terrorism and barbarism. The way the NATO warplanes recently killed the Libyan dictator Gaddafi's innocent son and pre-teens grandchildren is barbaric and deserves condemnation in any score of human values. I would sincerely request the United Nations to apply any other simple way to compel Muammar Gaddafi to step down accepting the reality and rescue his own countrymen from being perished.//////Tony Greig, the famous cricket commentor has rightly said that BCCI has been influencing the International Cricket Council (ICC). I would like to draw attention of all readers that there might have been some arrangement between BCCI & ICC to make India the ICC world cup champions of 2011.

The police pulled him out of the plane moments before take-off and sent him to jail. //////It is only natural to pore over the results of Bidhan Sabha elections in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal to try and assess its likely bearing on West Bengal-Bangladesh ties, and more important, on Indo-Bangla relations. //////Of the 98 Nobel Peace Prize winners from 1901 to 2010, which Nobel Peace Laureate ordered and watched with relish the killing of an unarmed person before his family members and disposal of his body into the sea?

Obama, the Nobel Peace Prize winner of 2009.//////Professor Muhammad Yunus is an economist and the only Nobel Laureate from Bangladesh. He started his academic career as a lecturer in economics at the University of Chittagong in early '70s. His research activities started from the grassroot level. At that stage he realised the importance of creation of the Grameen Bank with the unique idea of a mobile bank that moved from door to door to lend money to women.
