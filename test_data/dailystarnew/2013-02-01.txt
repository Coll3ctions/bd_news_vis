More than 1000 innocent people have already been killed by BSF in the last ten years. So, to stop killing along the border, both the governments should take proper measures.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star online reports.

He is being dragged back and forth between court and prison, his fate resembling that of Tantalus.
