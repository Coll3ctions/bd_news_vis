Akbar Ali Khan, alternative executive director of the World Bank for some years and an adviser of the caretaker government of Bangladesh in 2006, has written this book in quite a charming way.

Pararthoparatar Arthaniti could be titled equally well as a book of jokes. The jokes are sharp, intelligent and subtle.
