Given that the BCL, by its vicious involvement in the admission process, may have minted a huge sum of money, to the tune of one crore by one estimate, and that too, only from three colleges of the capital, it is no surprise that such lucrative business is being conducted -- thanks to the impunity leash. And to cap it, it is alleged that some teachers may have got involved in the trade, a few under pressure and some on their own volition. //////THE Ekushey book fair is one of those annual events which reveal the cultural strengths and aspirations of the Bengali nation. It has been that way for decades altogether, which is as much as to say that the constant stream of visitors making their way to the grounds of the Bangla Academy every year is a reflection of the intellectual wellspring the people of Bangladesh have always been drawn to. It is a matter of satisfaction that it is not merely the Ekushey book fair but other book fairs as well which have regularly been a source of inspiration to young and old alike.

Life in Dhaka is heading for a complete standstill unless something is done urgently.//////BANGLADESH'S large and growing trade deficit with India is often used by critics as an indication of India's dominance in its relationship with Bangladesh, and by implication, serves as a rationale for why it is a bad idea to engage in more cooperation with India. What is amazing is that not just political opponents but also NGOs, business leaders and even some professional economists use this argument. Is this a valid concern?

This is a very alarming predicament at all levels of our society and even educated women often become victims of unbearable harassments and abuse. //////To ease the haphazard traffic movement in this mega city, the govt. has taken a number of steps, including removal of age-old unfit commercial vehicles from the city roads and introduction of newer vehicles on some routes. But unfortunately for reasons best known to authorities, the BRTC Volvo Double Decked bus service has stopped operating on the Uttara route for the last one year. Students, women, children and office goers, who availed themselves of this service are now facing serious trouble. Older people and patients, who like to go to BIRDEM, BSMMU, DMC etc. for treatment find no other alternative but to board a local bus which stops here and there to collect passengers and takes much time to reach the destination. Moreover, these buses take passengers beyond their capacity and one has to fight to get a seat. //////Food-borne diseases are an ever-growing concern across the globe and it has been reported that in 2005 alone, 1.8 million people succumbed to death due to the diarrhoeal diseases mainly attributed to food and drinking water contamination. It's obvious that the poor and developing countries like ours top the list of most vulnerable countries due to many reasons like illiteracy, poverty, unscrupulousness of food manufacturers and sellers and lack of proper surveillance on the government's part etc. From the picture of the last few years it is as clear as the daylight that how horrible, grim and grisly is our condition in this regard. Deadly formalin in fish, milk and milk products, urea with rice, poisonous pesticides, chemicals and other preservatives with fruits and vegetables, artificial ripening and colouring of fruits, algae in so called pure beverage bottles, industrial dye and tar in sweetmeat, arsenic in water and even, recently, in paddyin fact, the list is so long that a whole book could be written on it. As a result of food and drinks adulteration and contamination the health of the people is breaking down giving rise to fatal diseases on a regular basis. Millions of taka is being spent behind treatment and the government is already gasping for air while coping with the ever-growing cost of health care. //////President Ahmedinejad resumed Iran's suspended nuclear programme.

Shoe hurling as a sign of extreme displeasure; started with US President Bush (the son) on his trip to Iraq! Having set the precedent, the next target was the French President (if I correctly recollect). Now it is the Sudanese President's turn. Next target is anybody's guess!//////I saw you in Bangla TV the other day. Unlike a lot of other leaders (political and non-political), to my mind, you came out very clean. So, one day last week I tried to call your office unsuccessfully. I know you are busy, but you must have a secretary to answer the calls of common people like us. Well, I thought, may be you will check your e-mail. So I e-mailed you and again very unsuccessfully//////While I am writing, the govt. has already declared Rangpur as a new division and obviously, this is another mind-breaking news for the people of Mymensingh who are demanding Mymensingh to be declared a division for the last around 30 years. But the govt's a recent decision to conduct the feasibility study, though some reports claimed it a decision, of establishing a new international airport at Trishal has made the people of this area at least a little bit hopeful. This is a logical decision as we see the neighbouring countries especially India, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea establishing their national airports at least 50-80km away from the capitals. Besides, through several unwanted developments Dhaka is now going to be dead city and govt. is desperate to expand its metropolitan area. //////While presiding over a cabinet meeting on Monday, 25 January, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked the ministers, secretaries and public servants not to pile up files on their tables as she reminded that the present government did not come to power to while away time.

Chowdhury in his letter on 27 January. The simple reason is that our authorities do not bother about it. It is for them to put up a realistic and representative image of Bangladesh; and take it up with Google to be incorporated in their website! //////Those of you who frequent around Dhanmondi, during rush hours i.e. in the morning, afternoon and in the evening must have experienced unpleasant traffic situation on both sides of the bridge connecting the eastern part with the western part. As I have been experiencing this unpleasant situation on a regular basis, I kept wondering what is the cause of this unbearable traffic jam. In my observation, it is the dearth of bridge connection between the two parts of Dhanmondi. A few more bridges across the lake could have mitigated the problem to a great extent. It is though true that both Mirpur Road and Shatmashjid Road experience similar situation during such rush hours, even then I am inclined to believe that constructing a few more bridges across the lake shall greatly benefit the commuters.//////Just now I got the news from The Daily Star, about the death of a cute child named Hamim Sheikh.

It is really an unfortunate and sad event. The motor transportation is one of the major means of transport in Saudi Arabia, hence the incidence of deaths on the roads is much higher.

Steps need to be taken to make sure that such roads are rectified or closed to avoid innocent people being killed or maimed. The drivers should also be properly monitored.//////It is said that books are the best mirror of one's life.

These are those VIPs who don't care about the public in general. School goers, office goers even patients in the ambulance have to suffer a lot. //////Five of the killers of Bangabandhu and his family members were hanged finally, although some of them are still at large. There's been a clear message on the way forward that killers and criminals can be booked, and it can happen in Bangladesh.
