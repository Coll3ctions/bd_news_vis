Children are the worst victims of this harmful electromagnetic radiation.

Many of the busy roads and highways are in urgent need for repair, because they cannot stand heavy pressure of heavy traffic. //////I always read Brig Gen Shahedul Anam Khan's articles, as in today's DS. I have been nauseated by the new benchmarks of adulation that the sycophants have reached and in recent days wasting huge sums of money (whose?). I wonder what pleasure was derived by the recipient(s), when the real facts and the balance sheet of the 'victory' remain obscure. Does anyone know what our nation will gain in practical terms? //////Noise pollution has already become a concern for the city dwellers in Dhaka. Daytime commuters especially patients and children suffer a lot. But the persons who are responsible for making these noises defy the sufferings of others and also the rules regarding this. Buses, trucks, mikes and construction sites (mainly brick crushing machines) are the major sources of unbearable noises. But the law enforcers turn a deaf ear to this public nuisance.//////I'm among the majority of the people who hoped and prayed that corporal punishment would end in schools when the High Court gave its landmark verdict over a year ago, but the reality is that this evil practice is still rampant in classrooms.

It may sound like "Nero playing flute while the Rome was burning" but it is actually like the Titanic musician who valiantly played on to soothe the pangs of departing. //////Every year May Day is observed all over the world to reaffirm the rights of the workers. The factory/industry owners must offer better wages and humane treatment to their workers.

Shakib and Tamim are playing in the IPL and that is why there are lots of Kolkata and Pune fans in Bangladesh. However, IPL matches focus too much on cheerleaders and glamour, rather than the game itself.

Nowadays it is quite embarrassing to watch IPL matches with our family members.//////According to the statistics of the rights organisation Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), a total of 100 people have become victims of enforced disappearance from January 2010 till 20 April, 2012.

The Nobel laureate poet took up painting and sketching towards the end of his life. I feel, as do many others, that he expressed in his paintings what was beyond the reach of words of his poetry, plays, novels and other forms of written work. This was a time characterised by the flourishing of the Bengal School, the paintings of Amrita Shergill and Rabi Barma. //////Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore's idyllic 'Shilaidah Kuthibari' (mansion) inspired some of the bard's most famous literary works, including poetry, prose, novels and music. //////A website (www.ashrafsiddqui.com) on the life and works of the acclaimed poet, researcher, folklorist and essayist Dr. Ashraf Siddiqui -- with a view to preserving his precious contribution to literature for the next generation -- has been launched.

But it has never been a foregone conclusion. Indeed, every crisis since independence whether natural or man-made had at the time seemed like the end of the road. Only the concerted efforts of a myriad range of actors helped to turn the corners. While leaders repeatedly showed feet of clay, the man and woman on the ground quietly soldiered on with determination and ingenuity. And produced outcomes that have rightly earned the marvel of the world be it in economic resilience or social progress. But a new danger is afoot that of premature and ill-served complacency.//////Eight weeks after the Congress lost legislature elections in four out of five Indian states, it's finally acknowledging its crisis.
