It has just formulated a work plan for itself for the next two years. That is indeed a bold move, but for such a move to be translated into reality on the ground it will need a good deal of spirit and energy. Experience shows only too clearly that it has in the past made as many as 88 recommendations on the law and its various aspects to the government. Now, obviously, such a number is remarkable. The unfortunate bit in the story is that no more than four or five of these recommendations have been accepted by successive governments. Which brings up the matter of whether governments, political in nature as they are, have ever been ready and willing to take the Law Commission seriously? One feels here a whiff of the partisan. Every time a new government has taken over, it has found the reasons to keep the commission at bay.//////THINGS are back to square one as far as traffic management is concerned. After the short-lived respite during Eid holidays the everyday urban menace called traffic congestion is back with a bang. Throughout the week thousands of vehicles of every description are to be seen clogging the main roads and alleyways of the metropolis from morning till midnight. While traffic lights keep turning from red to green and back in sheer futility, exasperated policemen try to control the burgeoning number of vehicles with their hands. Alternative system of modern and effective signalling is yet to be installed to address the situation. //////THE Norwegian Nobel Committee has stunned the world with its announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009. Of the 205 names in the list, US president obviously was the most prominent personality in the world to draw the attention of the Nobel Committee. But his being the most powerful and illustrious global celebrity apart, many have questioned the wisdom of the Nobel Committee for its decision to exalt Barack Obama so early in his career in the US presidency as he is yet to deliver the promises he made to the people of the US and the world at large. The former Polish president and winner of the Peace prize in 1983, for instance, exclaimed in reaction to Obama's luck saying, "So soon? Too early He is only beginning to act." In a similar vein the former US ambassador to UN John Bolton called "it is indicative of the politicisation of the Nobel Peace prize process. This just carries it to the n-th degree." On the other hand, the 2002's Nobel peace winner former Democratic US president Jimmy Carter welcomed the Nobel Prize committee's decision as "a bold statement of international support for his vision and commitment." //////LIKE Paul Nitze, who served US presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Bush Sr. in different capacities, and George Kennan, who conceived the containment policy of communism that guided US after the Second World War till recently, Harry Truman also had, in his Defense Secretary, a hawk and Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, a dove, who were called upon by Truman along with Secretary of State Dean Acheson to advise him in whether US should try to build a hydrogen bomb, knowing that the bomb could destroy civilisation as was known at that time. //////Despite having already stormed into the knockout phase with a haul of 19 goals in three outings, there is no feel of complacency in the Mohammedan camp as they take on newcomers Shuktara Jubo Sangsad in a quarterfinal match of the Citycell Federation Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////The crowd at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium did not have a home team to support in the first part of the Saturday double-header but those who bothered to show up certainly got their money's worth, thanks to a wonderful display of power hitting by the Champions League's first centurion, Andrew Puttick, and later by Justin Ontong.//////A similar story to Thursday's panned out at the Feroz Shah Kotla, with another Indian team failing to capitalise on home conditions and crowd support.

The common increase of private cars and beggars is synonymous which may have some meaning from economic point of view. Private cars have increased traffic jam and beggars also cause traffic jam. But here the point of interest is beggars not private cars. The beggars are poor but all poor are not beggars. There are professional beggars too. Women beggars with babies are common. Some people pretending to be pir/fakir are also found begging. Children are also engaged in begging. Foreigners visiting the country fall prey to the beggars. There are beggars everywhere round the clock. It is often seen that crippled beggars are lying on footpaths suffering from cancer, leprosy, malignant tumour, swollen, protruded eyes etc. Religious places like mosques and mazars are full of beggars. During prayer time men, women and children remain awaiting outside for begging while devotees are praying inside the mosque, as if beggars need not pray. There is also no question about men and women begging together. It appears that beggars need not be worried about heaven and hell.//////The aim of taking medicine is to recover from the diseases, not to fall further sick. The real situation is different in our beloved country. Sometimes it seems that we take medicine to die. The so-called pharmaceuticals are producing various medicines that are not of the required standard. //////Every day we hear lots of noises cracking our ears and beating our nervous system. Similarly, we see a huge jam in front of our school gate. This continues from the very early morning to 8:30am, while our class has already begun.

It is an incredible discovery, based on magnesium from the seas and oceans round the world; and the usion heat harnessed from the sun! Both raw materials are nature's gift to mankind and available free!//////Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA), a national research institute, can't run its research and administration smoothly because of bad student politics. As it is located on Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) campus, leaders from the ruling party demand 'chanda' from its employees, tinker with the tender process, recruitment is based on the ruling party's list and, above all, the entire administration is totally helpless because of their dominant role in every situation. The authorities can't take any decision against the ruling party student leaders, all the time the leaders enter into BINA campus and threaten the authorities with dire consequences. //////The 3rd session of parliament resumed on 4 October and participation of the main opposition is again uncertain. This is really disappointing. The 29th December parliamentary election was an overwhelming election where all the voters from all sectors of society participated spontaneously. It is true that in most of the constituencies the BNP did not come out victorious, but in every constituency the BNP candidate got a lot of votes. So why are they not participating? They are the representatives of the voters. But I think that the BNP does not think like this. They are only thinking about their personal and political issues. They should put their position and activities on the manifesto as an opposition party. Because it could help the voters to rethink on the issue of casting their votes for the BNP. //////World Teachers' Day is celebrated once a year on October 5 since 1994. Its endeavour is to garner support in favour of teachers and to make sure that the needs of future generations will be met by teachers.//////The death of yet another big cat, a black leopard, on the 29th September Tuesday is really unfortunate. From the beginning of this year till now, approximately four big cats including two Royal Bengal Tigers have been killed by people and God knows how many more are being poached in the Sundarbans without being noticed. The animals in Dhaka Zoo are also not in good health and some of them have even died. Why so many animals have become sick at the same time and why the vets have failed to cure these animals are yet to be explained.//////The thoughts, principles and energies of young men and women are vital for the continuing development of the societies in which they live. The evils of young men and women, as well as their dreams and aspirations, are a necessary constituent of the challenges facing today's societies and future generations. In all parts of the earth, young citizens, living in countries at diverse stages of growth and in different socio-economic situations, aspire to live better lives in their societies. Convinced elements would help this process, such as ensuring education, access to employment opportunities, adequate food and nutrition, a physical as well as social atmosphere that promotes high-quality health and protection from disease, pleasure of human rights and basic freedom, contribution to decision-making processes etc. //////Salute to Ted Kennedy, a supporter of our 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. //////Recently, a news report was published in one of the leading Bengali newspapers with a photograph of a small helicopter which had just landed at Rajshahi Airport. I read the related news and understood that the CEO of a bank accompanied the owner of the helicopter to Rajshahi. They were in the middle of their business tour in the north-western part of Bangladesh. I found that the reporter strongly criticized the CEO for accompanying a prospective investor.//////I refer to your editorial of 5 October. Although such killings are regrettable, the law and order forces have a duty to interrogate and recover arms and explosives from criminal gangs and have an inherent right to defend themselves if under attack. Similarly, if a criminal attempts to escape they have a duty to give warning and if it fails, to stop escape by shooting down the escapee. //////North Korea is showing signs of flexibility over returning to nuclear disarmament talks, and other countries must seize the opportunity to get the negotiations back on track, China's premier said yesterday.//////Pakistan intelligence agencies have warned that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) may carry out a series of suicide attacks across the country including Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Chaklala and Peshawar.//////Former Pakistan president General Pervez Musharraf has said that even though the US considers Islamabad as an important ally in its 'war on terror', Washington sees it with suspicion.//////Indian troops killed five Islamic militants, three of whom were trying to sneak into Indian Kashmir from the Pakistani side of the disputed region, the army said Saturday.//////The ruling Congress party has emerged as the frontrunner in the coming assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, with the fractured opposition unlikely to spring any surprises.//////Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday affirmed the government's determination not to succumb to the increasing threat of Maoists but ruled out the use of the army against them.//////Turkey and Armenia plan to sign an agreement Saturday establishing diplomatic ties in hopes of ending a century of acrimony over their bloody past and reopening their border, but nationalists on both sides are seeking to derail its implementation.//////British MPs are facing a further challenge to their expense claims when Parliament resumes after the summer recess.//////Floodwaters from tropical storm Parma receded in much of the northern Philippines on Saturday but the toll from heavy rain rose further as more bodies were recovered, officials said.//////More than 1,000 demonstrators took to the streets across Iraq on Saturday against plans to enact a controversial closed voting system, which does not name candidates standing for office.//////Five Jordanians and six Uruguayans belonging to the UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti were killed Friday when their airplane crashed while on a border surveillance mission, the UN mission in Haiti said.//////The world's media were divided yesterday after the shock award of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Barack Obama, with some calling it a victory for ideals and others condemning it as deeply politicised.//////A Hamas delegation met Egypt's intelligence chief Omar Suleiman yesterday to try to set a new date for the signing of a Palestinian unity deal, a member of the Islamist movement's team said.//////Ten MPs belonging to India's ruling alliance are headed to Sri Lanka Saturday and they said their main aim is to see the conditions in the camps where thousands of Tamils displaced by the war are housed.//////The first clown in space, Guy Laliberte, has launched a 14-city poetic planetary extravaganza to promote clean drinking water, from the International Space Station.//////Nasa's much-anticipated "Moon bombing" mission, in which it sent the LCROSS spacecraft to the Moon to strike a crater in order to collect frozen water, may have literally hit a "dry hole", as there were no billowing plumes of dust and ice visible after the impact.//////Pakistan took two news channels off the air Saturday that had been covering attempts by soldiers to capture two militants who broke into army headquarters in an attack on the complex.//////Seven suspects accused by India of involvement in last year's Mumbai terror attacks that killed 166 people were Saturday produced in an anti-terror court in Pakistan, a defence lawyer said.//////The head of the Philippine government's peace negotiating panel which is in talks with local insurgents is resigning his post to run for office next year, his office said yesterday.//////Thirty-five people were killed in Mexico's drug-related violence on Friday, with brutal attacks spanning five states, officials said.//////Theatre troupe Natya Kendra celebrates its 19th anniversary this year.

It's no wonder a portrait of Stalin was prominently displayed at the parade celebrating Beijing's 60th anniversary. One of the world's most tyrannical and inhuman rulers, responsible for the murders of tens of millions of Russian women and children, his picture is still placed proudly in the office of the CPI (M) politburo in Kolkata.//////COMPRESSED Natural Gas, commonly known as CNG is almost a household name. With the rise in petrol prices the most common and preferred form of energy for running vehicles is CNG. It's considered to be among the most environmentally friendly substitutes for gasoline and costs  the price of petrol. This alternative fuel might be a long-term solution to reduce the reliance on gasoline for the auto industry. In Dhaka, with the worsening traffic situation, running any automobile on petrol is quite unthinkable. Yet one question remains. Why do we always see long queues in front of the CNG stations irrespective of time or place? It is simple. The demand for it is much higher than the supply. It doesn't take much to realise that as consumers we need more of these stations. //////
