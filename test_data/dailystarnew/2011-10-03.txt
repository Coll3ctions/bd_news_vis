The main opposition seems to be no exception, despite the plausible assurances by the prime minister that her new anti-terrorism measures are directed at extremism, and extremism only. If anything, the main opposition has shown a readiness to compromise on human rights and the much cherished Bangladeshi tradition of freedom of expression and liberal values. The attention of the political observers in Bangladesh has been focused since the last week of September. The ruling party came down heavily on the opposition leader's remarks that the government had deliberately orchestrated many issues against opposition leaders and activists. //////The High Court ordered the government on 29th July 2009 to collect the required equipment for the rescue operation if any deadly earthquake hit the country. We have learnt from the newspaper reports that the rule has given a guideline to form a committee in this regard, and the eligibility and assignment of its members were also mentioned there. However, we heard that according to the High Court order the committee made a list of the available equipment and the requirement, and already submitted it to the government.//////These days the issue of road safety is a much talked about one. The media--both the electronic and the print--has relentlessly drawn our attention to the topic. As we open the daily newspapers we are bombarded with the news of road accidents which are often fatal. It seems, we are no longer shocked by the news of death on the highways. In some cases, it is reckless driving that causes accidents. Of late, the communications minister commented that education is not necessary to qualify as drivers. He also said that anyone who can identify a cow or a goat is eligible to drive a motor vehicle! He is ready to give driving licence to anyone. It is time the authorities did something concrete to ensure road safety. The ministers at the helm can not get away with silly comments.//////Smoking in public places is not unusual in our country. We all know the demerits of smoking, and not only the smokers but also the people around them get affected by the smoke. The government has banned smoking in public places, but who cares? At present, the law enforcers themselves smoke in public and nobody dares to complain. The government should take the initiative of totally banning smoking, as it affects a large number of people. By banning smoking we can set an example for other countries to follow.//////Bangladesh Cricket Control Board on September 20, 2011 has decided to set up a satellite TV channel to telecast their cricket matches and they have also allocated Tk. 30 crore for this project. Currently, all the satellite TV channels of our country are airing programmes via foreign satellite. A few years back, some Bangladeshis completed their training abroad at the government's expense to set up Bangladesh's own satellite . Also, a few months ago, the telecommunications minister said that Bangladesh would soon have its own satellite.//////I live in Nikunja. Here the situation is perhaps the worst in the city. The workers from the grassroots level use the name of the ruling//////People did not know in advance what might happen on September 27, the day on which the BNP-led four party alliance held a grand rally. They heaved a sigh of relief when it ended peacefully. We thank the BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia for not announcing any hartal programme. The common people do not like hartals, they have had enough of it when the Awami League was in opposition. The opposition leader opted for road marches and we think it is a very wise decision. We also like to thank the government for allowing the opposition to hold the rally without any major hindrance though there are reports of Awami League activists and supporters obstructing the opposition activists in many places who were going to join the rally. These are uncalled-for and should be avoided. We hope the government would not obstruct the road marches or take any steps which can create a confrontational situation. People are already very annoyed with the government. So, for its own good, the government should act rationally this time.//////I was against hartal till I saw the newspaper picture of brutal police boots smashing the face of a protester during the last week's hartal. While condemning the vandalism by Jamaat protesters, we cannot deny the fact that every political party has the right to press home their demands through peaceful demonstration. But unfortunately, police, instead of escorting the procession, pounce on it without the slightest provocation. Admittedly, the police do as they are instructed to do, but I still don't think they should necessarily be so mean as to push a human being to the ground and smash him under their boots. I think it is time we put a stop to such inhuman treatment by the police. //////The residents of old Dhaka have been living with a serious problem. Monkeys frequently visit their houses taking away foods, damaging utensils, water-pipelines, etc. Often these monkeys, in a group of 40-50, attack and even bite the children. //////The battery-run rickshaws are now visible on some Dhaka roads. The other day, I had my first ride on one. I found it more comfortable and faster, and as maneuverable and cheap as traditional rickshaws. If their centre of gravity could be shifted to a lower position, arm rests installed and powered with solar cells, they would be more stable, safe and economical - the ideal non-polluting vehicle to phase out the rickshaws and to cut the arrogant, pricey and noisy CNGs down to size. Those behind pressing these Battery-operated rickshaws into service should be commended and rewarded. I suppose, with the usual sagacity of our 'public masters' (previously servants), they will soon realise that here is a startling development to solve transportation for the masses, where they have not got their 'cut'. Also, they would not look good on their multi-billion dollar rickshaw-free illusory freeways. So, they should be banned.//////In the recent past, the government while evicting the leader of the opposition from her Shaheed Moinul Road residence made a display of the house wherein she lived for long. The nation, nay the world at large has come to know about the lavish life of a leader of a third world country where more than 80% of the population lives below the poverty line. Honestly speaking, the nation has become sick and tired of both the parties. If a free and fair election is held without any intervention from any quarter, none of the parties will come out victorious with the necessary seats to form a government.//////More than 700 anti-Wall Street activists were arrested Saturday in New York amid chaotic scenes on Brooklyn Bridge after the protest movement's march against "corporate greed" was broken up by police.//////The Palestinians need to show flexibility and get back to the negotiating table, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said in an interview with Egypt's Al-Hayat TV released Saturday.//////Israel yesterday accepted a call by international mediators to resume peace talks with the Palestinians and urged President Mahmoud Abbas to do the same rather than pursue a UN bid for statehood recognition.//////The Afghan government says its investigations show that the killer of Burhanuddin Rabbani, its negotiator with the Taliban, was a Pakistani.//////United States issued a worldwide travel alert Saturday warning its nationals of the "potential for retaliation" after two key al-Qaeda figures were killed in an air raid in Yemen.//////Beijing has urged Myanmar to protect the rights of Chinese companies after the government halted construction of a $3.6 billion China-backed mega dam following public opposition to the project.//////Police forcibly removed four legislators from the chamber of the deputy speaker at the Andhra Pradesh assembly building late Saturday, ending a nearly nine-hour-long episode.//////An Israeli writer has won a historic court victory granting his request to be officially registered as "without religion" rather than "Jewish," Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported yesterday.//////Police forcibly removed four legislators from the chamber of the deputy speaker at the Andhra Pradesh assembly building late Saturday, ending a nearly nine-hour-long episode.//////Police in New York City freed most of the more than 700 people arrested on Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday during a protest against corporate greed.//////Swedish inventor and scholar Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), who made a vast fortune from his invention of dynamite in 1866, created the Nobel Prizes in his will.//////Egypt's military rulers agreed on Saturday to amend a controversial electoral law following threats of a poll boycott by dozens of political parties and a rally in Cairo's Tahrir Square for reforms.//////At least 25 soldiers have been killed in a friendly fire incident and clashes with militants linked to al-Qaeda in south Yemen, security officials said yesterday.//////The United States and Saudi Arabia are satisfied with the "strength" of their ties, the White House said Saturday, despite recent disagreements over Arab Spring revolutions and the Mideast peace process.//////Israeli fighter jets Saturday fired a missile on Gaza, injuring three people, one of whom was in serious condition, Palestinian medics said.//////Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra came under fire from her own Twitter account yesterday when it was taken over for 20 minutes by anonymous hacker who accused her of incompetence.//////The evening of October 1 could have been much like any other for many in Dhaka, but for a select 400, it was slightly more memorable.

Below is what transpired between the star and Subhi Shama from The Daily Star.//////Muktok Padabali, a recitation academy, arranged a solo recitation performance, titled Ami Noile Mittha Hoto Shondha Tara Otha, featuring elocutionist Laila Afroz on October 1 at Shawkat Osman Auditorium, Central Public Library, Dhaka. //////We have seen in the past how the question papers for recruiting teachers for public high schools, medical college final examinations, Civil Service tests, Secondary and Higher Secondary School Certificate exams and so on are leaked and sold to candidates and their guardians. In most cases, the police nabbed the culprits and brought them to justice.//////The struggle did not gain the same national prominence as the hunger strike waged by Anna Hazare. Yet a landmark it surely was -- in the history of India's nuclear programme. On August 17, a group of activists started a hunger strike near Koodankulam in Tamil Nadu. It was directed against plans of the Indian government to commission a 1,000 MW nuclear plant. //////Forty years after 1971, the Bangladesh liberation war remains a frozen object, not yet fully open to heterodox narratives. Historians need to unpack the complex and contradictory matrix that gave rise to Bengali nationalism, and the mixture of racism and hysteria that spurred the Pakistan Army on to a path of atrocities. This is essential for Bangladesh to decipher its post-liberation trajectory, and for Pakistan to excavate the roots of its current crises. Among several new books on the war is Sarmila Boses Dead Reckoning, carrying a bizarre and shrill agenda of absolving Pakistan of allegations of a genocide. What we are left waiting for is a deep investigation into 1971 about the nature of violence, crisis bargaining, unintended consequences, and historys orphans. Peoples actions during war are always a combination of contradiction, heroism and failure of nerve; they are a fundamental aspect of being human. Bangladesh is still waiting for that human history of 1971.//////
