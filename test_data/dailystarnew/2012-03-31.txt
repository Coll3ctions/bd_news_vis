Terrorism is absent from most parts of the country. Punjab has not experienced even a single incident in the last 15 months or so. Above all, terrorism is no more a topic in any discussion.

Still, people do feel uneasy and even insecure, but appear to have reconciled to the circumstances and the conditions.//////This year's theme "Water and Food Security" highlights the challenges associated with the precious resource.

This becomes a nationwide phenomenon after a public examination like "Shomaponi," JSC, SSC or HSC. This identification is simply injustice to a child whom we identify as unmeritorious. It even be called a crime (not in the eyes of any existing law but psychologically of course!) in the case of children of primary level, who are still so innocent that when we single out a child as unmeritorious it can make him feel so low and inferior to others that it can lead to permanent damage in his/her self-confidence and negatively impact his/her future. A psychologist can better describe and provide rationale for my remarks. But I want to depict this issue from other hard facts that we totally forget and ignore. //////Meeting his Iranian, Afghan and Tajik counterparts in Dushanbe, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari made all the right noises: a stable Afghanistan was in Pakistan's interest; the nexus between militancy and drug trafficking needed to be curbed; non-state actors want to destabilise Afghanistan and, implicitly, they should not be allowed to do so; cooperation in all spheres among the four countries would assume added significance after the withdrawal of foreign forces in 2014; etc.//////It goes without saying that Sundarbans is an important forest and the most beautiful ecosystem in the world. There are hundreds of articles on the question of importance of Sundarbans forest, dozens of projects have been undertaken and still there are many in the pipe line.

But it is very unfortunate that so many projects are attempted spending huge amount of money for the betterment of the situation, yet the condition deteriorates. //////Bio-village means a village/territory where community people would live and breathe in nature and foster the biodiversified ecological balance.

These days, many people living in Bangladesh are familiar with the term Autism. Even, we see mothers not living in urban areas bringing their child when they find a bit unusual about their child.//////Tuberculosis (TB) often goes undiagnosed in children from birth to 15 years old because they lack access to health services or the health workers who care for them are unprepared to recognise the signs and symptoms of TB in this age group. With better training and harmonisation of the different programmes that provide health services for children, serious illness and death from TB could be prevented in thousands of children every year, experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Stop TB Partnership urged.//////Face transplant surgery has transformed the face and the lives of several people.

The collective security system may have brought temporary peace in the world immediately after the two World Wars. However, it failed to establish long-lasting or ever-lasting global stability and security. For example, the League of Nations established after World War I succumbed into failure as the collective peace effort, which pulled the world to get involved into World War II, the most destructive and devastating event in the annals of history mankind had ever experienced. Some writers, thus, consider the twenty years between the two World Wars as the intermission or interim period. At the end of World War II, a second collective step towards peace was taken through the formation of the United Nations. Unfortunately, the UN, over the years, has lost credibility of the peace loving people to the extent that the structuralists started labeling it as the vehicle of exploitation.//////While the foreign policy elite in Washington focuses on the 8,000 deaths in a conflict in Syriahalf a world away from the United Statesmore than 47,000 people have died in drug-related violence since 2006 in Mexico. A deeply troubled state as well as a demographic and economic giant on the United States' southern border, Mexico will affect America's destiny in coming decades more than any state or combination of states in the Middle East. Indeed, Mexico may constitute the world's seventh-largest economy in the near future.//////Whenever I come across any story of Syed Manzoorul Islam, I recollect the boom-time litterateurs of Latin America, namely, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jorge Luis Borges and so on. The reason is that the way the story tellers of Latin America tell their tales is very similar to the way Syed Manzoorul Islam tells his stories. I find a resemblance between our culture and Latin American culture because they have a very rich tradition of story telling like us. Since magic realism is an inseparable part of this oral tradition of story writing, Islam's tales are packed with magical happenings which we can relate to our everyday realities. His latest volume of short story entitled ////// (Stories of good times and bad times) is a collection of thirteen stories where readers will find Islam at the heights of postmodern experimentation. However, he invariably uses his own experiences to make his stories lively and playful. Thereupon, the stories have a direct link with our everyday happiness and grief. Islam has introduced multifarious subject matters before his readers through his latest collection. Therefore, the tales of this volume are of different tastes. We go through a lot of good and bad times in our lifetime. Happiness and grief situate side by side in our life. Stories stem from these good as well as bad times. However, we generally do not keep in mind all the moments of life but those which compel us to recollect particular moments. In ////// Syed Islam has tried to capture those moments in the light of his experiences.////// is basically a collection of newspaper columns by the writer published in the period 1996 -2005. The author says in the foreword: The essayist is a self liberated man, sustained by the childish belief that everything he thinks about everything that happens to him is of general interest. He is a fellow who thoroughly enjoys his work, just as people who take bird walks enjoy themselves. The essays in this book contain the writer's perception of various national as well as international affairs and issues during the last decade, which was eventful. They span a vast domain of subjects like the historic water sharing treaty, the decisive role of education, Political Rhetoric: Use and Abuse, Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge, strategies for redesigning government, etc. It is a vast canvas. Mahbub Husain Khan wields a facile and multicolored pen which flows like the rivers of Bangladesh. His style is simple, lucid and attractive. It pulls readers toward the many themes he articulates in this collection. His concern for contemporary issues and their analysis are in a sense very original. //////Of the many novels with settings in Cairo, Albert Cossery's ////// captures the frenzy of the metropolis more vividly than all the others I have read. Cossery's novella was published in French is 1999, more than a decade before the recent events that have altered Egypt so thoroughly, though all the seeds of the current revolution are present: the decrepit sections of the city; the traffic on the streets, making them impossible for pedestrians to cross; the minions of street-people with little hope or expectations in their lives. The narratora professional thiefis stopped short in his tracks one day when he discovers a new occupation: Street Crosser. //////
