Yet once the ship is built it glides through the rough waves like a dinghy in a small stream.//////It was one of those days. Sitting on the patio looking at the blue sky through autumn's worn-out brown leaves, I drew a complete blank. Nothing came to mind. Well, I decided if my mind can think of ////// then perhaps I need to write about it. That became even more challenging. My mind couldn't conjure up ////// as my brain experienced no such thing. Ah, the magical will! I became more determined to understand what my mind refused to understand. The concept in question evoked several words: void, nonexistent, nothingness, blank, oblivion, naught. None resolved the dilemma. As a starting point I asked whether ////// should be treated as a value, an ideal in pursuit of knowledge. But again, that knowledge is relative to something. Or is it more tangible?As ascetics who denounce everything material in search of that void called nothing? I hungered for a clearer answer.//////Around 15% of the worlds population, or one billion people, live with disabilities. And the rates of disability are increasing due to population ageing and increases in chronic health conditions.

The British Journal of Surgery reported an overall accuracy of 76%.//////The growing tension in East Asia over China's aggressive claims to the region's oil-rich waters now delineated on maps in Chinese passports may suggest a meticulously calculated plan by Beijing to propel the country to superpower status. The reality may be more mundane lack of coordination and bureaucratic infighting. //////History will undoubtedly deliver the harshest condemnations of the UN climate talks currently underway in Doha, Qatar. But the conference was laughable before it began; the inept goals of the talks stand in tragic-comic opposition to what we already know about climate change that the climate has already changed in profound ways and its trajectory spells doom for civilization if drastic, coordinated steps are not taken in the immediate future.//////Omar Faruq was born on March 12, 1950, in Pirojpur. He was the son of Sayedur Rahman Sharif and Kulsum Begum.//////An amazing book containing amazing stories of the lives, activities, struggles and sacrifices of some outstanding women who lived during the time of our beloved Prophet (Peace be upon him). They are the luckiest of women. No, I am not talking about his mother and mother-like figures, neither of his wives nor his daughters because they are either related to him by blood, or as foster parents or by marriages that are only natural, but about those women who were outside of such bonds yet by association with the Prophet shone into prominence. Of course, they fortified themselves with strong will, indomitable spirit and fortitude that came into full fruition because they experienced the company of the Prophet (pbuh), could seek his advice through waiting on his decision, oftentimes taking decisions on their own knowing that they would be endorsed by him because they knew the Prophet (pbuh) so well and would listen to his deliberations. Therefore, although this book is divided into four groups of women, nevertheless, the section on such women merits attention in its own right much more than the other sections.//////
