The minister did so in presence of the prime minister. What is really shocking is that the PM a few months back recommended Dr Yunus as the president of the World Bank for his achievements in micro-credit and women empowerment. Any opinion of a minister in a public platform should be considered the government's opinion. I beg to ask whether the PM's recommendation of Prof. Yunus as a candidate for World Bank presidency was real. Syed Ashraf's comment was instigated by Hillary Clinton's opinion that the US government hopes that Bangladesh government would not interfere with the Grameen Bank's activities. Dr Yunus is one of our very few global ambassadors and it is really disheartening to see that the current government is undermining the very individual who brought immense fame and goodwill to Bangladesh instead of giving him the recognition he so much deserves.//////LGRD and Cooperatives Minister Syed Ashraful Islam has said that Dr Yunus having worked in economics and receiving a Nobel prize in peace is proof enough that something is really wrong.

Padma Bridge if constructed could have benefited millions of people for millions of years saving millions of hours of travelling. We the Bangladeshi people are born with poor luck and so we have no right to dream about something new or modern and we are destined to remain poor! //////It is heartening to learn that as part of the new Open Access Policy, the World Bank has made all its research data and publications accessible to everyone.

Then he chose to be neither, erasing his political footprints in that exact order. First he resigned from the ministry and then from the parliament. He even went away so far out that he left the country to show he meant business. But like a sea that washes back garbage thrown into it, the protocol he gave up keeps coming back to him.
