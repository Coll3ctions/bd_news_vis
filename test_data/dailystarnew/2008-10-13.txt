There is obvious lack of effective traffic management, which is causing congestions lasting hours together in the capital, every day from dawn to late evening, thereby making life and living next to impossible. The rush of vehicles that turns the roads into veritable traps for commuters also results in other fallouts, such as loss of valuable fuel and that of man-hours. Surprisingly, it has been going on for years together but no relevant agency came forward to stop the slide. //////ONLY the flunkeys will deny the fact that the unusual caretaker dispensation of the day has failed to deliver. It's not for nothing that it has started drawing flak from the public who gave this government blanket support on its advent eighteen months ago amid great relief and rejoicing. There is no denying the fact that it made some waves with its anti-terror and anti-corruption drives. Now, with the motives of those popular steps put to question, the redeeming works visibly coming to a naught, and the country's political forces gaining primacy irrespective of their past records and background, the credibility of the caretakers couldn't but plummet drastically. //////IT often needs a startling image to convey the dimensions of a crisis. Bloggers have time to discover such startling analogies. Someone on the net has had the time and patience to conjure up this image about $700 billion, the most dramatic figure among the many mountains of cash that governments have doled out to capitalism's poster boys in order to save capitalism.//////SENATOR John McCain must be thanking his stars that Barack Obama did not take him up on his offer of ten town hall debates.

Today, free market is a blended version of capitalism's perfect market competition and government monitoring don't confuse that; we call it mixed economy. However, whenever a third world government plays regulatory role our "development partners" still mischievously use this concept as a tool to suggest that "laissez-faire"(which means market mechanism bypassing government participation) is the best way to go about operating market.

Or, this is just religious consumerism and promotional activity to attract more customers and reach the target customers of services in those fields ?//////In the first presidential debate, McCain behaved like Mr. Knowall from the barracks -- overconfident and arrogant.
