May be bribe tampers the process of police investigation or NOC issuance. But by no way passport authorities can issue passports without such apposite investigation report or authentication reports. Anything contrary to the rules, if ever happens, should be meted with due punishment.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////Israeli and Palestinian leaders have launched a new round of peace negotiations, holding their first direct talks in nearly two years at a US-sponsored summit in Washington DC.//////Relief efforts in flood-ravaged Pakistan are being stretched by the "unprecedented scale" of the disaster, with the flow of international aid almost at a standstill, the UN said yesterday.//////An apparent air strike by foreign forces killed 10 election campaign workers in Afghanistan's north yesterday, a government spokesman said, and Nato-led forces said they were investigating the incident.//////Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard won the support of a key independent MP yesterday, leaving her close to breaking the worst political deadlock in decades after elections failed to produce a winner.//////US Defence Secretary Robert Gates arrived in Kabul yesterday on a surprise visit following a trip to Iraq, where he attended ceremonies to mark the formal end of the American combat mission there.//////The Islamist Hamas movement vowed yesterday to press a campaign of attacks against Israelis, hours ahead of the relaunch of direct peace talks in Washington.//////Over 100 workers have died during the construction of the metro railway in the Indian capital, Delhi, according to a submission by the metro authorities.//////The death toll from suicide attacks that targeted a busy procession in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore rose to 31 yesterday as six people succumbed to their injuries, officials said.//////German General Egon Ramms, chief of operations of Nato-led forces in Afghanistan, criticised yesterday Afghan President Hamid Karzai for failing to support Nato forces in the war against the Taliban.//////Discovery Channel HQ hostages freed as gunman was shot dead.//////The United States has designated the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or Pakistani Taliban, linked to the botched Times Square bombing attempt by a Pakistani American, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.//////There is no place for God in theories on the creation of the Universe, Professor Stephen Hawking has said.//////Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts is holding an exhibition, titled Apparitions and Cinegraphies, featuring images by French photographer Jean-Philippe Pernot.//////On the occasion of Janmashtami, the birth anniversary of Lord Sri Krishna, a colourful procession was brought out in the district town on September 1.
