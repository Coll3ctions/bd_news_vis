Mansur Ali Khan's magic transcended the supreme piffle that passed for cricket commentary when radio, with a glowing green eye in the right hand corner, was our primary passport to Test cricket. Secondary knowledge came from the grey photographs in black-and-white newspapers; but the red cherry seemed to blossom when it was smacked imperiously in an arc that began with the single eye of the master and traversed along the hooded nose that had been designed by God for aristocracy. The radio went into memory. The photograph was lovingly preserved in a scrapbook along with peers like Neil Harvey, Richie Benaud, Wes Hall, Garfield Sobers and Frank Worrell.

This trend is seen in developing countries like India, Kenya, Cambodia, Vietnam and Pakistan. Simultaneously, allocation of resources to the health sector is also decreasing proportionately. //////Muslim Valencia surrenders to the besieging King James I of Aragon the Conqueror.//////
