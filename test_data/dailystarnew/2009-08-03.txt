The quiet, unassuming woman who found herself thrust into an epic struggle against the dictatorial Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 would go on to emerge triumphant and take charge of the country. It was her determination to have Marcos voted out of office --- and she did that through pitting herself against him at the elections, though he attempted to repudiate the results --- that was to open the door to a new future for her people. A glimpse of that future came through the People Power revolution she spearheaded and then translated into a political process that was fundamentally a reinvention of democracy.//////THE 1972 UN Convention on Human Environment held in Stockholm, the 1987 Brundtland report on our "common future," and the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janerio --dubbed the Earth Summit -- debated the looming danger of an incipient conflict between Nature and man's unsustainable developmental activities. They all were summarily dismissed as scientists' fantasy or overestimation of the danger, if any. The world lent a deaf ear even to the Dahomey Declaration adopted at the 38th Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs in 1981, which made a clarion call to expand concern to a broader set of interrelated dangers, the destruction of the environment on a global scale and what could be seen as denial of basic needs for a growing majority of people.//////THE Awami League (AL) government's effort to make law-makers advisers to the Upazila Parishads will disempower local government and further aggravate the already skewed power relations.

The city's drainage system is no better than the other utility services which our government is supposed to deliver to the people who have voted them to power. Every day new cars and rickshaws from other neighbouring districts are coming to the city. The city has shortage of parking space as there is no guideline for residential, commercial and industrial areas. //////Each and every season in our country turns up with its appeal. Wherever and whenever you visit the different parts of country, you will find nature is clad in deep green, trees are laden with fresh, colourful, and mouth-watering fruits. Even if you do not have the chance of visiting rural areas, pay a visit to a local fruit market, you will see a variety of fruits in different times of the year. We should encourage everyone, particularly our children, to develop the habit of eating more and more domestic fruits like jackfruit, guava, black berry, pineapple, watermelon, mango, plum and many other types fruits that grow in our fertile land. It is a widely known fact that the flora and fauna in a region are inextricable linked to each other. The fruits that grow in a particular region are very essential for the people living in the area and consumption of these fruits rather than exotic ones increase vitality of people. In other words, we should give priority to our domestic fruits over fruits imported from abroad. Moreover, local farmers will be more motivated to grow more fruit trees which would have a significant impact in reducing air pollution. //////Drought has long been considered to be a hazard responsible for ups and downs of many civilizations in the world. Drought occurs when rainfall is absent for a prolonged period of time, causing earth to parch, wells to dry, underground water to fall, crops to wither leading to crop failure and scarcity of fodder for livestock. Because of meagre supply of water, food and fodder both humans and livestock suffer untold miseries. Drought extends its ominous tentacles slowly but surely. In Bangladesh, drought in the northern districts is very common. The hydrological and climate conditions of Bangladesh are characterized by 'too much water in the wet monsoon season and too little water in the dry months, creating a drought environment. Now it is the Bengali month of Sravan and the rainy season is going to be over but there has not been enough rain. Rainfall in June was 37% bellow average and in July 21-22% lower then average. //////I have been driving in Dhaka for the last 16 years. I have seen that unregistered cars are being driven in Dhaka city with no hesitation whatsoever in front of the law enforcers. Surprisingly, even in Dhaka Cantonment these cars are moving freely. Has the government officially allowed people to drive cars without numbers for an indefinite period of time?//////Bangladesh has entered the export market of sea-going vessels. The shipbuilding industry is now in a position to get a place on the list of priority sectors of the new export policy .The other sectors to be on the list, are agro and agro-processing products, light engineering, footwear and leather, pharmaceuticals, software and ICT products and home textiles.//////I am writing regarding the recent remarks made by the Indian High Commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravorty which were beyond any diplomatic norms, to say the least. His dismissal of expert opinions regarding the Tipaimukh dam would have been met with outrage if it were in any other country. But this is Bangladesh, an, as usual, the response from our foreign ministry was meek.//////Khulna to Dhaka via Mawa is an important route. //////The 'FRONTLINES', a publication of the Bureau of Legislative and Public Affairs, USAID in its latest (July 2009) has published the main features of the historic speech which the US President Barack Obama had delivered in Cairo on June 4, 2009. In this speech which has been translated into 15 different languages on the White House website, President Obama said I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect. The US President further said Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments, community organisations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim countries around the world to help our people pursue a better life. Obama pledged US foreign assistance for education, women's rights, democracy and economic development. Expressing respect for the rights of women to choose a traditional life style, the US President added I do believe that a woman who is denied education is denied equalityAnd that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls, and to help young women pursue employment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams. The President also announced an initiative with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio.//////A front-page report from New York on the large numbers of corrupt officials netted by the police for corruption in New Jersey USA was published in a local daily on 25 July. Is this a new manifestation of the principles of free enterprise? What was however really surprising was the inclusion of five Rabbis (Jewish priest) among the 44 people arrested! Here we have priests, who are considered to be pious and supposed to teach us about good and right living with high moral values, joining the ranks of the corrupt! This only demonstrates what the lust and lure for the lucre can lead to!//////It appears that the Bangladesh government is going about it the wrong way. India and Myanmar are being blamed for submitting their maritime boundary limitations to the UN which detract from Bangladesh's fair share of the resources. Did India or Myanmar consult Bangladesh and have Bangladesh's agreement to delimit such boundary and send it to the UN? Obviously not. So why is Bangladesh so eager to submit its boundary limitations after India and Myanmar agree to it?//////A proverb goes ---- even a mad man can choose the things which are better for him. It seems we are worse than lunatics. Yes, I am talking about our maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. We know that we have a vast area in this adjoining sea as per international rules. But our two neighbouring countries India and Myanmar want to have a more than fair share of the Bay. They have already filed their claims to the UN. But we are still doing nothing. Some months back, Myanmar tried to install some heavy machinery in our territorial waters to extract oil, gas etc. India often sends their naval vessels into our territory.//////It is estimated that two million people in Metropolitan Dhaka belong to the so called middle-income group. They are facing trouble while commuting in the city. Private car is out of their reach. Taxi-cab service is inadequate and also too costly for them. When a family likes to join in a marriage ceremony, it needs a low cost vehicle to go to a community centre. When a patient is to be shifted to a hospital, an affordable baby taxi is needed. If a family wants to go to shopping to celebrate a festival, a baby-taxi is required. To appear in a public examination hall, a student needs transport service of a baby-taxi. It is the reality. //////Results of the HSC exams have recently been published. We are happy to see the lovely faces of our next generation who have done so well. But the smiling faces will become gloomy very soon, we easily understand, when the dates of admission tests will be announced in different higher educational institutions. They have to run from post to pillar in a very restless manner during this period. The guardians and applicants take it as normal as they know the reality of our country. But the problem arises when the authorities declare that the admission tests will be held on the same day in different universities. //////Mr Kajal's letter on our cricket is both inspired and inspiring. From Kolkata he shared the joy of our cricket team's triumph in West Indies.//////The DMP commissioner was right to blame DCC and Rajuk for the nagging traffic congestion in the city. If you look around Gulistan which is abutted by DCC and Rajuk offices, you'll find almost all the markets owned by DCC without any space for even a single car. The building designs must have parking spaces with a specified calculation. But unfortunately all the DCC markets- parking spaces have been converted into underground shops forcing the cars to be parked outside. DCC is realizing the rents from these illegal underground shops and the officials concerned undoubtedly got 'something' into their pockets. We don't have any other watchdogs to oversee this abject violation of laws by the people who are entrusted with the responsibilities to enforce it!
