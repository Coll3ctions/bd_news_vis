When waves of passion thudded at his heart, he did not feel like begging. He did not beg at the entrance to the mosque any more, for the faithful who came out after prayers, wearing pyjamas and loose shirts and donning skullcaps, hardly went beyond a penny or two; and how could they? The way the beggars swarmed the place, it was difficult to give more, he told himself, as he, after finding a little space near the supermarket, gripped his crutch. Not that he would not be able to walk without it, but he used the crutch nonetheless, which made him look even more forlorn. Ashamed he felt though to beg before the girls who come here to shop; he narrowed his small eyes to fend off such feelings. But when some of them sifted through their purse to fish out a taka or two, Aman's close-set eyes refused to obey him. Trust them, these girls! And the way they dress! Things that you craved for would brush past you; you would be left with this ball of flame in your body; what you would do with this was solely up to you. Red hot he was with desire, but he did not know in what lake he would take a dip to douse this flame. //////Ah, beautiful autumn has stepped in, setting my gypsy blood astir. I always think that there is a part of me that wants to roam around the world like a gypsy. And at times like this, when the season is changing to maddening autumn, I feel like staying out with nature. I don't want to miss out on the thrill that the changing season holds. For me this is life, this is exhilaration. I can picture myself growing wings so that I can travel with the fleecy white clouds that autumn brings. I would float over the vales and hills. I would float over the swaying white 'kash' flowers and I would float with the clouds that bring in sudden drizzles in this season. The gypsy in me wants to rest beneath the twinkling stars at night. I will ride the white cotton-like clouds that hide the moon. Home, office and materialistic wants --- all seem to be a part of me that for the time being is left far behind. My thoughts are lost to autumn and all that it beholds, my soul sings to autumn.//////He darts into the washroom, splashes water on his face; sprays as much air freshener as has been left in the bottle. Lemon-fragrant air freshener. He throws up in the commode; flashes it hastily. He is whining like a little girl. Warm droplets are streaming down his cheeks. He can't breathe. He rubs his hands with the washing foam. The smell of the liquid soap mingled with the lemon-fragrant air freshener lets out a totally different smellnow that new smell inundates the white tiled washroom. It is similar to the smell of burnt flesh. //////Conclusions transform like night to day//////In recent years, the field of cardiology (which deals with heart diseases) has been developed remarkably in Bangladesh with the establishment of high tech private and specialised cardiac hospitals.

Success of the commanders' rests broadly on the uninterrupted functioning of the chain of command as it is stratified into various levels of authority.

Experience in this regard at home since 1975 provides testimony in favour of the assertion made above. //////Six weeks after the start of Pakistan's devastating floods, waters pouring into a lake in southern Pakistan are threatening several towns and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee, officials said on 13th September.//////The Swiss defence industry says restrictive export laws introduced two years ago have put it at a disadvantage compared to manufacturers in other European countries.
