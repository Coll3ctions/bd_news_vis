It was through his inspiration that this nation emerged into freedom and took its place on the global stage. In Bangabandhu was personified the most articulate spokesperson of Bengali aspirations, the most visible and vibrant face this nation could present to the world.//////Yet another tragic road accident! This time among the five dead in one accident on the Dhaka-Aricha highway were two iconic figures, Tareque Masud and Mishuk Munier. Each in his own field, and in his own way, has etched a place in the heart of the nation.

We, the helpless commuters, know this but cannot do anything against it. //////Same old cry - purchase all types of jute in fair price! It is learnt that the BJMC's jute mill agencies are purchasing only the best quality jute fibers from the farmers which have been grown in limited quantity. It may be mentioned here that the production of jute has increased significantly and with the effective extension activities of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) farmers are again getting interested to grow jute, our Golden Fibre. As reported in the press quoting jute growers, last year all types of jute fibre were purchased by BJMC's purchasing agencies and prices for different types of jute fibre were fixed by the authorities. Under the present situation, jute farmers are urging the agencies to purchase all qualities of jute fibre so that they may not have to sustain a total financial loss.//////Whenever the word 'traffic police' comes in our mind we encounter words like 'bribe' and 'corruption', totally neglecting the fact that if the traffic polices had not been there, our traffic system would've gone haywire much earlier! We see them very often standing with only an umbrella, fully devoted to their job, but who cares? Although they work all day standing, not even bothering if it's raining or if it's too much hot, to free vehicles from jams and accidents, yet they are paid a meagre amount of salary with which running life in this world is very hard! //////No eviction of hawkers from Dhaka city during the holy month of Ramadan, said our communications minister.

Adulteration of food does not ultimately pay. Panicked by the recent reports of formalined fish, food and fruits and skyrocketing price of essentials, I, like others, have already cut on consumption of food well ahead of the commerce minister's 'directive' about eating less. //////According to different reports and surveys, in most of the cases the inefficient or fake drivers are responsible for road accidents. I came to know a different thing while talking to a driver in Dhaka. The driver said, I am a skilled driver but I failed to obtain the driving license after my third attempt because I didn't give bribe to the BRTA (Bangladesh Road and Transport Authority) people, whereas unskilled drivers are buying driving licenses. He also added that we have shortage of skilled drivers and unskilled drivers are driving throughout the city. If this is the real picture, then how come our roads will be safe from accidents, as the ghost is in the mustard? The government should take a hard line to curb corruption in all sectors like transport, electricity etc.//////We are actually tired talking about road accidents. Each day when we go out of the house or traveling somewhere we are not sure if we can really make it. We know death is in the hands of Almighty, still we can be careful and our drivers should be sympathetic to the people on the streets and other vehicles on the highways.//////The greatest prophet of all times Muhammad (SM) has said, "A smile to your brother is a charity".

On this day, the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed along with his family members save two by military adventurers abetted by self-seeking, unconscionable politicians. This tragic event was patently the precursor to usurpation of power through backdoor, overthrowing constitutional government. Subsequently, we had to weather a spell of extra constitutional ambition in the space of the last 40 years of our independence. It was a distortion in the evolution of constitutional norms and practices for a nascent democratic polity like ours. The gory event enacted on that fateful morning at 32 Dhanmondi traumatized the entire nation beyond measure. It left a deep scar in its psyche that will never be blotted out from memory.//////
