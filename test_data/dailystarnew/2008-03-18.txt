But our selectors went for that adventure!! This is because of their inefficiency. And they should pay for it. They should resign admitting their guilt & inefficiency. They forced many of the ODI players to play Test cricket. This is the main cause of our shameful failure in Test cricket in the recent past. If Javed Omar Belim Golla, Khaled Mashud Pilot, Rajin Saleh and Aloke Kapali were to play in the first Test against South Africa, the story could have been different. //////On 11-03-2008, the United States released its State Department's 2007 Human Rights Report on Asia where North Korea and Myanmar have been ranked the world's worst violators of human rights and condemned other Asian countries, including Bangladesh for alleged human rights abuses.
