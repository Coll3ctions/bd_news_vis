Almighty Allah says in Holy Quran the first sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Mecca, a blessed place, a guidance to the people wherein are plain memorials (of Allah's guidance); the place where Abraham (Ibrahim) stood to pray; and whosoever enters it is safe. And pilgrimage to the house is duty unto Allah for mankind, for him who can find a way thither. As for him who disbelieves (let him know that) Allah is independent of (all) creatures. Many Muslims are united this day but it is sad that this unity disappears when the rituals of Hajj are over. Muslim community is going through the toughest of times and we must be united. Through your daily I ask all my Muslim brothers and sisters to stay united and to save our peaceful religion, Islam, as we commemorate the teachings of Hajj. Eid Mubarak to all of you.//////The composer of this song, Dr. Bhupen Hazarika died on 5 November 2011 at the age of 86. He was not only the greatest cultural icon of Assam, but also the region's biggest cultural ambassador. His music echoed beyond borders. He was a multifaceted genius. He was at the same time a poet, a music composer, a singer, an actor, a journalist, an author and a film-maker of the very highest order. It is said that he wrote and composed over 1,000 songs. //////As most of the people of our country suffer from the worst of all diseases, 'poverty', they never get the chance to enjoy and share the joy of Eid. As the elders were busy discussing their stories of how the haggling for purchasing their sacrificial animals at the cattle market went, many street kids, even on the day of Eid were begging meat from door to door. //////Wave of changes started from Algeria that jolted most of the parts of Middle East and African countries. Popular upheaval against tyranny is the great gift of this century. Change was inevitable but all the changes were not expected by America and the Western countries, although they are very rhetorical about these changes. Toppling down of Egyptian tyrant was a great blow to Israel and USA. Unpopular Mobarak regime maintained diplomatic relation with Israel that was the cause of smouldering discontent in Egypt and the Arab World. Handing over power from tyrant to military regime is a new development in Egypt. There are, however, uncertainties about over the transition of power and the covert and overt diplomatic manoeuvres by Western countries. A cloud is hovering over the sky of Libya so far as the transition of power and the controlling of its oil resources are concerned. Because, the battle for Libya may turn out to be the battle for grabbing its oil by the USA and its allies. It depends on the new leadership of Middle East to fulfill the dream of the people to establish democracy without the interference of USA, Israel and Europe.//////Permanent members of the Security Council are in fact, the rulers of the world! They are the rulers and it seems that the rest of the world is destined to be ruled by them! They have the veto powers which provide them with immunity from all their wrongdoings and injustices caused to other nations. A permanent member uses its veto to foil any move or proposal that goes against its interest, even if it is supported by all other member countries of the UN. While these elite members criticize, accuse and impose sanctions against others on flimsy grounds, they themselves smash any such move against their will or interest with the hammer called veto. Due to their intransigence and machinations, many of the world's major problems have been remaining unresolved for decades. The latest instance is the case of Palestine. Though Palestine's just bid for statehood enjoys the support of overwhelming majority of nations, the US is threatening to thwart such a move by using veto in the UN Security Council (UNSC).//////We have become so much dependent on so many things for living that we have become almost oblivious of the essential elements of life, which we get for free and without which we perhaps could not live for a few seconds even. The modern world has got us preoccupied in such a manner that we have almost forgotten about the very essential elements of survival for which we do not have to pay anything. But then there is a saying "nothing comes free." So what does this imply? It is that everything has a price and that which we are getting for free has got a price too.//////It was pathetic to see horijon families at Nandigram in Bogra are being evicted from their colonies without any prior warnings. These poor and socially oppressed people have been living there for more than forty years and now they have no place to go but to sleep under the bare wintry sky. I find this act very callous on the part of the local government who has committed a grave injustice to these people. Evicting these families right in the middle of Diwali and Kali puja ceremonies is obscene and inhuman. I find it pretty odd that no Bangladeshi news media have taken up this issue. The reason could be that these poor people are so marginalized in our society that nobody really cares whether they could make it to the next day or not. //////The lane from Nabisco (Tejgaon) to Farmgate is an important lane used by thousands of pedestrians everyday. But it remained uncared for, unnoticed and overlooked by the Dhaka City Corporation for decades. This is the only lane connecting Farmgate. The lane is very narrow and is very difficult for the movement of car. Pedestrians, too, find it difficult to use. The two sides of the lane are occupied illegally and in an unauthorized manner by some shopkeepers thereby blocking and narrowing the lane. This creates jam, congestion and kills valuable time and causes unbearable hardships to its users. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina needs to be judicious and careful about extending cooperation to India on Indian terms without resolutely standing for safeguarding the national interests of Bangladesh. In this connection, the role of Lendup Dorje of Sikkim, who played a major part in making Sikkim a province of India through massive manipulations by India, should be borne in mind. //////Pakistan pressed for the adoption of a visa-free system among the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) countries.//////India and Pakistan yesterday started a new drive to heal the wounded, accident-prone ties, with Manmohan Singh terming his counterpart as a 'man of peace' which was slammed by BJP as ridiculous.//////Pakistan on Wednesday assured India it will not backtrack on its decision to grant the most favoured nation (MFN) status to its South Asian arch-rival, a report said.//////A joint security plan involving the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), Sri Lanka's Special Task Force (STF) and Indian Navy were placed in and around the Saarc summit venue in Addu.//////The UN envoy to Yemen returned to Sanaa yesterday to revive efforts aimed at resolving the political turmoil rocking the impoverished country for nearly a year, state news agency Saba reported.//////Thousands of Chinese couples are reportedly planning to get married today, dubbed "singles' day" in China because the date is made up entirely of the number one.//////Greece's new leader Lucas Papademos steeled his country for tough times ahead yesterday, as he assured Greeks of the need for the euro after being named interim prime minister to lead a crisis government.//////Embattled Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra yesterday vowed to stay on and fight the country's deadly flood crisis despite criticism of her handling of the disaster.//////Western aid agencies in Pakistan warned yesterday they might have to halt flood relief efforts in the cash-strapped country because of funding shortfalls.//////At least 20 workers were killed and another 23 were trapped underground after a blast at a mine in China yesterday, state media said, in the latest disaster to hit the country's vast mining industry.//////The United States believes that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are in safe hands, a State Department spokesman said Wednesday, rebutting a report that Islamabad's atomic arsenal was vulnerable to theft.//////Iran "will respond with full force" to any attack -- or even any threat of military action -- the country's supreme leader said yesterday, after Israel warned the world must act to prevent Tehran getting nuclear weapons.//////James Murdoch rejected allegations yesterday that he was a "mafia boss" and told British lawmakers he had not misled them about the extent of his knowledge of phone-hacking at the News of the World.//////Hundreds of rescuers hunted for survivors yesterday after an earthquake in eastern Turkey killed seven people, toppled buildings and sowed panic less than three weeks after a massive deadly quake in the same area.//////Demanding death for "terrorist" Ajmal Kasab, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik yesterday said the proposed visit of a Judicial Commission to India will help quicken the trial of 26/11 accused in his country. //////Afghan President Hamid Karzai attempted to ease tensions with Pakistan yesterday, asserting that a strategic partnership with India and talks for a similar deal with the United States do not threaten his country's neighbors.//////China opened a full diplomatic mission in the Maldives Tuesday, heading South Asian summit in the Indian Ocean archipelago, an official said.//////Former President of Maldives Maumoon Abdul Gayoom stressed that the regional club attained key milestones over the years such as the social charter, the Dhaka declaration on climate change, Saarc convention for the promotion of child welfare and Safta.//////The promoters had not promised too much on the invitation card: 'Beijing Night', held on Wednesday evening by the Beijing Municipal People's Government and Embassy of the People's Republic of China, in association with Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, was indeed a grand show. It started in the foyer: On big screens, pictures of Beijing were shown, accompanied by melodic Chinese music. The entrance and the theatre hall were decorated with red Chinese lanterns and hundreds of blossoms. The turnout at this show was so huge that not all could be seated. We didn't expect so many people to come, an attendant said. //////I was 21 years old and studying for my masters at Carleton University, Canada. I spotted an ad in the tunnel of my university: Bhupen Hazarika, the famous singer, was going to sing in Ottawa! I looked at the date; it was that very day. I decided I would go. I had no time to go home for a change and rushed to the venue undaunted by the bitter cold of the month of November in Canada. The venue was deserted, seemed as if the organisers did not have enough time to campaign and advertise for this programme. For me, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise.//////Nasiruddin Yousuff's Liberation War saga, Guerrilla, will participate in three major Indian film festivals.

Written by Kamrul Ahsan, the play has been directed by noted actor Humayun Faridee.//////However much the planet Earth may revolve on its axis in two days, it was enough time for our contentious politics to go from one extreme to another. One day a female candidate won a bitterly contested mayoral election by a landslide, even after her party had dropped her like a hot potato to endorse a notorious rival. Next day came the complete reversal. An assassin's bullet cut short the life of another mayor who was immensely popular amongst his people. In just two days, the power of the people went from invincibility to invisibility. Like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, it wobbled.//////Vettel is the Champ, India the Winner," screamed the newspaper headlines reporting on the first-ever round of the Formula One (F1) motor-racing championship held India.
