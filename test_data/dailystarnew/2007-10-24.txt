dealings at DCC have been rife. Many have been the occasions when wrongdoing at the corporation came under the spotlight, especially through the media. Not that it has helped so far. In fact, the corporation has always remained under a cloud not only because of the corruption in it but also because of its clear failure to ensure good and purposeful services to citizens. Can we expect some dramatic improvement now that the Task Force is delving into DCC affairs?//////We have mixed reaction to ex-chairman, National Board of Revenue, Badiur Rahman's dramatic response to his being transferred out of NBR to Ministry of Food and Disaster Management as its secretary. Rather than accepting the new posting order which he thought was unceremonious as he was not given an inkling of what was to come, a courtesy deserved by a senior officer, he has sought voluntary retirement on crossing the 25 years of service threshold.//////When a magistrate, lately hailed for the zealous manner in which he has pursued food related crime, suddenly expresses his readiness to be jailed or hanged, you are left mystified. And you ask yourself if everyone around you is losing control over his own sentiments. Or could it be that it is you who have been falling behind in all this demonstration of desperation, typified by those ready to reveal their readiness to sacrifice their lives on the altar of something that does not really mean anything? //////The actions of the administration cadre, opposing separation of the judiciary days before the November 1 implementation day, should be seen as a barefaced example of people who want to live in the pre-1/11 days of Bangladesh. "We cannot push the country towards anarchy in the name of independence of the judiciary," Magistrate Rokon-Ud-Doula said, as if the people already forgot the pre-1/11 anarchic days. His argument that it was not possible to implement a meaningful separation of the judiciary before 2021 is sheer nonsense. //////The cards are on the table; the world is warming up to the most brutal

report//////The main problems of population migration that arose from the independence of the Indian sub-continent from the British Rule was not the creation of India and Pakistan as such. Jinnah wanted partition of the country into Pakistan and India, mainly on religious grounds, but he also argued fiercely with Mountbatten and his advisers (I read in one of Mountbatten's biographies that the argument at the final stages of independence went through a whole night), against partition of the provinces of Bengal and Punjab and demanded that these two Muslim majority provinces which had existed for many years with their democratic provincial legislatures and governments must remain in tact and be allocated to Pakistan. Mountbatten was adamant that if religion was the basis to divide the country as a whole then the same principle must be applied to these provinces as well.//////Thanks to Zarina Rahman of Dhaka for drawing attention of everybody concerned to the consequences of using toxic chemicals in fruits through her letter of October 19, 2007.//////While responding to reporters' questions at the Bangladesh High Commission in London a few days ago, General Moeen U Ahmed made it clear, as he did previously on many occasions, that he has no desire to become president.//////Long time ago, US President Theodore Roosevelt said, "All those blatant sham reformers, in the name of new morality, preach the old, old vice and self-indulgence which rotted out first, the moral fibre, and then even the external greatness of Greece and Rome." //////This is with reference to the recent letters on Mr. K. M. Shehabuddin's book "There and Back Again : A Diplomat's Tale (University Press Ltd., Dhaka, 2005)" by the former state minister/adviser of Khaleda-Nizami's government - Mr. Reaz Rahman (September 24, 2007), Mr. Rezaul Karim (October 01, 2007), Mr. Mohiuddin Ahmed (October 05, 2007) and two earlier book reviews by Syed Badrul Ahsan (September 08, 2007) and Mr. Muhammad Zamir (January 17, 2006).//////Australia, heading for a Presidential poll next month, has been a trusted ally of US-led terror wars in Middle East that saw the fall of Afghanistan and Iraq. John Howard, the Australian prime minister and Liberal Party leader, has called a federal election for November 24. Howard, 68, has been in power for 11 years, but is lagging behind Kevin Rudd, his younger Labour opponent, in opinion polls. Among the issues the election will determine are the future of Australia's military contribution in Iraq and its stance on climate change. Labour has promised to withdraw troops from Iraq and sign the Kyoto climate pact, but, generally speaking, the election will also be fought and won on domestic issues. Rudd, 50, has promised sweeping reforms to health and education as well as an overhaul of controversial labour laws introduced by Howard. //////Recently BTV started showing a feature on the bad effects of consuming Indian sugar which is available in our local market. Indian sugar contains ingredients like hydrogen peroxide H2O2 which can cause severe damage to health.//////Regarding the 'independence' of India and Pakistan, I have to mention that 'undivided' India or Bharat was always independent and had outstanding economic, academic and cultural excellence until the 'British traders' arrived. After the British finished 'trading and ruling' the foundation was laid not for 2 but 3 countries: India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Unfortunately, B'desh became the youngest child abandoned at birth by a large family although once Bengal was one of the richest regions on earth. Today the European colonialists, once racing to grab the Indian resources, are united under 'EU'. But there is also a mighty shine fiercely emerging from the united South Asian platform under 'Saarc'. //////It is known that the scapegrace will never listen to moral lectures. If proper justice is ensured and all possible loopholes are sealed, the members of society would not have thought of it. But unfortunately so far as it is known, nobody dared to take proper actions against the unscrupulous vicious circles existing in the safe zone except little eyewash. //////It has been noticed that due to the failure of the authorities to enforce any law , public respect for its compliance is eroding fast. People do not seem to show any respect for any law as they can get away with the violation easily. For example, an anti-smoking law was promulgated long ago prohibiting public smoking. But has it been implemented? the answer is a big NO. Because there is no authority to implement this law. Recently, horn free zones were declared for some particular streets and places in the city. But the drivers of the vehicles are not showing any respect for the law and there is no one to enforce it. As a result, hooting is rampant in those restricted areas. The traffic authorities now have come up with another directive prohibiting use of mobile phone or ear phone while driving. But as usual this directive is also totally ignored in the absence of any attempt to enforce its implementation.//////The government promptly set up a one-man judicial inquiry commission to look into the DU incident. Since the commission has started its function, we have seen sporadic comments from the witnesses in print and electronic media reports. //////I just finished reading the article 'Headless horseman?' by Shahnoor Wahid on the DS issue of 18tOctober, 2007. I must first congratulate the writer for brilliantly portraying the prevailing truth in politics of Bangladesh. His last comments on questioning the three leaders to speak on behalf of Bangladesh are worth noting. In spite of 1/11, the politicians are simply playing the blame game and honestly trying to show their innocence for the fear of being booked by the ACC or some governmental agency. Truly, it is nonsensical to line up behind these people who had marauded and defrauded the nation for so long and in such unceremonious way that I am revisited by a spine chilling specter of pre 1/11 days and my blood pressure shoots up. //////An illuminating front page report on the matter was published in a local English daily after Eid. The report is a proof of bad habits leading towards criminality, even in so-called high society! It is astonishing to even think of "Phensidyl mixed Semai"; an unholy concoction, even on a holy day like Eid.//////There was no government that came to power with such popularity as the current caretaker government did. But their popularity is now at the lowest ebb. Because they have deviated from their prime assignments.//////It was a delightful morning for me to see the coverage and the picture of three Chiefs of Armed forces, the President and the Chief Adviser paying tribute to our father of the nation on the 32nd anniversary of the assassination of Bangabandhu. Bangabandhu and Bangladesh are synonymous. General Moeen and his colleagues have displayed maturity and good sense. Let us not disgrace the father of the nation anymore. During the time when Awami League was in power Bangabandhu's image was restored to some extent. //////Change of NBR chairman is a routine function . But it is news since people feel that the immediate past chairman was talking too much, which was beyond the normal discipline of a bureaucrat. //////Since January 2007, this caretaker government has only been doing one single thing: cracking down on the politicians. They are only focused on arresting the corrupt politicians and business people. It is a good thing but after they came to power it is their only mission. They are not at all concerned about other major issues concrning the development of the country. The RAB and police are doing nothing to stop crimes. Prices of essential commodities are increasing day by day at an alarming rate. The entire nation is suffering from power failure. If electricity is not available 3--4 hours a day, then how will it be possible for business people to compete with the rest of the world?//////Mr. Nurul Huda's incisive observations on police management (Oct:20) present the pragmatic realities of facts as practiced in Bangladesh. The prime goal is "non-accounting cash flow". This prime goal covers everyone in the hierarchy; except a few, too few; honourable people; who therefore become misfits in the highly efficiently managed and well developed "cash flow" system.//////Turkey's foreign minister rejected any cease-fire by Kurdish rebels Tuesday as he met with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad to press them to crack down on the guerrillas.

Kibria, M.P., in a grenade attack in his Habiganj constituency on January 27, 2005. My nephew, Shah Manzur Huda, and three others were also killed in the attack. Like me, so many wives, mothers and children who have lost loved ones in grenade and bomb attacks still cry in anguish, with the forlorn hope of justice. So many families have been torn apart by these attacks. For these families there can never again be carefree laughter and joy -- the dark shadow of these brutal killings will haunt them for the rest of their lives, a constant source of sorrow and depression. The great shame is that they are even denied the scant consolation of knowing that the killers will be brought to justice.//////Potchitro or story telling through depicting images on canvas has always been a traditional form of art and entertainment. The trail goes a long way back to the Middle Ages when story telling was an important form of entertainment in Bengal. Poets told tales of gods, saints and the virtuous, of kings and queens, through their writings.
