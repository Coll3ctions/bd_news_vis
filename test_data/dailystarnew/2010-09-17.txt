According to the news item, vulture, an ecologically vital bird, helps stop germs from breaking out after it eats dead cattle and sheep. In their absence if some other animals like dogs and cats or any other birds eat the dead cattle, it opens the road to dangerous diseases like anthrax. Because they do not have the resistance power to kill the germ even after digestion. //////Recently, the government announced the new wages of the garment workers, though it has been rejected.

Today Barrack Obama could not say that the mission was accomplished and they are victorious. In the name of establishing democracy, the then US president Bush started the war against Iraq but his mission has failed miserably.//////Your Dinajpur correspondent's report of September 2 is disgusting reading. Is the 'madrassa' teacher(?) a man or a beast? He should be taken to police custody, and criminally prosecuted; and punished in an exemplary manner; to set an example.

The Daily Star deserves thanks for bringing the important issue to the knowledge of the citizens of the country so outspokenly. Outwardly, the arguments are partial and inadequate to describe the predicament of the incumbents. There are some posts of the republic which some people have to fulfil or serve either on pursuance or diktat of the concerned ministry like: Directors/Director Generals (DG) of he Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Deputy Commissioners (DC), Divisional Commissioners, Private Secretaries (PS) to the Ministers or top brass of any government etc. Generally, bureaucrats of capability, knowledge, honesty and repute are chosen or selected for those positions. Though sometimes partisan people also get those honourable positions, thanks to their political tilt, but in most cases honesty, reputation and efficiency are the main considerations for these postings. //////During daytime hundreds of overloaded trucks enter Sylhet city which make the lives of commuters hazardous. //////The Planning Commission's extension by two more years of the project implementation time for shifting the hazardous tannery industries outside the capital city exposes the government's wanton disregard for public health. This decision shows the government's negligence to ensuring affordable health service to poor and rural people. The NGOs and the private clinics are capitalizing on the poor health services in the public hospitals that suffer a lot from shortage of doctor. The doctors find no time to attend the rural health centres as they are busy making money working in the private clinics in the upazila towns. But who is there to monitor them? Heath being one of the major human rights, the government cannot look the other way while the teeming millions wallow in ailments.//////We lost Diana in 1996. This loss can never be compensated for. Her death got massive media coverage which raised several questions. Some people say that to escape the journalists, her car faced the accident. If so, journalists must be more tolerant in their attitude towards the celebrities. It is regrettable that some people were unduly interested in her personal life.//////Some companies by dint of quality of their products and service prove themselves qualified and acceptable to all concerned and become branded. In this way they earn confidence of the people. If the products of the companies fail to give desired results it goes against the name of the company and earns bad name. As for example GE, Siemens, ABB etc. Likewise educational institutions also get branded. Students coming out of these branded institutions are obviously good and subsequently are also found good while performing in their respective fields. As for example, Dhaka University, BUET etc. The branded companies further upgrade their products and the institution takes pride in their students when they are found performing as per expectation. When they fail the companies and the institutions are blamed for their bad performance. After getting the feedback they try to correct themselves to improve the quality of their products so as to maintain the quality as before or better. //////Some time back during my stay in Dhaka I happened to witness one of such programmes on Diganta TV channel. The interviewee was a veteran politician-- A.S.M.A. Rab. //////With respect to Prime Minister Tony Blair's new memoir "A Journey" I would like to offer the following comments. //////I could not agree with Ahrar Ahmad as to his contention of "judicial over-reach", published in The Daily Star on September 04, 2010. Constitutionally, the Supreme Court has authority to interpret or declare any law unconstitutional, if it so appears. Mr Ahmad may minutely go through the verdicts regarding 5th and 7th amendments. The Court has not passed any law. The parliamentary commission has already started to work towards re-writing the constitution as per the judgments. Yes, it's parliament which enacts law or amends constitution, but the Apex Court has the inherent authority to interpret or correct the same in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, as it is also in the United States and other democratic countries.//////In his letter of August 16 Mr. Ali wrote that the billion dollar loan provided by India's Exim Bank is on the key condition that 85% of all commodities purchased through the loan money will have to be from India. This means that 85% of the billion dollar, i.e. 850 million dollars, will go back to India. I quote from the letter "Repayment of a billion dollar loan will severely deplete our foreign reserves. Bangladesh could've spent the billion dollars internally to develop its infrastructure, which would have positive effects on the local economy, instead of spending 850 million dollars in India." If it is so, I must say that by this so called loan of friendship, India is simply strengthening its market in Bangladesh.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ended yesterday three days of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders with no visible sign of progress on breaking a deadlock over building in West Bank settlements.//////Jordan and the Palestinians have turned the page on the bloody clashes of "Black September" that kicked off exactly 40 years ago on Friday but fears still remain in the absence of regional peace.//////Pope Benedict XVI, beginning a controversial state visit to Britain, acknowledged yesterday that the Catholic Church failed to act decisively or quickly enough to deal with priests who rape and molest children and said the church's top priority now was to help the victims.//////BP's ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be permanently sealed by Sunday.//////North Korea has proposed holding military talks with South Korea to discuss disputes, the South's defence ministry said yesterday, in another apparent peace overture from Pyongyang.//////The White House on Wednesday sought to exploit an intra-party Republican "squabble" posing "stark choices" for voters, following big nominating election wins by conservative Tea Party candidates.//////Tropical Storm Karl dumped heavy rains on the Yucatan Peninsula yesterday as it moved toward the Gulf of Mexico, where it was expected to pick up steam and become a hurricane threatening Mexico's central coast by the weekend.//////Controversy over France's expulsion of Roma Gypsies yesterday engulfed a European Union summit originally slated to boost the bloc's profile on the world scene.//////A wave of disappointment swept across curfewed Indian Kashmir Thursday after no concrete results emerged out of a government meeting aimed at ending spiralling protests.//////The world will only be able to fund around 25 percent of the tens of billions of dollars needed to rebuild Pakistan after the floods, and its government will have to make up the shortfall, the U.S. envoy to the country warned yesterday.//////UN Secretary General Ban //////The Taliban threatened yesterday to attack polling stations during Afghanistan's parliamentary election as Nato and Afghan troops mounted a massive security operation to protect the vote.//////Though the UN Security Council unanimously agreed to continue its assistance in Nepal's peace process for four more months, the government yesterday criticised the reports tabled by UN chief Ban Ki-moon and his representative in Nepal, Karin Landgren, as unbalanced and not treating Nepal as a sovereign country.//////Noted artist Nitun Kundu's fourth death anniversary was observed on September 15.
