It's not totally unheard of. But unusual, isn't it? It is a common phenomenon that roosters do crow at dawn and that also is heard mostly in the villages. The city has lost its charm of any natural music. How about a cuckoo cooing in the hot sultry summer afternoon? That too goes for a seasonal imbalance, as cuckoos do sing, but only in spring. How about the croaking of the toads or the hooting of the bats...these all have a discordant and eerily musical effect, creating uneasiness, doesn't it?//////We are six women who arrive exactly at 7 pm to claim our reserved table at Clyde's in Georgetown, Washington DC. Tonight is Friday night and that is when we six ladies meet for our weekly dinner which I am in charge of for this month. We all take turns to avoid the raucous at the end of the dinner when the waiter brings the check. I, of course, researched all the top restaurants beforehand for I did not want to disappoint my club members. We are all singles in our group. My fellow club members nod in approval of my very fine choice and it has a cosmopolitan feel to it. The restaurant tonight also complements us as a group. We are a variety. We consist of a Bangladeshi, a Japanese, a South American, an Arab, an Indian and a Latin American. We are between the ages of 42 - 49 and still consider ourselves young. We are a group who are ridiculously wealthy and live a luxurious life in Washington DC. None of us seem to mind that we inherited our wealth by various means; through multiple divorces, huge life insurance money after the death of a spouse and, of course, family inheritance.//////She squats on a grassy mound by the river//////she crossed seventy years ago,//////left her family behind, a bride of fifteen hed bent, //////shoulders slouched, the lazy patterns of silk and gold //////threads of her wedding sari heavy on her shoulders.//////Heart diseases or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the worlds largest killers, claiming more than17.2 million lives a year.

During the elections domestic issues and the call for change captivated the attention of the voters. Foreign affairs did not figure prominently in luring voters to the DJP. However, things are changing in Tokyo. Although the DJP must satisfy the voters on a range of economic issues, foreign affairs is currently causing more attention both in Japan and outside. It seems significant changes are in the offing there in the way the DJP conducts its foreign relations, particularly with the United States. The new Foreign Minister of Japan Katsuya Okada is bringing all the attention both by his personality and the issues he is prioritizing for the new DJP Government in foreign affairs. //////ON 17th September, President Barack Obama took a bold decision in scrapping the Bush-era plan for a missile shield to defend Eastern Europe. Obama promised a redesigned defensive system, saying it would be cheaper, quicker and more effective against the threat from Iranian missiles. The Bush-era plan had complicated ties with Russia, which objected to where the shield installations would be built. Anticipating criticism from the right that Obama was weakening America's security, he said repeatedly that this decision would provide more - not less - protection.//////ON assuming office, President Barack Obama spoke of 'resetting buttons' of America's relations with Russia. Henry Kissinger's article which appeared on 26 February 2009 in the Washington Post reaffirmed a shift in thinking on Russia in the context of the Afghan war. Kissinger argues that the US cannot withdraw from Afghanistan as the jihadist victory there will have ominous consequences for the stability of the entire region. Nor can it win the war by the methods employed so far. He suggests that the Afghan issue be tackled through international effort, involving all of Afghanistan's neighbours, India and permanent members of the UNSC and not by unilateral US effort. Owing to geographical reasons, he termed cooperation with Russia and Pakistan as crucial and added that Washington had to choose between a partnership or adversarial relations with Russia. //////Rare is the politician who has been part of nearly every government in Bangladesh. And in this rarity Moudud Ahmed certainly holds prominent space. His career took off in the late 1960s, when as a young lawyer just back from London, he found himself drawn to the Agartala Conspiracy Case as part of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's defence team. In subsequent years, at least for a while, he remained close to the man who would make history as Bangabandhu and come to be revered as the father of Bangladesh. But Moudud Ahmed was never part of the Awami League government and indeed soon discovered, to his dismay, that the very principles of democracy and human liberty he had been waging battle for were being put at risk by the very politicians who had led Bengalis to freedom from Pakistan in 1971. Mujib was irate at discovering that Moudud had come to the legal defence of leftwing political elements who, in the former's view, were subversives intent on undermining the state. //////It was 1958 and Landon, a seventeen-year old boy, was growing up with the usual ups and downs that growing years hold. In his hometown, in Beaufort, North California, Landon had already dated a girl or two. The last person he had expected to enter his life was Jamie Sullivan, daughter of the town's Baptist minister, Hegbert. Jamie was seventeen and went round with a Bible in her hand. She seemed to be perfectly content to live her life set away from others. When others were having parties she was going round orphanages. When others were enjoying baseball games she was out rescuing hurt animals. Yet by a streak of chance Landon found himself very much involved with this girl, a girl whom all other friends labeled as strange. //////If Charles Dickens had visited Morocco, he might have written Secret Son, the tortured story of the twenty-year separation of a father and his son, set to the relevant social issues of Morocco today: young people with diminished expectations; class, coincidence, intrigue, and slum life. Any connections to the great Victorian novelist end there. Moreover, I was almost always more aware of the social and political issues confronting Laila Lalami's characters than their humanity.//////Apart from a preservation of 2,169 films in its vaults and 3,053 books, 14,575 photographs, 6,677 posters, 1,986 screenplays, 9,950 film journals and other film related objects and documents in its library, Bangladesh Film Archive (BFA) has set a new record for itself by publishing an annual journal focusing on film and film-related issues. //////
