I always feel sad when I remember this fact. My six-year stint (1975-81) as a student of the Department of English (two years more because of the session jams due to our war of independence) of the University of Dhaka was otherwise the happiest period of my life. Professor Murshid was in Europe as our Ambassador to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia and then the Assistant Secretary General of the Commonwealth during that period.

As the 20th century showed us, ideologies -- whether communism, fascism or humanism -- matter and matter greatly.////// is, from a critical standpoint, a compendium of almost all facets of human nature, ranging from extreme cruelty to supreme acts of kindness (at times from unexpected quarters), with avarice, lust, selfishness, betrayal, sympathy, empathy, fatalism, and wily thinking thrown in between.

Subsequently, with Niaz Zaman's deft translation, UPL has published the book in English. The expected larger readership will get to know about the privations suffered by Bengali women during the war, and, importantly, for years after Bangladesh had become a sovereign independent nation-state.////// The story of ////// is an account of unexpected happenings in the lives of two small boys on the outskirts of Memphis, USA. It's a tale of a week's events and yet its breathtaking plot and the vivid portrayal of the characters are left for the reader to recall and savour for days to come. Eleven-year old Mark Sway and his brother Rick are in the woods to take a puff of forbidden cigarette when a black car pulls into a small clearing. Mark, like all curious boys, waits to see what is happening. By sheer coincidence the brothers witness the occupant of the car, the famous lawyer Romney, shooting himself.
