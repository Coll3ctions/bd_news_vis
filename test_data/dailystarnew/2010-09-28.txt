But the thing, what can be extracted, common from all these terms is the genetic sequence change or mutations over time. These alterations do matter a lot and these account for many of our interactions. MHC genes (Major Histocompatibility Complex), a cluster of genes that plays a major role in the immune system, are a very good target for accounting the genetic diversity. Genetic diversity has been linked to fitness and reproductive success in general, and genetic diversity within the MHCs has been linked to immunocompetence and mate preferences. Hanne C. Lie et al; has performed a study published online in October 2008 issue of Evolution. They have photographed and genotyped 160 participants using microsatellite markers, one class of repeating sequences in DNA, situated within and outside the MHC, and calculated genetic diversity and found MHC heterozygosity, different gene sequences responsible for the same trait, is associated with male attractiveness and specifically facial averageness, with averageness mediating the MHC-attractiveness relationship.

The placebo effect, for example, demonstrates that people can at times cause a relief in medical symptoms or suffering by believing the cures to be effective - whether they actually are or not.

It is a term lifted from gastronomic language to liken the brain to the stomach, and is of very recent origin. Roughage is ingested to help in food digestion, and is considered good for the system, similarly brain roughage. Other such terms are information snacking and junk, as parallels for the brain. Roughage may be a little tough and needs some exercising to digest, but the grey cells need to work and think before absorbing the information.//////
