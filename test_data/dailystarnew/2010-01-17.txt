Despite public concerns about canals, lakes and other water bodies being filled in with sand and stone by unscrupulous elements, despite administrative and even judicial measures to put a stop to such encroachment, there seems to have been little improvement in the situation. It is true that of late the authorities have moved toward reclaiming many canals and similar water bodies in and around the nation's capital. It is equally, and sadly, true that in some way or the other the nefarious elements responsible for turning these water bodies into something of a wasteland manage to sneak back to the scene and begin their dark work all over again.//////IT is dreadful revelation that 57 out of 67 prisons across the country do not have a single doctor to come to the aid of the inmates during illness. What is more atrocious is that prisoners serving rigorous imprisonment are given the task of nursing the patients because of the absence of trained nurses. We wonder what would the situation look like if epidemic of an infectious disease breaks out in any one of those prisons. As there would be no place to shift thousands of prisoners within a short time it is only probable that a large number of them would get infected and face death or impairment of health. //////THE devastation of Port au Prince, the capital of the Central American state of Haiti, has made it glaringly evident what havoc a powerful earthquake can wreak on a country that is poor and not well-prepared to face a natural calamity of colossal magnitude. Though this island nation is no stranger to calamities, especially sea-borne ones such as hurricanes, the quake that struck it last Tuesday afternoon was the first of its kind in the last 200 years. //////MUSLIMS, the world over, are in a quandary. Continuing terrorism by a small segment of Muslims in the name of jihad against "infidels" and their reportage in the global media have resulted in the framing of Western attitude towards the Muslims as a people chained to their roots and unable to adapt their system of politico-economic governance and social life in accordance with democratic principles understood "as a universal ideal (and) as the capacity of men to control their life in society through communicative reason and public institutions (//////)."//////ON January 14, 2010, ////// reported an increase in the accumulation of arsenic levels in the topsoil of agricultural lands that are irrigated by arsenic-rich groundwater. The article referred to a recent study by Professor Badruzzaman and Professor Ali (both of Buet). In their study, the professors reported that paddy grown on lands that have been irrigated by arsenic-rich groundwater contain up to 0.3 milligrams (300 micrograms) of arsenic per kilogram of paddy. A relevant but unanswered question is whether this level of arsenic in the grains is a health threat. While the Daily Star article is rather ominous in its tone, some analysis based on WHO and FAO data leads to a less threatening conclusion.//////There was no other choice for Bangla-desh captain Shakib Al Hasan and coach Jamie Siddons than encountering what Virender Sehwag had just told about their team during the pre-match briefing yesterday.//////Will it be a battle between the Gulliver and Lilliput when world's number one team India take on bottom-side Bangladesh in the first match of the two-Test series in the port city today?

But when a player like Virender Sehwag draws the comparison like this, things are bound to heat up.//////Bangladesh Wushu Association (BWUA) is hoping to spring surprise in their first-ever appearance in the 11th South Asian Games by giving the nation two gold medals on home soil.//////Bangladesh Under-19 got their World Cup campaign of to a winning start picking up a five-wicket victory with 112 deliveries remaining over Papua New Guinea in Palmerston North. The new-ball bowler Abul Hasan picked up four wickets, three of which dented PNG's top and middle order after they chose to bat, while the spinners kept run in check. PNG were bowled out for 191 in 46 overs. Set a D/L target of 189 in 46 overs, Bangladesh suffered a top-order wobble but the lower middle order polished off the chase. The main contributor was all-rounder bowler Shabbir Rahman, who hit an unbeaten 51 from 45 balls. His innings was sandwiched between key knocks from Mahmudul Hasan (38) and Nural Hasan (24 not out from 17 balls).//////AB de Villiers and Mark Boucher shared an attacking century partnership on the third day of the fourth and final Test against England at the Wanderers Stadium on Saturday before rain again interrupted South Africa's push for a series-levelling win.//////Rajshahi posted a mammoth victory over Sylhet by an innings and 139 runs on the third day of the 4-day match of the National league at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Fatullah yesterday.

I could not find any match with the image aired on television every 21st February and the one right before my eyes. Considering this is Bangladesh, I was less than half expecting the National Monument being embellished with fresh beautiful bouquets in the middle of November, but expecting a decent and honourable scene at such a historically blotted place isn't too much! //////The dead Madhumoti has become a great worry of Gopalganj people, as it has never been dredged properly. Recently the government authorities have decided to re-excavate the river and beautify the surrounding areas.//////We have plenty of human resources for producing more doctors and nurses; but the development plans have been rather sporadic. Lately the government has paid some attention to the plight in the nursing sector; and also have decided to offer more allowances for postings in the rural areas.//////A few days back I went to watch the widely campaigned movie Third Person Singular Number by Mr. Mostafa Sarwar Faruki at Garrison cinema hall adjacent to my residence with one of my relatives. Since purchasing the ticket to watching the movie I was not at ease. Although the cinema seemed to be thought provoking about what is happening to a lone girl in our today's society, I think it could mislead the youth. Let me give an example-- in the first scene, where the heroine Tisha was chased by a teaser and some hooligans while seeking a shelter to spend the night, I found a section of the audience making obscene remarks loudly as if their suppressed feeling found an expression in the form of the characters on the movie. From the beginning to end, such obscene remarks continued.//////There was a time when a conservative Muslim woman would have preferred death to a touch of her body by anybody other than by her husband. It was unimaginable on the part of a Muslim woman to move outside of her home without cloaking her entire body with a 'burkha' and wrapping a curtain around the passenger seat of a vehicle where she would sit to travel. Getting photographed was also deemed sinful. //////I acknowledge that presently the state has given the girls freedom in many areas. But the family is still a problem. First of all, a family does not want to spend money behind the girls' education. In spite of being qualified, she is often not admitted in any good educational institution if it is far from her residence. On the other hand "the situation is completely different for a boy. //////The Teesta water sharing agreement is on the anvil, as reported in almost all dailies on 5th. January. From one report in a daily, I quote the Indian Water Resources Secretary's remarks. He stated, "We want to share water with Bangladesh, there is no doubt about it." What remained un-stated is the ratio of water to be shared. Even if we get the leftover, say five percent of Teesta water, even then it is sharing; justifying the basis of the very positive statement given by the Indian secretary!//////Satellite TV channels greatly divert our young generation from our rich heritage. Earlier our youths were influenced by western culture but with the introduction of satellite TV channels they are now dominated by Indian culture. Noticing that those channels were diverting our young generation to foreign culture, the local entrepreneurs launched local satellite channels. ATN, the first private TV channel, started operation in 1997. Gradually other channels came into being. At present about 17 local private TV channels are continuously airing programmes upholding our long-cherished culture and tradition. But if we shuffle through the channels we will come across the ubiquitous dance sequence of the Indian music video. Unfortunately, the young generation is easily lured into those things.//////I read in your daily, one column on Open and Distance Learning written by Dr Manzurul Islam. That was good writing. I also think that this method of learning should be accepted by the govt and people. I have visited several websites of universities teaching with this method. I think this service responsibility should be distributed to the private organisations. One more public Open University and at least one private Open University should be allowed to introduce this system as early as possible. //////If any one happens to be in the Dhanmondi Residential Area, she/he will find most of the footpaths occupied by cars that are using them as parking.//////We are in 2010. A lot of people think we are in an ultra-modern era. So, we would like to be so fast, especially the teenagers. In this time they wish revitalization of their vigour & visionary powers. Obviously, this tendency has some positive and a few negative aspects. The positive side is that if the teenagers are devoted to their own goals in life, then they will be able to enjoy a dynamic life.//////Every year a good number of students are going abroad for higher education. They are taking help from student consultancy firms. In most cases parents are allured by the advertisement of the student consultancy firms. Student consultancy firms are hiding information and giving false information for doing business. If they give proper information to the students and their parents then they can mentally prepare themselves for any circumstances. After getting the information from the student consultancy firms, their expectations go high. But practically they are facing a different situation. Just for example, the UK has graded their colleges & universities in A and B and imposed restrictions on recruiting students. The tuition fee of the colleges varies from 2500 to 4000 pounds. Most of these colleges do not have enough space to accommodate the students as well as don't have enough classrooms. After the economic recession, the UK has made some tricky decisions for economic development. The highest revenue comes from the education sector. For that they have relaxed their immigration rules. Their main target is to collect the cash money from all over the world. In the last six months approximately 30 thousand students have gone to the UK from Bangladesh for higher education. But most of them have the plan to do job there. It is known to all that due to economic recession people are losing jobs all over the world. In this situation how can you expect to get job there? But the student consultancy firms are still informing that it is very easy to get a job in London. //////The year that saw a revolution in country's education sector must be painful for people who really want a change in education system for substantial development of the country. I was astonished to see Dhaka University's admission procedure that technically banned students from madrasa backgrounds from getting admitted to some key departments. More amazingly, the decision coincided with rising militancy threats that turned out to be a big obstacle for the country's development, investment and everything. This insurgency is mostly led by some madrasa teachers and students.//////When world leaders gathered at Copenhagen to compensate the nations affected by environmental pollution and to find out some alternatives or to reduce, to some extent at least, carbon emission to save the planet as human habitat from global climate change consequences, we are simply playing our death-games at Sitakundo ship breaking zone defying all warnings and dangers. In an explosion on 26 December last year while dismantling the oil tanker MT AGATE in Rahim Diamond Steel Product, a shipyard owned by one Hazi Abdur Rahim at Madambibirhat, 4 people were killed on the spot and 2 more later and many others were injured. In the last three months, 13 people have died in three separate accidents and 22 in the last one year . Since 1984, about 1, 000 people died and 6,000 injured in the ship breaking accidents at Sitakundo. At present 37 shipyards are operating at Sitakundo with about 4,000 workers. According to The Daily Star (01/01/2010) and the Daily Prothom Alo (28/12/2009) , about 3,000 ships are waiting globally to be dismantled most of which will surely enter into Bangladesh and Sitakundo will grab its share, no doubt. //////Exorbitant fee structure in English medium schools is breaking the backbone of the middle class families which wish to provide quality education to their children. Parents have become money-minting machines for such schools.//////English in nursing is an important issue as the course related books are written in English and this course also originated in English society. There is no provision yet for permanent lectureship for English teachers in nursing colleges and institutions. In addition to this, having no prescribed textbook in English is a serious problem. //////It is heartening that Biman is going to get a different and modern look at last. (A new-look Biman in sight. Star Business. 07.01.10). The present world is more watchful about the outer look of everything. In Europe, America, even in Africa and Asia, every country and their people are paying attention to the modern dcor of everything they use, they see or even they eat. Though we haven't yet seen the actual facet of Biman, yet it has been revealed from the picture published in your daily that Bangladesh's flag carrier has got a beautiful look. Now, Biman will have a different image and the national flag carrier will be able to attract more passengers.//////Standing at a bus station next to her husband and four children, Talulum Saint Fils looks determined to get out of the Haitian capital that some now refer to as "hell". //////The earthquake in Haiti is the worst disaster ever confronted by the United Nations, a spokeswoman said Saturday, pointing out that the catastrophe has left affected regions with little infrastructure.//////Hundreds of thousands of Haitians are in desperate need of drinking water because of an earthquake-damaged municipal pipeline and truck drivers either unable or unwilling to deliver their cargo.//////Every five minutes, a vehicle pulled up to the gates of Port-au-Prince's cemetery, delivering another corpse to a mass grave dug by authorities trying to clear the broken city's streets of the dead.//////Six major powers were meeting here yesterday to chart a response to Iran's nuclear defiance but China is sending a lower-level diplomat in a signal of its reluctance to back tougher sanctions pushed by the West.//////Working from a police station close to the airport, the Haitian government is trying to provide some governance to the country, whose main symbols of power have been torn down by Tuesday's devastating earthquake. //////Yemen's interior ministry confirmed yesterday the death of al-Qaeda's military chief in the country, Qassem al-Rimi, and that of five of his lieutenants in an air strike a day earlier.//////Amid the widespread despair caused by the massive earthquake in Haiti's capital Port-Au-Prince, emerged a rare moment of joy when a 4-year-old boy was pulled to safety three days after he was buried alive in his two-story family home.//////It is likely that fishes also feel the pain, says a new study.//////Unmanned US Predator aircraft continued to pound Pakistan's lawless tribal region on Friday evening, with 11 extremists reportedly being killed in twin drones strikes in North Waziristan.//////Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari is trying his best to safeguard his chair and seems to be following a policy of reconciliation, as he has said that he would keep on trusting his critics even if they do not.//////The United States and Norway yesterday denied funding Sri Lanka's main opposition to defeat President Mahinda Rajapakse's re-election bid later this month.//////To please 'Behenji', some Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) activists are willing to go to any lengths. //////Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran said yesterday they had agreed to work together more closely to combat extremism, illegal weapons trading and drug trafficking.//////Three people died and around a dozen were injured when two express trains collided in thick fog in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh yesterday, a senior railway official said.//////External Affairs Minister SM Krishna signed four agreements with his Nepalese counterpart Sujata Koirala to strengthen ties between the two countries.//////At least five people were killed Friday when Kenyan police fired live rounds and teargas to suppress a protest by Muslims demanding the release of a radical Jamaican cleric, police said.//////A two-day memorial programme on the occasion of second death anniversary of 'Natyacharya' Selim Al Deen ended on January 15 at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.
