The businessmen say that international commodity prices rising, local prices are getting pushed up. But business insiders contend that since the present stocks have been procured when the prices abroad were lower, there is no valid reason why their current local prices would soar.//////THERE is little question that the number of people visiting patients at Dhaka Medical College Hospital every day is rather high and that the hospital authorities have a hard time dealing with them while attending to the sick. But that can hardly be a reason for the authorities to clamp fees on those intending to visit patients, something which seems to have been done. The DMCH has apparently made it a rule since the first day of this month that visitors will have to pay three types of fees, depending on which part of the hospital their relatives or friends are being treated in, if they mean to be let into the hospital premises. Now, quite a few points come up here. The first is that the DMCH offers free medical facilities to patients, which in turn means that the poor and not so well off find it a convenient place for treatment. And the second is that the relatives of those admitted to the hospital are themselves poor and cannot afford to pay the fees the hospital authorities now say they must.//////UNDERDEVELOPMENT breeds a hundred and one vices. The mindset of dependency is one of them. We have long been beholden to the very advanced West for about everything. Not long ago, a major portion of the country's development budget was dependent on foreign aid. However, of late, the nation has been able to lower this dependency to a considerable extent, thanks to the inflow of remittance and earnings from exports. //////FROM all appearances, it was the panache of a professional man who took a helicopter ride to a project inspection. A newspaper flashed that story on the front page, showing this corporate knight ducking his head under the spinning rotors of his flying horse. It could have been a prized display on bedroom and boardroom walls, if not for what we know that the picture didn't tell. Psst! The managing director of the largest bank in the country took that ride at client's expense.//////JUSTICE Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and the other judges who had refused to fresh oath on the Musharraf amended constitution when he declared Emergency and gave a new Provisional Constitution Order. It was indeed a very strange that the dictator had declared a second Martial Law against his own system. All actions that Musharraf took on November 3, 2007 -- declaring a State of Emergency -- have been declared null and void in law. //////Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan said his team is focussed on getting the game plan right when they meet Zimbabwe in the first ODI of the five-match Grameenphone Cup series at Bulawayo's Queens Sports Club today.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club made a bold statement on Saturday that they would splash any amount of money to win the B.

Sterling as market players awaited policy decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. Caution ahead of the rate decisions prevented further gains in the currencies, though analysts said sentiment remained buoyant as European shares rose 1.1 percent. Both the ECB and the BoE are seen leaving interest rates on hold at 1.0 and 0.5 percent respectively, though the market will be looking for whether the central banks have adopted a more optimistic tone on the economy. Interest is expected to centre on whether the BoE will increase asset purchases under its quantitative easing programme, although analysts see this as less likely after recent better-than-expected UK data. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar rose and the New Zealand dollar fell as better-than-expected Australian employment data contrasted with a higher-than-expected jobless rate in New Zealand. Data showed that 32,200 jobs were created in Australia in July, far better than forecasts for a loss of 20,000 jobs, adding to the risk of an early rise in interest rates.//////There have been no visible formal initiatives to conserve the vast forest regions and woodlands in the country, despite no lack of laws and policies, environmentalists at a conference said yesterday.//////Over one hundred students of MA Rashid Hall of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) fell sick due to suspected food poisoning after their lunch at the hall canteen on Friday. //////Information and Cultural Affairs Minister Abul Kalam Azad has sought cooperation of people from all walks of life to make the country free from crime, corruption and poverty. //////The hellfire missiles fired by the CIA drones caught the Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud, helpless, as the militant commander, a diabetic was on a drip infusion for his kidney ailment. //////The government has made it clear that it is the Energy Regulatory Commission, not the Directorate of Explosive, that will provide licenses for stocking petroleum products.//////Snakebite has become a public health problem in rural areas of the country, as estimated 6,041 individuals die from snakebites every year, revealed a study yesterday.//////Social Welfare Minister Enamul Haque Mostafa Shahid yesterday said equal rights for the indigenous people would be ensured in every sector to facilitate the overall development of the country.//////Some 40 people, including journalists and police, were injured as followers of two soccer teams involved in a clash at Rajshahi district stadium last night.//////The newly formed Information Commission has started working and the government will provide all-out support to ensure that it function independently, Information Minister Abul Kalam Azad said at a meeting recently.//////Paribesh Bachao Andolon (save the environment movement) yesterday urged the government to review the Consumers Rights Protection Act 2009 to ensure protection of the rights of consumers in true sense, says a press release.//////The National Committee to monitor the printing and free distribution of textbooks has expressed the hope that it will be possible to make the textbooks available to the students at primary and secondary levels including those under Madrasa and Technical Education Board at the beginning of the next academic year.//////Two muggers got bullet injured by members of Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) yesterday, as they were taking preparations to commit a crime at Koratitola at the city's Jatrabari.//////Adviser to Prime Minister Prof Syed Modasser Ali called on different corporate bodies to come forward and contribute to the betterment of society as part of their corporate social responsibilities, says a press release.//////The 13th meeting of the Bangladesh Society for Child Neurology, Development and Disability was held at the college gallery of Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital recently, says a press release. //////Speakers at a memorial meeting yesterday said the commitment of Santosh Gupta to democratic and secular ideas and his relentless fight against all forms of reactionary forces and authoritarianism have made him a legendary figure in society.//////Police arrested three youths along with firearms while they were mugging a man at Mazam Bazar in Borhanuddin upazila on Thursday night.//////Leaders of Samajtantrik Mohila Forum, a left-leaning women's organisation, yesterday demanded enactment of a law to stop fatwa (religious edict) and exemplary punishment to those behind issuing fatwas.//////As many of 20 people drowned in the ditch of Madhabkunda waterfall in Baralekha upazila under Moulvibazar district during the last several years, but authorities are yet to take adequate safety measures at the scenic tourist spot.//////On the eve of the Interna-tional Day of the World's Indigenous People yesterday, leaders of the indigenous communities in the country reiterated the call for protecting their rights for a harmonious society. //////The authorities of Madan Mohan College yesterday closed the institution for three days from today following a clash between the activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS) on the campus. //////Two groups of villagers clashed over a disputed land at Athkhana village under Haripur upazila of the district yesterday morning, leaving 15 people injured.//////A fish trader was killed by muggers at Shashiganj launch terminal under Borhanuddin upazila of Bhola district yesterday.

He said, as he recently issued a notice in this connection, Lobi filed a rape case with the district judge against him (jail super).//////Khulna unit of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (Bapa) formed a human chain yesterday near the Picture Palace cinema. The programme was observed to protest recent claim by two neighbouring countries that they have the right to use Bangladesh territorial waters. The human chain was followed by a rally at the same place with coordinator of Khulna unit of Bapa Feroz Ahmed in the chair. Speakers at the rally demanded of the government to build up a stronger naval force and establish a separate ministry with a view to safeguarding Bangladesh territorial waters and maritime zones.//////A couple was electrocuted at village Ramanthpur in Khoksa upazila yesterday. Two sons of the couple were also injured as they tried to save their parents. Khatun, 40, came in touch of live wire when she put some wet clothes on a poll near her house, police said.

Shakib-AL-Hasan and his team have brightened the image of Bangladesh in the world. We are proud of you and keep up the spirit to face formidable teams in future. //////I hope you have seen the opinion of the opposition on satellite TV channel on the occasion of a meeting with the " Krishak League" of the Jatiyatabadi Dal.

As the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina is entitled to get special security but we do not understand why the others are getting it.//////I refer to Captain Husain Imam's PCP article (31 July), and fully sympathise with him. What he says about professional training is obviously true. The Marine Academy is an excellent institution and I am proud to have been a lecturer in Marine Engineering ( 1965-66) there, when it was in its infancy, and trees planted there were only a few feet high. Bangladeshi Mariners are now a large community at home and abroad as Captain Imam mentions and have their dedicated website www.bangladeshmariners.com. Obviously, the appointment of the present DG of shipping is an individual case on which I cannot comment, however it remains true that by and large young, able and ambitious Merchant Navy Officers earning international salaries on ships or shipping industry abroad are unwilling to join government jobs in Bangladesh, because of astronomical drop of remuneration and inherent politics involved with such postings.//////The Bangladesh government has taken a decision lately that whole one brigade of Bangladesh military would be pulled out from the Chittagong Hill Tracts area. The decision has created mix reaction throughout the country, especially in that CHT region. People have been experiencing that law and order situation is much better with the army deployment in the region. One the other hand, their presence made indigenous people unhappy.//////That the brilliant Test Series win over West Indies was not a fluke has been proved by Bangladesh by defeating the Caribbean's in the ODI series also. Following the maiden away Test series win, this first-ever overseas //////While most of our politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen are busy in making money by corrupt means and tarnishing our national image, our youngsters are fetching name and fame from all corners of the world for our dear motherland. The youngsters, very young ones, recently won a bronze medal in an international Mathematics Olympiad. Our young mountaineers climbed one of the highest peaks of the Himalayas. Our under 19 cricketers defeated their English counterparts on the English soil. Our national cricket team, for the first time in our cricket history, won a Test series and an ODI series by defeating the West Indies team on their own soil. //////The politics of our country has always been characterized by confrontations, conflicts and indiscriminate comments hurled on to opponents. The leaders hardly realise the impact of such behaviour on the people and how it impairs the image of the country. Recently, the leader of the opposition told that the prime minister prefers to remain as chief minister, rather than prime minister just for the sake of power. Such remarks on the part of the top leader of the main opposition party is absolutely shocking, senseless, and unacceptable. This will not only harm the relationship between Bangladesh and India, but it will also hurt the sentiments of common people. The party leader should understand that the prime minister is also the representative of the people of Bangladesh and this type of abusive comment means showing disrespect to people's verdict. //////Different channels are arranging talk shows on various issues, especially relating to politics, country's economy, law and order , corruption and the history of freedom movement etc. It manifests sincere effort of the producers who take such challenging jobs to do good to people.//////Tipaimukh dam is the most discussed subject of the present time. Many are saying that when constructed it would have a harmful effect on Bangladesh. Some are saying 'Boon or bane for Bangladesh?' or 'Disaster or opportunity for Bangladesh?' finishing with a conclusion, giving indication of immense benefit for Bangladesh if constructed properly quoting study report of JRC(1972),Northeast Regional Water Management Plan(NRWMP)(Sept-1993) and Northeast Regional Model(NERM)(Final report, March-1995) prepared under the Flood Action Plan(FAP-6). Some say this is a technical matter and needs to be studied by renowned technical experts from home and abroad. Some are blaming the opposition party for politicising the matter for mere political gains. In this respect technical information like aerial survey map, hydrological survey, geo-technical data, earthquake indexes of the area etc. are required to be studied by the technical experts to come to a conclusion. Technical experts need to study the planning, design and supervise during execution and operation to make sure that things are in line with the agreed matter. Above all, experience gathered in the case of Farakka, a similar project, is of utmost importance which should play a vital role in deciding the construction of Tipaimukh dam where politicians can play their due role in decision making. //////The call centre industry in our country is a new sector which has a bright future. There are many call centres here that have been given license to launch their work by BTRC. As a result, huge numbers of jobless people are being involved in call centre. At the very outset it was so easy to get the license from BTRC. That's why people got this privilege and took license to run call centres. But the situation is different now. Most of the call centres have not started their work. In the name of call centre they are providing training to the people for the job and taking huge amount of money from them. But ultimately they are being cheated.//////The six pictures on the Dhaka deluge, published on 29 July, by the photo-reporters of a local English daily reflect Dhaka city and its miseries due to the recent torrential rains, breaking a 53 year old rainfall record, as reported! Five of the photographs represented the usual misery of Dhaka inhabitants. However the sixth picture-- the middle one in the bottom row of photographs-- was a critical one! It showed the misery of a building, with cracks in its decorative vertical panels. It is the Institute of Glass & Ceramic. The misery was not due to rains, but caused by human shortcomings!//////We express our extreme outrage at several recent comments made by the Indian high commissioner against Bangladeshi people in general. We find the comments about water experts, about the visa seekers and about migrant workers highly deplorable and outside of any diplomatic norm. //////The recently concluded 20th national council of the ruling Awami League has certainly failed to live up to the expectations. In other words, this council has been no different from the previous ones and it seems that holding of the council was more of ending a formality than bringing real "change" in the running of the party. While the newly re-elected party chief is undoubtedly the undisputed leader of the party, it was from her that we had expected the initiative for change to come. As one English daily's editorial put it, "even articulation of the aspiration to be a candidate runs the risk of being construed as challenging the authority of the party president," it was not unexpected that no candidates were available to run for the post of party president or general secretary. The party chief and general secretary have already chosen the 45 members of the central working committee, and the rest of the members are to be chosen by the party president. However, for the sake of intra-party democracy, it would have been better had there been elections to all the posts of the CWC. //////I teach at Valley Forge Military College at Philadelphia, PA.
