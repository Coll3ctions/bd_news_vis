The danger rises now that the season of storms is upon us. The first manifestation of it came last Wednesday when a huge billboard collapsed at Mirpur Road during a storm. While storms are a regular climatic happening in Bangladesh, what should not be regular is a deliberate flouting of judicial pronouncements on such matters as a removal of unauthorized billboards. Despite a specific High Court order on Rajuk in April last year that all such hoardings and billboards be removed, hardly anything has been done to comply with the order. The chairman of Rajuk now informs us that a lack of manpower has prevented an implementation of the HC directive. That begs the question: how is it that in an entire year Rajuk has not had the capacity to remove the billboards? Besides, why has it not come forth with any explanations about its failure until now?//////SINCE last week's violent clashes between the Bengali settlers and the indigenous people in Ramgarh some of the latter have become homeless as reports suggest.

hammering against a basket of currencies. On Thursday it hit a three year low against a basket of currencies as strong corporate earnings buoyed risk appetite in illiquid pre Easter trade, which threatened to drive the greenback to historic lows. The euro jumped to 16-month highs and looked on course for a move towards $1.50 if it holds onto these gains. Currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars also surged, though some traders warned the moves could reverse as investors take profit on short dollar positions before the long Easter weekend. The chart outlook for the greenback looked dire after it tumbled through a 74.17 trough hit in November 2009, a move that may spark a run towards the 70.698 all-time low hit in 2008. This week's threat by Standard & Poor's to cut the United States' prized triple-A credit rating has knocked dollar sentiment, reminding the market, which had been focused on euro zone debt woes, that the US still has massive debt problems. A series of records have been broken, with gold vaulting to all-time highs above $1,500 an ounce and the Aussie powering to 29-year peaks above $1.07, while the Singapore dollar and Swiss franc hit all-time highs. However, there were signs of profit taking, with the Aussie stumbling ahead of options barriers at $1.0800 after surging as high as $1.0775. The single currency looked poised for further gains, with the path clearing for a run at the 2009 peak at $1.5145. The dollar index fell 0.8 percent from late New York trade to 73.735, the lowest since August 2008 -- just before it surged during the Lehman Brothers collapse -- as world stocks marched

Taking advantage of this lapse, a sizeable portion of the river has already been grabbed and filled up by a section of greedy real estate developers. Industries that sprang up on both sides of the river, has virtually turned the river into a waste water body devouring millions of gallons of untreated effluents everyday. Of them Hazaribagh Tanneries are the worst polluters. We want that government must take stringent measures to reclaim its lost areas and get rid of the unauthorized structures and order the industries to set up effluent treatment plants immediately or face the eviction.//////Who can forget the disastrous 58 and 78 of the tigers in the recently concluded Cricket WC, one of which was followed by brickbat throwing on the team bus? But how about the heroic New Zealand white wash, the nail-biting conclusion against Ireland, the nerve cracking one wicket victory over the English ? All these bear testimony to the huge uncertainty the fans have to endure while watching game of cricket. Very recently tigers' consistent batting display has been exhibited even under pressure against the mighty aussies. Therefore we must be patient rather than criticising on a defeat when accidentally tigers fail to perform. //////It has been a constant panic that the people living and trading at the borders will always stay in a threat to be illegally shot at by BSF. Almost every day, we go through the daily papers with such kind of pathetic news of illegal shooting. From elderly to children, traders to general people, visitors to inhabitants-nobody is free from the fright of BSF killings. Border security must be maintained but it is, in no means ethical to shoot at the people without giving prior notice to the 'violators'. Moreover, sometimes the relatives of the people killed by the BSF do not get the dead bodies.Such kind of occurrence is no good in retaining the positive relationship between these two neighbouring countries. The both govt. must come forward in settling the matter as soon as possible.//////Bangladesh Railway plays a very important role from the very ancient period.

Unfortunately, polybags are being widely used again everywhere. Now we are using a huge amount of polybags daily and then throwing it into open place. The drainage system of our large city is hindered in rainy season due to polybags. It is also a threat of our environment and agriculture. //////The recent news item regarding export of maid servants from Bangladesh to Saudi Arabia is very disturbing. The inhuman torture and maltreatment of domestic helps in the Middle East in general and Saudi Arabia, in particular is well known. I think successive governments of Bangladesh in the past did not allow export of domestic helps to the region for this reason. //////I fully agree with Masaru Aklyama who wrote about the poor condition of //////A news item titled Abused TV presenter asks ministry to give protection to journalists published in the daily Arab News on April 14, 2011 has attracted my attention. //////In Sweden we rarely see anything on TV or read anything in the press about Bangladesh.

In developed countries; they are given high salaries for their work. But in Bangladesh, they are deprived. Government seems to be reluctant about teacher's compensation strategy or pay policy. Government recently declared that they will increase the pay scale and make separate pay scale for the teachers. But didn't focus on a major problem that they never get their salaries in due time in government schools and colleges. //////Last Friday when I was going through a newspaper, I became startled to see the news that a young boy had been killed by an S.I. of police in Tangail.

This dance-drama is a satire on the rigidity of class systems, both Indian and British, employing the dramatic and comedic device of a land of cards where a population is trapped in countless, inane rituals. But has this satire/fantasy managed to retain its pertinence after almost eight decades?//////A lack of familiarity with the byzantine history of China during the Warring States Period, from the fifth to the third centuries B.C., is a handicap when it comes to following the story of The Warring States, which is extremely loosely based on parts of that history.

The Christian festival of Easter is being celebrated today. Christians all over the world commemorate the resurrection of Christ from the dead -- the first article of Christian faith.
