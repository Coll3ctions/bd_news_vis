So far as we understand, the national committee will principally act as a policy-making body while a working committee consisting of representatives from the similar ministries and bodies as are represented on the NC will assist the latter on the implementation side. Additionally, the new body is to help recover money stashed away abroad. There are thus three functions before the committees: one, combating money laundering; two, fighting terror financing; and three, bringing back unearned incomes of Bangladeshi citizens kept in foreign financial institutions. //////THE problems faced by the physically handicapped in Bangladesh ought to have been tackled decisively a long time ago. That we yet have to emphasise the need for people with disability to be provided with the rights that are applicable to others demonstrates, in a big way, the insensitivities such individuals have been subjected to over the years. It is against this background that the call by the Chief Adviser for a protection of the rights of the disabled assumes significance. Indeed, the campaign for rights to be ensured for the disabled has been there since long before the remarks made by the head of the caretaker government. His intervention in the matter only reconfirms the public conviction that the time to address such issues is here and now.//////DON'T get me wrong. I think Hillary Clinton would make a superb president. For what it's worth, I even think that John McCain would be a significant improvement over the current occupant of the White House. Aside from his faith in America's imperial destiny, McCain is actually not that bad, as far as Republicans go.//////WHILE disasters tend to unite the nation, it is infinitely better that the nation closes ranks before any impending disaster. With world recession looming in our faces, we do not have the economic resilience to cushion the impact. Coupled with shortages of food, fuel and electricity, and increase in suicide bombings, only a monumental effort by all and sundry will see the country through a long hot summer. //////As the US primary election season approaches its decisive phase with two of the delegate rich states of Texas and Ohio, the desperation in the presidential bid of Sen. Hillary Clinton may turn into a doomsday despair unless she wins both states by 65% of the votes cast on February 5 -- a nearly unrealistic proposition according to most pollsters. //////It was a different scenario in the Bangladesh tent prior to the second Test match against South Africa which starts at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium today. Former national skipper Habibul Bashar and Mohammad Rafique got special attentions rather than what the Tigers were going to show in the second and final Test after their encouraging show in Mirpur.//////Before what is expected to be his last international match, Mohammad Rafique came up with a typical salvo saying that he had taken the decision of quitting the game because of some incumbent officials at the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).//////The met office here yesterday heralded good news for the cricket fans who are eager to watch the Bangladesh-South Africa second Test starting today at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium (CDS) alias Bir Shreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. //////Abahani won at a canter to enter the semifinal of the Premier Twenty20 tournament when they cruised past Surjo Torun by seven wickets at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium yesterday.//////It seems that Bangladesh cricket is all set to enter a new era after the departure of some senior cricketers.

While the entire world, including Asia, is engaged in controlling wastes, you have at least raised the voice against medical wastes! //////The Beijing Olympics 2008 are to be held in August. But even before the Olympic Games have started, China is already facing certain obstacles. A few days back, Spielberg (the famous director), who was supposed to be an artistic adviser for the opening and closing ceremonies, has decided to step down from the post. He believes that China needs to do a lot more to stop the ever increasing violence in Darfur (however, he must know that America itself is remaining mum on this issue).

In response to a query of the reporters, he mentioned that Bangladesh would start the work in the area which Bangladesh considers its maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. If any dispute arises with the neighbouring countries, they would stop the work and go for negotiation to resolve the issue. The spirit of the adviser is definitely patriotic but missing the ground reality of international maritime boundary issues being not finalized yet with India or Burma. I am not sure whether international bidders would respond to our tender before the issue of maritime boundary with India or Burma is clarified. This is a hypothetical question considering our relation with our neighbour.//////I would like to the draw attention of the taxpayers in Bangladesh (especially the business community) who contribute a huge amount of their hard earned money through taxes and a large portion of which goes to higher education spending.//////The current caretaker government's (CTG) popularity took a nosedive over the past few months.

The story of a Titas Gas sales assistant is one of those, although it is claimed by reporters that it probably surpassed all previous records. As an employee drawing only Tk. 4,000 in monthly salary when at the career's peak, he accumulated wealth worth over Tk. 2100 crore, though he claims the amount to be only 208 crore! Sounds unbelievable and the matter is beyond everyone's comprehension. It has come to light through the efforts of the National Coordination Committee against Corruption and Serious Crimes. In the mean time, under the supervision of the task force, the process of returning ill-gotten wealth of over 400 crore by a group of corrupt employees of Titas Gas has started. //////The government has claimed to have done so many good (or bad) things to put the country on a right (or wrong) track, which, as the government and its backers claim, was severely mishandled by the politicians in the last 36 years. Their initial actions, especially the ones taken to contain corruption and establishment of rule of law received support from general public, non-politicians (!) and even a group of politicians, who claimed themselves to be so-called reformists, but have a long track record of corruption, abuse of power and political cruelty on opposition leaders, workers and supporters. //////Israel pounded militants in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip with deadly strikes yesterday as Prime Minister Ehud Olmert vowed to make the Islamists pay a heavy price for rocket attacks. //////Two bombs left at least eight civilians dead in guerrilla-held territory in northern Sri Lanka, Tamil rebels said Thursday as the defence ministry reported killing nine militants. //////A militant ambush of an opium poppy eradication force sparked clashes that left 25 Taliban fighters and a policeman dead, a provincial police chief said yesterday.
