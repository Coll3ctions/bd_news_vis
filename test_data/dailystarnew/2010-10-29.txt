Worse, it is a powerful indication of how our law enforcers have been failing, consistently and embarrassingly, to take action against those who have been committing such nefarious deeds. Only the other day, the prime minister spoke of tougher laws being enacted to deal with these culprits. She reassured the nation that no one caught stalking women would be spared. Our question, which is also that of society as a whole, is pretty simple: do we need newer laws to handle such criminality or do we need some effective, deterrent action on the ground to see to it that the menace is put to an end? The statistics, as a report by Ain-o-Salish Kendra makes clear, inform us that despite the growing public condemnation of stalking, incidents of such manifest criminality have steadily gone up. And they have gone up because of the gross failure of the authorities to bring to justice those who have been indulging in the crime.//////Buildings are supposed to last for generations. Some of ours fall before they are finished. The latest such incident occurred in Dhakkhin Khan area of our city where a three-storied apartment complex just fell on its side as a toy house used by children. Thankfully, there were no deaths, even in the neighbouring house on top of which the building fell. The photograph speaks volumes about the fragility of the structure and clearly shows, even to the untrained eye, that the foundation was far too weak for it to support the so-called apartment building. Most basic norms of construction were not followed. The question arises as to how could any one start building a structure based on such an ill-conceived design in the first place? Is there no monitoring body that keeps tab on construction in the city areas? Can anybody just build any structure, however flawed, anywhere at any time. This speaks volumes about our whole system of governance -- how building permission is given, who are qualified to raise a structure, under what soil conditions and with what safeguards -- there is no way of knowing whether any authority has satisfied itself that the concerns have been at all met before laying of the first brick.//////Experienced campaigner Sabura Khaun returned to top-flight

The city dwellers have been getting infected by dengue for the last two or three months. //////The government has decided to shut down the CNG filling stations for six hours a day in Dhaka city in order to meet the household demands.

The reward of a plot of land (where?) and a car (SUV?) to 20 members of the Bangladesh cricket team is, to say the least, a knee-jerk action, that is not justified by their performance on the field. Please consider the facts://////Law and order has deteriorated severely in the capital. Almost everyone I know living in the capital, has an experience of getting mugged. I was mugged twice this year in the city's College Gate area. One of my friends was not only mugged but also physically attacked by the muggers as he refused to give in to their demands. He is still suffering from severe injuries. The incidents of mugging occur in daytime also.

Is begging going to be a mega business soon in Bangladesh? //////Your staff correspondent's report on the subject matter, published in your pages on 16th October, where it was stated that Prof. Abdullah Abu Sayeed of Bishwa Shahitya Kendra talked about the journalists' capability in writing correctly, grammar and composition wise. I agree with his views based on my regular reading of four English dailies of Dhaka, practically from the first to the last page, as well as their weekly magazines and other English weeklies. //////Mahendra Singh Dhoni started his life as a ticket collector in the Indian Railways. Now, after playing cricket for some years, he is rich beyond imagination. He lives in a palatial house in Ranchi, owns many expensive sports cars, motorcycles and what not. Thanks to the game of cricket, more aptly to over commercialisation of cricket. Cricket sells and sells like crazy. //////To the utter dismay of the investors, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is interfering very much in the share market in the name of preserving the interest of small shareholders, by restricting loans, right shares, company's dividend, and by asking unnecessary explanation from the companies or by forming committees to investigate companies' affairs. Thereby, the share market is becoming volatile.//////The present government has imposed tax on cars, as they did during their previous tenure.

What do we see? Traffic jams and long queues of course. The government has ordered that all gas pumps must be closed by three in the afternoon. It has created nothing but traffic jams. My school journey in the morning is a nightmare. The roads are packed with cars and these create gridlocks everywhere. I am getting late for school almost every day. Previously, when this rule wasn't there, everyone used to take gas whenever they needed it. I urge the govt. to withdraw this order. //////The death toll from a tsunami that pummelled remote Indonesian islands soared to 343 yesterday as questions mounted over whether an elaborate warning system had failed.//////France and some allied Nato armies could begin to withdraw some of their forces from the conflict in Afghanistan as early as 2011, Defence Minister Herve Morin said Thursday.//////The US government has spent about $55bn on rebuilding in Afghanistan since 2001 but cannot easily show how the money was spent, a government watchdog says.//////Myanmar has told its neighbours that democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi may be freed after the November 7 elections, according to a source at a summit where the junta is under fire over the discredited polls.//////A system which could one day allow scientists to record people's dream has been developed.//////An Afghan election watchdog has registered almost 6,000 complaints following last month's parliamentary poll, around half of which could affect the final results, an official said yesterday.//////The head of MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, has insisted it has "nothing whatsoever" to do with torture but warned that it had to work with agencies from other countries which were not always "friendly democracies".//////An official says an 18-month-old baby has been found alive in a clump of trees days after the devastating tsunami that killed at least 343 people.//////At least 11 suspected militants have been killed in drone strikes in north-west Pakistan in the past 24 hours, local officials say.//////The controversial issue of stapled Chinese visas to Kashmiris and Sino-India economic ties are expected to figure in crucial talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao here tomorrow. //////Mohammed was the most popular name for newborn baby boys in England and Wales in 2009, according to official data released on Wednesday.

But while numbers hint at a success story, a more nuanced look at the story behind the numbers may bring little comfort.
