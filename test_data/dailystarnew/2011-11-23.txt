The conversation we had with the teenaged drug addicts changed our perception about them. Many of them are abandoned by either their father or mother. In most of the cases, their mothers were divorced and then got married again. As a result, they had no place to go but to live on the street. In some cases, after their father or mother's death they were forced to leave home and became street children. What is most depressing is that almost all the street boys are addicted to drugs and involved in crimes and different kinds of anti-social activities. Their average age is not more than 13 or 14 years. If every one of us takes the responsibility to bring them in the mainstream of society, the situation will change radically. It is our moral duty to stand beside these children.//////The classrooms of our government-run colleges are overcrowded.

As many as one hundred and fifty students sit in a single room.//////Dowry system is a deep-rooted problem in our society.

The situation is worse in the lower class of society.//////I have learned some facts about Libya while reading an article on the internet.

Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC) should be rebuilt so that quality films can be made there. During the last Eid-ul-Azha five movies were released. Among them four movies got good response from the audience. The directors and producers of these movies are happy in their success. Now, for the sake of our film industry the government should establish a film city in the country. Besides, a group of young filmmakers are trying to make good films. We hope the government will take some initiatives to promote these promising filmmakers.//////Much of the political rise of Paschimbanga Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is due to her ability to singlehandedly fight with her opponents.

The venue -- British Council on Fuller Road, Dhaka -- added to that bliss of course. Intoxicating smell of Shiuli seducing the olfaction and perfectly manicured bright green lawn under the feet. A great day to make hay.//////The Bangladesh Nationalist Party has said it loud and clear. The Awami League-led government, it informs the country, must be ousted in order to protect the country. And how do you observe that statement? For starters, you could tell the opposition that you can only agree with it halfway. And that is to inform it that the country is always in need of protection, always requiring the highest degree of security in order to carry on. And that ouster idea? That is a fine term, ouster, and we have over the past five decades or so been witness to the many spells of ouster governments have been subjected to by ambitious military officers across the globe. And then think of this lovely land of ours. Every ouster of a government has brought with it an end to the lives of the great and the good. By extension, each ouster has seen a newer, swifter decline in values. But oust an elected government? That very thought is in bad taste. It reveals two things. The first is an absence of pluralistic sentiment in those who simply do not know the ramifications of the term. The second is that a call for the ouster of a government voted to power by the majority of people in a country is akin to undermining the sovereign right of a society to make informed political choices for itself.//////Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah came to Delhi and valiantly pleaded that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act be lifted from parts of the state.
