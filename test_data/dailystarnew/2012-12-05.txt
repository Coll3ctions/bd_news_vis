However, it is good to learn that some initiatives have been taken lately to stop this malpractice. Some markets have been declared formalin-free. Import of formalin and other chemicals which are used in foods should be closely monitored. I felicitate the authorities for giving such efforts. I also request the government to give the malefactors involved in food adulteration harsher punishment. Formalin detectors should be made available at the shops near to bazaars.

But more than 60% voters are concerned about their economy. It seems to me that military cost is one of the major cause of the US' weak economy i.e. budget deficit, unemployment and poverty. So their foreign policy is a big factor for their economy. This reality should be understood by the ordinary American people. We came to know that cyclone Sandy might have cost America USD 20 billion. American economy needs more careful handling by the Obama administration. Racial division is growing gradually that may take serious turn in future. So president Obama should take the responsibility to unite the deeply divided American society. President Obama's win for four more years is a hope for the peace-loving people. I think Obama will be able to bring peace in the Middle East and other parts of the world. //////Nato joined Washington in delivering a blunt warning to Damascus yesterday against any use of chemical weapons, as the alliance readied to approve a Turkish request for missiles to protect its border with Syria.//////Iran yesterday said it had captured a US intelligence drone in its airspace over the Gulf in the last few days, but the US military quickly denied having lost any unmanned aircraft in the Middle East.//////Israel's government yesterday stood firm in the face of mounting international pressure as it pushed ahead with a swathe of settlement plans seen as threatening the viability of a future Palestinian state.//////An intense typhoon thumped into the southern Philippines yesterday, destroying homes, setting off a landslide and killing more than two dozen people, authorities said.//////Israel had no reason to oppose Palestine's UN observer state membership, according to ex-prime minister Ehud Olmert, who plans to announce whether he will run in the next polls today.//////Prince William and his wife Catherine on Monday announced they are expecting their first child, ending fevered speculation about a baby destined to become Britain's monarch whether it is a boy or a girl amid concern over latter's physical condition.//////Opponents of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi were to march on the presidential palace to protest his power grab and a controversial draft charter, as the country plunged deeper into crisis.//////India's government faced a test of its ability to survive as a minority administration yesterday as opposition lawmakers slammed its decision to allow in foreign supermarket giants such as Walmart.//////Typhoon Bopha killed at least six people in the Philippines yesterday as the strongest storm to hit the country this year forced more than 50,000 to seek refuge in emergency shelters, officials said.//////Jordan's King Abdullah II arrives in Ramallah tomorrow on his first visit since the Palestinians won UN recognition as a non-member state, a senior official told AFP yesterday.//////A leader of Myanmar's 2007 monk rallies has been arrested, an official said yesterday, in his latest brush with the law since being freed from jail along with hundreds of other political prisoners this year.//////A hearing in the civil case of disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been set for December 10, after reports he will settle with the hotel maid who accused him of sexual assault.//////Japan and India have inked a $15 billion currency swap agreement, the Bank of Japan said yesterday, in the latest sign of cooperation between the Asian giants.//////Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed has criticized foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar for promising to take action against him if India provides evidence, saying the Pakistan government had been unable to resolve outstanding issues like the Kashmir issue.//////Farm workers in South Africa's picturesque winelands resumed strike action yesterday, with tension enveloping the Western Cape region but few signs of a repeat of deadly violence.//////Veteran director Mamunur Rashid received this year's Shaheed Munier Chowdhury Award.

The extremities of North Pole itself are such that the thought of going deep sea diving there seems maddening. However, once the question emerges, one can't help but keep wondering.

And there were all the reasons behind this disappointment. His imprisonment by the Ayub Khan military regime came as a clear shock to him, indeed to people all across what used to be East and West Pakistan. That an individual of Suhrawardy's stature could be hauled away to prison, could be humiliated by a man who to all intents and purposes was an upstart in Pakistan's increasingly chaotic politics was a reality no one had imagined could happen. Suhrawardy was not quite the same man after he was freed from jail.

It was something that as a young child I accepted, not knowing it was unusual. My brother, who died in 1999 at the age of 55, was severely mentally handicapped with Down's Syndrome and learnt to walk when he was 6 years old and was not able to speak. I should emphasise, however, that he had a definite character and personality and at the residential home at which he lived he was a useful, helpful, and cheerful member of society.//////
