manner. Today nearly 10% of the country's population live in Dhaka. The pressure of population is increasing every day. Our country does not have the resource or the means to maintain such a mega city with the required facilities. Our traffic system is terrible and even after massive investment in underground trains and multi-storeyed overhead roads the situation will only marginally improve. It will not be considered satisfactory. Then there is shortage of electricity, water, gas and other essential services. Most of the multi-storeyed housing complexes will not be able to withstand a earthquake of the magnitude that struck China recently. We are in the earthquake zone. The last major earthquake to hit the city was nearly 100 years ago and another major earthquake is due any time. Should a earthquake strike Dhaka city, it will become a city of rubbles. There will be huge loss of life and property.//////The garment industry has become the main export sector and a major source of foreign exchange in Bangladesh over the years.

Though some banks provide education loan but such loans are not easy to get. //////While chasing the target of 233, Bangladeshi batsmen could not face the challenge. Towards the end of the match, when defeat of Bangladesh was certain I switched on to Bangladesh Betar commentary of the match as the electricity went off. The commentator was showering praises on Md. Ashraful for the innings he played using such words which were an exaggeration, to say he least. It seemed that Bangladesh was in a winning position where Ashraful played an epic innings creating history in the world of cricket. It's obviously a positive thing that our captain is back to form. But I have enough doubt whether that particular innings of Md. Ashraful had anything that could make it a memorable one. All he could do was to decrease the margin of defeat and not for a moment it seemed that he (or his boys) was competing for a win. It would be a lot better if Bangladesh could manage 163 in 30 overs for all ten wickets. But praises showered by the commentator were really beyond my understanding as if getting a fifty is the best achievement a batsman could have. //////Being an optimistic citizen, I always think that this is the time we can overcome the political unrest, but now we observe new clouds on the horizon. //////The report by Rashidul Hassan, published on June 8, about Air Arabia starting flights from Dhaka to Middle East destinations can be a serious threat to Biman's near monopoly on these routes. Though Air Arabia is a low cost airline, Biman's passenger handling starting at check-in counter is in no way better; maybe even worse than the new low cost carrier! Their edge however will be the cheaper fare as reported.//////The World Youth Student & Educational (WYSE) Travel Confederation is a non-profit organisation that represents the world's leading youth travel and student travel.

While the recipients of the accolades are no doubt deserving, I have a feeling that these awards have missed out on two points.//////The city's main roads do not have any rickshaws to be blamed for the traffic congestions. For example, five kilometer distance from Mohakhali Flyover to Dhanmondi road # 32 on a Friday takes 10 minutes, whereas the same route on a weekday will take around 45-60 minutes. Now I do not see any rickshaws for this congestion. It's simply because we have too many vehicles on the roads and the number of roads are limited. Moreover, the drivers of the cars (as majority of the vehicles plying on this particular route are cars) need to be educated by the person(s) sitting on the backseat The owner(s). Now the question is, is the car owner himself aware of the traffic rules? I personally believe they are not. I have seen many times the owner honking for no reason on a red light, taking over another vehicle from the wrong side and parking the car in a no parking zone. //////I refer to the suggestion of Rayhan Uddin from Chittagong under the above heading (June 12) to amend Article 97 of the Constitution because it apparently conflicts with Article 96. The recommendation of Supreme Judicial Council is required to remove any Judge (Article 96) whereas the President can remove the Chief Justice without any such recommendation if the President is satisfied that the "Chief Justice, on account of absence, illness, or any other cause is unable to perform his functions".//////A very common and popular topic of talk show discussion is rationalizing the direct interference of diplomats in our political matters. One of such discussions was held in the GP Tmatra recently. The participants were a former adviser of the CTG and an educationist-cum-diplomat. It is nice to hear them pointing out at the weaknesses of the country to firmly handle such so-called diplomatic indiscipline. The other catch ward we hear is: It is a breach of Geneva Convention. If it is a real breach of Geneva Convention, why Bangladesh cannot seek legal remedy from the UN which is the ultimate custodian of this Convention ? I do not know whether the UN has any role in monitoring the observation status of such an important UN Convention to protect the rights of the citizens of an under-developed and poor country like Bangladesh;//////It is incredible that grumbling, however rudely, by two foreigners about delays at the payment counter can lead to such a generalization about foreigners (DS 15/6/08 ). Such rude grumbling is not the exclusive domain of the English and is certainly well within the domain of Bangladeshis. If such a generalization is acceptable, it is no wonder that Bangladeshis are all painted with the same brush in the Middle East. It would have been more appropriate to complain about the rudeness of the two English ladies without referring to 'these foreigners'. The generalization that foreigners are rude is itself far ruder than rude grumbling about customer service. //////Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist has given a 24-hour ultimatum to Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to facilitate formation of the next government. //////Taliban militants destroyed bridges and planted mines in several villages they control outside southern Afghanistan's largest city in apparent preparation for battle, residents and officials said yesterday. //////Israel and Palestinian militant groups including the Islamist Hamas movement which controls Gaza have agreed to a truce in and around the territory, the deal's Egyptian mediators said yesterday.//////A spokesman for President Hamid Karzai yesterday downplayed the Afghan leader's threat to attack militants in Pakistan, saying that there was no intention to start a war with the neighbouring country.//////External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee met CPI-M leader Prakash Karat for half an hour Monday night and sought the Left's support in finalising an India-specific safeguards agreement with the IAEA - a crucial step in the conclusion of its nuclear deal with the United States. //////President Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday launched a major overhaul of the French military, cutting back the armed forces, beefing up intelligence and setting a course for France's return to Nato command.//////Even as Sri Lanka's defence ministry yesterday said that 11 Tamil Tigers and two soldiers had been killed in two separate gun battles in the northwestern district of Mannar, a state-run newspaper reported that the president is keen on setting up a security council to protect civilians from terrorism. //////Pakistani authorities arrested six would-be suicide bombers last week during a protest by lawyers demanding the reinstatement of sacked judges, a top official said yesterday.//////The World Health Organisation said yesterday that the health system in cyclone-battered Myanmar was "back on its feet," but warned that disease risks remained.//////Gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying four Shia Muslims in northwestern Pakistan Tuesday, killing them all, officials said.
