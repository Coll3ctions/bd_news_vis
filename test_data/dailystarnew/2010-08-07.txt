HIES-2005 of BBS). //////What is seasonal forecasts: Some readers will be a bit surprised to read this article as when the country is dry and hot with a serious shortage of rainfall, I am writing about a probabilistic outlook of flooding for the next few months. This is the beauty of probabilistic forecasting techniques where you can make advance forecasts for at least 3-6 months in advance. In the case of short-range and deterministic forecasts, we can generate information 3-7 days in advance, but the probabilistic seasonal forecasts can produce information for about 3-6 months in advance with reasonable accuracy. However, there is a problem here while the deterministic forecasts are mostly accurate as these are on shorter time scales, the probabilistic forecasts have some uncertainties as these are on longer time scales.//////From its beginning as a small city with a few thousand people, Dhaka actually experienced dramatic turns upward and today it has become one of the fastest growing mega cities of the world. Its existence as a major urban agglomeration has been consistent over a period of 400 years. Even the most developed cities in the world today cannot boast 400 years of uninterrupted and organised existence that Dhaka does as a historic city.//////We sat on the edge of a man-made lake somewhere in the north of the city of Edmonton. It was a spectacular late summer afternoon...almost timelessthe temperatures touching a balmy 25 degree centigrade. Lake Beaumaris is a storm water lake and brown hued ducks were all around, diving for little silvery fishes and critters off the surface of the lake. We spotted a couple of grey Canadian geese too. There was a ripple and a flurry of sorts, all around the water as the creatures played in the afternoon sun, content in themselves. The grass felt firm under me and I inched my feet out of my sandals and unto the mossy earth. It pushed itself back. I surveyed my toes with a certain amount of approval. Suddenly, a couple of waddling ducks ventured out of the water and headed towards me. I was startled! Surely my toes were not on their gourmet meal for the evening! Perish the thought of toe eating ducks! //////There are the years that give a shake to your sensibilities. And these are years you recall with something of fondness, with sometimes a dash of sadness. In 1968, we were young, we were in our teens, and we watched in amazement the way the world around us as also the world of which we were a part moved on, in breeziness that left us worried about the future to be. For those of us who remember 1968, it was a time when the world changed. We changed, all of us, enough to develop new perspectives on life and politics around us.//////He wore his full sleeve shirt over his grey trousers. There was nothing remarkable about his features. But his long hair parted in the middle and ran down to his shoulders a trend of the times. A man on the other side of thirty that he was, his glasses had a thick black frame, giving him an intellectual air. He was holding a cigarette between his fingers and he smoked with hauteur. It was a time of defiance. We had assembled to submit advertising campaigns. It was a collection of men that walked in the cloud. His men hung around him and prattled on. He lazed in his silence and spoke only when talked to. Soon the agencies started to submit their presentations and they did it with great relish. When his agency was to speak he curtly observed that since this was not a trade fair, he would prefer an exclusive opportunity. His wish was granted and it surprised me. I was a neophyte to the trade. And I got curious to know who this brash gentleman was. I was buffeted by a foreign name that showed his baptism. I naturally did not proceed any further.//////Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure child health and survival. Breastfeeding Week is celebrated every year from August 1 to 7 in order to encourage breastfeeding and improve the health of babies around the world.//////Calcium supplements, which many people consume hoping to ward off osteoporosis, may increase the risk of heart attack by as much as 30 percent, researchers reported recently.//////Gary Tickle and Dr Sanjeev Ganguly are two eminent South Asian figures who have been working for long to combat malnutrition in the region.

This resolution was presented by the Bolivian Prime Minister and 122 countries voted yes and 41 abstained with no countries voting against it.//////Pakistan has suddenly become the scapegoat for what is going wrong in Afghanistan. The latest documents released on WikiLeaks (92,000 documents in total) reveal that in Afghanistan USA is losing the war and the truth is far removed from what the Obama administration has been telling the people. The documents also show Pakistan's intelligence agency (Inter Services Intelligence) ISI's close collusion with the Talibans and other terrorist groups. In line with the leaks, British Prime Minister David Cameron has caused a major controversy by stating bluntly that his country and allies cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that Pakistan is allowed to look both ways and is able in any way, to promote the export of terror to India, Afghanistan or any other country. Quite understandably, Pakistan protested furiously but David Cameron did not recant his statement rather he came up with free advise about what Pakistan should do, which was like adding insult to injury.//////The plane carrying UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon to the Kabul Conference last Tuesday had to be diverted to Bagram Air Base from Kabul Airport, due to rocket fire. The 70 countries, organizations, and groups attending this conference cannot possibly feel any reassurances about their discussion after this incident. Peace and success seem to still be a distant quixotic notion for the people and government of Afghanistan, and while the Kabul Conference reports boast of unrelenting support for President Hamid Karzai, there are still many elements lacking in this country before it can become a fully functioning, sovereign, governing body.//////One of the US's leading strategic thinkers has warned Australia that over the next 30 years, China would seek to dominate Asia. //////Moscow, Russia: Russian defense spending will increase by 60 percent, to more than 2 trillion rubles ($66.3 million) by 2013 from 1.264 trillion ($42 million) in 2010, a leading Russian business daily has said.//////The last Dutch forces are leaving Afghanistan Sunday, marking the end of the Netherlands' four-year mission in the central province of Uruzgan. The Dutch withdrawal is the most significant pull-out of troops from the Afghan war, now in its ninth year.//////The occasion of a new book by Chinua Achebe, Africa's most celebrated writer and author of Things Fall Apart, the great African novel, cannot be ignored. It's been twenty years since his previously published book and more than that since his last novel. Much has happened to Achebe and Nigeria during those years, much of it not good. But even prior to those twenty years there was the civil war in Nigeria (1967-1970), after the country's Igbos succeeded and formed their own country called Biafra. It took years for the scars of those events to heal (if they ever did). Achebe and many other Igbos were left in a state of emotional collapse and, if you talk to Igbos today in southeastern Nigeria, they'll tell you that a similar situation could occur again.//////"CARO is short for Caroline Venable. A woman in her thirties, Caro lived in Peacock's Island, South Carolina. She was born there, grew up on the island and knew of no second home. Dayclear, a settlement of the Gullahs, was just a part of Peacock's Island divided by a marshland. To Caro both the places were like heavens in this world. She was in awe of the old civilization of the Gullahs. She wanted them to retain their own lifestyle and live on there in their own way. To her, the word Gullah was a beautiful word, a part of the strange and lyrical amalgam of West African and Colonial English once spoken by the handful of Gullah community. They were the descendants of the slaves brought here by the first white settlers of these archipelago marshes. Some of the elders still spoke the old patois among themselves. To Caro the Gullahs were a part of her home, part of her being.//////Ramachandra Guha gives you here, not the details of cricket matches in history but the personalities who left indelible impressions on the game. You have here a collage of essays straddling various periods of time, articles that throw up images of a bright past. The surprise is that those who may not understand the nuances of the game, indeed may not have demonstrated much attention to it (include this reviewer in that group of the ignorant) will nevertheless end up admiring the write-ups here. Did it ever occur to you that Hanif Mohammad, the original Little Master, went to a madrasa in Pakistan after his family had migrated from India in the aftermath of Partition? Those of us who went to school in the 1960s recall the splendour he brought to cricket with his quiet handling of the bat. Ah, those were the days of Hanif, Mushtaq, Kardar and so many others. Remember the Ceylonese (today's Sri Lankan) named Michael Tissera, whose batting so impressed the girls in Karachi in 1967 that they all crowed in unison, 'Tissera, Tissera, we want a century'?//////There is much to commend in Agnes S. K. Yeow's recent book, ////// It is thoroughly researched, lucidly written and completely focused on its subject: the stories and novel Joseph Conrad wrote where the Malay Archipelago is the setting.
