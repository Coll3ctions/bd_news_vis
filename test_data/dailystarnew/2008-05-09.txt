Bangladesh should take this seriously and be quick to respond to this opportunity. The only ingredients involved in making nuclear powered electricity are water and uranium. It is very cheap, it costs only two cents to produce one kilowatt of electricity. It is environmentally friendly. The initial cost is a bit high, but if we invest a few billions of dollars it will be worth it in the long run. It can run continually for thirty years before renovation is needed. There are some people who spread rumours that nuclear energy is "dangerous" without knowing the facts. Everybody knows that the nuclear power accident that happened 22 years ago (1986) at Chernobyl was due to a human error. Nuclear plants always need proper maintenance. Developed countries have been using nuclear electricity for more than half a century. Electricity is the key power for all industrial development. Bangladesh should immediately start developing at least 5,000 megawatt capacity power plants.//////All the obnoxious things of student politics are coming back.

What sort of Utopia is Engr Haque living in? Does he not know the circumstances that made these unfortunate people come to Dhaka in the first place? I would laugh out loud if the matter was not so pitiable.

According to the author, in 1986 (after the removal of Baby Doc Duvalier), the IMF gave loan of $24.6m loan to Haiti. But as always they set certain preconditions i.e. Haiti was asked to remove tariff barriers from their rice and other agricultural products so that cheap and subsidized US rice could enter into their domestic market. And as a result, the Haitian farmers found it very difficult to compete against cheap US rice. Thus domestic farmers were adversely affected and lost the incentive to cultivate any further. There were other repercussions in the form of rice wars, and to make matters worse lives were lost.//////A breakthrough took place in the history of American Medical Science as well as in the World Medical history on July,1990 at JAMA (Journal of Medical Association) Centre through a historical medical conference, organised by PMRI (Preventive Medicine Research Institute) of America and demonstrated by a young Harvard educated doctor, Dr. Dean Ornish, MD.//////On 26th April 2008 morning, ETV showed one programme titled "Explosives" regarding the very poor quality of milk being marketed in our country.
