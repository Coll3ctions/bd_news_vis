It has predominantly jeopardised the lives of the poor. We learn from the newspapers that many poor people died of various diseases caused by extreme cold. Weather office is predicting another two or three cold waves to set off in upcoming January. It is in fact a bad news for the poor. There are many well-off people in our country. They can pass the winter happily with warm clothes. But the poor don't have the ability to do so.//////Electricity price has again been raised at the consumer level by 21.2% in two phases. The energy regulatory commission has increased the price to Tk 5.02 from Tk 4.16 per unit. The retail price in the first phase is being raised by Tk 0.55 per unit with retrospective effect from December 1. Another hike of Tk 0.31 will take place on February 1 next year. When people are smarting from sky-rocketing price of essentials and petroleum products, this fresh hike of power tariff is really very painful. The chairman of the energy regulatory commission said the increase in electricity would help the government save about Tk 10 billion in annual subsidies. It is true that Bangladesh is facing severe pressure on the economic front. The government has increased its bank borrowing heavily. The government is tired of providing subsidies to different service sectors. So, to reduce subsidies, the government has no way but to raise power price. But the government should also consider the plight of the common people. //////Announcing the launch of the Grow campaign as 925 million people go hungry every day, UK Charity Oxfam Chief Executive Barbara Stocking has observed that the food system is pretty well bust in the world.

Carelessness contributes to a large number of accidents. The news that some people got killed while crossing the railway tracks, or when talking on their mobile phones is very saddening. They had to pay dearly for this carelessness. We should always remain alert and avoid unnecessary haste when working with sharp objects, or crossing roads. When we walk, we should pay attention, or we may stumble.//////To mark present government's three years in office, The Daily Star has started publishing evaluation-based reports on each day focusing on the performance of specific ministries under the title Three years of the government. On December 27, 2011, it highlighted the performance of education ministry. Under the title Education shines with success, the reporter appropriately threw lights on different praiseworthy efforts of the ministry. But I am sorry to say that the minister is not giving his due attention to the National University (NU), the largest University (affiliated) of Bangladesh. Among many problems, the session jam ranks number one problem for which the students are to waste their valuable 3/4 year. We believe it is not an impossible task if the education minister handles the issue properly. //////The powerful media, dominated by the western world, bitterly criticize the Muslims for discrimination against women, which is absolutely baseless and unfounded, as Islam does not promote any such discrimination.

The election campaign appeared credible, as both the candidates and the supporters were peaceful in nature and festive in mood. One group affirmed their election pledges while the other group did the same at the same venue and in front of the same gathering. Democratic norms and values were observed at every phase of the election process such as during submission and withdrawal of the candidature, at the of electioneering campaign. The post-election occasion of congratulating the winner by the defeated candidates was also no exception. We, the people of Bangladesh, can follow this as a model in our national election where candidates, voters and supporters will really act as friends of each other. Will it remain a mere dream or would ever become a reality? We are optimistic and look forward to seeing the positive changes in this regard. //////How kind are the people who donate warm clothes and blankets to the poor for the winter season! But where do the poor keep them during the hot and wet season so that they are available for next winter and do not need the generosity to be repeated? Are the ultra poor likely to have waterproof and insect-proof storage facilities? They also need the security that ensures the contents are not stolen or damaged - and get an airing once or twice. This needs not only people with space and time but the kindliness that does not shrink from direct contact with the ultra poor. In about 6 weeks' time, are there people who would approach particular poor people that they know and offer to care for blankets and clothing until the following winter - and be trusted to do so? I wish I found this easier to imagine However, may be inspired people could develop a system and a team of sympathisers and, surely, mosques, temples and churches with extra space could help ?//////The Opposition on yesterday slammed the Lokpal Bill saying it would lead to constitutional havoc as the Centre would be encouraged to usurp rights of states through the provision of setting up of Lokayuktas.//////North Korea yesterday staged a massive memorial service for Kim Jong-Il to end almost two weeks of official mourning, and formally declared his untested young son Jong-Un as the new supreme leader.//////A showdown between Iran and the United States over Tehran's threats to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz to oil tankers worsened yesterday with warships from each side giving weight to an increasingly bellicose exchange of words.//////The Strait of Hormuz is a strategically important waterway through which 40 percent of the world's seaborne oil transits.//////Anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare, who called off his two-day fast here for a strong Lokpal Bill due to failing health and poor public response, yesterday left for his native Ralegan Siddhi village.//////The Times newspaper in London on Wednesday named Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian fruit seller who unwittingly started a wave of protests known as the Arab Spring, as its person of 2011.//////Turkish fighter jets killed 35 Kurds in an air strike the country's ruling party admitted yesterday could have been a "blunder" that mistakenly hit civilians instead of Kurdish separatists.//////Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Wednesday questioned whether the United States could be giving cancer to Latin American leaders, after Argentina's Cristina Kirchner was diagnosed with the disease.//////A pre-dawn blast at a warehouse in Myanmar's biggest city killed at least 17 people and injured dozens more yesterday, sparking a blaze that took firefighters hours to tame, officials said.//////Regime forces fired on protesters at a protest hub near Damascus and killed at least 11 people around Syria yesterday, even as peace monitors spread out across the country, activists said.//////The tiny South Pacific nation of Samoa and its neighbour Tokelau was scheduled to jump forward in time yesterday, crossing westward over the international date line to align themselves with their other 21st century trading partners throughout the region.//////Malaysian airport authorities have gone on "red alert" against drug trafficking following a surge this year in arrests and drug seizures, an official said yesterday.//////A Taliban bomb attack killed 10 Afghan police returning from a recruitment centre in southern Afghanistan's restive Helmand province yesterday, the local government said.//////China said yesterday a police operation to free hostages in the restive Xinjiang region had left seven "terrorists" dead, but an exile group described the incident as a protest by local Uighurs.//////Palestinian militants fired a rocket at southern Israel yesterday, hours after Israeli warplanes attacked "terror sites" inside the Gaza Strip, the army said.//////Bosnia's main Muslim, Croat and Serb parties agreed Wednesday to form a central government, ending a 14-month political crisis that paralysed the state and blocked further EU integration.//////Spanish King Juan Carlos' son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, will appear in court February 6 accused of corruption in a growing royal scandal, the judge said yesterday.//////Hundreds of people yesterday demonstrated in a square in central Moscow against the continued detention of left-wing activist Sergei Udaltsov, an AFP correspondent reported.//////Two soldiers with the French Foreign Legion serving in Afghanistan were shot dead yesterday by a man wearing an Afghan army uniform, the French presidency said.//////Yesterday marked the 97th birth anniversary of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin (1914-1976).

The god of happiness, Dev Anand, who had given joy to millions in his packed sixty seven years of film life left for eternity. In the world of Hindi films, the inevitability of his death did not diminish its emotional impact. Despite what we know about life, we just think some people will never die.

Over the last many months different BNP leaders came up with different positions vis--vis the proposed trials. On April 2, 2010, BNP said: "The government has stepped away from the trials of war criminals and now they are holding the trials for crimes against humanity, deviating from the election manifesto." On October 5, 2010, the BNP chairperson called the trial "a conspiracy to throw the nation into chaos in the name of war crimes trial four decades after the general amnesty to the collaborators." //////PRIOR to December 30, 2010, strange things were known to have been possible.
