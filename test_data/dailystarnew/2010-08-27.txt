At present looking around us one will notice Dhaka doesn't have any decent/modern facilities which the Dhaka dwellers can enjoy.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind Mr. Blair of his letter to me dated 06 June 2006, in response to my article styled  100-Dollar Laptop: UN Secretary General's Office shouldn't be used for exploiting the poor. Let me quote an extremely pertinent portion of a sentence from my article regarding my invention 'Radio without battery', which states my invention was hijacked first by a British and then by an American. While in office as PM, Mr. Blair found my article interesting and he referred it to the Commonwealth and his foreign office. But till today, I haven't received any response from any corner. My article was published in almost all the national dailies in the country in addition to 6094 websites including Wikipedia. Some foreign enthusiastic people brought out CDs on the article too. Publication in the Wikipedia was done on the initiative of a native American. Actually, most of the people who wrote to me on the article, were quite sympathetic towards me on my invention being hijacked. My suggestion with due explanation to limit the expense of an international patent to a minimum, for the third world country inventors in addressing what I called rich people's property(whim) effectively, instead of intellectual property, was hailed as the greatest invention. Earlier, on the initiative of our present PM's office (previous term), our High Commissioner in UK wrote to the alleged inventor, but I am not aware of any response. //////Honestly, in the last few years did any of you watch Bangladesh Television for a minute even?

Visva Bharati, however, objected to the release of the film; the charge was that music arrangement of one of the Rabindra Sangeet used in the film was improper. The film's release got stalled and producer of the film begged Nazrul to intervene. Nazrul went straight to Visva Bharati, met Tagore and presented the predicament. Tagore apparently was surprised by the allegation that Nazrul did 'injustice' to his song and right away gave written consent, which enabled the film's release. The producers wanted Nazrul to include one of his original compositions and the poet-music composer wrote the song, 'Usha Elo Chupichupi'.
