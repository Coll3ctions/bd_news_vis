As reported in a national Bangla daily, it has received complaints from as many as hundred people in the last three months to the effect that the police have refused to record their complaints which included alleged rape, abduction, attempted murder, extortion, wrongful confinement and various other grave felony. In certain instances people had to pay under the table to have their complaint filed. And some of the aggrieved had to record the case directly in the lower court.

Wherever we go we see poverty writ large on the faces of the poor tattered clothes, their bodies emaciated from malnutrition. Who are to blame for this situation?//////Khilgaon flyover has been kept off limit for heavy vehicles causing severe traffic congestion under the flyover at Khilgaon rail crossing. This situation has been continuing since the publication of some reports in the daily newspapers that the Khilgaon flyover has developed cracks. Thereafter, several teams from BUET, Dhaka City Corporation and LGED inspected the flyover and reported that these faults which appeared to be cracks were neither due to faulty design nor they were posing any serious threat to the flyover. //////The other day at Farmgate I came across a boy selling newspaper to a man who was sitting in his car. The man handed him a ten taka note and the boy did not have change. So, the man started to scold the boy and at one point he got out of the car and beat up the poor boy. Nobody said anything or came forward to save the boy. As I was shocked at how cruel people have become to the underprivileged children, I stood beside him and asked him his whereabouts. He was an eight-year-old boy named Shujon. I also enquired about his parents and he said, My father had left us and married another woman. My mother is sick and doesn't do anything. Shujon is second among his five siblings; he lives in a slum at Mohammadpur. Whatever insignificant profits he makes out of selling newspapers, he gives it to his mother so that she can run the family. Although he had always wanted to go to school, he never had the chance to attend one. Shujon and children like him struggle for survival every single day. Theirs is an insurmountable battle, beginning from the very day they are born. If we are really unable to help them, we can still love them and show them sympathy.//////Nowadays road accidents have become a very common issue in our country. We all know that most of the accidents occur due to the competitive attitude of the drivers. In Bangladesh, there are lots of drivers who do not know the traffic rules but have driving licenses. The helpers always embarrass the passengers. We have lost some renowned personalities in road accidents. Even Ilias Kanchan, who has been fighting for road safety since his wife's tragic death in a road crash, has become a villain to the drivers. Now the drivers are trying to prove that they are innocent. I think if the BRTA does not take necessary steps, then the BRTA officials may also lose their relatives soon due to road accident.//////Syed Badrul Ahsan's analysis of Shaheed Minar Tamasha (DS 26 Oct) was diplomatic and perhaps beyond the intelligence level of the participants, who can only differentiate between a Cow and Goat! Who are then the killers? Are they not: ://////Dhaka City Corporation has been split into two - South City Corporation and North City Corporation for two mayoral posts, but for whose benefit?//////Use of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a widely discussed issue in Narayanganj City Corporation election. The EVM is going to be used for the first time in Narayanganj City Corporation election 2011 for 145000 voters. The EC is trying to digitalise the voting system by using EVM denying the public opinion against it. The electronic voting system was recently rejected in India and not highly accepted even in the first world countries. All the mayoral candidates of Narayanganj including the ruling party supported candidate Shamim Osman have opposed the use of EVM. But EC is trying to use this system forcefully. Many illiterate voters still do not understand the analogue system of voting, but they will have to use digital voting machine. Moreover, the main allegation against the EVM is that it does not provide recount facility in case any doubt arises. So, I think the EC should turn back to analogue voting system respecting people's opinion. //////It hurts when we see many teenagers in Dhaka have become smokers and they do not bother to smoke in public places. Everybody knows the bad effects of smoking. Most of the cigarette sellers in Bangladesh are teenagers who usually get addicted to smoking. That day while I was having my evening walk, I found a young boy, aged around 11 or 12, smoking at the corner of a lake. I could not bear the sight as he was too young to smoke, and asked him to throw away the cigarette at once. The next day when I was walking, he came forward and greeted me and proudly said that he gave up smoking. I don't know whether it was true, but we should strictly speak to the teen smokers whenever we see them smoking. Ban on smoking in public places may play a big role in persuading the teens not to become smokers.//////As per the government decision the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education has recently appointed as many as 1377 assistant teachers in the secondary level for the double-shift schools. Regrettably, a number of them have not joined their jobs. Perhaps they have got better jobs elsewhere. It is clear that talented and capable young people are not at all interested in this profession due to lack of both respect and good pay. That's why the teachers of government. high schools have been demanding first class status for a long time. Teaching is an honourable profession. Teachers are the torchbearers, mentors and leaders of a nation. But honestly speaking, teachers are not well-treated in our country. I would like to request our present government and the authorities concerned to address the issue.//////Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has warned that any Western intervention would cause an "earthquake" inflaming the region, after almost 100 people died in the bloodiest two days of the uprising against his rule.//////Sources close to Gaza militant groups said early yesterday that they were trying to call a halt to rocket fire that brought deadly retaliatory Israeli air strikes.//////Dozens of Occupy Austin members were arrested early yesterday, police in the Texas capital said as protesters face a rough chilly winter ahead.//////Malaysia's former Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad yesterday said that Muslim-majority countries should look east for development models and not at Western nations, which he described as "failures".//////Residents living along canals in parts of northern Bangkok were warned yesterday to be ready to evacuate if needed because of the spread of floods that have so far spared most of the Thai capital.//////The world's seven billionth person will be born Monday into what UN leader Ban Ki-moon calls a "world of contradiction" -- and facing an uphill battle if it is on the wrong side of the poverty line.//////A former soldier from Canada working as a private security contractor has admitted he helped late Gaddafi's son Saadi flee Libya adding he found no wrong with the Gaddafi family.//////A blast at a coal mine in southern China has killed 29 people, state news agency Xinhua said yesterday, in the latest disaster to hit the accident-prone industry.//////The death toll from eastern Turkey's devastating earthquake rose to 596 yesterday while bulldozers were replacing sniffer dogs as search efforts wound down.//////Freezing conditions prevailed on the US East Coast yesterday after a rare October snowstorm and icy rain reportedly killed at least three people, sparked long airport delays and caused massive power outages.//////The trial of ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak which was due to resume yesterday has been postponed following demands for the appointment of a new judge, state-run news agency MENA reported.//////China, the world's most populous country with more than 1.3 billion people, will maintain its strict "one-child" policy, state media said yesterday, despite calls for the rules to be relaxed.//////Voting got underway yesterday in Kyrgyzstan in the country's presidential election following last year's bloody revolution and deadly ethnic violence.//////Marking 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore and 100th anniversary of the publishing of his Nobel Prize-winning book Geetanjali, Padatik Natya Sangsad-Bangladesh arranged a special programme on October 29.
