For sustainable development of building infrastructures various acts, rules, regulations and guidelines are made for strict compliance in addition to setting codes for its safe construction and maintenance practices. In 1993 Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC) had been published for bringing unanimity in planning, designing, construction, maintenance and even in demolishing practices in the country considering its socio-economic, cultural, religious and environmental conditions. The code was supposed to be followed by all concerned as a good practice. Unfortunately, irregularities in every aspect of building development went on unabated. As a result, serious failures of varying magnitude from tilting to pancake collapse of buildings were experienced. The number of such occurrences of various types of building failures is increasing. With a view to ensuring safe buildings BNBC was made legally binding in 2006 by amending the Building Construction Act. Provisions for punishment were also prescribed for the violators, though instances of punishment for building code violation are at best rare. But the burning question remains: who will administer BNBC?//////The limitations and failure of among others Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakhya (RAJUK), Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) and its Ward Commissioners, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Dhaka Traffic Control Board (DTCB), Fire Service and Civil Defence, Dhaka WASA, Dhaka Power Distribution Company and its predecessors, and Department of Environment (not in that order or extent) in harnessing improper building activities have compelled ideas in the past to emerge from professionals seeking to ameliorate the rapid deterioration of our urbanscape.//////After three days of readings, workshops and literary discussions, the Kathmandu Literature Festival came to a close on Sunday, September 18.

Not many months ago it was revealed that the US had put ISI in its internal list on "terrorist and terrorist support entities". As the US relations with Pakistan deteriorate further Washington is increasing coming out in public about its assessment of Pakistan's complexity in war on terror. The rift between the two allies in the war on terror was simmering for quite some time and the Osama bin Laden's episode only split it wide open. The unilateral raid is the result and not cause of the US Pakistan growing rift. The downward spiral begun since the US special force consisting from Navy seals commando made a raid in September 2008 which created uproar in Pakistan. Later, there were media reports that this raid was authorized by President Bush. The US operation is now limited to drone attack which now is being operated from Afghanistan without intelligence input by Pakistan.//////PALESTINIAN villagers say Israeli settlers in the West Bank have set fire to dozens of acres of agricultural land and cut down about 500 olive, fig and almond trees" (AP, 22 Sept'11). "The Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Professor Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, strongly condemned Israeli for its decision to build 900 new settlement units on lands of the occupied East Jerusalem, considering this act as a disregard to the international will and flagrant violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention" ( OIC web 21 Sept'11). These incidents have happened when the Palestine President Mahmud Abbas has reached to the UN with the preparation to raise their demand for statehood. Though 126 member states, comprise 5.5 billion people of 7 billion world population, have officially recognized the Palestinian state in some form, it is still not considered as sovereign state as per international standard. As a result the conflict between Israel-Palestine has become an endless game spread over the whole Middle East. 'The Balfour declaration' of 1917 was the basis to create a Jewish state in Palestine and that is the root of the continuing Israel-Palestine conflict. Though the Arab world categorically rejected to establish such state within Palestine, their rejection was overruled and the Israel state was established in 1948 and the Palestinian people became stateless. The six days war in 1967 made the Palestinian people more frustrated and criminal arson at Al Aqsa Mosque in 1969 forced the Arab and the other Islamic states of the world to be united and work together for the protection of Muslims and upholding their human rights, which resulted the creation of Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC). Although before and after forming the OIC, the Arab world tried to solve this problem by recognizing the independent entity of Israel but the recognition of a Palestine land comprising the West bank, Gaza stripe and East Jerusalem were abandoned by the Israeli authority time and again. In different times it has been reported in different media the brutality of the Israeli authority towards the Palestinian people including the women and children. The affected people were even deprived from the humanitarian assistance from others.//////JERUSALEM (AP) Israel's government on Tuesday granted the go-ahead for construction of 1,100 new housing units in occupied east Jerusalem, raising already heightened tensions fueled by last week's Palestinian move to seek U.N. membership.//////Syed Abul Maksud is known to many as a columnist, essayist and a veteran journalist.
