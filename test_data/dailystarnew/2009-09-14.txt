To any sensitive person the sight of an underage boy, labouring in hazardous conditions, and that too for a pittance, must evoke the most contemptuous reaction, as it does in us. //////HE was truly a monarch in his realm of melody. For Baul Samrat Shah Abdul Karim, music was all. It was music that welled up in the soul and remained evocative of the soul. Now that he is dead at ninety three, the music becomes a memory and the man rises to a crescendo of transcendence in the human consciousness. It would be superfluous to suggest that Shah Abdul Karim is now set to become a legend, for legend is what he rose to being in all the years of his striving for the Creator, for his land, indeed for the universe. There is something about baul music that takes its notes, its inflections and its nuances toward a wider space; and doing so, it resonates in the hearts of those who feel it brought to them on the waves of the wind. Karim sang in the fields, under the trees and on the banks of the river as an adolescent. As time lengthened itself in his life, nature became part of his being. It expanded and widened his reach. For those who heard him, they felt their own world taking on a larger dimension.//////NOTWITHSTANDING continuing woes and setbacks, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party's (BNP) political prospects have, off late, brightened thanks to the growing frustration over the incumbent AL's performance, which is depressing at the least. //////TIME is ticking -- less than 90 days -- towards the 15th conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen (COP15) for adopting a new protocol, replacing the Kyoto Protocol, which will expire in 2012.

According to police, a gang of extortionists demanded Tk 1 lakh from businessman Sahajul Islam of Gangni Bazar a few days ago. Being refused, the gang threatened Sahajul with dire consequence. On Saturday night, Shimul, 25, a member of the gang, came to Gangni Bazar and threw a bomb on the shop of Sahajul at about 10:30pm. As the bomb did not explode, the criminal tried again but this time it went off in his own hand leaving him critically injured. People caught Shimul and gave him a good beating. Police later took him to Gangni Upazila Health Complex. From there he was shifted to Meherpur hospital where he died in the morning.//////A court here yesterday sentenced five people to three years rigorous imprisonment (RI) for keeping illegal arms.

According to the prosecution story, the five were arrested along with a gun, a revolver, five bullets and other arms on July 17, 2009 from Khilpara area in Sadar upazila after they attacked an arbitration at one Khalequzzaman's brick field. All the convicts are residents of Kishoreganj town.//////At least 15 people were injured in a clash between Awami League and BNP activists at Tarash upazila headquarters yesterday. Police and locals said the clash ensued over a meeting venue. BNP called a meeting at Boalia school ground on Sunday noon, while AL called another meeting on the same venue and same time. When BNP men assemble near the school ground, a group of AL activists attacked them and beat up some rival activists. The BNP men retaliated triggering fierce clash for about one and a half hours Fifteen from both groups, including Sabina Yasmin, a local college teacher and daughter in-law of BNP leader Habibur Rahman Habi, were injured. The clashing groups also demaged four shops in the area. The administration later postponed the meetings of both the groups.//////Agitated people yesterday laid a siege to the office of so-called 'Bright Future Group of Industries' at Jhhowdanga bazar in Sadar upazila and locked its office and beat up one of its director. The other directors and staff, however, managed to flee. Sources said, the fake NGO styled 'Bright Future Group of Industries' was set up about three months ago. One Ashok Kumar Ghosh identifying himself as its director collected Tk 50 to 1000 from the villagers promising them training on computer engineering, handicrafts and other matters. They also offered them 'lucrative' micro-credit schemes. As they failed to start the programmes in time, the depositors started pressing the director and staff to return their money. Yesterday, they besieged the office of the NGO demanding arrest and punishment to 'the cheats.' They caught its director Ashok, beat up him and locked the office.//////While tourism continues to grow at a rapid pace the world over, it has not been able to gain much ground in Bangladesh. Over the years there has been so much talk over the 'tourism potential' of Bangladesh. It has become a clich. It is the absence of serious planning and execution, coupled with the unprofessional approach of the government authorities that has been a perennial stumbling block in the realisation of the region's tourism potential. Mere observance of the World Tourism Day is not going to make any difference unless the irritants plaguing tourism in Bangladesh are addressed. Since Bangladesh has diverse attractions to offer to the tourist in the form of its pristine natural beauty, forests and wildlife, rivers and mountains, and a unique multi-cultural heritage, it is indeed baffling that tourism continues to be a non-starter amidst such potential.//////Three-wheel human haulers are one of the most popular means of transportation in our country. But these have become a tragedy for the people depending on this transportation system. During the holy month of Ramadan the service that the citizen is getting from them is a matter of real concern. Not only in the capital city but also in metro cities like Chittagong the residents are getting robbed by the drivers of these three wheelers. The government has set rules that the drivers of such haulers are bound to carry passengers wherever they want to go. Meter has been set too so that the passengers can pay a certain amount of fare. But in Chittagong none has ever seen any taxi driver going by the rule. They always show excuses like their owners force them to take extra amount of fare or they cannot cope with the heavy traffic jam. Today I had to go to Probottok Shoroni from Halishahar H/E and I had to wait for an hour to get one CNG baby taxi. The vacant one that I got was asking for 100% extra fare and was showing excuse that it's the month of Ramadan or there is a huge traffic jam ahead. But the fact was that the traffic was like a regular day. Seeing no option, I had to pay an extra Tk 40 to reach my destination.//////Police attack on the activists of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports is really very unfortunate. People who want to protect the resources of the country should not be treated in such a way, rather the government should have co-operated with them. I am shocked to see Prof Anu Mohammad in the hospital and asked myself whether we live in Bangladesh or in East Pakistan. This AL government always claims that it is a pro-people and pro-independent force but in reality the government has awarded an Ireland-based company the shallow water block SS-08-05 and a US oil company deep sea blocks DS-08-10 and 11 in the Bay of Bengal for oil and gas exploration with agreement, empowering them to export 80% of the gas at a time when the whole nation is facing serious power shortage. Many African countries have huge gas and oil reserves but still they are poor because of the anti-people agreement between their corrupt governments and multinational companies involved in the exploration of oil and gas.//////Mr. Saifur Rahman was a very respected senior politician and a witness to the development of our economic progression. He had always been sober in his appearance and had always been careful about his image before the public. //////Our constitution (Article 67) has the provision for forming parliamentary standing committees. Successive sub-articles describe its formation, function, authority etc. The aim of parliamentary standing committees is to establish transparency and accountability of government institutions. //////All the newspapers including The Daily Star headlined, on September 11, almost the same with the two ladies' photographs on the front page. At the iftar party, the Prime Minister also urged the Opposition Leader to return to the JS.//////LGRD and Cooperatives Minister disclosed in parliament that 81 government officials including 20 secretaries and additional secretaries have been kept as officers on special duties (OSD) for various reasons. On 07-09-09, the government also promoted 494 senior civil servants and asked them to join as OSD at the establishment ministry as there is shortage of the required posts / jobs for them. It is learnt that this large-scale promotion is a part of a major reshuffle plan of the government and these promoted officials were mostly overlooked in the last seven years.//////This govt has made noticeable progress in allowing Indian access to our Ctg port and also in the transit issue in the name of Asian Highway. But can the port fulfil our requirements, is the road network good enough for our traffic? The answer is no. Then why our govt should allow access to a neighbouring country when they have large number of ports of their own. This is regrettable that the govt is doing so much for India, without getting much in return.//////Your editorial on the impetuous promotion of the civil servants of the republic (on 09.09.09) should be appreciated though the language was soft in consideration of the impacts it would have on the civil service as a whole. How could we make the Honourable Prime Minister understand that this sort of unscrupulous decisions would plummet the credibility of the present government. It's no secret that the BNP alliance government did the same thing before. But what is the difference and where is the change then when the vaunted activities remain the same or even worse? //////Let us not say, Let bygones be bygones rather say, Let not bygones be not bygones. In fact it was the all out driving force generated by the last CTG against venality in order to drive out evil spirit from venal human soul and psyche. //////Some problems are created in Bangladesh because of ignorance. I can give you two examples://////Despite all efforts, traffic jam in the city-Dhaka is still an endless source of bewilderment as well as harassment for almost all those who have to go out for work or shopping. The cops seem to be fighting a losing battle and yet not giving in. It appears as though the city will heave a sigh of relief only during Eid-ul-Fitre and not before that. That implies the authorities couldn't come to the rescue of the suffering public at a time when they needed help very desperately.//////Recently, the Indian information minister said that they would soon form a committee to look after the programmes of the television channels and the fm radio stations as allegations are rife that sometimes these television channels and fm radio stations broadcast such types of embarrassing programmes which go against the Indian culture and tradition. In the present context of our country, I also truly believe that we too need to form such a tv-radio censor board because these days most of the private television channels and fm radio stations are airing programmes with vulgar words and gestures which totally go against our culture. If we have a censor board to control the cinema, if we have the press club to look after the activities of the print media, then definitely we also need to form a committee to look after the activities of the tv and radio stations. There seems to be a culture of impunity prevailing in these sectors and therefore many radio jockeys these days are misguiding the youths with ill advices and TV stations are copying programmes being inspired from the west.//////The inspirational report on the contribution of the blinds of Nilphamari to our society published in your daily has made me abashed. The blinds have shown us the path. (Blind, yet they set green mark: The Daily Star: September 4, 2009). They showed us that we should do something big or small for the well-being of our country. They have shown us that every individual has some responsibility to society, to the nation as an individual and as part of society. If we are sincere to our responsibility and have commitment to the country and its citizens we can contribute something positive for the nation. //////Though it would need to be recharged by electricity but still it's friendly to the environment. This new transport wouldn't pollute the environment but it would be huge pressure on electricity if it is uncontrolled and innumerable on the street. Any way, it has become a popular transport.//////In the last budget the govt imposed 15 percent VAT on commercially rented space, establishment and machinery. VAT or value added tax introduced by late Saifur Rahman was aimed to collect more taxes from the business people. It is a different form of sales tax. It really baffles us all how a commercially rented space adds value to the business of the tenant or the owner. The owner is already paying ATS (tax at source), City Corporation tax, income tax at increased rate, an amount which eats up a major portion of the income. The tenant engages in business and pays VAT again on products sold, his or her turnover, income tax etc. The owners have been directed to collect VAT from the tenants and deposit it to Bangladesh Bank. If they fail to collect VAT from the tenants the owners have been ordered to deposit VAT from their own pocket. What a mad, desperate, illogical, illegal and sick directive !! How our tax people can justify VAT on commercially rented space? In their bid to expand the VAT net the overzealous tax people have taken undue liberty. This is a totally illegal tax imposed on persons concerned. //////Advancing the clock by one hour has not improved the power shortage at all, in fact it has deteriorated further, from bad to worse and now worst.//////Ten of thousands of protesters from across the United States descended on the nation's capital Saturday, decrying President Barack Obama, "big government" and big spending.//////President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said yesterday that Iran was ready to talk with world powers on global issues but will not negotiate over Tehran's right to nuclear technology.//////Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that there were still gaps to bridge as efforts to kickstart the Middle East peace process intensified ahead of the UN General Assembly.//////After a huge criticism at home and abroad over uncertainty in lottery arrangements for Purbachal and Uttara, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) is likely to hold it in three categories for the Purbachal New Town Project on September 16.//////At least four people were killed late Saturday in a powerful car bomb blast set off by militants near the main jail in Indian Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar, police said.//////Afghans face dark months ahead as vote rigging claims overshadow eagerly-anticipated elections, with the prospect of a lengthy and bitter bout of political unrest coming as the Taliban are at their fiercest.//////Two Nato fighter jets reportedly flew inside Pakistan's airspace for nearly two hours on Saturday.//////North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has reportedly instructed party and military leaders to start preparing for a third nuclear test with the use of enriched uranium.//////Nepalese Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal said here on Saturday, that peace cannot be established as long as the Maoist rebels do not surrender all their weapons.//////Half a century of almost uninterrupted conservative rule in Japan will come to an end this week as Yukio Hatoyama's Democrats take power, facing huge pressure to revive the economy.//////South Korea plans to train 3,000 "cyber sheriffs" by next year to protect businesses after a spate of attacks on state and private websites, a report said Sunday.//////Pakistan Interior Advisor Rehman Malik has said that Islamabad would hand over its response on the latest Indian dossier regarding the Mumbai terror attacks to New Delhi next week.//////The Pentagon has begun putting into place a new programme under which hundreds of prisoners being held by the military in Afghanistan will be given the right to challenge their detentions, a defence official said yesterday.//////A Kurdish policeman's wife and three young children were murdered as they slept early yesterday in the disputed northern oil city of Kirkuk, a senior police officer told AFP.//////Violent clashes between anti-Islam demonstrators and Muslim counter-protesters in English cities are worrying the government, with one British minister comparing the disturbances to 1930s-era fascist incitement.//////The Yemeni army killed seven Shia rebels and wounded an eighth as its offensive against their strongholds in the northern mountains entered a second month, a commander said on Sunday.//////Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Prize winning scientist who played an important role in agriculture and whose work was credited with saving hundreds of millions of lives, has died at the age of 95, The New York Times reported Sunday. //////Three unidentified gunmen shot dead an Iranian Sunni cleric who formed part of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election campaign in western Kordestan province, Iranian news agencies reported Sunday.//////Five workers died on Sunday after plunging more than a dozen floors down a lift shaft in Hong Kong's tallest skyscraper and the fourth tallest building in the world, police and local reports said.//////Suspected Islamist militants killed five people in Thailand's troubled south, including a teenager who had his throat slit and his body set on fire, police said Sunday.//////Two police were killed in a night-time attack in Chechnya, Russian news agencies reported on Sunday, citing officials in the war-town North Caucasus region.//////An early starter in the world of music, Dinat Jahan Munni has crossed many a milestone in her professional and personal life and can clearly be said to have arrived in the media world.
