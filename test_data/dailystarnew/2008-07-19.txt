Recent incidents have made it quite clear that Afghanistan's fate is on the edge and that the international community needs to engage itself more politically, rather than just militarily. At the same time they should ensure that Afghans themselves are in the driving seat. It is also becoming apparent to the NATO policy planners that they should, if possible, work jointly with the United Nations and the US so that the international community speaks to the Afghan government with one voice.//////WITH prices rising almost every day and incomes remaining the same not only the poorest class but also the lower middle and middle class people are in dire strait. Compounding the problem already affecting every aspect of life, the sudden big rise in the price of petroleum products, linked with the livelihood and living of all classes of people has pushed them on the brink.

Pakistan's hand was seen straightaway. Still New Delhi did not react officially till Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai himself confirmed that it was the doing of Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). He has now said so in public.//////MD. Jahangir, a farmer in Amtali in the district of Barguna, was happily demonstrating to his peers how to use a Leaf Color Chart to determine when the plant needs urea fertilizer and how much to use -- When the color of the paddy matches the dark green shade on the card, you know your crop is healthy and there is no need for fertiliser -- Jahangir tells them proudly, pointing at his newly harvested paddy. In a visit to Barisal and surrounding Sidr affected areas last week, a team of BRAC officials met with farmers who were covered under its ongoing Agriculture Rehabilitation Programme. As part of the programme, farmers whose crops were destroyed, received High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds of rice, maize and vegetables, developed by BRAC's Agriculture Research Unit. The main purpose of this visit was to assess the farmers' response to this programme, particularly the performance of Aloron, the new hybrid Aus rice, seeds of which were distributed among the farmers in March -- April this year, for cultivation in the Aus season. As compared to traditional Aus rice, Aloron has more than three times the yield. //////WORLD'S population by 2030 will reach eight billion from its current 6.4 billion.

However, we have some tertiary upland in the northwest and some hills and hillocks in the southeastern area. Hills, plains and river basins -- all are created naturally; unfortunately, the mankind realizes their essentiality at least after doing much harm to the natural ecosystems. //////"This is the worst flood on record"//////"This is the coldest winter on record//////"The hottest decade in recorded history"//////Unprecedented hot weather in temperate climate the United States has taken the people unawares and made life difficult. It is the effect of climate change Americans are experiencing. From spell of scorching heat to tornadoes to heavy thundershowers as well as flood and draught have been occurring in many parts of the vast country. //////Sharmila sat still in a corner seat of the subway, on her way home, from downtown. The officials in their shining towers had summoned her for a hearing after she had missed two citizenship tests in a row. So she had expected to find herself before a judge. Instead, she was led to a large testing area and handed a citizenship test. It was their way of having one take the test. Silly official people! The whole thing was s-o-o-o easy. It disappointed her, as had many other things, since she first arrived. What had she really expected of this land? //////This is it! This is the book that Amitav Ghosh has talked about and read from during his recent visit to Dhaka (//////, Delhi: Penguin Viking, 2008). Anyone who has been to Ghosh's talk must remember his immediate response to the warm reception given to him by Independent University, Bangladesh: I wish my parents were here to see how Dhaka had honoured me! This remark mediated through a shadowy line combines personal 'desire' with the social aspects of language--an idea which I think is characteristic of almost all of Ghosh's writing.//////Sharon, the dogs will, of course, call you////// The Man of Peace//////By your blessings they fill their stomachs////// with human meat//////In the senate of the vultures////// you will surely get hundred percent vote////// in favour of your genocide.//////Those vile insects, donning their black jackets,////// will accord you a red carpet reception////// in the sandy desert land,//////for, you have given them as a present////// a favourable land, slippery with blood.//////Sunset like copper pots and pans//////Slowly the grey settles in beneath//////The waters of a scummy ditch,//////Country liquor, sweeper colony,//////Evenings shaped by formless revelry//////Aimless talk, smattering of small shops//////As afternoon fog//////Bumps in like a herd of unfenced swine. //////At least 15 percent of couples usually experience some degree of infertility with all of its feelings and frustrations at some point in their life.

Professor Shamsuddin Ahmed will be present as chairperson on the occasion. Interested doctors are invited to join the workshop.//////THE Unites States is in a position to consolidate a long-term relationship with India, edge Pakistan away from chaos, prevent another regional war, and address such important issues as the spread of nuclear weapons, terrorism and China's regional role. United States looks at enormous economic profits. India has a population of more than 1 billion, which means a big market. India has already become the third largest economy in Asia after Japan and China. Then, the China factor is a strong boost to US- India relations. A US think-tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, recently issued a report on the US agenda with regard to the rising power of India namely India as a New Global Power: An Action Agenda for the United States. Similarly, the opening of the Indian economy has also encouraged India's civil society to expand its interactions especially exports with the United States. //////THE Editor of Newsweek International has categorically spelt out "What Obama Should Say on Iraq." This is necessary as Zakaria prophesies that 'were he elected, the war would be his biggest and most immediate problem..he.will need to implement a serious policy on Iraq..that is. informed by the conditions on the ground to-day.'//////HOPE for peace and progress under emerging democracy in Pakistan is being increasingly mired in violence and uncertainty. The Afghan inferno is sucking the neighbourhood. Fighting terrorism continues to be the top agenda of the PPP government. The latest bombing in Karachi, Islamabad and the offensive in Khyber area to evade insurgent pressure on Peshawar, the capital city of the frontier province, are the signs that containing terrorists through war and ceasefire is far from achieved. That Americans have advised Pakistan to concentrate on antiterrorist operations and not to waste energy on the removal of president Musharraf is the strongest indicator of the ground reality. The continuation of President Musharraf and failing to allow the judges to get back to the courts within 100 days are signs that corrections of the military regime may have to wait longer.////// is quite a few strands of thought coming together. And with Hasnat Abdul Hye's telling of the tale, or tales as the case may be, there is a feeling that readers will get to enjoy vicariously the experiences he relates in these accounts of his life. Ah, but then the writer, or perhaps a reader, might protest. Whoever said these accounts relate to Hye's life as he lived them between 1943 and 1954? There is --- isn't there? --- a narrator here, one who speaks impersonally, in third person singular? You do not get to spot Hye anywhere. It is always a 'he', always 'his' world of experience. And there lies the charm in the tale. //////Sometimes Bangladesh seems like a literary wasteland. No time-winning fiction gets published. No new writers are promoted. Despite being a pro-stalwart literary area, none of the established novelists makes it a point to write in such a way that people read them, get back their lost reading habits. Too many people here exhaust themselves wrestling with poetry. Or is it? Do they find composing poems easier than writing short stories or novels? Writers who show potentials of writing good fiction spend most of their time writing newspaper columns on politics.//////In democracy, the institution of election is held in high esteem. Democracy theorists consider this institution greatly essential not only for political legitimacy of the rulers and stability of the political order but also for integration of societal arrangement, system capability, participatory behavior and above all political institutionalization. It is through the means of election that the politicians bolster their assurance to deal with the crises involved in the process of nation and state building. The essence of this commitment is general agreement on the rule of the game of politics that in turn establishes trust in the election process and peaceful transfer of state power. //////It is never difficult to lampoon a particularly flamboyant politician. In the United States, Richard Nixon was the subject of numerous novels, both while he was in office and shortly thereafter. Bill Clinton was the hero of //////, published anonymously early in his presidency. George Bush has been satirized on stage in two devastating dramas--and certainly more are in the works. American (and Western) writers certainly have no lock on the tradition. One thinks immediately of Nigeria's greatest writers--Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka--both of whom have borrowed lead characters from real life. The list is actually endless, once it is opened up to Latin America and Asia.//////
