In broad measure, the prime ministerial visit as also the flurry of diplomatic activities observed in the nearly two years the government has been in office reflects a clear emphasis on a strengthening and reshaping of foreign policy priorities by the administration. It goes without saying that in these times, a nation's global significance depends in large measure on how it utilizes the opportunities which diplomacy opens up before it. From that perspective Sheikh Hasina's visits to Belgium, Russia and Japan, as her earlier visits to India and elsewhere, can be looked upon as an opening of new windows for the country.//////The food ministry is preparing to stock up granaries with quick imports. This preparation is due to delayed monsoon and less-than-average rainfall that is casting uncertainties over the expected output in Aman production in the southern districts. It is indeed worrying that the foodgrains stock has almost halved over the past year. It was 7.19 lakh tonnes in August 2010, compared to 13.75 lakh tonnes in the same period last year; and within the time limit set for the procurement drive, the government could buy only 4.66 lakh tonnes of rice. That is what the food ministry noted in a report to the purchase committee a few months ago. //////Probably the expectation of fending off the hattrick ball got to Christopher Mpofu. The tall strapping paceman from the small town of Plumtree in southern Zimbabwe looked ill at ease wearing pads and helmet as he traipsed to the middle. The noise at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium was a deafening cacophony as skipper Shakib Al Hasan moved Junaed Siddiqui to first slip and Rokibul Hasan under the helmet at silly mid-off. The No 11 took strike, unusually wearing bowling boots rather than the half-spiked options for the batsmen.//////With two changes to the team Bangladesh bounced back strongly in the series by securing a convincing six-wicket victory in the second game thanks to the batsmen who didn't let down the bowlers' efforts as in the first game.//////The 1992 World Cup. held in Australia and New Zealand, saw many innovations that had appeared in the intervening period between the last tournament and the current one. Most of the 39 matches were day-night affairs, with players wearing coloured uniforms that had the players' names emblazoned on the back. For the first time, the balls used were white, and unlike today, there was a separate ball for each end to guard against the ball becoming too dirty and dark to spot in the night sky. Rules for the thirty yard fielding circle, introduced in the previous World Cup were refined; now only two fielders were allowed outside the circle during the first fifteen overs. After the fifteen overs, the old rule of four fielders inside the ring at all times applied.//////James Anderson reduced Australia to their worst start to a Test innings in 60 years and despite a stirring fightback from Michael Hussey, England remained well on top after the opening day in Adelaide. Few venues in the world are kinder to batsmen than Adelaide Oval, and after winning the toss on a 34-degree day, for Australia to be dismissed for 245 before stumps was not only sub-par, it was potentially ruinous. //////The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has decided to reward five Bangladeshi football organisers with gold and silver awards for their contribution to the game and their long association with the Bangladesh Football Federation.//////Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o has lost his appeal against a three-match Serie A ban for headbutting but a 30,000 euro ($39,570) fine has been dropped, the Italian soccer federation said in the statement on Thursday.//////Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar will be competing with the likes of tennis star Rafael Nadal and Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel for the 2011 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award. //////Pakistan's one-day captain Shahid Afridi said Friday he was not fully satisfied with preparations for next year's World Cup, acknowledging low expectations of victory.//////The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is indulging in favouritism in the national team's selection, by including its "blue-eyed players" in the squads and showing the door to the rest, a Pakistani newspaper has said. //////India might be comfortably placed to wrap up the five-match series going into the third ODI against New Zealand with a 2-0 lead on Saturday, but skipper Gautam Gambhir warned Friday about the dangers of complacency creeping into the mindset of his team.//////Siddikur Rahman was placed 32nd on the leaderboard with a par score of 144 and six shot off the leaders after two rounds of play in the Hero Honda Indian Open at the Delhi Golf Club yesterday.//////It was all one-way traffic at Pallekele Stadium as rain dominated proceedings on day three. An intense period of sustained drizzle, highlighted by two spectacular, heavy downpours meant that most of the players didn't even arrive at the ground and the media twiddled their thumbs for much of the day. //////Garpara Association emerged champions in the Second Division Football League with a convincing 3-1 win over Kowri KCH Muslim Sporting Club at the Shahid Miraz-Tapan Stadium in Manikganj yesterday.//////Former West Indian captain Brian Lara wants to take part in the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) next year after ending his three-year retirement from cricket recently.//////President Dmitry Medvedev wrote "Hurray!" on his blog Thursday and his prime minister hailed both his country and FIFA as Russia rejoiced in the honour of finally being picked to stage the World Cup.//////Cristiano Ronaldo is likely to make Real Madrid's home clash with Valencia on Saturday, after pulling out of Spain/Portugal's bid presentation for the 2018 World Cup finals to focus on recovery from a bruised right ankle. //////Liverpool, Paris St Germain, Besiktas, Dynamo Kiev, Sparta Prague and Villarreal reached the knockout stages of the Europa League on Thursday in contrasting fashions. Freezing temperatures continued across Europe but the hardy souls who braved the weather were treated to a flurry of goals.//////"I think it was the wrong decision."//////Manchester United's bid to maintain their position on the top of the Premier League with victory at Blackpool on Saturday is in danger of being scuppered by the freezing temperatures in England.//////Twenty-two members of the FIFA Executive Committee were entitled to vote in the race for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups with 12 votes needed for an absolute majority and therefore to obtain the right to host the World Cup.//////Former Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane said Thursday he was "upset" that Spain and Portugal's joint bid to host the 2018 World Cup had failed but was "very pleased" with the choice of Qatar to host the tournament in 2022.//////Real Madrid want to replace the injured Gonzalo Higuain in the winter transfer window with Wolfsburg's Bosnian star Edin Dzeko a key target, Spanish media reported Friday.//////Pragati Industries Limited (PIL), the lone state-run automobile assembling industry of the country, has started assembling Mitsubishi's most modern Pajero jeep in Bangladesh.//////Considering the country's extreme vulnerability to the effects of climate change, an integrated green economy system needs to be introduced to cope with the challenge.//////A cyclist in his odyssey on pedal from Teknaf to Tetulia in 65 days is now in the city with a message to "save the nature."//////I love the Laxmi Bazar neighbourhood because children from local schools fill the street, and they happily pose for a photo. During one of my visits, I was walking with my camera when I noticed a man on the footpath close to St. Gregory's. His unusual attire caught my attention.

of the country, is being held at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Titled 'Cultural Diversity Festival 2010', the programme began on December 2. //////Noted Bangladeshi theatre personality Kamaluddin Nilu is directing an international production titled Giddagasas (Prison).

Through the show, Chhayanaut opened its doors to theatre enthusiasts in the city. The venue will have theatre performances regularly from now on. //////Leading Bengali daily Prothom Alo celebrated its 12th anniversary at regional level at a community centre in Rajshahi last Wednesday night. //////There is no denying that criminal offences cause worries in the minds of citizens and thus it was not surprising for many concerned Bangladeshis to be worried about the increasing incidents of the so-called eve-teasing. There was widespread criticism of the lack of speedy and prompt action from the authority in tackling the offence and the offenders. One remedy that followed the public outcry was the application of summary trials to counter this dimension of juvenile delinquency.//////However strident the voice of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, it lacked the ring of sincerity. She had to defend the indefensible but she could have been more transparent and more forthcoming on the leakage of the US classified documents (popularly known as WikiLeaks expose). This might have revived confidence among the countries which the United States has hurt. They would have got some justification to give it the benefit of doubt.//////In a bid to curb the loss of the world's species due to human activity at a rate some experts put at 1,000 times the natural progression, the United Nations marked 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity. //////I have been to Houston and other American cities. Europe too. Traffic is fast. People wait for the traffic signal to walk. They are so disciplined.There are few people walking anyways. When will our city become like that? Possibly never. Not with people like this. Not with so many people.They are not fit for a modern city." //////GOT an Email ad urging me to buy tickets for a theatre show called "Insane in the Brain." The blurb said, "Violent and sad!" Isn't it strange what people choose to boast about?//////Tropical forests are considered the most endangered due to deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, shifting cultivation, clear cut, illegal logging and other types of anthropogenic disturbances. Now these forests consist of only 10% of their former areas and 12% of their former primary vegetations. About 1.8% (in Amazonian forests, probably 2.6%) of the tropical forests is disappearing annually. These rates indicate that one Florida per year is being destroyed; one football field is logged per second. Tropical forests are also subject to destructive natural forces -- cyclones, landslides, floods, mud flows, volcanic eruptions, fire, drought, and climate change.//////When natural disasters strike, they hit poor communities first and worst. And since women make up an estimated 70 percent of those living below the poverty line, they are most likely to bear the heaviest burdens. //////Hillol jumped over the railway track. The train was approaching and the gate had been shut. The gateman could not keep up with the little rogue. Merely telling him off was not enough. Like a dragon-fly he flung himself all over the place and feared no one's scolding. One who was so carefree outside would definitely fear no one at home! In spite of everyone's spanking, he remained cheery twentyfour hours a day. No, not exactly twenty-four hours, he laughed away till he went to sleep. //////There are great loves that make the world go round. And if you think of the relationships that have impacted on history, or made some dents in the way the world carries itself, you need to go back to how Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir longed for each other's company. They loved greatly, and they contributed hugely to the shaping of literary and philosophical perceptions among their contemporaries and in the young who flocked to listen to their discourses. //////Mati by name and major general by age fifty five, he had a tough life. At the time of his death he was adjutant general at army headquarters. He had lived hard, and had always been a bit of a loner, spending time regularly in a quiet corner of the room with a cigarette. He was a devout Muslim, a loving husband and a caring father. He had been in the army, fought for the liberation of Bangladesh. A grateful nation conferred the Bir Protik gallantry award on him for his bravery in 1971. But he always told young people, There's nothing special about me; it is all about determination and it is self-belief that makes you a soldier. There's nothing ever more satisfying than serving your country as a soldier. //////When the support of ground under feet//////dissolves away, darkness devoid of love comes closer//////from all around.//////Playing restless hide and seek, unbridled memory //////cannot hide the mind for long.//////Once overpowered with the heatless light//////of the parasite moon, the one, that took rest//////in the eyes, took it for his rebirth, the yard of autumn.//////The sculptor of earthen myths has understood,//////but the one who has passed his only life//////being a parasite//////has not.//////Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality. Globally, 6 percent of deaths are attributed to physical inactivity. It is estimated as being the principle cause for approximately 2125 percent of breast and colon cancers, 27 percent of diabetes and 30 percent of heart disease burden.//////Sufferings from neck pain, back pain and many other work related musculoskeletal disorders like tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome and tennis elbow are very common among many corporate officials and workers at different office and industries. This is specifically a problem in garments industries, tanneries and textile factories in Bangladesh.//////A negative caloric effect means that the number of calories your body has to expend to chew, digest, metabolise and eliminate the food is more than it gains from the food itself.//////Not only courtesy, but beating also begins at home. It has been proved that discipline without shouting or spanking offers effective, practical and non-violent options for correcting the most common behavioural problems of children.//////People whose arteries (blood vessels) get blocked due to cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes may now get a quicker treatment as a high-powered laser, which unblocks or clear arteries in minutes, has been designed in the UK.//////Our life is fraught with stories of mission and intermission. Both missions and intermissions are polyphonic. Deleterious missions of destroying the environment of collective well-being through commercializing process call for salvaging mission of social activism. Intermission on the other hand is both a desired and unwanted procedure of action. It is understood both as the deliberation process of our action having to do with environmental degradation as well as our lack of concern amongst other things for the vegetation. It is in the phase of intermission (understood in the second sense) that the depraved stories are woven around the theme of denial which has a direct bearing on deprivation because of the commercial destruction of the trees. We seem to suffer from an untreatable amnesia regarding the importance of trees in our lives. The way trees are being extirpated throughout the world and particularly in Bangladesh is already taking its toll on our physical and mental health, as well as on the ecosystem we live in. //////On 8th April, 2010, US President Obama and the Russian President, Medvedev, have signed a landmark nuclear arms reduction treaty in the Czech capital, Prague. The deal replaces the expired Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) of 1991. //////Washington: Russia moved tactical nuclear warheads to within miles of its borders with NATO countries as recently as late spring, complicating US ties with Moscow, a report said Tuesday, as Congress mulled a new arms control treaty.//////MILITANCY has been part of the Bengali political psyche. Add to that a dash of poetry, for poetry is what has consistently defined the Bengali, and what you then have is a powerful expression of nationalistic sentiments. Siddikur Rahman Swapon does, in the work under review, the very creditable work of reminding the nation not only of the various phases of political struggle it has gone through over the years but also of the stridency that was brought into that struggle at successive phases in history. The growth of Bengali nationalism, as it were, was fundamentally a rise of gradual political awareness among the people of this country. You could argue that nowhere around the world can you spot a society as radically inclined as Bengalis, for whom politics has historically been a ceaseless struggle against oppression at various stages of time. Go back to the seminal struggle for language that has come to be known as Ekushey. It was in February 1952 that political slogans first began to acquire a pattern, with such demands, voiced collectively by young Bengalis marching in defence of their language, as rashtra bhasha Bangla chai. It was, at that point, a simple enough demand. After 21 February 1952, though, it not only came by a new potency but also spawned songs that only intensified the militancy. Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury's amar bhaiyer rokte rangano Ekushey February and Abdul Latif's ora amar mukher bhasha kairha nit-e chaaye went a good many steps further in hastening the march to Bengali disillusionment with Pakistan.//////ATIKA Cherry is very young. As a poet, she is also brave, with that element of the profound which must define one who is acutely conscious of modernity. In ////// (Dancing, in Bengali parlance), she gives you all the reasons why you should take her seriously as a maker of verses with all the underpinning of imagery and pathos such poetry entails. Observe the obsessions, a tiny sign of them, in the poem ////// (Discomfort)://////THE history of famines as well as of regular hunger is full of blood-boiling tales of callousness and malevolence. It isn't just regular starvation that one sees in 436 B.C., when thousands of starving Romans 'threw themselves into the Tiber'; or in Kashmir in AD 918, when `one could scarcely see the water of Vitasta (Jhelum) entirely covered as the river was with corpses;' or in 1333-7 in China when- we are told- four million people died in one region only; or in 1770 in India, when the best estimates point to ten million deaths; or in 1845-51 in Ireland, when the potato famine killed about one-fifth of the total Irish population and led to the emigration of a comparable number. //////IF Shakespeare's tragedy ////// is a manifest love story of two young lovers, ////// is a mature version of love between two mature lovers.//////
