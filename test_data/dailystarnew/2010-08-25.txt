The poor rickshaw puller Sirajul Islam is not the only victim of corruption here.

Officer-in-charge Amiruzzaman of Muladi police station said, at around 12pm yesterday, acting Mayor Enamul Haq invited upazila Awami League president Abdul Bari and general secretary Abdul Malek to his office for a meeting on the matter. But before the start of the talk some unruly aides and contractors started to vandalise the office, the OC added.//////A mobile court here on Sunday realised Tk 20,000 in fine from four restaurants in city for preparing food in unhygienic environment and adulterating food.

The operation will continue, the mobile court sources said.//////Higher education in Bangladesh is fragmented, scattered, and takes place in nearly 1200 institutions called affiliated colleges, many of which are tiny and a trace better than higher secondary schools. They do not have libraries worth the name. Most of them have a faculty strength varying from 100 to 200 and the number of faculty with doctoral qualification is pitiably low or nil in many cases. These institutions of higher learning perform only classroom teaching, preparing students for examinations like tutorial colleges. Unfortunately, the entire higher education in Bangladesh takes place only in the ill-equipped, understaffed, affiliated colleges as can be seen from the fact that 89 per cent of undergraduate students, 66 per cent of post-graduate students, and 82 per cent of faculty are in the affiliated colleges. //////I would like to thank the four Supreme Court advocates who recently filed a writ petition on public interest on the over population problem of our country. In response to the petition the High Court has issued a ruling on the government regarding this matter.//////Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) said, Fasting is a shield. //////Officer in Charge of Sharsha Police Station was physically assaulted by a member of parliament allegedly for starting a murder case against some of his party supporters. I as a retired police officer feel hurt and anguished and demand exemplary punishment, of course after due inquiry. As per CrPC, the OC is the symbol of civilian authority. Even in the colonial period when OC was a non-gazetted officer Union Jack( flag of the British Empire) was hoisted in his office. That tradition still continues. As per Police Regulation of Bengal, OC had a place in presentation line when governor general visited his area. In present day police administration, OC plays the pivotal role. Assault on OC is an assault on whole judicial system because criminal justice system starts with the lodging of complaint with the OC. In suggesting punishment to the perpetrators, I shall also suggest departmental proceedings against OC and accompanying staff on charge of cowardice. The police officers who cannot keep the honour of his uniform should not be allowed to wear it. //////Over the years, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport has become busier with a growing number of foreign airlines operating to Dhaka. It is however most regrettable to say that the service of Biman has deteriorated noticeably. In the hot summer they are usually unable to provide ground external air-conditioning due to unavailability of equipment. Whenever a piece of equipment becomes unusable, it is left without any repair. Biman does not even bother to import spare parts for the upkeep of the equipment. Instead of buying good German equipment, they buy cheap Chinese or Indian equipment which does not give any service. //////The Bangladesh Chhatra League is now out of Awami League's control. We are keen to know what is going on in this organisation. If the AL fails to control BCL, they would be detached from the general people of Bangladesh. //////The new wage structure declared by the government has infuriated the RMG workers. Everyone knows that with a minimum salary of Tk 3000 per month, a worker can hardly make both ends meet, let alone other activities. But we will also have to be aware of the fact that it is an 80 percent increase from the previous salary structure. I believe our government could have handled the situation more prudently through maintaining communication with both workers and owners. Owners have to take workers in confidence that they are trying their level best to meet their (workers') rational demands. At the same time workers have to be patient. The government should not allow any evil force to instigate the workers to indulge in vandalism in the name of movement. Any kind of unrest in RMG sector is an ominous sign for our economy. Healthy environment for production is a crying need if we want to compete in global market. //////The government's decision of shutting down all the schools with a view to lessening the never-ending traffic congestion, came too hurriedly for the teachers to provide their students with holyday homework, let alone advancing the syllabus a bit to ease the load both teachers and students will face before the annual exam. What is more, JSC (Junior School Certificate) exam of class Eight is scheduled to be held for the first time in November. Having the experience of teaching, I know how difficult it is to complete the courses in time unless classes are held as it should be. So the decision is shortsighted. Consequently, the reliance on private coaching increased by degrees, compelling the guardians to expense more than necessary. //////It has become difficult to roam around in the sun for a long time without an umbrella. The days of walking on the boulevard are over. One would feel the skin burns. The weather is intolerable.//////We, the people of Bangladesh, are living with our misfortune. But the situation should have been different. In the electoral pledge the AL promised to establish rule of law. The utterance of this sentence is now a cruel joke for us. The law and order situation is deteriorating without any pause since the grand alliance assumed power. The latest addendum of their stigmatised achievement is the assault on cops. Where is the end of it?//////I congratulate the writer of this well researched Point Counterpoint article published on Aug 17. The suggestion to shift the main railway terminal to Tongi is an excellent one coupled with the provision of frequent commuter trains between Tongi and Narayanganj. However to prevent traffic barriers it is necessary to construct a sky train mass transit system for commuter trains. This can be built on the existing roads on elevated pillars and completed much more quickly and without much disruption of traffic flow or services, and at a fraction of the cost of an underground system to carry passengers on this route.//////I would like to thank the bus owners association and concerned advocacy groups who have ventured to keep at least nine seats in each bus reserved for the handicapped, children and women. //////Both Bush and Blair lied to the world and to their countrymen and triggered an invasion of mass murder and annihilation of human beings unprecedented in the history of mankind. Does anybody has any statistics of how many children and women and innocent human beings were slaughtered indiscriminately in Iraq due to a barbaric and unjust war thrust on the country illegally by the above two persons, besides destruction of homesteads and properties? The figure is enormous. Those two persons are seemed to be totally oblivious of the crime they committed against humanity. We are waiting for the time when these two persons will face the war crime tribunal for their misdeeds against humanity. We do not know what business has brought Blair to our country where he is most unwelcome. Only business as we read in the newspaper was to meet the foreign minister to attend a dinner and meet the prime minister. He could be a VIP to our ministers but certainly not to the people of this country. We are peace-loving people and hate war and its perpetrators.//////The current situation of our country has made our life miserable. It seems that everything is falling apart.//////According to a news item published recently in the press, the government is considering to provide public university Vice Chancellors (VCs) with gunmen to ensure their safety. A letter has been sent by the Council of Vice Chancellors to the Ministry of Education recommending deployment of gunmen for VCs security inside and outside their campuses. //////To get Western aid, Pakistan must stop propping up Afghan Taliban in its proxy war with India.//////We often say that we are Bengalis. It's all right. I never oppose it, but I think at first we are Bangladeshis (I mean after 1971). People who speak Bangla are known as Bengalis. People of West Bengal of India are also Bengalis. //////As 1000 prisoners across the country were set free from 68 jails across the country, in what appears to be the largest ever release on amnesty for those who are aged, ill, women, children or disabled, there seems to be a feeling of uncertainty in the air. Among those released are prisoners who were jailed for 20 years or longer and have displayed good behaviour. Outbursts of delight and tears of joy ensued as the friends and family of the released welcomed them home. However, there are always two sides to a coin. While this news has been greeted with joy and ecstasy by the near ones of the convicts who have been released, much of the population remains in doubts over the situation. This decision is bound to have certain positive outcomes on the society based on grounds of humanity, but the question that remains unanswered is whether these people will continue to display their good conduct in the days to come. There seems to be no assurance that those set free will not associate themselves with any wrong-doings in the future since authorities have themselves admitted that prisons don't have the ability to rehabilitate wrong doers.//////People the world over must have seen many unnatural things on Television in Ripley's Believe It or Not.

That we have a judiciary ready to steer the country back to self-esteem, to the values which led us to war against Pakistan in 1971, is a happenstance which cheers us to no end.
