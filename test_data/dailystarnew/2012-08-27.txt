In a country where millions of people cannot manage three basic meals a day, how can the government spend that much for a minister who is not required in the cabinet? In Bangladesh there are highly educated and conscious people who are able to understand the wrong decisions taken by the government but. Bur government doesn't bother at all. //////It is unbelievable that the world famous Bangladesh Grameen Bank is being discredited by its own government.//////Our prime minister proudly disclosed to the world that despite worldwide recession, Bangladesh was enjoying a growth rate of 6/7 percent, in her interview with the world renowned journalist Stephen Sackur of BBC.//////Sometimes when I am writing letters, reading books, or doing some chores, I have to stop in my track wondering, who am I?

Having an overwhelmingly big population is regarded as the number one problem of this country, but traffic jam is the number one problem of Dhaka city. It now seems that traffic jam is a never-ending problem. Almost every person who commutes through the Dhaka roads has to waste time and energy every day due to hours of tailbacks. Time is the most valuable thing on earth. But we are simply losing it every day because of the traffic jams. There are numerous reasons for traffic jams.

The row started after Assange took refuge in Ecuadorian embassy. The foreign ministers of the OAS have passed a motion backing the "inviolability of diplomatic missions." However, the UK has denied it threatened to storm the Ecuadorian embassy, though the fact remains that the UK government had issued a demarche to the Ecuadorian Embassy that it might invoke the 1987 Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act to temporarily revoke the extraterritoriality and diplomatic immunity of the embassy to arrest Assange.
