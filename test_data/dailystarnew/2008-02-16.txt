They all hailed from Dighirpara area of Meherpur town.//////Beginning in 1991 with our Commitment to People's Right to Know we have completed nearly two decades of journalism serving our readers with dedication, sincerity and commitment to public interest. During this period the country witnessed many upheavals, some natural and quite a few man made. Throughout it all we stood by our readers giving them the most authentic and timely reports, features, articles and editorials to enable them to form informed opinions. In addition we have tried to provide a variety of supplementary publications, four weeklies, one fortnightly and one monthly, to meet their rising expectations.//////Deputy Inspector General (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddique yesterday said the jail authorities would not dispatch any letter by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia if the content is political. //////Awami League's (AL) move to form a grand electoral alliance is facing differences of opinion among key leaders in the party as well as in the AL-led combine. //////Sharks are being hunted indiscriminately in the south-western coast of the country threatening marine eco system even though catching sharks is banned under the Wildlife Act. //////With an increase in supply of rice, prices of coarse varieties on wholesale markets in the capital came down a little yesterday, but no impact of it was seen on retail markets.//////The plan to set up separate investigation wing at all the police stations remains far from being effective mainly due to lack of sufficient number of sub-inspectors (SIs). //////A day long migratory bird watching fair was held on Jahangirnagar University (JU) campus yesterday without any precautionary measure to mitigate the chances of direct contact between visitors and the birds amid an epidemic of bird flu sweeping across the country. //////The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has filed a corruption case against former state minister Ziaul Huq Zia and four others with Ramganj Police Station. //////The Election Commission (EC) has so far listed 2,054 inmates of Dhaka Central Jail as voters, said sources.//////The stakes are high but enthusiasm appears low as Pakistanis face one of the most crucial elections in their history. //////Hillary Clinton got a badly needed piece of good news Thursday with word she had won last week's New Mexico Democratic presidential caucus over her surging rival Barack Obama. //////Army Chief General Moeen U Ahmed has said the army does not want to see Bangladesh as a poor country anymore.//////A mob beat a mugger to death and injured three other of the gang as they were trying to flee after robbing a student at Chittagong city's GEC intersection yesterday afternoon.//////Criminals killed a construction material trader of Golapganj upazila in Sylhet Thursday night. //////Livestock officials have culled some 65,000 chickens and other fowls in Gazipur and Comilla districts after detection of avian influenza. //////Police are yet to arrest the absconding convicted killers of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) president and an organiser of the Liberation War Kazi Aref Ahmed and four leaders of the party's Kushtia unit even after nine years of the killings.//////The Sixth Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad 2008 began at St Joseph's Higher Secondary School in the capital yesterday with high hopes for innovations and building a prosperous Bangladesh.//////Immigration Advisory Service (IAS), a British charity, urged UK ministers to make Bangladeshi workers' migration to UK easier to avert a potential staff crisis in Britain's curry houses.//////West Bengal's Transport Minister Subhas Chakraborty is to reach Benapole Land Port today to handover 111 truckloads of relief materials for Sidr-affected people to Bangladesh authorities.//////Authorities investigated Friday what drove a former student to coldly spray a university lecture hall with bullets, killing six people and wounding 15 before turning a gun on himself. //////The resumption of the dialogue between Election Commission and the political parties on February 24 should inject dynamism into the otherwise lacklustre atmospherics related to electoral preparations. The dialogue stalled for more than two months due to a legal dispute over the question of who should represent BNP is now being rightly pushed forward pending High Court judgement on the issue -- not taken the earlier decision to invite one faction of BNP and not both.//////The decision to rename the villages of the seven Birshreshthas of the Liberation War of 1971 and three martyrs of the 1952 Language Movement after their names is indeed a highly commendable one. We are also happy to learn that the government has further decided to establish a library and a memorial museum in each of the villages through the local district councils. This is almost akin to paying off a debt that has been long due. Surely this laudable step will help keep the memory of their heroic deeds ever fresh in the minds of the present and future generations. //////The despicable act of robbery committed by a serving Assistant Commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police has shamed and shattered many well-meaning hearts. This writer as a former law-enforcement practitioner feels especially distressed because experience has shown that the life styles of the overwhelming majority of our police personnel are no different from the ordinary law-abiding Bangladeshis.//////The regional security landscape and Tehran's security outlook has dramatically changed since 11 September 2001. In 2000, at the beginning of this decade, Iran had two sworn enemies on either flank -- the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in the east and Saddam Hussein in Iraq on the west. After the terrorist attacks on the USA on 9/11, the dynamics started evolving first in Afghanistan and then later in Iraq. Soon after the attacks on New York and Washington came the American-led international coalition invasion in Afghanistan that overthrew the Talibans. Then, less than two years later came the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime. //////Acivilised society is now 'architectured' upon market economy and democracy, human right based liberal ideology, enlightened civil society and free press, pluralism being the pivotal force to all. Pluralism is a pervasive and comprehensive concept of recognising, interacting and stabilising with diverse opinions and dogmas. It entails that every thing has got its inherent phenotypes of meaning, understanding and implication. Open market economy principally rests on pluralism, the grand total of price mechanism and rationality of customers and producers. It holds that a market has pluralistic customers and suppliers, and the price and production of any goods depends on its demand and supply. The core driving force of the open economy is the multifarious competition among the consumers and producers for the price and value. //////South Africa will put the recent selection controversy behind them and concentrate on cricket in Bangladesh to extend their good run in what has already become a very successful season.//////If the loss to BKSP was a shock, then defending Twenty20 champions Mohammedan Sporting Club's consecutive defeat to no-hopers Kalabagan by four wickets in Savar yesterday must be their final wake-up call. One more loss and they would be facing a premature exit to disappoint their large fan base, who would ask where all the money have really gone.//////Pakistan will bid for a third successive title when cricket's future stars take part in the under-19 World Cup, which starts in Malaysia on Sunday.//////When Graeme Smith took over South Africa's captaincy from Shaun Pollock in 2003, he was the youngest ever to lead the country at 22 years.//////Local hero Adam Gilchrist scored a fairytale century in a man-of-the-match performance that lifted Australia to victory in their tri-series one-day game against Sri Lanka at the WACA Friday.//////All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan will lead the Bangladesh Cricket Board Eleven in the three-day warm-up match against touring South Africa at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium from February 17. //////Dipali Jubo Sangha played out a goalless draw with Mohakhali Ekadash in the day's lone match of the Metropolis Senior Division Football League at the Bir Shreshtha Shaheed Sepoy Mohammad Mostafa Stadium at Kamalapur yesterday.//////England captain Paul Collingwood praised his side's resilience after their morale-boosting six-wicket win over New Zealand in Auckland.//////Former cricket captain Kapil Dev on Friday said out of form batsman Yuvraj Singh should be given a long rope to rediscover his touch but the left-hander should not take his place in the team for granted.//////Kanchipara Academy beat Gaibandha Government High School by three wickets in the opening match of the Standard Chartered Young Tigers school cricket competition at the local stadium yesterday.//////English Premier League sides Tottenham and Bolton took tentative steps closer to the UEFA Cup last 16 on Thursday while Aberdeen maintained Scottish pride with a 2-2 draw against Bayern Munich. //////All eyes in Spain will be on Real Betis on Saturday to see if the southern club can defy their status as relegation candidates and stop Real Madrid all but wrapping up the title by Easter. //////Second place is the prize on offer in the big match of the weekend as Roma travel to Turin to face Juventus while AC Milan try to overcome the loss of Ronaldo in their trip to Parma. //////Arsenal's success in opening up a five-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the Premier League has upped the stakes for Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round showdown between the clubs. //////There promises to be bad blood when Hertha Berlin face Arminia Bielefeld at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Saturday with Hertha threatening legal action against Bielefeld's Artur Wichniarek. //////Sepp Blatter, the president of football's world governing body FIFA, said on Thursday that plans to stage English Premier League (EPL) games overseas will never happen. //////Brazilian World Cup winner Romario was on Thursday cleared of a doping offence and had a three-month suspension quashed. //////Barcelona's Brazilian forward Ronaldinho, whose form has dipped this season, has stressed that he is not a "super hero." //////Ireland named former Inter Milan coach Marco Tardelli as assistant manager on Thursday, a day after announcing the appointment of fellow Italian Giovanni Trapattoni as national coach.//////Skipper Paul Collingwood led from the front as England bounced back from two drubbings to win the third one-day international against New Zealand here Friday to keep the series alive.//////PSG face arch-rivals Marseille in French football's biggest derby this weekend with nothing to lose as the faltering Parisians bid to improve their mid-table standing. //////At Australia's Boxing Day sales there are stampedes as crowds of shoppers rush for ridiculously priced items.

It is an uncertain state which can take any coursetheocratic, despotic, semi-democratic or just chaotic. When I visited Karachi and Lahore a few days ago, I found hardly anyone who was optimistic about Pakistan's future. However, the country is not falling apart as is the general impression.//////The structural factors which perpetuate poverty in Bangladesh include little access of the poor to economic and political resources. Poverty, as a multi-dimensional deprivation is the inability of people to meet economic, social and other standards of well-being. The multiple causes of poverty are either internal or structural or induced (man-induced and/or policy-induced) and certainly linked to low income, lack of education and poor health. But, there is a growing emphasis on considering poverty as a direct result of inadequate policies and ill-designed development programmes, such as those preventing sustainable access to social services or productive assets (e.g. land and financial resources) and thus hampering economic empowerment. //////Recently an article was published in these columns, without mentioning names that talked about a particular family in Bangladesh each of whose members are successful professionals in their own right. The article was malicious, sweeping, full of innuendos but contained no facts. Such a piece should never have been published in our paper, which has tried to uphold a standard of taste and value that this article did not remotely represent.//////Basis SoftExpo 2008, the mega exposition of the software industry, is now going on in the city with a view to exploring new avenue for local hi-tech industry.

While the one on de Beauvoir is replete with commonplaces, anything on Marquez is always eminently readable, and the one here is no exception. The piece on Mailer, though informative and informal, yet fails to discuss Mailer's 1968 ////// which won him both the Pulitzer and the National Book Award and boosted the genre of creative nonfiction to new heights--though part of the problem is, as the writer correctly points out, the unavailibility of books in Dhaka . There are two graceful and affectionate in-memoriums: one of Proshanto Kumar Pal (the biographer of Rabindranath who completed 10 volumes of his ////// and yet left his task unfinished, a commentary perhaps on the amount of toil necessary to completely view the Poet's life and work), and Sanjeev Chowdhury, Bangladeshi writer, editor and musician. Among the essays there is an account of some fascinating research being conducted about women writers of pre-modern East Bengal by writer Shaheen Akhtar, two volumes of which has been published (and which also has been favourably reviewed in this particular issue of //////). There is also the usual complement of art/artist and book reviews, poems and short stories--among the latter Nasima Anis's ////// (Teeth) and Ashutosh Debnath's ////// (Grasshopper) make for enjoyable reading. There is an usual piece on Tokyo's car shows ////// by Manjurul Haque, demonstrating both a writing style and choice of theme not usually encountered in Bangla. As usual, all pieces and articles are accompanied by the drawings and sketches of some of the best artists of the country, which by themselves make for a separate category of aesthetic experience.//////It is rare that an international tribunal awards total victory to one party in a maritime boundary dispute. This appears to be almost inevitably so even in situations where strict application of legal principles to the geography of the situation would seem to require that result. Two maritime boundary arbitrations- the 1999 Eritrea v Yemen and Qatar v Bahrain case under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS) merit discussion. The international law of maritime delimitation has been the subject of considerable examination during the past half century. The history of the development of the law through the cases, starting from the 1969 North Sea Continental Shelf cases, has been well documented and it would be better to focus on both the maritime boundary cases decided under the UNCLOS. First of all, we would like to discuss the Eritrea and Yemen case, which was the delimitation of a single maritime boundary.//////On 20 January 2008, India and Israel successfully forged a partnership in the space sector when an Israeli spy satellite was launched into space by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The Techsar satellite was launched 9:15 am local time (0345 GMT) from the Sriharikota space station in southern India.//////Failure in Afghanistan would directly threaten European security, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned Feb. 8 as he sought to mobilize NATO allies and more especially public opinion in Europe.//////The Indonesian Air Force (IAF) is planning to procure fewer on-order NAS-332 Super Puma multirole medium helicopters from state-owned Indonesian Aerospace in an effort to accelerate their delayed procurement, according to the Air Force Chief of Staff, Vice Marshal Subandrio.//////Immanuel Wallerstein, in the process of discussing accelerating decolonisation of much of Africa since the end of World War II, talks about the intent of white settlers in colonial Kenya and Southern Rhodesia: that whatever the devolution of powers by constitutional means, power should go to them as a group rather than to the black majority. Indeed to ensure that this was so, he explains in a 1972 article, white settlers sought to achieve federations of the strong settler territory with its immediate neighbors, among other reasons lest power be turned over to black Africans in the neighbors and thus affect by example the settler territories. In East Africa the federation was to bring together settler-dominated Kenya with Uganda and Tanganyika. However, the federation idea faltered in East Africa because of spirited resistance in Uganda and the outbreak of Mau Mau insurrection in Kenya in 1952. Now a new book, Rethinking the Mau Mau in Colonial Kenya, takes another look at the Mau Mau revolt, where the author aims to explore two broad theses: that colonial power and resistance to it are intertwined with each other, and that, as a fallout from such entanglement, both are transformed in various ways.//////In this very lucid narrative, Karen Armstrong, by now an accomplished writer on comparative religion with such works as A History of God, Islam: A Short History, The Bible, and important biographies of Muhammad and Buddha behind her, explains how and why people of varied environment and cultures took to developing the fundamental spirituality that shapes the world even today. They did it without even knowing each other, their actions were based on very different realities, but there is a surprising coherence in the core message they left for us. Armstrong writes in a chronological story-telling fashion how people from different regions went about developing the core spirituality defining the Axial Age. In the very first chapter (The Axial Peoples: 1600 to 900 BC), she tells the story of the journey of Aryans from the south Russian steppes into Northern India, how the terrain and the social realities gave rise to the Vedic sages' spirituality which would ultimately lead to the later very mature Upanishadic spirituality.//////Man cannot live alone. We live in society. The love and warmth of our friends and relatives are essential to our living a happy, peaceful life.////// is a publication celebrating a good number of outstanding images of SM Sultan (1923-1994), a legendary artist of Bangladesh. The photos have been snapped by Nasir Ali Mamun, who spent ten years in pursuit of this loner artist and recorded his sufferings, struggle and ecstasy. For me personally, photography is pleasing not only as a matter of aesthetics but for the technical aspects of it as well: the lens choice, focus, shutter and aperture selection, film rewind, et cetera. He is very sensitive about the connection between subjects and techniques. Mamun's themes are renowned creative figures and personalities of the world and his camera has captured many outstanding moments in the lives of rare personalities.//////This happens to be a book for anyone who has been in love or for one who dreams of a world of passion. That missives of a romantic kind can be invigorating for the soul is a truth brought out by the diversity of letters, from an equally diverse array of individuals, in this compilation. The letters recreate a sense of old idealisms and unforgettable desires.//////
