Of course, the CEC expects that for that to happen, the emergency will need to be relaxed by the end of December. //////The prevailing situation at both the bus and launch terminals in the city appears to be the same as in previous years.

He mentioned that Bangladesh received only 200,000 foreign tourists compared to 1 million by Cambodia. In my opinion the actual number of 'real' tourists in Bangladesh in 2006 was far less. Anybody entering Bangladesh on a tourist visa is counted as a tourist. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these so called tourists are actually native born Bangladeshis holding foreign passports and visiting their relatives. Very few of them actually visit a tourist spot or spend money like a tourist when in Bangladesh. The inflated number of tourists only makes the Ministry of Tourism look good which has no economic impact on the country. I visit Bangladesh every two years on a tourist visa and I don't consider myself a tourist in the conventional sense. //////The Myanmar military junta's disregard for human life was once again demonstrated, as it used noxious force to scatter and threaten peaceful protesters that included Buddhist monks.

US President George W. Bush led the international condemnation. He called on China, Myanmar's top trading partner, to press for the Burmese authorities to stop using force. The US also imposed economic sanctions on 14 identified Burmese government officials.//////As a 51 year old concerned citizen of Bangladesh I would like to write the following://////The NBR has extended the date for filing income tax returns but has said that it would not extend the date for declaring undisclosed or undeclared money.

He was subsequently invited by Columbia University to deliver a speech to interested students. I am sure you are aware of the media frenzy this event generated in America. I have listened to his entire speech at Columbia University (http:// www.president.ir/en/) and as many conscientious people would agree, I believe he did a great job. I have also read the entire transcript of his interview earlier this week with the CBS network in America. He raises fundamental questions and refutes some of the mind-boggling myths that the West had been perpetuating against the Islamic Republic of Iran and on a personal level against the president himself.//////I wonder if it is proper to describe Hindu deities as 'idols' as mentioned by K. Karmaker to describe the deity of Goddess Durga, September 27, 2007. (Craftsmen may be idol or "putul-makers," but deities are not idols.) If you do not like the word deity, you may use murti as English-speaking Hindus in the Caribbean and South America have been using for over one century, or perhaps image, sculpture or even pratima as used in Kali and Durga worshipping West Bengal, rest of India and Nepal. Unfortunately, there is no equivalent word in English. //////The following is the leading headline of DS Internet Edition of September 27, 2007://////I am shocked at the recent mugging spree in Dhaka and cannot understand why it is so difficult to stop it!

Musharraf, who is now cleared by the Supreme Court to contest the elections, is going to be re-elected as president of Pakistan. It is funny that both Sharif and Benazir have blamed Musharraf for being soft on the West. It should be the other way round. Musharraf has shown his stiff opposition whenever the circumstances warranted. One fine instance could be cited here.//////Ernesto Guevara de la Serna commonly known as Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928 in Argentina and he was known as the Marxist revolutionary and a great political figure.
