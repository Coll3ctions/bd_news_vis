Nothing has also been done to construct another building planned for the premises. Apparently, the authorities have already cancelled the concerned contractor's work orders on the ground that the scheduled one year period as stipulated in the contract had expired in 2005. As a result, the half-demolished building has become prone to accident.//////Terrorism and terrorists have their own concept of grammar. They define their ideas, objectives and behaviour on the basis of denotations and connotations that are totally different from the generally accepted norms of civilized society. For them, ends justify means. Their continued action and response are not always logical or rational. However, within this complex scenario, lies a method in their madness.//////I know the accession of Kashmir to India is a sensitive point with us. Anybody questioning it is criticized in the worst language possible. I am, however, surprised to find lack of furore over a remark by Farooq Abdullah, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.

With the Afro-Caribbean angry young men of the not so distant past now replaced by their Asian counterparts in the United Kingdom, it was priorities that mattered. He informed the group of journalists on a visit to London at the invitation of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that the focal point of those priorities was policing not so much actual incidents of violence as threats of violence. That was one way of keeping the confidence of the various ethnic communities in the country. And policing the threat surely seemed to be working. In the past few years, 120 individuals suspected to be engaged in terrorist plots, of which there had been anywhere between four and six, had been locked up. A significant thrust of the police, said Bateman, was reaching out to the Muslim community, to those members of it who upheld the ideals of a tolerant democracy and could in turn exercise their influence on those prone to falling back on a misguided policy of using faith as an explanation for their acts of violence. But he admitted that in certain cases, particularly where Islamic television channels were involved, reaching out to a section of Muslims proved pretty intractable.//////We may easily understand the great importance of Hajj from the fact that it is not only one of the five strong pillars (Rokons) on which the grand edifice of Islam stands, there is also a Sura (chapter) called Sura Hajj out of 114 Suras of the Qur-an.

Is it so that performance of Hajj began after Prophet-hood was bestowed unto Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him) in 610 AD? No, it is not so.//////If you ask a primary-school student what they loathe most, the answer is probably exam!

And it is especially in these present, some would say mediocre, times that a sense of humour in politicians remains acute by its conspicuous absence. We are rather unfortunate that ours happens to be an age when, for much of the time, we laugh at politicians rather than laugh with them. That is the pity, given that there used to be a time when men like Piloo Mody, Atal Behari Vajpayee, Syed Badrudduja, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan injected good doses of humour into their politics and left people feeling pretty light-hearted, even jocular, about conditions that were otherwise quite weighty.//////In this age of feminism, reading a collection of women's short stories is like adding more flowers to a bouquet.
