Transports were stopped at different points on inter-district highways to extract 'toll' without any compunction, legal or otherwise.

Perhaps, this year's festival time has seen record takings in reckless abandon. //////The results of Sunday's referendum in Turkey may well be regarded as a turning point, if not exactly a defining moment, for the country. The constitutional reforms package put forward by the ruling Justice and Development Party now has the support of 58 per cent of the electorate. And yet the fact that 42 per cent of voters disapproved of the reforms is indicative of the deep divisions which still assail a nation in the political sense of the meaning. Even so, the referendum is a clear triumph for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his allies. There are quite a few good reasons why that is so. The most significant is that the vote reduces the power or authority of the military, which has for decades seen itself as the guardian of Turkey's secular democracy, in politics. That promises to be quite a change, given that the Turkish armed forces have on more than one occasion --- four in fact --- in the past four decades have launched coups d'etat against elected governments, especially when they have perceived a threat to the secular republic put in place by Kemal Ataturk.//////Shakib Al Hasan confessed that he had no qualms of being lonely in the West

Reported first in Sirajganj, anthrax is now spreading to other parts of Bangladesh. Caused by bacterium Bacillus Anthracis, anthrax is an acute infectious disease which attacks both animals and humans. Domestic animals like cattle, goats, sheep, dogs, horses, etc. are often attacked by the deadliest anthrax disease. Anthrax usually spread by the spores of bacterium Bacillus Anthracis (Spores are the asexual production units of bacteria) which lives in soil in dormant condition. They survive well in alkaline soil and multiply when the soil conditions are favourable in terms of moisture, temperature, nutrition, etc. Meanwhile the average soil in Bangladesh is acidic in nature (pH between 5.5 and 6.5), so survival of anthrax spores is rather difficult. The anthrax spores enter into animal through ingestion while grazing on grassland.//////Society is going to the dogs; in almost every sector. The campus is full of political activities --- of the wrong kind. The medical treatment has gone out of the reach of the middle class. The diagnostic centres prescribe expensive non-essential tests, for making profits, thanks to the doctors. Except allopathic, no other form of treatment is officially recognised. The ambulance emergency service is expensive; with lack of publicity.//////The news item published in The Daily Star on 27 August 2010 captioned Govt seek further opinion of Prof Reza about cracks caught my attention. South Korean Hyundai Ltd built Jamuna Bridge with an expected lifespan of 100 years .But cracks have developed within 5 years of its construction. The govt is now going to give the task of repairing the bridge to a Chinese firm at a cost of Tk 165 crore. I want to know from our honourable FM why HEC(Hyundai Engineering and Construction) Co Ltd is not being asked for paying compensation as per the agreement? Or should we guess that Tk 165 crore is no amount to the govt? //////Plenty of material surfaced to come to conclusion that those Arab pilots were not even ready for solo flights in a Cessna, those flying objects that hit the twin towers were not commercial aircrafts, 3 big towers collapsing under controlled demolition, the celebration by 5 MOSAD agents right after the attack took placeall pointing towards a Zionist element behind the whole conspiracy. The real victims are the Muslims and this is exactly what the conspirator's objectivity was. Ground zero mosque is not going to make much difference in the name of building inter-faith relations, it's all politics. Are Muslims learning? //////Success can be considered from two different points of view. Progress in making money and being able to lead a luxurious life is the point of our consideration these days. But when there is no shortage of money and something takes place only because someone has plenty of wealth, we say, if he had less such a mishap might not have happened. On the other hand, when we think about the rewards and punishments of the life hereafter, then we say, there is little necessity of money here. //////There has been uproar in the cricket world that Pakistan team in recent England tour has done match fixing in the match against Australia. In that scam one Pakistani gambler has been arrested in the hotel suit of Pakistan team with a huge amount of money. It is presumed that entire deal of match fixing was supposed to be done through that gambler. Pakistan Premier Yousuf Raja Zilani vowed to bring to book the culprits of match fixing who tarnished the image of Pakistan. Match fixing is not new in the cricket world. Previous Indian Cricket Captain Mohammed Azharuddin had been implicated into the scam of match fixing. There had been voice of denouncement and condemnation from around the cricket world against this heinous act. People in India spitted at the portraits of the cricket captain in public places where those were available. Azaharuddin had been banned from cricket for life by a ruling of Indian Cricket Board once this scam had been proved. The Daily Star in its 30th August issue in the sports page quoted some foreign journalists as saying Pakistani cricket players are after money, women and food whenever they visit England. The Pakistan cricket captain in his immediate reaction told one cannot be implicated or prosecuted into a case without proof. It has been estimated at least 7 Pakistani cricketers will be implicated into the case of match fixing. So, arch rivals of two superpowers in this subcontinent are not free from malpractices. //////Biman has a captive set of customers in providing the hajj service (numbers going up and up) and transporting labour to the Middle East. Its services to other destinations are viewed as of non-core nature demanding little attention or motive for profit.

Monawar Hossain's frank assessment of corruption at the highest levels was published in a local daily on 31 August.

In exchange, the activities of the Banglabandha port would be eased by India so as to facilitate the carrying of commodities between Bangladesh and Nepal through Siliguri of India. It reminded me that thirteen years ago Banglabandha land port was opened. It was a sunny day on 1st September 1997. A helicopter was disembarked at the zero point from where the then Bangladesh Minister for Trade and Commerce Mr Tofael Ahmed, one of the Ministers of Nepal and some reporters of the leading dailies of Dhaka got down. Before that DC Panchagarh, Mr Saiful Islam, the ambassador of Nepal and the customs commissioner were present. Tens of thousands of people from the adjacent places thronged there. //////Most of the students study in National University. But session jam is very common in this university.
