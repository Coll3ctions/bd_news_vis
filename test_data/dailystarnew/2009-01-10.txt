Though the media was able to get some predictions right but generally speaking she outwitted us all. Not only in choosing the individuals but equally in giving them portfolios, Prime Minister (PM) Sheikh Hasina showed a boldness and a spirit of moving away from the trodden path that is rare in our politics. However, in her 'thinking out of the box' she has also taken some very serious risks that can make or break her government's prospect for success. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said her

the Bangladesh Nationalist Party has decided to join the inaugural session of the newly elected Jatiyo Sangsad on January 25. In a political culture where the parliamentary opposition has generally not taken kindly to its defeat at general elections, the BNP's move is certainly encouraging. We would like to think it is the first of many steps the party will take in contributing to the growth of a new, sophisticated political culture in the country. In the last few days, Begum Khaleda Zia and Khondokar Delwar Hossain have made allegations, out of pique and in less than good taste, about the fairness of the recent elections, comments we think were highly off the mark in light of the credible way in which the voting took place. Even so, the party has demonstrated a degree of political acumen in agreeing to play its role in Parliament.

That particular opening book did indeed impress readers and reviewers with its exceptional collection of pieces and authors who tended to inhabit the lesser-lit spaces of Indian writing in English.//////It was mostly during the summer months,//////when arriving early before class//////we'd dart across from college,//////ducking under the sun that made//////the street glisten and shimmer//////like cathode heat,//////Cervical cancer is cancer of the cervix  the lower part of the uterus, which opens into the vagina.

He was part of the Mujibnagar provisional government between April and December 1971, one of the many inspirational voices in what would turn out to be an annus mirabilis for the Bengali nation. He was part of the team that organized, in the absence of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (by then a prisoner in an undisclosed location in Pakistan) the guerrilla war which in nine months would lead to the emergence of Bangladesh as a free socialist, secular republic. As finance minister in Mujibnagar, it was a difficult job he was compelled to carry out. In post-liberation Bangladesh, his mettle was sorely tested when, as home minister, he was expected to handle law and order in a society where the disorder that follows a revolution was soon to manifest itself. He proved equal to the task. And in early 1975, as Bangabandhu took the country into the Baksal political system, Mansoor Ali took charge as prime minister.//////Eating is a biological necessity, but cooking is an art.
