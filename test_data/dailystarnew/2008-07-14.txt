What are we taking in the name of mangoes? Are we poisoning us and our future generations to gradual painful death? This is a clear case of poisoning the entire population which warrants capital punishment for the offenders. But what a mockery of justice, the offenders were only served with three months' simple imprisonment! Is it the right kind of punishment for a crime of such magnitude? Anywhere in the world the perpetrators of such a horrible crime would get death sentence without any question. We have seen pouring of chemicals (poison) on fish, bananas, grapes and pineapples indiscriminately by the criminal traders, but only this time we have seen that even mango and jackfruits were not spared. This malpractice is going on unabated due to the weakness and time consuming procedures of our legal system. Imagine, only three months' simple imprisonment for poisoning the entire population! We demand immediate amendment of the law and severe punishment to the criminals. Otherwise, those greedy criminals in the guise of traders will never stop such dreadful activities.//////Beaming faces of the students on the front page of the newspaper : this image shows that the students are over the moon as they have achieved a good result.

But things are different now. //////Credit is a necessary component in all sectors of commerce and industry. Inefficient use of credit is one of the main causes of poor credit management. In these continuously changing sectors of trade, commerce & industry, it is very much important to ensure availability of credit. In a country like Bangladesh it is more important to increase credit availability to build SMEs, which play a vital role in economic development.//////The Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU) is located in the heart of the capital city. It started officially in 2001. In fact, the SAU has come into being through the upgrading of Bangladesh Agricultural Institute (BAI) which was established on December 11, 1938 as The Bengal Agricultural Institute by Sher-e-Bangla A. K. Fazlul Huq, the then chief minister of undivided Bengal, which later became East Pakistan Agricultural Institute. Regrettably, the teachers and the students of SAU are facing many problems due to lack of some required facilities. //////The Bengalee sense of humour is much older than that of the now materialistically-developed Western civilization (classical knowledge and wisdom travelled from the East to the West; now in the 21st century there is reversal of the sine wave: relocation from the West back to the East). Now both the West and the East have to meet and live together, in this squeezed global village. In the hot tropics, BO [body odour] is present in epidemic form; hence the daily bath--we have to patronise our 300-plus rivers! A land overflowing with the bounties of Nature--don't blame the Begums.//////I was one of the passengers of Biman's DC10, Flight No. BG 022 which was coming from Muscat via Chittagong on July 3, 2008.//////Though this caretaker govt. is not an elected one but it got the silent support of the majority. The start was very good. It began to materialise the dreams of people by revealing the corruption of our patriotic (?) elected leaders.

It made us believe that no criminal would go unpunished.//////Shaista Khan was a general cum governor of Bengal during the Mughal period. We know about his military adventures and good governance. It is said that the price of 8 maunds of rice was only Tk 1 during his rule! Perhaps, it was not that good news for rice growers. But people in general were happy.

The learners can learn the English language easily using dialogue. In the light of it, it can be said that the English books of different classes, especially for the classes at secondary level, prescribed by the National Curriculum & Textbook Board should be written in a simple language as well as simple sentences. I would like to highlight the book of classes 9 -10 (English First Paper) only. There are many long sentences in this book, which are really very difficult for the students to learn. Some topics of the book where these sentences are found are mentioned here. Such as The Voice of Women (Unit-18, Lesson-2), A Letter From Nottingham (Unit-9, Lesson-3), The International Mother Language Day (Unit-18, Lesson-3) etc. On the other hand, there are also many mistakes in this book. Correction of the mistakes is a must and the sentences should be shorter. Moreover, there are 100 marks for English first paper in the SSC exams every year and the students are to answer the questions on the basis of that marks. But it is a matter of regret that all the questions are not set up on the basis of that subject only. Some questions like rearranging of sentences, Substitution Table, Vocabulary Test etc. are taken in the question paper from other books, though the first one is taken from the textbook at times. //////This refers to the letter(11/7/08) written by Prof. Zahidul Haque dismissing my proposal to shift SAU (Sher-e- Bangla Agricultural University) from its present location to a new countryside location.

When I asked him why didn't they take iodized salt? He counter questioned me, "Do you take that awful stuff?" Yes, I said. Then he got four packets of prominent brands of iodized salt and put lemon juice in the salt. As we knew the colour of the salt should turn pink, it did not turn so. I said that all these packets might not be of original brand or company. //////It is learnt from an AFP dispatch from Riyadh that the Custodian of two Holiest Mosques of Islam and the King of Saudi Arabia will launch an inter-faith conference in Spain later this month from 16 July to 18 July 2008, to be specific.
