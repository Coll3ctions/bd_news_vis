The play, Nimphool, was first aired in 1997. Set in a typical Bangladeshi village, the story begins with a mob approaching the home of the headman, ably played by Abul Hayat. A notorious bandit has been caught. The smart-mouthed outlaw, deftly played by Asaduzzaman Noor, and his young son receive generous beatings from the mob. As happens with crazed mobs almost everywhere across the world, logical reasoning is banished, and it's decided that the bandit will have to lose his eyes as punishment for his crimes.

As the whole village rejoices the imminent eye gouging with festivity, the headman's daughter -- consummately played by Sheela Ahmed -- begs her father to stop this madness. The bandit should go to jail, she says. He is a criminal but his eyes haven't committed a crime. //////Theatre troupe Swapnadal will arrange a weeklong festival featuring plays of Rabindranath Tagore, Selim Al Deen and Badal Sircar.
