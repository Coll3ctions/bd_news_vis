Even the open market sale (OMS) by the government has not reduced the price line significantly. Now the joint forces are planning for a market monitoring exercise from tomorrow that would include scrutinising the purchase and sale receipts at the wholesalers' and retailers' levels.//////It is certainly heartening for the nation to know that the caretaker government means to initiate a process of dialogue with the political parties. Considering the stalemate that has existed regarding contact between the government and the politicians since the imposition of a state of emergency a year ago, reports about a planned dialogue can only add to our overall optimism about a quick return to democratic, elected government in the country. //////It has been said many times in many ways. We are a nation of fickle minds, which are as quick to remember as to forget. A few weeks ago there was uproar over the sending of our priceless artefacts to a private museum in France. Before that, we were wildly ecstatic over the demolition of a high-rise building. We are also a nation that was once terribly shocked by the scandalous appointment of a fake as High Court judge. But then something happened, and we forgot. We lose interest in the bygones as fast as boys grow tired of toys. //////The February 18 elections held under the aegis of the present caretaker government (and that of the present Election Commission (EC)) will be disputed as "rigged." Taking the very unlikely scenario that PML (Q) does not win a single seat, even then neither PPP nor PML (N) can reach the magic 137 number for an outright majority of the 272 NA seats on offer. With Asif Zardari claiming 2/3rds for PPP (more than 181 seats), and the PML (N) claiming a simple majority (137 seats), post-elections confrontation is guaranteed. Given the remote chance that the February 18 elections are really free and fair, it will not only be an exercise in futility, but also an invitation to anarchy. The results will not be acceptable to anyone but the winner, and falling short of a majority even the winner will cry "foul." What we have is a no-win situation! //////Article 9 of the Japanese constitution is seen by many around the world as a worthy example that nations should try to follow if their real desire is to turn the world into a place without war and self-destruction. The present Japanese constitution, that came into effect in 1948, is the only one in the world that renounces war as a sovereign right of a nation, and rejects the right of belligerency of the state.

invented by the Americans or by the British or by the Arabs. Democracy was invented by the ancient Greeks who believed that ordinary people should have a say in the government and aristocrats and oligarchs should not be allowed to dominate them by virtue of their birth. Athenians invented democracy: a beautiful idea of government by and for the people. But like all the beautiful ideas, democracy has some apparent contradictions and the most seductive one is majority rule, and this is not democracy. It is merely a government by and for the majority. Ancient Athenians learned this lesson the hard way. After several bouts of class warfare, they took practical steps to make government involve all citizens and serve the general interest.//////There is a lot of hue and cry about re-drawing the territories of the constituencies for election. Although I feel it should be done but this will also take time. It may not be complete in such a short time. //////It has been learned from your paper (07.01.08) that the quota system in recruitment of cadre services will remain unchanged. It is frustrating news for the nation. A nation cannot be developed neglecting the meritorious. As a developing nation, brain drain is eating into the vitals of the nation for which the quota system is one of the main reasons. A number of changes in the selection system for the BCS exams are under process, which is definitely appreciable. //////I was walking today (10/1/08) close to Aarong and Manik Mia Avenue where I saw a shinny looking blue Nissan Patrol stationed next to the road where it read in bright colours 'no parking.' I was mildly amused and was thinking who is this 'rich guy having no civic sense.' To top it off, there was parking space available next to the car. I took interest and peeked in to see that it was none other than a Rab's car where a young adult and a little girl were seated. Without paying much attention, I moved to a close-by house and ran my errands and returned after around 25 minutes and saw that the Nissan Patrol was still resolutely standing in the same position, whereas there were three parkings open where the driver could have easily pulled into. The young adult and child were not there and I could easily put two and two together and realized that the 'official car' was being used for shopping at Aarong or a mall close it. This practice is common in Bangladesh and most people abuse the system and no pointing fingers at this wrong deed are ever labelled at anyone. This sorry state of affairs needs to change, however. //////I find it amazing that Sheikh Hasina and/or Khaleda Zia would consider going abroad for medical treatment and, worse still, there is an expectation that the hard working Bangladeshi tax payers should be bearing the cost of their treatment. What should warrant such preferential treatment? Are they of a higher caste than other good hardworking Bangladeshis who are trying hard to live an honest life?//////The infamous Mr. Henry Kissinger was the foreign secretary of another infamous and disgraced ex-President of the USA Mr. Nixon. Mr. Kissinger was known for his notorious foreign policies and as the architect of heinous plots aiming to eliminate popular leaders of other countries in the world, albeit not compatible with so-called American interest and or to terminate popular struggles for independence by the nations who upheld socialist values. No wonder, he despised the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 that he considered as distraction to his top secret China venture and as a result not only under his advice America vetoed UNSC resolutions to stop the Pakistan army junta from continuing the genocide in Bangladesh but also Sheikh Mujib found his place in Kissinger's list of the top three most hated leaders in the then world. //////Handloom industry at Ishwardi in Pabna is on the verge of extinction due to handloom owners' economic crisis, shortage of capital and , above all, price hike of raw materials etc. //////When the statues of our National Museum were being sent to France for exhibition, there were strong protests by some cultural activists and newsmen which impressed many. My point is that how they were sure that those materials would not be returned? What pains us is that when thousands of innocent children and women were smuggled out (possibly still being smuggled) like commodities, there was no significant protest (at least not noticeable). //////I was very glad to read a letter on the above subject in The Daily Star issue of the 7th instant which was written by one of my revered teachers, Prof. Abul Khairat Majumdar (former Professor of Soil Science of Bangladesh Agricultural Institute, now Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University).//////The number of deaths of people is not, in my experience, a good indicator of HR situation in a country like Bangladesh. For example, just a few weeks back there was a mega cyclone. Nature has taken thousands of lives. I refer to the compensating effect that a famous economist once mentioned in his theory of economics. Those who have studied economics know it well.//////For the last few days, Dhaka University teachers and students are staging silent processions, manab-bandhan (human chain), abstention from classes etc. in protest of trial of teachers and students who reportedly incited countrywide violence. They are also demanding unconditional release of teachers & students who were reportedly involved in the incitement. //////Entrepreneurs take industrial ventures when on analysis it appears profitable. The same factors influenced a few industrialists in Bangladesh in the late 90s and early 2000s. They analysed the then fiscal policy of the government and found that it would be profitable to set up and operate Cold Rolling Mills (CRM) to produce Cold Rolled (CR) Coils. The galvanizing factories in Bangladesh then imported CR Coils from abroad to produce Corrugated Iron (CI) sheets and Galvanized Plain (GP) sheets. The duty structure on import of Hot Rolled (HR) Coils, basic raw material to produce CR Coils was low. Only 5% customs duty, 4% DSC, 3% AIT and 1% PSC were imposed on HR Coil import. Encouraged by these fiscal policy, a few reputed industrialists over here established some sophisticated large industrial projects, viz. Cold Rolling Mills (CRM) from 1997 to 2003. Total achievable production of these CRMs stood at 7.5 hundred thousand metric tons. In 2003 the total demand of CR Coils was estimated at 6 hundred thousand metric tons. Before setting up of CRMs in Bangladesh, all the CR Coils were imported from abroad. When the country achieved self-sufficiency in producing CR Coils, the government started to increase customs duty from 5% to 7.5% then 10% there after 15% on import of HR Coils. In addition to that the government imposed 15% VAT on import of HR Coils. On the other hand, the basic prices of HR Coils have increased many folds in international market within a couple of years. All these factors increased the cost of production of CR Coils. As a result, the cost of production of end product, Corrugated Iron (CI) sheets and Galvanized Plain (GP) sheets crossed the purchasing power of the most consumers. It is estimated that annual demand of CI sheets and GP sheets has gone down to 3 hundred thousand metric tons owing to abnormally high prices. To bring down the price to a significant level, the duty structure on import of HR Coils needs to be re-fixed at 5% and VAT needs to be withdrawn as those were before 5-6 years.//////On 11th January, our present government finished one year in office during which they have tried, and been trying, their level best to give us a corruption free country and true and fair election scheduled to be staged at the end of this year. Prior to Fakhruddin-led government's undertaking, our political situation was potentially turning towards a civil war .
