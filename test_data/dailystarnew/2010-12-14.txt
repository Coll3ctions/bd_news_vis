The chemical is widely used in products such as antibacterial soaps, toothpaste, pens, diaper bags and medical devices. The scientists cautioned that their analysis didn't clearly determine cause-and-effect relationships. For example, some people might use more antibacterial soaps because they have more allergies, rather than the other way around. But the triclosan findings may support the 'hygiene hypothesis,' which maintains [that] living in very clean and hygienic environments may impact our exposure to micro-organisms that are beneficial for development of the immune system, said Allison Aiello of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, principal investigator in the study. The research also found that excess exposure to Bisphenol A, a substance found in many plastics and as a protective lining in food cans, among adults may weaken the immune system. Both chemicals are in a class of toxicants called endocrine-disrupting compounds, thought to affect health by mimicking or acting on human hormones, said the researchers. The investigators used data from 2003 to 2006 generated by a previous U.S. study known as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. They compared urinary Bisphenol A and triclosan levels with diagnosis of allergies and with levels of antibodies to the pathogen cytomegalovirusboth considered signs of immune system changes. People over age 18 with higher levels of Bisphenol A exposure had higher cytomegalovirus antibody levels, which suggests their cell-mediated immune system may not be functioning properly, said Erin Rees Clayton, research investigator at the school and a member of the investigative team. Researchers also found that people age 18 and under with higher levels of triclosan were more likely to report diagnosis of allergies and hay fever. There's growing concern among the scientific community and consumer groups that these endocrine-disrupting compounds are dangerous at lower levels than previously thought, some scientists said. //////Considered the other "Easter Island mystery," Rongorongo is the hieroglyphic script used by the region's early inhabitants.
