The financial meltdown of 2008 was the worst of its kind since the Great Depression in the 1930's. It became prominently visible in the last quarter of the year 2008. The US sub-prime mortgage market collapse and the downturn of the housing boom in other industrially developed economies have had a ripple effect around the world. The gravity of the problems has been so severe that some of the world's biggest financial institutions have collapsed and subsequently gone for restructuring. The governments of the rich countries have come out with extensive bail-out policies and rescue packages, pouring billions of dollars into the banking system. Now, the question is- how much isolated we are, from this meltdown. Our policymakers might already have identified the various aspects of this crisis along with its likely impact on us. But the most important question is- how shall will address those forces which will have negative impact on our economy? First of all, we should focus on those sectors, which are relatively more sensitive to the global economic activities. Remittance is one of them along with export, import and foreign aid. Globally, jobs have been cut significantly by the industrialized nations. As a result, our manpower export is declining which has been magnified due to unscrupulous middlemen problem. Foreign aid may also be shrunken, as the donor countries are busy with their own economy and stimuli packages whereas it is easier to cut foreign aid budget since we are not their voters. From the media, we are hearing the news of employment decline and retrenchment of migrant workers across the globe. This will continue until the crisis takes a new look. FBCCI has already sought a Tk 6,000 crore bailout package to deal with the situation. The impact of global meltdown is perhaps much greater than the one, perceived earlier. It is like a shockwave, which is yet to be realized in most of the developing countries around the world. //////We organise seminars, symposiums and meetings for protecting children from labour but I am not sure of our success in this regard. In my locality, there are many factory where I see most of the workers are children. Besides, there are also many CNG and bike garages where preteen boys are doing very risky jobs. A few days ago, I witnessed a very tragic scene that hurt me a lot. I saw a young child who had lifted scrap iron into a rickshaw van. He filled the van more than its weight and the scrap irons seemed to wait for a soft touch to make a mess. As soon as he pulled the van a little, all the iron which looked like a mound, fell down his slender body and the result was that he died on the spot. The irons fell down on his body in such a way that no one could do anything. . I was so much shocked. //////The Bangladeshi nation is plagued by so many maladies!//////For posting a letter, I, on March 17 last, went to the post office at Lama Bazar in Asadganj, Chittagong. The time was around 3:15pm. An old lady there asked me, ''Why have you come at this time?'' I said, 'why'? //////Perhaps, no one can disagree with me at this point that Bangladesh is passing through a critical phase after the restoration of democracy. Yes, if we look at the mishaps like, BDR HQ mutiny, helicopter crash, blaze at Bashundhara, clashes at Rajshahi University, we will be able to figure it out. //////For years, I have been looking for a particular building that must be in existence now for over 62 years. No doubt it is a huge structure by now because there must have been numerous additions to it, to increase capacity and to take the ever-increasing load over the years. It is certainly centrally air-conditioned because the contents stored there require to be kept safely in cold storage.//////Many private schools are using the names of the saints for business purpose.

The gruesome tragedies that we witnessed less than a month ago have shaken most of us at the core of our being and have definitely made us think over and over again about the evils that could be summoned by hatred for others. I held out hope that, of all the people, our politicians will understand the gravity of it all and act in a civil manner towards each other and try to put an end to the violence that is wrought by differences in ideology. I don't think I should be ashamed if I cannot figure out who is gaining by these endless fights over the declaration of independence and overt insults directed at leaders who have been dead for nearly 30 years. Our politicians should understand that in a feudalistic society such as ours, where pleasing the political masters takes precedence over decency, they are running a very high level of risk of creating the environment that could lead to more tragedies; the constant fighting need to stop now because hostilities breed more hostility, lest we want to risk resembling Pakistan.//////Politics in public run universities and affiliated colleges is a sad reflection on the achievement of these educational institutions. No matter what the basis of student politics is ethnic, political, ideological or religious, regional or even academic the fact remains that it undermines academic pursuits and discipline in educational institutions.//////Along with the pleasures of smoking there are real risks of serious diseases such as lung cancer, respiratory and heart diseases.
