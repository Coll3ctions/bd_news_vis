Due to infrastructure and building construction by felling trees, and unplanned plantation to at least partially replenish that, the green views of Dhaka city has already disappeared. Now Dhaka is a city of shops, a city without water bodies, green fields and with lots of bad things which demerit human health condition and also the environment. The greenery started declining day by day from both surroundings and inner parts of Dhaka city conspicuously from 1980s. Only the DU and BUET campus, Ramna Park and Suhurawardy Uddyan and Agargaon could survive the onslaught as yet. The plantation now we can see only on the island between two ways of some roads. The footpath is treeless in most parts. And the species diversity is not good or proper. The city was beatified by the British and other leaders of that period. But we failed to preserve that beauty and we ever did not think to do something like them. We have done so called plantation and also political tree plantation here and there. We did not think it deeply.

The anxiety about this is that the United States who is responsible for 20 percent of greenhouse gas emission has not yet signed the Kyoto protocol. With it there is also Australia. But the hope is that many states of the United States have taken different steps to reduce the greenhouse gas on non-governmental initiative. ////// The human task of architecture is not to beautify or to humanize the world of everyday facts, but to open up a view into the second dimension of our consciousness, the reality of images, memories and dreams.

In ////// she begins her search for the truth on a false premise: that Bengalis seceded from Pakistan in 1971 and that what happened in that year was a clear case of civil war between the two parts of Pakistan. In 1861, states in the south of the United States decided to secede even as Abraham Lincoln prepared to take over the presidency. And what followed was four years of civil war as both Union troops and Confederate soldiers struggled for supremacy. The struggle ended with Robert E. Lee's surrender to the Union army in April 1865.

This is how one of the stories in William Dalrymple's book, Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India, begins. This seeming contradiction plays through most of the nine stories in the book: a nun who sweeps the steps before her with a peacock fan when she walks so as not to inadvertently step on any living creature, ritually starves herself to death; a dalit untouchable not allowed to use the water of the very well he helps to dig, is revered as a god for three months of the year and illiterate villagers who are still the guardians of an entire oral culture, able to recite a 4,000 line epic by heart. //////After conducting my regular classes, I go to the chairman's room to say hello or to discuss some important matters concerning classes, examinations or the upcoming seminars.
