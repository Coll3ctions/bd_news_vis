They have been facing acute hardship and, therefore, are trying to manage with less intake of food or avoiding some of these commodities in daily meals and even many daily wage earners have reduced their daily meals from three to two.

She is an accused in a corruption case and at present an under trial prisoner. If she is sick, why the government should be asked to arrange her medical treatment abroad at the cost of the public exchequer is not understood. Very recently, there was a similar demand from the Awami League to send her husband for medical treatment abroad at government expenses. She is like any other ordinary citizen of the country and, therefore, should get the treatment from the government which an under trial prisoner is supposed to get. Otherwise, if she can afford, she should be free to avail any foreign medical treatment, provided legally allowed. Under no circumstances should the public funds be used for her medical treatment abroad. //////Yasuo Fukuda's recent visit to China is a reflection of the fact that Fukuda looks forward to warming ties with China and the fact that by improving relations with China, he also looks to bolster his own position ( in effect, this would help him overshadow some of the domestic problems he has been facing, to a certain extent). While his predecessor looked to adopt a more tougher stance towards China, Fukuda is certainly not following suit. And this was clearly reflected by the refusal of his government to meet the Dalai Lama in November last year (when he visited Japan). The excuse given by his govt. was that Dalai Lama was not "important" enough and hence they could avoid meeting him.//////The year 2008, the long awaited election year for the people of Bangladesh has dawned with a lot of hopes and aspirations. The EC (Election Commission) has declared a roadmap for a free, fair and credible election this year. This is the first time the people of Bangladesh are expecting to cast their votes with voter ID bearing their photos. There is lot of enthusiasm among public to enlist their names as voters. As the election time is nearing the voices of some of the leaders of certain political parties are becoming louder every day. They are dreaming that their old days are coming back and the people are always with them as they were and ready to sacrifice their lives for them as they did in the past, as if they (these leaders) have not done any wrong to the people and were not involved in any anti-people activities. They are trying to make the people believe that all the actions against them by the present CTG are vindictive. They are clean and "fuler mato pabitra"-- the slogan their supporters used for them.//////It was interesting to learn about the conference organised by Scholars Bangladesh at Hotel Sheraton, Dhaka.

However, I believe that it is not relevant to the vast majority of Bangladeshis; except for the very few well-to-do, who are planning weddings this winter. In addition, the same daily, in its bottom left hand column in the same page, writes about the Paris based report of oil reaching 100 dollars a barrel soon this year! More miseries are in store for bus passengers and those who use oil driven transports.
