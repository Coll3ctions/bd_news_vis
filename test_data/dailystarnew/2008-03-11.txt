Tuesday, February 26, 2008). This bridge is indeed a national treasure and can be considered the most important economic lifeline for Bangladesh. To save the bridge, and possibly many lives, and to avoid the nightmare of a closed bridge or even the cost of a more extensive repair or replacement in the case of a collapse, the authorities must repair the bridge immediately. In the past, at the request of the residents of California, the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) sent teams of in-house expert bridge design and maintenance engineers to other countries to investigate the causes of bridge damage and to provide repair recommendations. //////The shooting of East Timor President Jose Ramos Horta and Father of the Nation and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao brings back memories of the conspiracies that Bangladesh went through in its childhood.

Here is why://////According to many observers, in the Democratic convention in August, Al Gore, the former Vice-President, could emerge as a compromise candidate. It may be recalled that Al Gore, already a Nobel Laureate, has since become a grand ecologist and he appears more a benefactor of the mother earth than just a politician of the United States. He has been lecturing on the topic of global warming, which he labels as "the climate crisis." Despite all these, the public speculation is already there in the United States as also in the rest of the world over the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. However, Gore frequently stated that "I have no plans to run". At this stage, no one can say for sure as to who is going to be the next President of the United States although a very few can gainsay that Al Gore, if nominated by the Democrats, could prove to be one of the best Presidents the United States ever had.//////Jamaican Umpire Steve Bucknor raises the question again: should he stand in a Test match after wrongly judging Rafique LBW in our 1st Test match against the South Africans. //////I would request you to write a befitting column and urge the PSC to reconsider the age limit of the 28th BCS exams.

I enquired about what was going on and was told that they wanted to expand the road from building to building. First of all, I would like to know where the pavement will be for the pedestrians. Secondly, this is a residential area and doesn't need more expansion of the roads. Thirdly, with half of Gulshan lake being taken by encroachers all the time, shouldn't the DCC have other priorities rather than to break up an already nicely kept area? I then realised that the government bodies don't normally take action unless they are forced to by higher powers or there is some profit in it. I looked carefully at the tree lined roads and therein lies the clue! This is obviously a pretence to cut down all the beautiful trees of Gulshan-2 and make some timber money.
