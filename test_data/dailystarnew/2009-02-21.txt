But Barack Obama was our new president. Great day in the morning; a new age in American politics is upon us.//////WE have reverted to the 1996 phobia syndrome hovering around possible transit agreement between AL government and India. No sooner had AL formed government in 1996 staging a comeback after 21 years than the rightist camps both extreme and moderate were found active fanning the flames in a frantic attempt perhaps to fish in troubled water. The issue that immediately came up as a debatable one related to transit to India. The then AL government deferred the issue for some ostensible reason. The opposition tried once again to upset the AL led Mahajot government from the very beginning using transit question as a favourite topic of their anti-government campaign. This is to create a lot of furore among the public on transit issue. It is as if the ruling AL is a synonym for transit. The opposition still thins that people nourish anti Indian sentiment. //////Adequate and uninterrupted supply of energy is the basic demand for economic growth and development of any country. Earth's energy crisis and global warming from energy sector, day by day, enhance the demand for renewable energy.

All outpourings on this theme remain exclusively in the domain of Bengali. This fact is not surprising, given that it happened at a time when English creative writing was relatively unknown in these parts, and the truth is it is only lately that English creative writing is also being nudged by popular emotions and themes. English writing tends to remain aloof and cerebral, at a distance from the nation's teashops and streets, and the passions that can ignite and rule the streets. It is only with time and an enlargement of the subjects and topics that Bangladeshi English writers deal with will it engage with the nation's popular imagination and furies. //////Rising trend of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) has emerged as major threat to tuberculosis (TB) control programme in Bangladesh.

The media hype before the visit about possible agreement on transit and joint task force to combat terrorism created a great deal of interest in many quarters. While land transit is an old issue, the joint task force is a new one floated by Sheikh Hasina soon after becoming the Prime Minister that the BNP interpreted as an attempt to allow Indian security and intelligence presence inside Bangladesh. In the end, neither agreement was signed although from press interview given by Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, it was clear that on task force on terrorism, India did not have much interest.//////RECENTLY it has been noticed that the print and electronic media have been focusing quite well on the resources of the Bay of Bengal. Of course these may have different meanings for our people. Coastal people might be thinking that it has something to do with the fishery resources at sea and may be their unending sufferings due to straying over the non-delineated maritime boundaries will come to an end and possibilities of landing into jails of neighbouring countries and thus loosing their costly nets and the only means of livelihood may decrease. Environmentalists may be relating the issue to the ecology of the coast, health of Sunderban mangroves and other coastal habitats. Some of the academicians may be hinting at the potential of minerals, oils and gas likely to be found in the deep and shallow water blocks of the Bay. Some may be worried about the security of maritime areas and the need for proper surveillance through the Navy or Coast guard. However, these issues generally discussed did not confine to only 12nm of the Territorial Sea, over which Bangladesh has total sovereignty, or on another 24 nm of Contiguous Zone over which we have rights to prevent the infringement of laws on custom, fiscal, immigration and sanitation but mostly with another extended belt of water known as Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200nm from the baselines for exploitation of the living and non living resources of sea. It also included important issues like settlement of maritime boundary with our neighbours and the submission of our Continental Shelf (CS) claim extending over 350nm and allowing us exploitation rights of all non living resources and sea bed living beings. The term CS actually brought fore the important concept of the continuum of the Bangladesh's land mass under the Bay of the Bengal. //////In a democratic environment, after a landslide victory a rise in aura of confidence in the mind of the leadership or in party members is quite natural and justifiable. Unfortunately, the victor always misses the determination to win the next election as parochial self and party interest overpowers the national interest; the interest, for which people voted them to power. Therefore, every time a landslide victory turns into an avalanche of defeat by the end of the term. When a party is in power, it has the scope to do well for the people but not while in opposition. But surprisingly it is always the opposition who wins the election, not the party in power. Why is it that every time the mass opinion sways so much from the party in power to the party outside the power? If the defeat by the ruling party is natural then how did Jyoti Bashu's communist party remain in power in West Bengal for as many as 25 years or Mahathir Mohammad of Malaysia for 22 years till he left voluntarily to his successor? It is not that our party in power wants to retire for next 5 years, handing over the power to the opposition; rather they try tooth and nail to remain in power but fail miserably. //////The objective of the book is to examine various facets of FDI inflows in the developing economies, China, India and the Caribbean in specific. The rationale behind taking up two large economies like India and China for the study is the strategic shift of both countries development from inward to outward orientation, whereas comparatively smaller economy like the Caribbean has been taken up to show how they require to take up FDI as an alternative source of capital and investment after the withdrawal of concession from countries like US, Canada and EU and their response to this global challenge. //////The message of Colm Toibin in his novel, The South, can be translated as Follow your heart and see where it leads you. It takes courage to break away from the familiar surroundings of one's family and home and go to a new place. Kathrine Proctor, an artist found her heart growing restless, she wanted to escape the everyday routine life of her home. The bondage of home, her husband and even the child was choking her. Suddenly she wanted to be free. An unknown adventure, an uncertain future seems to be beckoning her. Leaving her home in Dublin, leaving her husband Tom and her ten year old son Richard for an unknown destination was like a wild goose chase. And yet her heart called out to the wild wishes. She felt as if an inner force was driving her to the far, wide world. And she made no secret about it. She told Tom that she was leaving him, going where; she herself did not know. //////Imagine a man attempting to understand a woman. He would fret over the complexities of female psychology, scratch his head in frustration and waste uncountable pages and pens. There would be several rewritings, broken threads of reason, sparks of emotion and passages of to-and-fro analytical narrative. And in the end after implementing much intelligence our diligent writer would come up with something very similar to 'The Golden Notebook'. //////It's all in the eyes of Maria Modig, eminent Swedish writer, who on a life-affirming observation, has had a look over the insights and outward feelings of a child's sound growth in her book 'Att vara med barnbarn' (To Be With Grand Children). //////
