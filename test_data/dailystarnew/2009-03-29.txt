It is certainly not the first time that a mosque has been made the target of a violent attack in Pakistan. It is an ominous sign of how much radicalised religious fanatics have become in Pakistan of late.

We never miss to seize the opportunity to point out the faults in others no matter how inane those imperfections are. We surely take delight in others' follies even if those are the result of honest efforts at doing something meaningful that somehow had gone astray. At the same time we are probably the stingiest, most tight-fisted and the most miserly people when it comes to praising the good deeds of others.

But at that time I could not realize the deeper meaning of the sentence. Now, this statement should more appropriately be "quality education is the backbone of a nation." Unfortunately, the quality of our country's education seems to be declining gradually, and this is largely the fault of our policy makers and the overall educational system. Moreover, the state of our student politics is at such a level that the prospect of quality education is unthinkable. I am really shocked with the news of recent political violence in different educational institutions. I think no civilized society would tolerate such violence in educational institutions. When the whole world is now in great fear of the economic recession and thinking about the possible ways to get rid of this situation, we are fighting with each other and killing one another. But what should be the duty of our students?//////As we all know we are having an electricity shortfall of about 2000mw per day. The situation is becoming worse as most of the age old power stations across the country can't run to their full capacity. On the other hand, due to fast urban development the country needs more & more electricity. Since the last 4 party alliance government did not do anything to generate power according to the demand of the country the hunger for power is increasing day by day. Though this new government is trying to address this issue on an emergency basis but it is very difficult to sort out this chronic problem in a year or so. On the one hand, the government should review what would be their source of energy i.e. gas, coal or fuel. Fuel is the most expensive source of energy nowadays to run any power station, so we have to look for alternate source of energy. Since we have sufficient coal we should prepare a coal policy at the earliest to utilise our own resources. Since we are having a shortfall of about 2000mw per day we should also look for nuclear power plants, as nowadays there are several countries which are using nuclear power plants to mitigate the demand for energy. Understandably, the government has started dialogues with Russia to negotiate commissioning of Rooppur Power Plant with a capacity of 1000mw. Besides China & India have also shown interest to help build such nuclear power plants. //////The government is claiming that they have solved the 'Pilkhana' carnage politically. They also claim that this 'political solution' has saved many lives. Has it really? //////The potato harvest was indeed remarkable this year and so would be the wheat cultivation particularly in the west and the north-western region of Bangladesh. However, the boro harvest will be better if fertilisers, pesticides and water are applied timely and sufficiently. //////Bashundhara Group's Corporate Office, attached with the Bashundhara City Shopping Mall, saw a devastating fire on 13 March 2009, Friday. The fire devoured the top five floors of the tower from 15th to 20th floor except the 16th. //////We, the common people of the country, take exception to the latest incident that took place at DMCH. There was allegation that the patient died due to negligence of doctors. As the deceased's relatives were under such an impression, they might have failed to control their emotions. //////I'm writing to you because I think I'm a responsible citizen of this country who had the great good fortune to witness the Great Liberation War as a petty officer in then exiled govt of Bangladesh. To speak the truth, the whole spirit of LW was lost immediately after the new govt took power. Just as our political leaders in the partition era (1947) did not care to get the Ist Radcliff Award exacted, rather set to fighting for 'gadi' and thereafter put all blame on WP leaders; the power-hungry, money-starved political leaders of Bangladesh got down to plundering the assets, immediately after liberation. Nobody bothered to restore the morale and morality of a traumatized nation; rehabilitate the people mentally after the great shock and set the judiciary and the education sector, first on the right track. Instead, party goons and thugs have since been nurtured in both the camps, thereby entirely degrading the standard of education. //////With due respect I would like to refer your 18th, 20th and 22nd Mar'09 editions' feature news, where in it has been observed that our sense of environmental cautiousness is increasing, which is obviously a good sign . A good environment is of course an important ingredient of a healthy life. In this regard , I would like to share the following with you. There is a university at Dhanmondi. On its left side, stands a school. Hundreds of small children are coming every morning and breathing the black smoke of the university power generator, besides the tremendous sound pollution during their classes. Also in the apartment houses there are many small children, aged and sick persons living among others, who can not intake fresh southern air for the same problem. //////The mercurial playmaker, Juan Roman Riquelme of Boca Juniors, has announced his retirement from Argentina national football team. He cited differences of football tactics and philosophies with coach Diego Maradona, a former Boca Junior player as well. The inclusion of Riquelme in the national team has pros and cons. The team has to be built around him and whenever he is in top form, the whole team plays well, but whenever he does not click, it seems to affect the performance of the whole team. That is why, he was hardly called up by former coach Marcelo Bielsa. Since coach Bielsa stepped down from his coaching role in late 2004, then coach Jose Pekerman built the team around him. This trend continued under coach Alfio Basile. In the meantime, a new superstar, Lionel Messi has become the most important player for the Argentina national team. The new coach, Maradona, repeatedly said the he would include Riquelme in his team and want him to be a part and parcel of it. But he said he wanted a slightly different role for Riquelme. Apparently, it was not acceptable for Riquelme. //////It was very disheartening to read a detailed report carried out by the Bangla daily, Prothom Alo (March 22nd ) on the present deteriorating state of different industries which were handed over by the government to the Bangladesh Freedom Fighters' Welfare Trust for the purpose of helping out the financially weak and injured freedom fighters.//////Afghanistan welcomed Friday a revised US strategy to fight extremism as authorities announced they had killed 18 insurgents and an Afghan troop killed two foreign soldiers for unknown reasons.//////The chief Palestinian peace negotiator warned yesterday the Middle East peace process may not survive if the new Israeli government fails to accept a two-state solution for the crisis. //////Twenty Muslim separatists and seven soldiers have been killed in fighting in the southern Philippines as the rebels Saturday accused the army of undermining the prospect of a return to peace talks.//////The United States has vowed to put the heat on Pakistan's spies in its new regional strategy, with top officials openly accusing elements in powerful intelligence agency of abetting al-Qaeda.//////A Muslim-baiting speech ahead of India's elections next month has opened the door to a divisive campaign exploiting the country's religious fault lines.//////Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz chief Nawaz Sharif has held former President Pervez Musharraf responsible for the current crisis being faced by the nation.//////The waters of Sydney Harbour plunged into darkness yesterday night, with the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge killing their lights for an hour in a global call for swift action on climate change.//////Rescue workers in Indonesia searched yesterday for 100 people still missing after a dam burst sending a torrent of water crashing into a Jakarta suburb, as the official death toll rose to 77.//////President Asif Ali Zardari executed a climbdown yesterday in calling for an end to governor's rule in Pakistan's most politically important province.//////The United States has made it clear that it would steer clear of the Kashmir issue as it seeks to involve India and other key stakeholders in the region in its new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan.//////A constitutional petition has been filed in Sindh High Court challenging the alleged meddling of US diplomats in Pakistan's internal affairs during the political crisis in the country.//////Malaysia's prime minister announced yesterday he will resign April 2 and hand over power to his deputy, completing a transition one year in the making after the ruling coalition's shock drubbing in general elections.//////It was a rather crowded affair than the usual calm and quite ambience at Drik Gallery, Dhanmondi on March 27.
