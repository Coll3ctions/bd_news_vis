in Dhaka Central Jail on November 3, 1975. The pioneering roles that Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmad, M. Mansoor Ali and AHM Quamruzzaman played in the liberation of Bangladesh through setting up the Mujibnagar government in April 1971 are now part of history. Without these men taking such a step, the history of this nation could well have been different. In these three decades and more since they were assassinated, barely three months after Bangabandhu and most of his family were wiped out in August 1975, the nation has looked forward to justice being done. Despite the fact that three of the accused in the jail killing case were sentenced to death, a number of questions have remained as to whether we as a people will be able to put the case behind us and move on. //////There has been indeed a very fast growth of private universities in Bangladesh since 1992 and one must admit that most of the private universities attempted to fill the void for higher education that was so much in demand given the state of our public universities that were hamstrung by the ill effects of bad politics and political unrest in the country at that time, albeit for those who could afford the cost. Some of the universities with their experienced faculty members and their curricula that compared well with those of some good foreign universities catered to the requirements of increasing number of higher education seeking youths in the country. However, one must also admit that not all of them had the rhapsodic idea of imparting quality education only since a good number of them did not fulfil the criteria laid down by the UGC, even after the stipulated period. //////At the turn of the millennium seven years ago, the international community sang the siren song of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and hunger between 1990 and 2015. Quite obviously, as we stand at about half-way point between the declaration and the deadline, an assessment of performance to that effect warrants attention. //////For long in the development discourse, it was economic growth that was of central concern, with human rights remaining largely marginal. While the development discourse evolved through various phases, focussing on Gross National Product (GNP), basic needs, structural adjustment, and so forth, a special focus on "rights" was missing. The definition of development focussed on economic growth and material prosperity only. Unfortunately, there was no inclusion of freedom, dignity and overall "well-being" of the people, and development was merely linked to human rights standards.//////Within a fortnight of the first mention of the truth commission and a widespread extolling of its virtues, there is now a committee in place working out the legislative measures needed to implement it.

nations or the big powers as they are termed by other nations, have been employing double standard.
