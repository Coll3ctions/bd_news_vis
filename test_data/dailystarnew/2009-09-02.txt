And yet the defeat of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is in a very important sense an earthquake for the people of Japan. The reasons are quite a few. In the first place, a long-entrenched party like the LDP (it has governed since 1955 with a slight break) now finds itself repudiated by the electorate in a decisive manner. In the second, the DPJ has not only won the elections but has won them with a landslide. In the second (and this is crucial), the Japanese electorate has sent out the message that a government which cannot get the economy moving does not deserve to be in office.//////THE Bangladesh Nationalist Party observed its birthday yesterday.

Although it was the duty of the caretaker government to hold election but they first tried to eradicate corruption from the country to make it free and fair. It gained popularity among the common people but uncommon people who had piled up illegal wealth could not accept it. Many costly cars were found on the road without any owner and many were running towards unknown destination. Every day we got surprising news. Many high-profile politicians, businessmen and service holders were arrested. It was unimaginable and unpredictable. We thought the antidote was working to root out corruption from society. Practically, the antidote started to work properly. But suddenly the dose was stopped and some advisers reportedly became corrupt. Consequently, it started to react. It was very unfortunate for us. The main reason is that the caretaker government could not finish the required doses. //////We know that most Bangladeshis earn their living from agriculture. Although rice and jute are the primary crops, maize and vegetables are assuming greater importance. Due to the expansion of irrigation networks, some wheat producers have switched to cultivation of maize which is used mostly as poultry feed. Tea is grown in the northeast. Because of Bangladesh's fertile soil and normally ample water supply, rice can be grown and harvested three times a year in many areas. Due to a number of factors, Bangladesh's labour-intensive agriculture has achieved steady increases in food grain production despite the often unfavourable weather conditions. These include better flood control and irrigation, a generally more efficient use of fertilizers, and the establishment of better distribution and rural credit networks. With 28.8 million metric tons produced in 2005-2006 (July-June), rice is Bangladesh's principal crop. By comparison, wheat output in 2005-2006 was 9 million metric tons. Population pressure continues to place a severe burden on productive capacity, creating a food deficit, especially of wheat. Foreign assistance and commercial imports fill the gap. Underemployment remains a serious problem, and a growing concern for Bangladesh's agricultural sector will be its ability to absorb additional manpower. Finding alternative sources of employment will continue to be a daunting problem for future governments, particularly with the increasing numbers of landless peasants who already account for about half the rural labour force.//////The DS of 16 Aug 09 informs us that Dhaka Metropolitan Police are installing an intricate Tk 61 crore control room with C3S, 155 CCTV cameras and 31 dot matrix displays at important intersections that will curb street crime and traffic congestion.

I was looking at the pictures in the booklets when my father saw this he explained to me about John. F. Kennedy and a country called the USA. To me Kennedy, meant the USA and the USA meant Kennedy.
