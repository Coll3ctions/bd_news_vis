But that is what they, as the foremost political personalities of the country, are supposed to be doing anyway. That they have not met or have not talked for a long time in the way modern politicians should is an embarrassment not only for them but for all of us in this country as well. It is only normal practice for politicians of their stature to be in constant contact with each other and keep themselves in touch with the objective realities around them. The fact that screaming newspaper headlines greet readers about their rare meetings only shows the levels of poverty to which politics has sunk in Bangladesh. And poverty is in the way the chiefs of the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have effectively transformed adversarial politics into deep personal animosity.//////THE jute industry faces a fresh spate of problems stemming from a fallout of the global financial meltdown. The recessive trends have triggered a fall in the demand and prices of jute products. The price of jute goods have decreased by about 15 percent. With higher cost of production entailed by our industry, the falling international price has turned out to be a double jeopardy. Many jute mills are having to suspend production while others are incurring losses by selling their products at prices that do not even cover costs. //////THERE has always been a raging debate on the primacy of politics over development. With the transition of mankind over the ages that brought about enlightenment, making life easier, and now ushering in globalisation and the ascendancy of an economic philosophy that puts freedom of capital over the interest of the society, the debate continues whether development and democratic pluralism cannot be fellow travelers on the same train. //////AS president-elect Barack Obama selects his cabinet in preparation to hit the ground running, Americans are adjusting to the expectation that things will be different and better come inauguration day in January.//////The crushing defeat handed to the Bangladesh team at the OUTsurance Oval in the first Test of the two-match series was hardly unexpected.

New Zealand were barely in the hunt at stumps on the third day but Ross Taylor gave them a glimmer of hope in their chase of 327, which after they stumbled to 4 for 49 must have seemed as attainable as an Oscar for Paris Hilton.//////Bachelors Sporting Club played out a 2-2 draw with Barnak Samaj in the only match of the Green Delta First Division Hockey League at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////Manchester City are preparing to make a world record 50 million pound (59m euros) bid to sign Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, The Times reported on Saturday.//////Juventus unveiled final plans for their new stadium on Thursday, which this time will be all about the Serie A club's fans.//////Sunderland manager Roy Keane has attacked footballers from Ireland and Scotland for eating and drinking "rubbish".//////William Gallas was fighting for his Arsenal future on Friday after reports emerged that he had been stripped of the captaincy and dropped for Saturday's trip to Manchester City.//////Blackburn goalkeeper Paul Robinson returns to Tottenham on Sunday with his confidence only just restored after the nightmare end to his time at White Hart Lane.//////Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez will be a Real Madrid player next season, the Marca sports daily reported on Friday.//////Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said on Friday that the Gunners should be compensated by the Football Association for the injury sustained by Theo Walcott on England duty this week.//////Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear has invited St James' Park legend Alan Shearer to learn the coaching ropes alongside him at the struggling English Premier League club.//////Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has reportedly offered to resign from the high-profile post following paceman Rudra Pratap Singh's exclusion from the ODI team but the BCCI vehemently denied the development.//////England have sent left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom for a new scan on his lower back as they seek to determine the extent of his injury problem.//////Two costly dropped catches on the third day basically ended New Zealand's chances of toppling Australia, but Chris Martin, the fast bowler, still held out hope of a "little miracle" despite his side losing six second-innings wickets. Opener Simon Katich was missed twice before Australia's lead reached 230 and they went on to set the visitors an unlikely 327 for victory.//////Left-arm pace bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe was Saturday named in a 15-man South African squad for a three-Test series in Australia next month.//////The offspinner Jeetan Patel will join New Zealand's squad for the second Test starting in Adelaide on Friday.

The dark history of apartheid in South Africa, the scare of yellow fever in Central Africa, the 60 percent HIV prevalence in Swaziland (highest in the world), the horrific genocides of Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda, mass starvations in Sudan are just a few headlines that define our perception of Africa -- the so-called 'dark continent'. So when a couple of months back I was invited by the International Trade Center (ITC), a Geneva-based UN organisation dedicated to promoting exports from developing countries, to attend a services exporters network meeting in South Africa's commercial capital Johannesburg, I immediately accepted.

It happened after two years. The nation always expects to see such scenes. Congratulations to Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia!//////We agree that there is no substitute of breast-feeding for human baby. But in practice when a baby does not get enough milk, we have to arrange for supplementary food suitable for a baby. Cow's milk is the best supplementary baby food known to us. In Bangladesh scarcity of cow's milk is an established fact. The government has imposed excess customs duty, VAT and supplementary duty to encourage production of milk in the country but in last two decades no significant development has been achieved. Very insignificant quantity of milk is produced here. //////Recently visa of former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been revoked by the British government. He is reportedly heading towards the Philippines which announced that they will refuse him entry to Philippines. It seems that Thaksin is looking for a safe place to live. Warrant has been issued by the Thai government for his arrest.//////Last Friday evening as I was taking a stroll near GEC crossing, the nerve-centre of Chittagong town, I came across a number of buses loaded with political workers. Though it was a holiday the presence of so many buses created a traffic congestion in that area. Those who sat on the roof of those buses were chanting slogans in chorus, thereby causing noise pollution. The event was occasioned by the arrival of the chairperson of a major political party.//////Following detection of melamine in milk powder some imported brands of powdered milk have been tested and presence of melamine in them has been confirmed. But what about the locally produced milk powders and various brands of condensed milk?//////This is in reference to the sports article dated 11Nov08 where it was reported that the Tigers were angered by the South African Captain's (Smith) comments. In my personal view, Smith was absolutely right. The so-called Tigers should learn how to take criticism in a positive and constructive way and improve on their game. Winning one game once in a blue moon does not show any signs of improvement or prove anything. I think the Tigers should stop crying about Smith's comments, get their acts together and start producing results because this indeed is not good for cricket. //////Thakurgaon is one of the northern districts of Bangladesh. It is beside Panchagarh, the northern-most district of Bangladesh. There is an airport in Thakurgaon but most of us do not know about that. The airport is located at Shibganj in Thakurgaon. During the 80's it was used as a domestic airport. But afterwards, for the lack of air passengers and maintenance facilities it was closed down. But now the situation has changed. The income level and standard of living of Thakurgaon people have improved considerably. Their capability in earning has also increased. Normally it takes eight hours to go to Dhaka by bus. It also takes many hours to go by railway. So, the local people feel the reopening of the airport. It is to be mentioned here that Thakurgaon is a district of economic possibilities and opportunities, therefore it is expected that the respective authorities will take necessary steps to make the airport ready for operation. //////After a prolonged hunger strike, candidates of the 27th BCS first time successful have got an assurance from the government concerning their re-recruitment. Meanwhile, second time successful are being recruited. Now a very simple question may arise in the minds of the people regarding the policy of PSC as well as government. Are they not pursuing a dual policy? //////I like to file a serious complaint about your telephone operator. I have called twice to enquire about your fax machines. I was trying to fax some documents and none of the fax machines were responding. I called your main number and requested the operator to find out. He flatly told me that these fax machines are always on. I told him that I know that I am having difficulties please check it for me. He hung up the phone on my face. I called back again 10 minutes later and he said the same and hung up again. //////Rickshaw is a favourite form of transport both in cities and rural areas. Rickshaw cannot create much problem in rural areas as the number of vehicles is less there. But in cities, rickshaws cause traffic jams. Rickshawpullers believe that road rules are not for them to abide by. So they pull their vehicle however they fancy, without showing any concern for safety. During rough weather like rain or storm they charge exorbitant amounts. Again, during school, college or university time they ask for double the fare. In such cases girls become the worst sufferers as they do not jump on a rickshaw like the boys or bargain with a loud voice. //////National election is expected to be held very soon in Bangladesh. Names of possible candidates with their short profiles are coming in the newspapers. As a conscious citizen and voter of the country, I believe I have every right to comment, criticize and advise the politicians who are going to take responsibilities of serving the nation as members of parliament which is a very sensitive and important position. Some of them will take responsibilities as ministers of the government of the peoples' republic of Bangladesh as well. It has been observed from newspaper report that very few women are participating in election, though the male candidates are coming from different educational and professional backgrounds. It has also come to my notice that very few scientists and technologists are taking part in the upcoming election. //////To make government's revenue policy adequate, I think govt. should give emphasis on revenue from land. Land may be divided into several categoriesa such as commercial land, industrial land, residential land and agricultural land. Revenue rate of agricultural land should be least whereas, business and industrial land revenue should be high. Calculating on the basis of total land government should impose tax on landowners. Income tax rate should be uniform and should be minimum as a result tax-paying attitude of people will grow. VAT policy should be discarded because it created scope for misuse and corruption. Income tax rate should not exceed 10%. Tax on industrial land, commercial land, business land should be higher than that of agriculture land. I hope the government will think about this matter.//////I am utterly shocked to know that the BSF jawan who was captured after the brutal killings of a mother and her sleeping sons inside the Bangladesh territory will now be handed over to the Indian authority (Prothom Alo; November 18; 2008). He and his accomplices had entered Bangladesh illegally and committed a heinous crime. Jawan RP Singh does not deserve our mercy and should be tried according to the law of our land. //////They say, form is temporary but class is permanent. Ashraful just proved the saying again. Although his batting was not up to the mark in the test series against New Zealand, his performance in the ODIs was decent and consistent. And now in South Africa he just played a genuine innings in the first ODI. He also started well in the T-20 match against South Africa before throwing his wicket away. In the first ODI, he played some glorious shots that remind us what he is capable of. Recently, his batting style was under a lot of criticism. The batting form he is starting to regain will stop all criticism. Let us hope he becomes consistent from now on.//////President-elect Barack Obama has moved with unusual speed to select officials for his administration, and senior Democratic officials say he intends to name Timothy Geithner as his treasury secretary as soon as Monday.//////Sri Lankan soldiers captured a Tamil Tiger rebel training camp, while air force helicopters bombed two rebel groups in the north, the military said yesterday. //////The chief minister of Pakistan's most populous province called Saturday for Washington to stop aerial missile strikes on the nation's soil, as the latest raid killed four more suspected militants.//////With the face of terrorism changing over time, the government on saturday warned that terror groups might use "nuclear, biological and chemical devices" and favoured a multi-pronged approach to deal with the menace.//////Former US president Jimmy Carter said yesterday that he and others planning a humanitarian mission in Zimbabwe had been refused entry to the impoverished African country.//////British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called Friday on the next US administration to embrace a "new multilateralism," saying the election of Barack Obama will allow the "world to lay new foundations."//////A bomb blast in an Afghan market yesterday killed two people, authorities said, also reporting other unrest-linked violence that left three more civilians and 14 militants dead.//////A UN General Assembly commission denounced Friday human rights violations in Iran, North Korea and Burma through separate non-binding resolutions.//////North Korea on Saturday said South Korea was seeking war against the communist state, condemning President Lee Myung-Bak's remarks that a reunified Korea should be a free democratic system.//////Iraq's presidential council has taken the unusual step of publicly criticising the Shia prime minister after he berated them for their opposition to councils of loyal tribesmen in several Iraqi provinces.//////The head of Myanmar's military junta called yesterday for all citizens to back a controversial "road map" to democracy, a day after the regime sentenced the country's top comedian to 45 years in jail.//////The electoral fortunes of 81 candidates, including NC president Omar Abdullah and former PDP minister Qazi Mohammad Afzal, will be decided today when six seats in Jammu and Kashmir go to polls in the second phase amid tight security.//////A Shia Muslim scholar and his police guard were killed in an apparent sectarian attack when gunmen fired at his car in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province, police said yesterday.//////A second day of protests against Indian rule shook Kashmir Saturday, leaving two Muslim protesters dead and over 30 hurt, police and witnesses said, ahead of more voting in state polls.//////France's opposition Socialists descended into open political warfare on Saturday after ex-presidential candidate Segolene Royal refused to concede defeat to Martine Aubry in a party leadership vote.//////Defence Secretary Robert Gates said Friday he would like to add significant US forces to the war in Afghanistan before national elections scheduled for next year, and that grim depictions of backsliding in the seven-year-old war are "far too pessimistic."//////Hundreds of Tibetan leaders debating how to advance their struggle for freedom Saturday will likely continue to support the Dalai Lama's path of compromise with China, the prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile said.//////A young man believed by followers to be a reincarnation of Buddha has returned to Nepal's jungles to meditate alone, police said yesterday, as scholars cast doubt on his supporters' claims.//////Congo's rebel leader is expected to hold his first public rally yesterday in the territory his fighters seized during a lightning advance last month in the eastern part of the country.//////Malaysia's top Islamic body yesterday ruled against Muslims practicing yoga, saying it has elements of other religions that could corrupt Muslims.//////Archaeologists have unearthed an elaborately decorated 1,800-year-old chariot sheathed in bronze at an ancient Thracian tomb in southeastern Bulgaria, the head of the excavation said Friday. //////To observe its ninth anniversary, Dik Theatre of the Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST) arranged a two-day theatre festival at the Sust mini auditorium.

Despite bold actions in US and Europe to tackle the crisis, credit is likely to remain constrained for some time, as financial institutions continue to reduce leverage, while growth in industrial countries is expected to be negative next year. What does this mean for Asia? And what can be done to limit the impact on the region?//////THE national election is expected to be held very soon in Bangladesh. Names of possible candidates, with short profiles, are coming out in the newspapers.
