We have so far brought out six supplements, the first one containing 96 pages and the remaining five 48-page each.//////The latest report by Ain-O-Salish Kendra makes dismal reading. In the past three months, according to the report, as many as thirty individuals have died in so-called crossfire incidents in the country while twenty five others died in police custody. By any standard of morality as well as legality, these incidents are appalling in nature. They fly in the face of the government's claims that no 'crossfire' deaths have occurred in all the time since it took office in January 2009. Now contrast that with a recent ministerial comment to the effect that crossfire killings have seeped into the system and it will take time for such killings to be brought to an end. Such contradictory positions are disturbing. //////A picture published in last Saturday's The Daily Star speaks volumes about our heavy-handed treatment to tender aged children. In particular it shows crowd's total insensitivity to a couple of poor and hungry urchin girls alleged to have stolen food. Whereas they should have been shown passion and the crowd feeling a sense of guilt that the society failed to provide two morsels of food to them, they behaved as if devoid of humanity.//////Mahendra Singh Dhoni doesn't spend too much time on history, records and emotions. He is a figure who gives off a distant air to the media, a cool persona to the public and a calming influence on teammates, be it stalwarts or rookies. What is Sachin Tendulkar's birthright and what should have been Saurav Ganguly's natural conclusion is now Dhoni's.//////Sachin Ten-dulkar said he could not hold back his tears after India thrashed Sri Lanka in the World Cup final on Saturday to win the "ultimate" prize after a gap of 28 years.//////Mahela Jayawardene's batting resembles Spain of the 2010 football World Cup.

Additional police have been deployed in the area, said Ullapara OC Tazul Huda. //////Indigenous leaders of northern districts yesterday urged the authorities concerned to introduce 'indigenous language' at primary education level to 'revamp' their culture. They also called for stringent steps against the killers of indigenous people and demanded justice. Jatiya Adivasi Parishad of Dinajpur unit placed the demands at a meeting here at Dinajpur Natya Samiti auditorium yesterday morning.

It is long drawn but comparisons tend to satiate our fantasies, so stay with it.//////India great Sachin Tendulkar was "made by God just to play cricket" said captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni ahead of Saturday's World Cup final against Sri Lanka.//////Cricket fans in the subcontinent have increased the pressure on players and coaches, which makes them anxious and stressed. The result is there for all to see. The people of the subcontinent should not forget that their teams too entered the tournament as underdogs years ago. Why should they raise a hue and cry when other teams outplay theirs? The hysterical outburst at Bangladesh's defeat to West Indies exposes our self-centred expectations. If our players do not perform, we denounce them. But one thing is for certain this bizarre cricket mania is the result of the unreasonable media hype. It has made us so crazy that we have lost the ability to accept defeats. It was saddening to see fans attack the house of Bangladesh Captain. Do the people ever lift a finger against erring government officials or politicians who are involved in scandals?//////It is inspiring to learn that a portion of the charitable gift fund to be raised on the occasion of the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton will be spent on the conservation of Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans. This gesture would definitely help stop the poaching of tigers, elephants and other endangered animals and ensure their protection and conservation.The number of tigers in the Sundarbans and elsewhere in the world has decreased alarmingly due to the human activities including cutting of forests. An Indonesian proverb makes the point clear as it states://////On March 15, Bangladesh kicked off its fifth population census since independence. We excelled all standards in terms of counting out people of Bangladesh. Concern has been voiced that the count has been preceded by too little publicity to ensure full public participation. //////Ricky Ponting has always been a man of character. He is often criticised for his harsh behaviour, but for the responsibility this man has been carrying through for last eight years with great determination and sheer success, he has to keep an attitude that no ordinary man bears. He is a captain with the ability to win a match from any condition. Winning consecutive world cup title was no small achievement. The opponent captains often misunderstand him. But in my opinion he is simply a man who has self believe and competes hard on the field. //////Ricky Ponting has always been a man of character.

Since a general diary (GD) has been filed, this information is open to the public. While the child victim's identity has been revealed in your article, why have the identities of the people who allegedly committed this disgusting crime been withheld? to be named?//////The title above, accurately describes the Bangladesh cricket team; which seems to suffer with 'butter-fingers' in batting, fielding and bowling!//////Will the Garments Industry get its act together on the subject of sizing? As the British Women's Association discover, each year, when they organise a mega-event for hundreds of disadvantaged children at Nandan Water World, the different sizes of the T-shirts given from different houses cause chaos. This year, we discovered that the green Tesco Medium T-shirt was the same size as the red XL T-shirt from House of Pearl! //////Following HC verdict on 5th amendment people from all walks of life and the media demanded in one voice that a provision to the effect that military can never seize power must be incorporated in the constitution, Begum Zia while addressing a gathering in observance of Peelkhana tragedy told us she feared another tragedy in the cantonment. Is the tragedy she referred to is otherwise a possible intervention by the Army to seize power? The DS on 2nd March was compelled to write an editorial calling in question the intention and basis of her fears and wanted to know her moral obligation as the opposition leader? From her statement it seems she is in a great deal of disillusionments and to come out of them she might prefer any alternative to her agitation programmes to precipitate the downfall of the AL government.//////PSC is taking a long course of time to recruit the BCS cadres. In fact, many brilliant students leave this field because of lengthy procedure. Tight civil administration plays a pivotal role for the continuous development of a country. For instance, if we look at the most developed countries like USA, UK, Japan, Germany, etc., we can say that the rigid base of democracy in those countries is the outcome of efficient civil administrations. The politicians can't do whatever they like rather opinions of mass people are taken into account in those countries. To minimise the course of time for accomplishing the total procedures of BCS exams the present govt. should act promptly. //////The leader of the opposition in parliament expressed deep shock and concern at the way the Nobel Laureate has been humiliated by the regime in power. Since then I have been wondering as to how his honour and dignity could be restored. It is indeed a matter of serious disgrace. To speak the truth, many a people throughout the globe know Bangladesh because of Dr. Yunus. The regime in power has gone in full swing to nail him down in all possible ways. As an ordinary citizen of the country, may I propose the leader of the opposition, to offer him the presidency of the country if they come to power next time. Hopefully, this shall bring glory both to the party and the country. //////The present day world is full of lies and falsehood. Without any prejudice or malice to none, I recall a saying "Lawyers and politicians are the same, the difference is the politicians are bigger liars" by a late personal friend who played a major role in a movie named "The Father" which is often shown on different television channels. //////The interesting headlines in the DS front page on 24th March evoked some questions://////Japan's prime minister made his first visit to the country's tsunami-devastated region yesterday as officials grappling to end the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl said they may have discovered why radiation has been leaking into the sea.//////Japan's unfolding nuclear disaster is "much bigger than Chernobyl" and could rewrite the international scale used to measure the severity of atomic accidents, a Russian expert said here Friday.//////The nations staging air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi's forces will be heading into a diplomatic minefield if they arm Libyan rebels as well, according to experts and envoys at the UN.//////Embattled Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh thanked thousands of supporters gathered near the presidential palace yesterday for backing the constitution in a further sign he has no immediate plans to step down.//////Palestinian Islamist group Hamas yesterday denied that three of its militants killed in a Gaza air strike were plotting to kidnap Israelis and warned of "consequences".//////India has banned trade in all goods and services with Iran that could help Tehran pursue development of nuclear weapons, a government statement said.//////Indian police yesterday charged a former telecom minister with abuse of power and conspiracy in an alleged mobile spectrum fraud that cost the country billions of dollars in lost revenue.//////Ten people died in Afghanistan yesterday in new protests against a Koran burning in the US, a day after seven UN staff were killed.//////Syrian security forces arrested dozens of people, rights groups said yesterday, after thousands marched in pro-democracy protests in unrest that has posed the gravest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad's rule.//////Nigeria postponed parliamentary elections until Monday after voting materials failed to arrive in many areas, a major blow to hopes of a break with a history of chaotic polls in Africa's most populous nation.//////Rescuers in Vietnam were working yesterday to recover the bodies of two brothers buried under huge boulders as a local official said 18 people had died in a quarry rockslide.//////Al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate yesterday claimed responsibility for a siege at a provincial council headquarters in Saddam Hussein's hometown in which 58 people were killed.//////Philippine tribal gunmen abducted 16 children and adults in a bizarre bid to have their leader released from prison after he was jailed for another mass kidnapping, police said yesterday.//////On the occasion of the approaching 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, Indian art critic Pranab Ranjan Roy articulated his views on Rabindranath's paintings and their various aspects on March 31 at Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts in Dhanmondi, Dhaka. Bengal Gallery organised the programme. Subir Chowdhury, director of Bengal Gallery, delivered the welcome speech. Veteran painters, writers, academics attended the event.//////We often hear teenagers these days show less interest in reading; rather, they are always busy with browsing the web, playing virtual games and watching films. Keeping that in mind, adaptation of Liberation War themed stories, novels and other fictional works into films is a way of encouraging the youngsters to get acquainted with the history of the nine month-long brutal war that freed the country. //////Curtain came down on the four-day long Ethnic Minority Drama Festival 2011, organised by Khudra Nri Goshthi Cell [Cell for ethnic minority groups] of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA), at the National Theatre Hall, BSA yesterday. //////Kanthabithi, an organisation of reciters in Magura, held a two-day long programme featuring poetry recitation to mark its 13th founding anniversary that ended on Friday evening. //////Starting April 1, the three-day-long historic 'Baruni Snan', a religious ritual of the local Hindu community, began at Boalmari Baruni village in Panchagarh.//////Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Bangladesh recently organised a 45-daylong art workshop, titled Standard Chartered Sreejoni 2010.

But to the 1.1 billion Indians it was a milestone victory. //////ONE of the most revolutionary inventions of this decade has been Facebook -- the enormously popular and addictive social website that has consumed the lives of so many. An interesting feature of Facebook, founded by Harvard dropout Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, is its ability to suck people into a virtual world of their illusionary selves recreated with glamorous photographs, racy video clips, and punchy self descriptions. Facebook can thus easily transform the introvert into a flamboyant online persona!//////FOR yours truly, perhaps the most symbolic moment in a World Cup at home soil came in the game against the West Indies. It was unfortunate, but a sparkling Friday afternoon was bastardised beyond repair by an inept performance from the Bangladesh side, which saw them capitulate to a nine-wicket loss, and more worryingly for the thousands, for a total score of just 58.//////THERE are many among us who, at the first mention of religion and politics, wiggle their forefingers and shake their heads and tell us that the two should never mix. Religion is a matter of faith, they assert, and politics -- well, politics requires crafty calculations. Religion is a matter of rules, but in politics, anything goes and everything's negotiable.//////FORTY years ago, the then Eastern "Wing: of Pakistan was fighting for the same ideals people from countries in the Middle East are fighting for today. The fight was for freedom -- the freedom to democratically choose their government, the right to hear their own voice and the desire to shape their destiny. Like all great fights, the fight began in the hearts of ordinary people, eventually boiling over into the streets. Just as those in East Pakistan, facing genocide may have wondered why the world stood in silence and why no one came to their support, those in the Middle East may be asking us the same questions today. Throughout history, those with courage stood on the right side of history, while the silent majority opted for the easier option and watched with inaction. Bangladeshis need to stand in support with the people of the Middle East, especially given its own history from just 40 years ago. By standing with the people of the Middle East, history will judge Bangladeshis to be on the right side of history. //////IN spite of the great success of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in Bangladesh in providing financial access to over 20 million poor households, and that too through financially sustainable methodologies, the reaction here in Bangladesh, very interestingly, has been extremely ambivalent. While many celebrate the global focus Bangladesh receives in being one of the pioneering countries in promoting financial access, others, especially many policy makers and academics, see it as exploitative (through charging high interest rates and employing coercive repayment strategies) and ineffective (in improving client conditions and reducing poverty). In fact there has recently been a renewed spate of criticism, based often on flimsy evidence. This stems on the one hand from an over selling of microfinance by advocates, and on the other a failure of opponents to truly understand poor people and their financial lives coupled with a limited vision on how best to facilitate a democratisation of the financial sector.//////Joseph Stalin becomes the first General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.//////
