A rather convenient and plausible explanation is being offered now for such a development. The recent rise in the prices of fuel, say traders, have led to this new enhancement in prices. One cannot quite dismiss such explanations, for these price rises are inextricably linked with the costs involved in transportation of food items among the different regions of the country. At the same time, though, there is the good question of how a section of traders may actually be taking advantage of the fuel price rises to augment their income by sinking their hands deep into consumers' pockets.//////WE notice with a great deal of concern that erosion of rivers has become a regular phenomenon in the country with all its devastating consequences. On a regular basis rivers are devouring huge chunks of cultivable land, forests and homesteads, thereby pushing a large number of people into poverty. At the same time, erosion of rivers is contributing to drastic changes in topography in the border areas much to our disadvantage. //////THERE is a gulf of difference between the two sciences, physics and economics.

In my personal opinion, as citizens we are not ignorant about rules but we have a tendency to violate them. This is a typical Bangladeshi behavioural pattern. If you are out in the road, overtaking is the most common thing and perhaps it has become a norm. I have noticed that educated people break the rules. I have frequently seen a whole family riding in a motorbike driven by the father, with mother behind and two little children riders. This is really hazardous. //////Ours is a male dominated society. Here women are suppressed and oppressed in various ways and forms both at home and at the office. At the office, the male officers always think the women officers are lazy, idle and worthless. They always show such an attitude that women should remain at home and they are quite incapable of performing the official duties. But all these self-declared heroes never remember for a moment that the head of the state was a woman and the opposition leader was also a woman. When the developed countries are sending their female counterparts to the moon, our male counterparts are getting thanks for exposing such ill feelings against their female counterparts.//////Not only in Bangladesh but also in other countries, hike of food price is a very burning issue. But we hardly realize that the price hike is a man made problem. It is the huge population which has created al the problems. Now it is difficult to supply additional food for the additional people. //////Globalisation is a concept of the developed countries. They are trying to impose it on us for their own sake. On the other hand, countries like Bangladesh are struggling in an open market system to survive. So the impact of globalisation on the developing countries is beyond our imagination. The developed countries are always trying to exterminate the existence of developing and poor nations. In the name of globalisation a new form of imperialism and polarization is emerging. The first provision of globalisation is to ensure equal rights and participation in case of economic and political affairs. But this has not worked. The developed countries are exploiting the poor countries in so many ways. //////Reading the post-budget lively analyses in the newspapers, we are flooded with the same old comments--the interested parties do not reveal the other side of the coin, especially the businessmen and the politicians.//////How long shall we have to observe the practice of "crossfire" and read the same story again and again? Is it possible to establish law and order by violating the very fundamentals of it? //////Observance of austerity in our national life is a crying need of the hour. But we find inconsiderate extravagance of many different kinds all around us. Unscrupulous use of gas, electricity, telephone, office stationery, official transport and tours both inside and outside the country, to please only a few, tell very heavily on our national economy. //////Recently a sick dog is visible in Dhanmondi and I started to feed it whenever possible, especially at night. After weeks of regular feeding its health improved a lot. But the problem arises whenever you feed the dog in front of people, they come up with different opinions and advises you what to feed, which is extremely irritating. When the dog was sick and was about to die, there was none to feed it but once it comes to advising, we people are extremely good. Whenever you want to do something good, people try to discourage you. //////On June 20, amid objections from the AL and the BNP, the Election Commission announced that local body polls would be held on Aug 4. But the AL working committee took the decision to participate in the local polls "based on the situation" in an adjourned meeting on June 27. //////Many suspects ranging from govt. officials to the leaders of the political parties have been detained depending on the various charges placed against them in the court.//////In the last tri-nation cricket matches in Dhaka, it was a painful experience for me to watch how religion reflected the attitude of Dhaka's sports loving people watching the game between India and Pakistan. The frenzy of emotional outburst in support of Pakistan was something I found difficult to believe in the year 2008. Today, when I watch Bangladesh playing in Pakistani empty cricket fields, no fellow Muslim brothers are there to cheer up the Bangladeshi team playing against India. //////Our Law Adviser and his co-passengers were lucky to escape serious injury, when the vehicle they were riding in CHT on 27 June 2008, met with an accident. I hope he and his fellow passengers were wearing seat belts properly. This practice is compulsory in most countries of the world. Failing to do so is subject to heavy fine. There is no shadow of doubt that the practice saves lives. Next time our Law Adviser or any car/SUV riders ride a vehicle, he/she must wear the assigned belt properly.//////The results of SSC of 2008 were to be obtained via SMS from various mobile operators. Almost all of them launched the ads that anyone could get the results by dialling some 4 digit numbers. For obvious reasons, in my assumption, around 6 to 10 Million SMS were sent from morning till 5:00pm of June 26 to all the mobile operators. Thus the operators earned millions whereas the actual results were supposed to be available not before 5:00pm on that day, and the mobile operators very intelligently kept that information secret. General people have lost a considerable amount of money by sending SMS unnecessarily, and getting the reply 'The result is not yet published, please type......'. //////Dhaka College students yesterday went on the rampage and set fire to a microbus following a road accident that left one of their fellow students injured. A speeding microbus had hit Saiful Islam, a first year student of biology department, in front of the college while he was crossing the road at around 12:00noon. Saiful's legs have been fractured but he was out of danger. Police had also done their job and seized the microbus and detained its driver Idris Miah.//////A lot is being written about Mr. Tarique Rahman, both in the media and on the Internet. There is no point in speculating upon how he received the injuries which are obvious from his appearances in court and through the remarks of his doctors. The fact seems to be that he is suffering.//////I strongly and whole-heartedly support the call of Mr, Zakaria for reinstalling those billboards printed with significant verses from the Holy Quran. It is a long time that those billboards containing very useful advices have been removed and Mr. Zakaria also cited the possible reasons. Nowadays, the capital city Dhaka and all other major cities and towns are crowded with billboards of giant sizes to arouse the interest of the people of all walks of life to buy mobile phones that drain the hard-earned currency, but nothing ethical is found. //////Going through a news item on Field Marshal Manekshaw's death on June 28 in a leading English daily of Bangladesh, courtesy to Press Trust of India, New Delhi, I was startled observing how the Indian press thinks of our nine-month long struggle for independence in 1971. The news started like this: //////The abominable act of a police officer at the airport has tarnished the image of Bangladesh in front of the foreigners and the rest of the world. But more astonishingly, we observe that the sleazy work is being treated in a different way. //////I wholeheartedly echo all those expressing the urgent need for extra training for the teachers of English.

Andaleeb explains, I want to give a new dimension to my work. Gold and black are colours which artists often wish to avoid. I want to take my work into a different direction. Black actually has many hues in it if you look closely. Earlier I used black with other colours. Now I combine other colours on my basic of black. The gold is there to diversify one's attention span and make the painting more vibrant. I'm veering into something new, subject wise, and as regards colour composition, I'm now doing paintings which are a far cry from my work which has gone earlier.//////, written and directed by Chandan Sen, is not like the typical plays that portray the sufferings of the elderly who do not get proper care in the family.
