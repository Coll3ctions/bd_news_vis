Functional and neutral local government institutions, elected democratically, not only can address key issues like poverty, employment, environment, illiteracy and malnutrition, they also can help uproot corruption and lawlessness that stem from opportunistic politics. But there is no denying that democracy and rule of law failed to take a firm root in the country as these important institutions so long remained in the hands of corrupt political elements and their goons and a section of unscrupulous government officials. Thus, a thorough restructuring of the institutions has become a need of the hour, and this has been stressed by the chief adviser of the caretaker government Fakhruddin Ahmed in his speech while addressing the conference of the local government representatives in the city. //////We find the comments of the finance advisor regarding the present crisis of rice as being the result of lack of proper coordination, a frank admission of the government's lack of planning.

Instead of putting all out efforts to bring down the price of food grains, the adviser passed a remark which has aggravated the already bad situation with a further rise in the price which now stands at an all time record of Tk 35 per kg even for the coarsest variety. My suggestion would be to stop import of all luxury and non-essential items, including motor vehicles, and divert the funds towards import of rice immediately and flood the market with subsidised prices to save the country from the impending famine. Rapid action in this regard will help defuse the highly alarming situation and we demand immediate action from the government to save the teeming millions. If necessary the current foreign exchange reserve can be utilised for the import of rice. The country is on fire and water MUST be poured in to extinguish it from whatever source available immediately, before it is too late. //////In our beloved country natural disasters happen so often that probably these should be taken as our natural characteristics. Every year we face them and still we lose our dear ones, our livestock, crops, properties etc. The governments spend millions to build dams, cyclone centres, for irrigation, medical treatment, relief and rehabilitation. But we still bear the losses. Every year our budgets are strained, we take loans from World Bank, ADB etc, but what is the result? Have we ever thought of the vicious cycle concerning this? Projects are taken, some never end, those that end collapse and at last it is the same again. In every country the people build their dwellings according to the nature of their climate, geology and GDP. //////Mr. Tariq Karim foresees Pakistan's future political development as a final battle between the forces of civil society and democracy and militant obscurantism and military jingoism. He also said lot of nice things about BB. His analysis was fine but I think he somehow fogged the identity of the real enemy of the Pakistani people though he mentioned it. Sixty years of relentless Goebblesian propaganda and Orwellian thought controlling programmed the Pakistani people including the weak civil society to think that the military is the saviour of their country. That it is the real demon which has devoured their souls and made them mere slaves. Not even the Stalinist brain washing on which Orwell based his 1984 society was as effective as the Pakistani military. The Pak military has the advantage of using Islam as the ideological tool which the Stalinists did not have. So if Pakistani people wish to establish democracy they have to wage a war against their own military. But in the current situation it is not going to happen, notwithstanding Mr. Karim's expectations. The Pakistani people are hopelessly divided and against them the military are solidly united as a rock as the only powerful organisation with all the weapons of brutalisation at their command. The military itself is the state in Pakistan. If the military is defeated and removed from power then the state will disintegrate. The comparable scenario is Somalia. The political scientists should ponder over this and produce a new concept to define the Pakistani state.//////On viewing the two one-dayers played so far between Bangladesh and NZ in the current cricket series, we are very much shocked to see the unjust decisions of the umpires going against Bangladesh only. In the first match, Bangladesh failed to get a positive nod from the umpires against their appeals on a couple of occasions when NZ batsmen were out. Even in the first match the leg umpire stopped a full shot of one Bangladeshi player by his own hand which would have been a boundary. In the second match, Ashraful was given out when the cover fielder caught a bounced ball. This is a huge injustice in any count and unfortunate for Bangladesh! If all the decisions were correct by the umpires, then NZ had really tough days. Their defeat was no far. //////I am shocked to learn the news of the death of Ms Bhutto. She was the best hope for Pakistan to get rid of the fascist elements. We should remember the attempt to kill Sheikh Hasina on 21st August 2004. While the extremists are killing their opponents, amassing money from mid-east and taking control of different powerful government and non-govt positions, our democratic and half democratic parties are busy to meet their own selfish interests.//////I am a regular reader of your newspaper's Internet and printed editions. As a leading national daily of Bangladesh "The Daily Star" has been taking part in many social activities and I believe it would make more if its readers aware of different issues. Believing this today I would like to request you to publish some articles, features, and quotes on selection of the seven natural wonders of the world and the positions of Cox's Bazar and the Sundarbans in the rating list. I believe this simple initiative of yours would help these natural wonders to maintain their positions firmly in future. Please post a regular section on the position of these natural wonders of Bangladesh on the Internet edition as well as in your regular printed edition to encourage people. It should also be provided with the link to the site directly(http://www.new7wonders.com/nature ) so that people can cast their votes. //////In consideration of the theft of valuable artefacts at Zia International Airport, the adviser concerned has resigned, taking full responsibility for the mismanagement. This is exactly what is expected of a person of his stature and position. But alas! Can we expect from anyone else the same degree of responsibility, courage and professionalism on the recent deaths of a dozen innocent workers? Never! //////We grew up hearing that Bangladesh was the country of gold, golden Bengal, and our future is golden too. During hard times, it was common to hear comments such as yes, always the future, never the present". Well, things are changing. Is the future here? Or maybe is it around the corner? What does this present situation, the new situation really mean? //////The disaster and devastation caused by the cyclone Sidr in such a short span of time (in comparison to two preceding floods) show us how nature may take revenge on us when it is infuriated by the unscrupulous activities of people, particularly those of so called highly industrialised nations. But unfortunately the havoc that nature causes in repercussion is indiscriminate and may befall even those who are not responsible for the misdeeds, as we find in our case. //////A great many felicitations, no doubt, should go to the caretaker government and its law enforcement agencies for the steps taken against the corrupt politicians and the vested interest groups of our country. Also worth praising is the recent drive against Yaba that arouses a new sense of direction about the ills of a drug. But two more things are yet to be done-- giving a proper reply to the objectionable remarks about our freedom fighters and putting an end to the fussing over the price hike. We, the commoners, respect our freedom fighters for their supreme contributions to our struggle for freedom.//////We can draw a parallel line between the three great national poets, most popular in their respective continents. Rabindranath Tagore can thus be regarded as having an effective visual perception regarding perceptual realism. One can recognise the factor that the poet had his greatest association with Hindu theology. However, if we draw a similar association with the Chilean author and poet Pablo Neruda and of-course no-body can actually forget Iqbal, then one can thus obtain the idea that the functional prowess of their national poetry has not only continued to influence their respective religious ideologies, but their inclination towards their respective beliefs can also be seen. //////Man seeks pleasure and recreation and cinema is a great source of fun. It is also one of the wonders of modern science. Cinema refers to a stage in which pictures on motion are shown on a screen. Firstly, to produce a cinema, shooting is a must. A number of actors and actresses play in a studio. In most cases they go out for shooting to hills, deserts seas or to places of scenic beauty. Some photographs against some backgrounds are then snapped. These photographs are shown on the screen with the help of cinematograph. When the show goes on, the ribbon of photo-pictures is unrolled and thrown upon the while screen with necessary lights. This produces motion pictures on the screen. Formerly, pictures moved silently but nowadays pictures not only move but also talk and sing.//////Who is the greatest killer of the world now? Undoubtedly the answer will be Mr. Bush. In the name of 'war on terror' the Bush government is torturing and killing a lot of innocent people in Afghanistan and Iraq. From immediately after 9/11 of 2001 till now the US soldiers and coalition soldiers are arresting people as suspects. They made so called prisons for the suspects at Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib and so on to torture and kill people. There is no definite allegation or evidence against most of the detainees. As they are shouting for human rights and humanity, they are the first violators of all such things. They are continuously degrading humanity by their brutal inhumane behaviours. Most of the detainees are innocent and they have no connection with terrorism. But they are passing the worst months and years suffering the ruthless torture of the soldiers. When anyone dies due to their torture, they pass it off as a natural death. You will be surprised to know that the young energetic persons are always the victims of natural death in those torture cells. //////A new political drama is unveiled. The health condition of two interned former prime ministers is in the limelight which has given rise to the question of going abroad for better treatment. Health and political approach to this issue is different in case of the two interned leaders.
