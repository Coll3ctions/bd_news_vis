On another day the ball may have eluded Tamim Iqbal, but yesterday he leapt to his left and at full stretch pulled off a two-handed blinder to hammer the final nail in the Caribbean coffin.//////Stemming from the Tazreen Fashions disaster, garment and leather workers' agitations in Ashulia industrial belt continued yesterday as they attacked several factories and clashed with industrial police.//////Ending a four-year ban, Malaysia will initially recruit 30,000 Bangladeshi workers for its plantation sector from early next year.//////In a tragic irony, the day before the deadly Tazreen blaze her father had called her from the capital and promised to stay for five days with her in Rangpur. //////In a major breakthrough in building the country's first metro rail system in Dhaka, Japan has approved $2.1 billion in soft loan for the $2.7 billion project.//////People should change the mindset towards the physically-impaired and help flourish their potential to the fullest, speakers at a dialogue said yesterday. //////A listed prosecution witness, who gave her testimony as the fourth defence witness in the war crimes case against Abdul Quader Mollah, claimed she did not hear the accused's name until yesterday.//////Rapid Action Battalion yesterday arrested five top-level leaders of Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in the capital's Mirpur on charges of allegedly plotting to foil the ongoing war crimes trial by destabilising law and order.//////The government has decided to procure Aman rice at a price of Tk 26 per kg after considering all aspects of its production cost and market price, Food Minister Abdur Razzak said yesterday.//////Philippine authorities yesterday warned the public to take precautions for what could be the most powerful storm to hit the country this year.//////Rescuers have found three more bodies after landslides in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, officials said yesterday, taking the confirmed death toll to 15, with three people still missing.//////A strong 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck off the South Pacific island of Vanuatu yesterday, seismologists said, but there were no immediate reports of damage and no tsunami warning was issued.//////When the state entered into a peace accord with the PCJSS, the now-defunct political wing of the former tribal insurgent group which called itself Shantibahini, one and a half decades ago, it formally ended a two-decade long insurgency in the hill districts. Peace was an instant dividend from the accord that both sides celebrated with the world welcoming the olive branch spread across the CHT.//////We find it very difficult to rationalise why a leather factory in Ashulia was vandalised on Saturday. It was functioning normal; there was neither labour unrest nor any problem there. Reportedly, the factory management refused to give in to the demands of some workers of an adjacent garment factory whose work was suspended because of a fire alarm. As a result their owner, rather sensibly, declared the remaining day off which caused workers of a few other factories to suspended work too fearing trouble. And these workers set upon the leather factory.//////There was more than a little consternation before the five-ODI series between Bangladesh and West Indies at the fact that Bangladesh were going in with four debutants against a team that performed so powerfully in the preceding Test series. By the end of yesterday's second match at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium, those doubts would have been blown out of the water. One of the newcomers, Anamul Haque, was the player-of-the-match after a match-winning 120 while another, Mominul Haque, who was playing his first innings, was instrumental in Bangladesh plundering 68 runs off the last five overs to set up their 160-run win.//////Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal had scored five consecutive half-centuries leading up to the second ODI against West Indies. The first of those was in the Asia Cup match against Pakistan in Dhaka in March, nine months ago. So it was hard to imagine Bangladesh would get off to a good start or make a competitive score without Tamim's contribution, especially with their champion cricketer Shakib Al Hasan not there to shore up the middle-order.//////Even Bangladesh fast bowler Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, when speaking on the eve of the second ODI against West Indies, said that getting their opponents out for 199 runs in the first match was 'too good', and maybe something that will not be repeated.//////At the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna the Tigers roared to their second win against the West Indies on Sunday. And an elated sports minister of the country Ahad Ali Sarker immediately congratulated the Tigers and announced Taka 2 lakh cash award for young Anamul Haq for his brilliant century. //////The professional football league committee of Bangladesh Football Federation yesterday revoked its decision of instilling a one-month ban on Brothers Union manager Amer Khan after the suspended manager appealed to exempt the punishment. Khan was handed a one-month ban on November 12, following his 'misleading information' about last season's league match between Abahani and Brothers Union. The game's governing body revoked its decision ten days before the expiry of Amer's punishment. //////National rejects Enamul Haque jr and Imrul Kayes hit form for their respective teams in the sixth round of the National Cricket League yesterday.//////Australia will have to produce the greatest run chase in Test history to beat South Africa in the third Test at the WACA Ground and claim the top spot in the Test rankings.//////The Bangladesh U-23 side will be hoping to get a winning star in the HE Mahinda Rajapakshe International Football Tournament in Sri Lanka when they take on Pakistan in one of the two opening day matches at the newly-built Jayathailaka Stadium in Kandy at 4:00pm (local time) today.//////Bangladesh will host four international friendly football matches in the first quarter of 2013, said Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin yesterday.

This is a superb performance by most developing country standards. This export boom was led by one product group -- the readymade garments. The RMG exports have surged from $1 billion in FY1992 to a whopping $19 billion in FY2012, which is an amazing 79 percent of total merchandise exports and some 49 percent of total export earnings of Bangladesh (including goods and factor and non-factor services). There have also been some positive shifts within the garment sector in terms of product composition. While Bangladesh has continued to gain strength in the low-end segment, outperforming the cost escalating competitors in China and India, it is also making some inroads in the high-end segment of name-brand products. The spread in terms of geographical diversification of RMG exports is also improving, although the US and the European Union continue to be the main buyers. Overall, Bangladesh's prospect for gaining further market share in the large global RMG market is bright.//////Dubai is back in the business of unveiling mega projects, three years after a severe financial crisis crippled its booming property sector, but doubts still linger over finance and feasibility.//////When Taslima Begum, a housewife turned entrepreneur from the north of Bangladesh, accepted the Nobel peace prize in Oslo in December 2006, it was a proud moment for Bangladeshi women.

Many jumped to their deaths because the doors were locked to prevent stealing. The fire at Tazreen Fashions in Dhaka in 2012 has killed 111 workers, mostly women. Most of them died because the factory doors were locked to prevent stealing. The two fires prove that Bangladesh is lagging behind at least one hundred years from the USA. //////In Bangladesh, corruption has already reached the peak. The Bahaddarhat accident in Chittagong city is a clear example of it. This is not the first time that the flyover collapsed. If the government had taken strict action after the first accident, maybe it would not have happened for the second time. As usual, our government will form an inquiry committee but the investigation result may seem absurd to us. And the real culprits will roam free. Not only that, they will prepare themselves for future crime. It is high time the government took exemplary action against the culprits.//////After the deaths of 160 Palestinians, including 10 of a family and 5 Israelis during a few days' conflict, a ceasefire has been announced with the effort of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. It is reported that US President Barack Obama spoke to the Egyptian President and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on the night of November 19, 2012. We were very upset about the escalation of violence and are now feeling relieved by the news of ceasefire. We hope the ceasefire will not be temporary; the world leaders must take steps to make it permanent. The Palestinians are the victims; they are deprived of their land and have been living under occupation for so many years. They have the right to live with dignity. The USA, the Arab countries and others must try to execute a two-state plan so that Palestine and Israel can exist side by side in total harmony. This is the only solution to permanent peace and we hope Israel will not object to it. //////We are living in a world of uncertainty as far as climate and agriculture are concerned. Although there are a handful of scientists who disagree, but available evidences suggest that climate change is a real threat to sustainable agriculture, particularly food crop production system. Climate changes are occurring dramatically over which we have almost no control. This phenomenon is visible in the occurrence of frequent natural disasters (recent cyclone Sandy in the USA is an example,) which are due to the adverse impacts of climate change. //////I am one of those lucky persons who participated in the Hay Festival and got the opportunity to meet many distinguished personalities of the country and abroad. The whole programme was organised in a very systematic way. I have found many foreigners who were very pleased to have joined the festival. This festival will definitely encourage many new writers of the country. I came to know that our country has already progressed a lot in the field of English literature. I am eagerly waiting for the next Hay Festival to and strongly believe that next time there will be more participation. I feel this festival is a great achievement for our country.//////History tells us that Rohingya people's ancestors lived in the western part of erstwhile Burma even before the first Anglo-Burmese war that broke out in 1823. Since then the Rohingyas have been living there generation after generation. By any standard or consideration, the Rohingyas are the true sons of the soil and deserve to be treated as full citizens of Myanmar. //////Kanchpur, Meghna and Daudkandi are three important bridges at different points on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway. I recently noticed that some of the lights on these bridges are not working, which may cause serious accidents. Therefore, I, on behalf of the people, draw kind attention of the authorities concerned to the matter and urge them to replace the lights.//////I have been noticing for some time that some cinema posters and billboards of diamond jewellery, body spray, boutique, beauty products, etc., are really objectionable. The general public feel ashamed to look at those billboards. Not only that. Advertisements of these products are also being aired on television channels regularly. In the entertainment pages of some newspapers, obscene photos are published. Our culture is being influenced by foreign culture in such a way that it has become hard to find a movie or entertainment programme that we can watch together with our families.//////We have learnt from a report of this daily on a roundtable entitled Barriers to mainstreaming of children with disabilities in education held at The Daily Star Centre in Dhaka that Braille books which are used by the visually challenged students are pretty expensive. The report also reveals that there is no specially designed curriculum in schools for the physically challenged children.//////After a long vacation, Islamic University opens, but regretfully our honourable teachers have declared not to take classes sine die. They are on a strike demanding the resignation of the present vice chancellor along with pro-VC and treasurer. A handsome amount of public money is being spent for our education every year. Moreover, the hard-earned money sent by our parents is being wasted. If this situation continues, meritorious students will be reluctant to get admitted to IU. I urge the university authorities to break the deadlock as fast as possible considering the sufferings of the students.//////It takes almost 3 hours to go to Satkhira from Khulna due to the bad condition of the road. If the road was in good condition, it would take 45 minutes. Several reports were published on the matter in the national dailies but no steps have been taken to repair the road. We, the people of this area, have tried many times to draw the MP's attention to this major problem but didn't get any response from him. MPs forget their voters after winning the election. Should we vote for him in the next election? No one can blame us if we don't. MPs should always keep in mind that people are no fools. They now have options to make a better choice. //////Egypt's top court yesterday began an open-ended strike in what it called a "black day" for the judiciary after supporters of President Mohamed Morsi blocked the courthouse ahead of a key ruling, amid a tense standoff between the president and the judges.//////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas returned to the West Bank yesterday after winning upgraded UN status for the Palestinians, telling cheering crowds: "Yes, now we have a state."//////President Bashar al-Assad's forces yesterday hammered rebel positions with artillery and air strikes around Damascus, in a strategic assault aimed at securing the Syrian capital as phone and internet services returned after three days.//////Taliban suicide attackers struck at a Nato base on an Afghan city airport yesterday early morning, killing five people and wounding several foreign troops in a two-hour battle, officials said.//////The Pentagon, in a major expansion of its intelligence gathering activities, plans to assemble an espionage network rivaling the Central Intelligence Agency in size, The Washington Post reported late Saturday.//////Israel will not transfer tax and tariff funds its collects for the Palestinians this month in response to their successful bid for upgraded UN status, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said yesterday.//////The United States must prepare for a time when it no longer is at war with al-Qaeda, and when sweeping federal powers ushered in after the September 11, 2001 attacks come to an end, the Pentagon's top lawyer said.//////The tussle in India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party for its prime ministerial candidate in next parliamentary elections due in two years got an interesting turn on Saturday when its senior leader Sushma Swaraj saying Narendra Modi was fit for the top job.//////Ten main political parties in India had a whopping Rs 2,490 crore of tax-exempted income in the last five years, according to information from the Income Tax department through an RTI plea.//////At least two people have been arrested at a rally in Yangon held to condemn a violent police crackdown on protesters at a Chinese-backed copper mine, an activist and an AFP reporter said yesterday.//////US troops in Okinawa, southern Japan, have been banned from drinking off base, a US military statement said, following a spate of crimes including the alleged rape of a local woman in October.//////The government yesterday said it was confident of its numbers ahead of a crucial debate with voting on FDI in multi-brand retail in the Lok Sabha Dec 4-5. //////UK Muslim extremists have withdrawn their threat to behead a teenage girl who is recovering in a British hospital after she was shot by the Taliban in Pakistan.//////Fierce fighting between heavily armed rival clans in war-torn Somalia has killed at least 26 people in a dispute over grazing land and water, officials said yesterday.//////WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange vowed to keep exposing secret documents and defended his controversial website, two years after it published a massive trove of sensitive US diplomatic cables.//////The Kuwaiti opposition yesterday vowed to press on with its protests until a newly elected parliament is abolished and a disputed electoral law is scrapped, a day after a vote they boycotted.//////Fatima Bhutto, the writer-activist niece of slain former premier Benazir Bhutto, will contest Pakistan's upcoming general election from a constituency in Punjab province, her mother has said. 30-year-old Fatima, the daughter of Benazir's brother Murtaza Bhutto, has for long said that she has no plans to enter politics.//////Slovenians yesterday voted in a presidential run-off with opinion polls favouring former premier Borut Pahor, despite his support for government austerity plans that have brought thousands of protesters on to the streets.//////Dhaka Music enthusiasts and connoisseurs were in a musical high.

Here are some of the finest architectural beauties in the form of buildings, a gourmet's paradise and a cultural arena that beats many. Once a city in slumber, Dhaka is now a bouncy capital making news; the latest being classical music.//////Music enthusiasts of the port city were recently enthralled by the performance of Trio Nattergale, a troupe consisting of three Norwegians baroque musicians, //////The issue of safety in garment factories has again been brought to the fore after the horror of Tazreen Fashions fire. The result of the inspections carried out at the garment belt in the Ashulia area by fire service officials has provided the answer as to why the factories are so susceptible to fire. //////When the idea of the caretaker government system was floated in 1996 by Jamaat and then picked up by Awami League, it was fiercely opposed by the BNP which was in power. And now that it has been cancelled, demand for its restoration is being opposed tooth and nail by the government again, only the party that leads the government is Awami League.//////I wouldn't be surprised if on Valentine's Day, a garment factory owner in Bangladesh gift's his wife or mistress or girlfriend a Louis Vuitton handbag priced anywhere between $30,00 and $5,000. That's cheap! If he has class, he may serenade her in a $50,00 a night hotel suite with a partial view of the Central Park in New York, take her out for dinner at the Maxim's, and go on a diamond-buying spree at the Tiffany's. If he is really romantic and at the same time wants to announce loudly to his fellow kin how much he is worth, he will rent the yacht "Monkey Business" and sail to Bimini Island in the Bahamas with his lady love. If he is a stag, he may spend $1,250 per hour for a female escort's company in New York City or Las Vegas.//////As I pen this article I notice a piece in the ////// detailing the recent fire disaster at the Ashulia garment factory. The title "Why Bangladesh Keeps Burning" catches my attention. In my experience of keeping a close tab on news from Dhaka, this one incident has been receiving relatively wide coverage -- and scrutiny -- from the US press. It is ironic this accident took place at about the same time as Black Friday in the US. The day after Thanksgiving, referred to as Black Friday, is the biggest sales event for shoppers when retailers mark down prices on every item from the 42 inch TVs to winter jackets. It is hard to miss the connection that like in every holiday season, this year as well a large number of retailers were stocking their shelves with clothing made in Bangladesh when the factory fire broke out in Dhaka twelve time zones away. //////The International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) is a worldwide annual commemoration authorised by United Nations to focus on the theme of "removing barriers to create an inclusive and accessible society for all."
