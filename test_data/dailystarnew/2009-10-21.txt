That a fire could occur at such an important place, one which has a direct link with education, is certainly beyond the imagination. Naturally, therefore, the first question which springs to mind relates to the presence or otherwise of adequate fire fighting equipment in the warehouse. Given the fact that till yesterday the fire could not be put out fully, one can reasonably guess that the NCTB warehouse did not have any equipment it could employ to limit the damage caused by the conflagration. And so from our question we move on to another: how is it that in all these years no one gave a thought to the necessary fire fighting equipment that might be needed at some point? When a building houses important documents and papers (and the NCTB is surely that), it should have been for the authorities to have such precautions in place.//////NAGAR Bhaban day before yesterday was the scene of heightened tension centring around tendering for a lease of a parking space and three pieces of construction work. These are meant for a ward under Dhaka City Corporation.//////YOU watch the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and you wonder where all the good people in it have gone. It is, of course, another matter that you may not consider the party a true representative of popular aspirations as they shaped up in the 1960s and during the entirety of the War of Liberation. Its coming into being was, as we have learned so sadly and so bitterly by now, fundamentally geared to putting our secularism under the rug or even cause it to crash headlong into the rocks below our perch of Bengali nationalistic fervour. But that is a subject for another day. We will talk about it later, as we have talked about it in the past.//////THE summit on climate change at the UN in New York on September 22 has given a strong boost to negotiations over an important international treaty on global warming in Copenhagen in December.

The continued primacy of personal laws in matters of marriage, divorce, maintenance and child custody and adoption discriminates against women in respect of rights within the family. Citizenship laws also discriminate on their face against women. De facto discrimination in opportunities for education and employment as well as access to resources and to services, in particular healthcare, further imposes various barriers on women in exercising their rights. Women face discrimination both in public and private spheres. Violence continues to be a significant feature of the everyday experience of many Bangladeshi women. The actual figures for sexual assault, rape and domestic violence are undoubtedly high, not least because a widespread culture of intimidation inhibits reporting. Moreover, in cases involving the transgression of 'sexual honour,' the fear of social stigmatisation discourages making such incidents public. //////Do we want to move forward or backward?

Sad but true, this bizarre phenomenon is taking place in your vicinity. Yes, you got it--I'm talking of our country Bangladesh. It's all happening here these days. No doubt we've got a country mired in widespread corruption in every bit of the body.

Students who passed SSC & HSC in 2001 & 2003 are now blocking roads and vandalizing vehicles. Why do the general students have to take this kind of steps? Why are they victmised? As a general student, I want this problem to be solved immediately. I would like to draw the authorities' attention in this regard and expect them to be more concerned about this matter. //////It is very sad to see that that those who deal with the rules of the education sector do not know the elaboration of an international degree like DVM (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine) and the value of this degree. If we want to make the rules of national education sector, we should know the exact meaning and the value of the degree. I have seen that the rule makers of national education sector elaborate the DVM degree as Diploma in Veterinary Medicine. My point is that at first we should know the exact meaning of diploma and the difference between diploma and bachelor's degree. //////Former finance minister and BNP leader Saifur Rahman died in a road accident on September 5, when he was returning to Dhaka from his home district.

The prime minister didn't officially issue a condolence message to the media or his bereaved family. //////How could the present gov't decide to give new school timing without withdrawing the Day Time Saving( DST)? Has anyone thought about it at all? The Fajar Namaj starts at 6.25am and finishes at around 6.45am.
