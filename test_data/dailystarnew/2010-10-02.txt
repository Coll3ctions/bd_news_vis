Coming to specifics, the particular interest would be to see how the relationship can be delineated in statutes. There is, understandably, a pressing need to understand how police organisations are held accountable in democratic polity and also the role of political executive in police accountability.//////Local Government Institutions (LGIs) can play a significant role in the overall development of a country. Since majority of population of developing countries live at the local level, structure of the local government bodies should be designed in such a way that these bodies are administered by elected representatives. At the same time, avenues should be created for participation of local people in the decision making bodies. Involvement of citizens in the political decision making process can be considered as a prerequisite to establish good governance and democracy. Nowadays it has been realized that real development is difficult keeping citizens away from the policy-making process. Realizing the essence of strengthening LGIs, the government of Bangladesh reintroduced the Upazila Parishad (UZP) in 2009.//////Indigenous people constitute at least 5,000 distinct peoples with a population of more than 370 million, living in 70 different countries.

After enforced silence people feel free to speak their minds. //////Due to rapid and unplanned urbanization and industrialization the Dhaka city's surrounding rivers, including the Turag have gradually experienced undue and unbearable pressure to their very existence. Precisely speaking, a handful of complicated problems have almost suffocated these lifelines the city. Of all the problems taking on the rivers, pollution is one that predominates. However, the pollution level and pattern of all the rivers of the city are not the same. The writer has roughly investigated the spatial and temporal pattern along with the extreme pollution points of the Turag River especially from the Buriganga Third Bridge to Tongi Bridge. This write-up intends to elucidate these issues in brief.//////I find it remarkable that one other leading light of the English Department of Dhaka University has made an appearance as a poet. In Bangladesh, Prof. Ahsanul Haque could long ago compose poetry with his individual stamp. One may feel deprived, quite rightly, for the lately-appeared poet's not making it regular or quicker; but never will the poems be found to be a sign of mere self-gratification on Haque's part. //////It was like a 1950s Hindi movie set.

Impromptu poetry recitals. Romantic interludes under a humongous moon peeping in and out of autumnal clouds. Torrents of rain - then flashes of sunlight, temperatures not too unbearable. Distant rolling thunder. A firefly or two setting hearts on fire. Cerebral conversation, evocative laughter. Loud singing in the distance in accompaniment of kortals, cymbals, dholok and the harmonium.//////Baghdad, I will always remember//////the cobalt slide in your neighborhood park,//////your multi-storied, brick apartment buildings,//////rows of stores on concrete streets and muddy roads,//////flowerbeds in shades of periwinkle, crimson,//////aquamarine, tangerine, and yellow topaz,//////alabaster statues of Sheherazade's Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,//////your mazaars, burial tombs of ancient Islamic leaders////// whose lives intertwined with yours, as has mine.//////Along with millions of Muslims around the world, many people here in Bangladesh are getting prepared to move to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform the holy Hajj.

It has been more than two months after Madhav Kumar Nepal resigned as Nepal's Prime Minister. Eight rounds of election has thus far failed to elect a new leader. The fact that the country does not yet have a Constitution and that the present House is not a regular hung parliament like in Britain rather the first elected Constituent Assembly formed to write a new statute of the country compounds the already complex problem. The annual budget is already two months late and indications are that without a consensus across party-lines, the current lame-duck government will not be able to present the budget let alone ratify it. //////THE Afghans have once again proved many pundits wrong. Sceptics who were predicting that the Parliamentary election on September 18th cannot be held in the face of the Taliban resistance were disappointed. The Taliban failed to cause any dent on the Afghan resolve and despite scattered violence, the polling went ahead smoothly. Peaceful holding of the election is, no doubt, a big achievement for the Afghan people and the government. It is true that there were many problems in the election. There were forged voter ID cards, ghost-voters on the voter-list, ex-Warlords and ex-Taliban seeking votes, poor voter turn-out on the Election Day and numerous complaints of voting irregularities. Yet, hundreds of candidates, including women, contested the election, thousands held rallies and campaigned for their candidates and in the end, millions went to the polling stations. This was proof enough of the peoples' desire to see a modern democratic Afghanistan, rather than a strict Islamic theocracy that the Talibans offer. //////ISLAMABAD: Nato reversed its position on aerial strikes by its helicopter gunships inside Pakistan on Monday after Islamabad warned the US-led forces in Afghanistan of counter-measures.//////Prominent development economist Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize in 1998.

He is so possessive about his dream that he would not his younger three brothers to have the same dream. //////Michael Foot was a brilliant intellectual who also happened to be a politician. In an earlier era, he might have been a philosopher-king or a wise counsellor to a monarch in the best traditions of history. You could think here of Merlin in that old tale of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. There was a profusion of wisdom in Merlin, something which only reinforced itself when one day he chose to venture a metaphysical explanation of a spate of gloom in the king. When Arthur looked out the window and intoned, sadly, It is a dark day, a troubled day, Merlin told him in dispassionate manner, It is a day, just a day, my lord. You have a dark and troubled mind.//////
