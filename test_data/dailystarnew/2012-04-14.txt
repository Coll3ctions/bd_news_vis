The exchequer will receive $141million upon signing of the contract and the rest in six equal instalments. Though the loan falls under IMF's concessional lending regime, there are tough conditions to be met for the government to avail the loan.//////It is appalling to note that as many as 5.5 million members of Dalit and Harijan communities barely exist on the peripheries of the mainstream society. They lead a subhuman life in the sense that they are clearly neglected, marginalised and excluded in the national scheme of things. A country emerging from the ashes of a hard-fought war to establish an egalitarian society can ill afford such discriminatory treatment to a particular community on the grounds of their origin. More so, when our Constitution proclaims equality of all citizens, irrespective of caste, creed and faith in the eye of the State.//////"Oh was it today?

Being a novice tree planter, I learn from word of mouth. The optimal time for planting trees lasts barely over a month: the period between the first rain of the year in ////// and the onset of full monsoon in //////. If I plant too early, the soil is not ready to allow the roots to penetrate and get nourishment. If I wait until the rains are in full swing, then the saplings will not benefit much from this year's rains, since it takes time for the roots to take hold. The ideal planting time is the start of the rains. //////Law enforcers have tightened security and issued traffic and necessary instructions to make today's celebration of Pahela Baishakh smooth and

But it is not famous for generosity in strategic policy.//////Today, the nation celebrates Pahela Baishak, the first day of the Bengali New Year, with traditional pomp and splendour. People from all walks of life, dressed for the occasion, will enjoy open-air cultural programmes, colourful parades, wrestling, and fairs across the country. //////The decision to revive the Rooppur nuclear power project after about 50 years raises some questions in the public mind. Power generation by nuclear reactor in a country lacking enough fossil fuels is definitely a viable option. But whether it is a boon or a bane has to be studied dispassionately in the light of nuclear catastrophes that have struck some places with horrifying consequences.//////Nowhere has literature been so much entangled with the political history of a land as it has been in Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh had to fight for self-determination; that political struggle against colonial exploitation by Pakistan was over in 1971. But soon another monster raised its head, a hydra-headed monster with multifarious tentacles, the worst of which were religious fanaticism and communal hatred. After the killing of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975, fundamentalist forces came to power with the help of the anti-liberation forces both inside and outside Bangladesh. A new fight started, which was more bloody and devastating, because this time the enemies were more covert and guileful and more relentless and brutal. Bangladesh has experienced some terrible carnage since 1975, particularly in the nineties. Mass killings through bomb attacks on religious and cultural venues, on Bangali New Year celebrations, in cinema halls and mosques have been witnessed by us. Following the demolition of the Babri mosque, there were riots, forcing many Hindus to flee across the border. Bands of fundamentalist thugs appeared in the northern districts of the country and went on a killing spree. Members of minor religious sects like the Ahmadiyas were persecuted: bombs hurled into their mosque in Khulna killed dozens of people. Bangladesh turned into a virtual killing field and figured on the international media as a potentially dangerous tract of land.//////Pahela Baishakh fills us with renewed ardour and zeal which comes in new contours every year. Shubho Nababarsha is the tiding of the day, and I cannot but help share my thoughts with all. Tagore's classic call esho hey baishakh esho esho awakens us today as always on this auspicious day.//////She sat there on a lonely rock//////Face buried deep in her palms//////She smiled at every passer-by//////As they offered her some alms//////Vocal health is critical to our communication-oriented society, but the voice does not receive public recognition and appreciation it deserves.

This number is expected to double by 2030 and more than triple by 2050. Dementia affects people in all countries, with more than half (58 percent) living in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh. By 2050, this is likely to rise to more than 70%.//////There is obvious need to increase the number of skilled nurses and normalise the current reverse doctor-nurse ratio.//////A three-year-old boy has been kept alive with an artificial heart for more than eight months, which doctors say is a record for a child in the UK.//////A cheap medical device can dramatically reduce the number of premature births in some at-risk women, according to a team of doctors in Spain. Being born before 34 weeks of pregnancy is linked to a host of health problems. The study, published in the Lancet, showed that using a "cervical pessary"  a small ring of silicone, inserted into their cervix, reduced the rate in the at-risk group.//////Obesity during pregnancy can raise the risk of autism, according to a new study published in the journal Paediatrics. The study found the risk of autism and other developmental delays was 60 percent higher among those born to mothers who were obese, hypertensive or diabetic.//////Talks between Iran and the P5+1 group - the five permanent UN Security Council members plus Germany may take place in Istanbul on April 13 and 14 or any other date in the following days with an objective of seeking a prospective solution to the alleged nuclear program of Iran. Sergei Ryabkov, deputy foreign minister of Russia told the Interfax news agency ten days before the upcoming talks, "There are hotheads whotalk about the possibility of resorting to force." Hotheads are those among the US, Israeli and EU political leaders and policy makers, who are likely to rejoice hot war with Iran. The hotheads in the US, to satisfy the hotheads in Israel, have clarified their position that Iran would be attacked if it does not agree with their demands. //////Is the victory of opposition in by-elections, particularly Aung San Suu Kyi, seriously implying that the military junta of Myanmar , one of the most brutal, oppressive regimes of today's world is going to 'ease its grips' or allow an actual 'political transition' started last year after decades of repression? The narrative says that the mass people of Myanmar are against the military dictatorship. It is being told, Myanmar is no longer an isolated tyranny but a part of widespread rising in which the West's moral integrity is going to be tested also. As the West has been walking a tightrope of contradictory principles, it must support this victory gently. That means the West must not sponsor them but at the same time must act to prevent the repressive regimes from crushing them. This is a complex maneuver. The failure to support the rising will be a betrayal of fundamental moral principles. Leaving aside whether the narrative is accurate, it particularly appeals to Europeans with their ideological preference for 'soft power.' Self-imposed isolation has not only snoozed possible change over a decade- that with more engagement, Myanmar could have opened and risen like Vietnam has. The whole situation not only deprived the world's poorest country but also pushed the government into the arms of neighbours with bigger bankrolls and the worst human rights record.//////During the 19th and early 20th centuries, religion lost influence, but the religious impulse lingered on. Some people sought salvation in the secular religions of politics in Communism, fascism and various utopian experiments. Others saw artists, musicians and writers as Holy Men, who could provide transcendence and meaning, revealing timeless truths on how to live. //////Anything to do with women's dilemmas immediately takes on an intriguing quality for most of us women. Women in any part of the globe are worth studying, knowing more about. Women in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, in particular, have so much to say (or hide), and there are many ways of looking at their views (or silences).//////The books we've read and the movies we've seen tend to show the squalor in Indian cities but veer toward the optimistic, typically happy endings. Think of ////// that begins with Jamal Malik jumping into a pit of excrement but ends, much later, with his dancing on the platforms of Mumbai's elegant railroad station. Squalor, degradation and poverty abound in the film, as well as organized crime, but still we are smiling and cheering for the underdog by the uplifting ending. //////
