To no one's surprise, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party kept up the boycott of proceedings it began months ago as a way of highlighting its grievances. Among those grievances are the grouse of the party's lawmakers about seating arrangements in the House and about the notice served on the leader of the opposition relating to vacating her cantonment residence. It is now quite clear that on a solution to these problems, one to the BNP's liking, hinges the question of its return to the House. For the nation as well as for those who voted the party's lawmakers into legislative office, it is a most unfortunate situation. For the nation, the boycott is increasingly looking like an attempt to make the JS an ineffectual and therefore an uninspiring body.

The lamb bleated timidly. Then you called me names, the wolf nagged still forcefully. How long ago sir? The lamb wondered miserably. The wolf asserted, A year ago Sir I am only six months old.

Bryan wrote: In an era when most of us seem to be working more hours than ever provided we're still lucky enough to have jobs, 17,000 people in Utah have embarked on an unusual experiment. A year ago, the Beehive State became the first in the US to mandate a four-day workweek for most state employees, closing offices on Fridays in an effort to reduce energy costs. The move is different from a furlough in that salaries were not cut; nor was the total amount of time employees work. They pack in 40 hours by starting earlier and staying later four days a week. But on that fifth (glorious) day, they don't have to commute, and their offices don't need to be heated, cooled or lit. After 12 months, Utah's experiment has been deemed so successful that a new acronym could catch on: TGIT (thank God it's Thursday). The state found that its compressed workweek resulted in a 13% reduction in energy use and estimated that employees saved as much as $6 million in gasoline costs. Altogether, the initiative will cut the state's greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 12,000 metric tons a year. And perhaps not surprisingly, 82% of state workers say they want to keep the new schedule. //////Nowadays, swine flu has become a serious threat to the world as well as to our country.
