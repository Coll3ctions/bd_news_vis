But what advantage the country and its people will gain from such enhancement of status under the new category of MIC? //////The figures say it all. Between January and September this year, no fewer than 434 incidents of stalking of women have been recorded in the country. In the same period, 22 women, unable to resist their tormentors, opted to commit suicide. Note too that other instance of shame in the period we speak of: 34 fatwas have been issued in different regions of the country over incidents involving women -- and this when there are clear High Court directives against fatwas. Overall, these figures inform us of all that we as citizens yet need to do where guaranteeing the safety and security of women is concerned. There is little question that a clear degree of awareness has been created among the populace regarding the menace of stalking or sexual harassment of women throughout the country. The spirited manner in which citizens have been coming together to combat the danger is out there for us to see. It is a condition that should make us feel happy, for seemingly matters are under control.

A flash flood recently submerged the low-lying areas of the upazilas, creating acute fodder crisis. Moreover, erosion by the river Padma and the Meghna multiplied the problem. During the recent river erosion and flash flood, affected families along with their domestic animals, including cows and goats, took shelter on embankment and high lands. The affected people, somehow, managed two meals a day but their cattle remained half fed or unfed. They are quite unable to purchase fodder, including straw, rice dust and husk for their high prices in the local markets. Shefali Begum of Sadipur area under Sadar upazila said that she along with her cow took shelter on the nearby embankment during the recent flood. She said she was quite unable to rear her cow for lack of fodder.//////An anti-stalking forum, based on social networking site facebook, formed a human chain in front of Rangpur Press Club yesterday morning.

In our country, over the last few years, women have become visible as productive labour force, but they are deprived of their rights. Women generally work longer hours than men, but they are paid less than men. Undoubtedly, it is a heinous conspiracy to undervalue women's work and their contribution to society. In Bangladesh, female domestic workers are treated badly too. This under-valuation not only reduces women's bargaining power, but also deprives them of the legal rights.//////The news of demolition of the tilted building by Rajuk did not convince me (source: The Daily Star, 14-11-2010)! An under-construction seven-storey building in Kathalbagan tilted a few days ago. Rajuk, rather than the owner himself, demolished the tilted building! //////The proposed Tipaimukh dam would be one of the rock-filled dams in the world. The main purpose of constructing this dam is to generate hydroelectric power. Bangladesh and its biodiversity will face serious consequences if this dam is constructed. The construction of the dam will destroy the livelihoods of millions of people. All political parties must put aside their differences and unite on this issue. We have seen the consequences of Farakka, and we do not want another Farakka.//////At the time of enrolment in the school, most of the students submit fake birth certificates. As far as I know, there are many parents who change their children's date of birth while getting their kids admitted. According to the rules of the Directorate of Primary Education and the six education boards, a student must be above six years for enrolment in class 1 and 14+ for sitting for the SSC examination. How can it be possible for a student to sit for the SSC examination at the age of 14+, getting him/her admitted into class one at the age of 6? I think, everyone will agree with me that it is quite impossible for a student to pass SSC examination before the age of 16+. //////An editorial, published in a local English daily on 10th November, dealt with the busting of an arms factory near Cox's Bazaar. This is just an example of current trend of violence and lawlessness that is fast spreading all over Bangladesh, which is rapidly creating market for illegal arms and ammunitions. Meanwhile, 'eve-teasing', armed robbery, kidnapping, killing and extortion are matters of everyday affair, which was rare and scarce only a decade or so ago. Today, it has become a sad and ugly part of our daily news, with only a small part being reported! //////I was disappointed with the editorials, A legal battle takes to the street and BNP's hartal published on November 14 and 15, 2010, respectively.//////A report entitled Trees dying in Dhaka published in The Daily Star on 12th November 2010 says that experts are clueless behind the reasons of the death or decay of trees. The experts may be clueless but I, a layman, am not clueless about the reason. My office is in Uttara on Alaol Avenue. There is a road going out of the avenue. The police quarters stand on the road. The road is lined with green trees on both sides. I walk through that road at least twice a day. A few months back in the morning I found, to my astonishment, many trees on the road were scaled from top to bottom. It was done overnight, because the previous evening while I was passing through the road, I saw the trees ok. //////This time, for sure, the Awami League has netted the ball. It was a very smart decision by the AL to evict Khaleda Zia from her residence, keeping in mind that invariably the BNP would go for hartal the following day on November 14, just two days ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, thereby making BNP more unpopular.//////Finally, Bangladesh has earned a silver medal in the Asian Games, which is undoubtedly great news for the nation. We are feeling extremely proud to see our country's name in the list of the medal winners. We should now try to groom this cricket team. //////The Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Ltd, BTCL has raised its overseas call charges, at least in case of the UK for sure, by as much as three and a half times the previous rate. Since mid August, 2010, they are charging at the rate of TK.24 per minute for a call to the UK (land phone to land phone) irrespective of whether it is dialed through 012 or 00. It was (for dialing through 012) Tk. 7.50 per minute before. According to BTCL, their overseas call rates have been changed since mid August, 2010 as per instruction of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, BTRC. They have now done away with the economy ISD rate and made it same for both 00 and 012 dialing. Regrettably, this they have done with no prior notification.//////The BNP has called another hartal on 30th November 2010. The funny thing is that they are calling this hartal not for establishing people's demands, not for fulfilling the rights of people, but for their leader who has been evicted from her residence. //////Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November (November 25 this year) in the United States of America.

In Bangladesh, violence against women and girls is becoming more and more common and widespread across the country. The so called "eve teasing" is getting wide attention because girls and their guardians are being attacked, and sometimes murdered, because they protested against it. //////Sparkling waters of the Indian Ocean with variegated shades of blue surround islands with luxurious over-water bungalows trembling on lagoons.

It is a pity to find this date disappearing from our consciousness and conspicuously missing in the array of designated national dates. //////We are a power-starved nation. According to some statistics, access to electricity in Bangladesh is one of the lowest in the world -- around 70 percent of the total population does not have electricity. In other words, among some 30 million families, about 23 million are deprived of power, most of who live in rural areas.
