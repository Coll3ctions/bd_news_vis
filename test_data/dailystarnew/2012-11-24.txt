Planned and deliberate attacks on police testify to diabolic designs and definitely do not augur well for a democratic polity. It is thus no wonder that the home minister has brushed aside suggestions for holding discussions with the protesters and is determined to confront and subdue them before talks can start.//////United States President Barack Obama's history-making visit to Southeast Asia this week was a consummate display of American high-level diplomacy.//////One year on from the Olympics, the eyes of the world will again be on the United Kingdom next summer, as we host the G8 at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. Some people ask: does the G8 still matter, when we have a G20? My answer is "Yes." The G8 is a group of like-minded nations who share a belief in free enterprise as the best route to growth.

People here, before long, will feel like being driven away by the accelerating deterioration in the quality of life caused by clogged roads, eye-stinging smog, polluted streets, parks, and lakes, unaffordable housing, overcrowded schools, colleges and hospitals and polluting industries. The very qualities that lured millions to Dhaka 30 years ago are threatening to disappear. In this winter season, auto exhausts and chemicals hang lower and longer than before, affecting human health. //////In order to ensure better corporate governance, efficiency, profitability and more vibrancy, the state-owned commercial banks were converted into public limited companies few years ago, giving more power and responsibilities to the board of directors. In view of this, the government formulated policy guidelines in April 2009 with respect to appointment of directors and chairman in nationalised commercial banks (NCBs), specialised banks (SBs) and financial institutions (FIs). These policy guidelines, inter-alia, include maximum number of directors, qualification and experience of directors, disqualification of directors, term, re-appointment and other pertinent issues. //////World War II: Slovakia becomes a signatory to the Tripartite Pact, officially joining the Axis Powers.//////We are so constrained a people, situationally and conditionally, that we tend to ignore many implied ills for a single apparent gain. Such an issue is the ever-expanding brick-making industry, given the fact that brick appears to be an essential item in this era of urbanisation and industrialisation. But, unfortunately, many consequential problems have arisen for not having any effective precautionary measure to contain establishment of illegal brick kilns and use of firewood as fuel, check loss of cropland and top soil, and stop hill cutting. //////Global warming has seldom been mentioned this year on the campaign trail, despite Obama's promise to the contrary//////By 2030, more people in India will be reading English fiction and non-fiction than in Europe and North America. This population is estimated to be 500 million (half a billion). It is no wonder Western publishers are making book launches more and more in India these days. India is where an emerging English fiction and non-fiction reading market lies. More and more words, phrases and caricatures of South Asian origin are entering English literature. With a wave of freshness and originality, authors of Indian origin have changed the landscape of English literature and created a new wave and genre totally of their own. This genre is different because the Soul of South Asia is different --- rich in variety, deep in history and tradition.//////Fakrul Alam (notice the missing h) is the youngest of the trio that also includes Syed Manzoorul Islam and Kaiser Haq. They have been friends for more than four decades. They are almost of the same age. They are the most creative among our teachers who are still active. Even readers expect me to write simultaneously on all three of them. This time I have a powerful reason. I remembered Syed Manzoorul Islam and Kaiser Haq when they reached sixty in January 2010. Then a few readers enquired, 'What about Dr. Fakrul Alam?' I assured them that I would write on him when he reached sixty in July 2011. I am sorry that I am a little late in keeping my promise. //////Take a moment to imagine the world from the point of view of a deaf-mute person. For those of us who are blessed with the ability to hear and speak, imagining ourselves being silent in a silent world is not an easy task. Very few of us comprehend how blessed we are to possess those abilities and even fewer of us refrain from complaining about our almost perfect lives. It is simply because we take those abilities for granted and forget to be grateful. //////Renowned author and poet Vikram Seth delivered a talk at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) on Sunday, 18 November 2012 at its permanent campus at Bashundhara, Dhaka. Prof. Razia S Khan delivered the introductory speech and welcomed everyone to the talk where she introduced the author.

Israeli politicians have again trotted out the usual Zionist crowd-pleasers about the need to bomb Gaza back to the Middle Ages (Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai) and flatten all of Gaza (Ariel Sharon's son Gilad). Yet the regional situation today is very different to what it was back then. In 2009, the 'resistance axis' of Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas was strong, and Iran took concrete steps to provide military supplies to Hamas at a time when the best most other states had to offer was impotent and generally hypocritical 'condemnation'. As intelligence analysts Stratfor have noted, where the rest of the region largely avoided direct involvement....Iran was the exception. While the Arab regimes ostracized Hamas, Iran worked to sustain the group in its fight. The report elaborates: In early January 2009, in the midst of Operation Cast Lead, Israel learned that Iran was allegedly planning to deliver 120 tons of arms and explosives to Gaza, including anti-tank guided missiles and Iranian-made Fajr-3 rockets with a 40-kilometer (25-mile) range and 45-kilogram (99-pound) warhead...The long-range Fajr rocket attacks targeting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in the current conflict are a testament to Iran's continued effort.//////The upsurge of fighting between Israel and Hamas has highlighted, once again, the total disparity of force between the two sides. //////Barack Obama's visit to Southeast Asia, which started on Sunday 18 November and is culminating with his attendance at the East Asia Summit in Cambodia, underscores America's stepped-up re-engagement in what is considered China's backyard.//////Note: It was a special privilege to be a discussant on the panel of the Daily Star Publications launch of the esteemed journalist Kuldip Nayar's book on 16 November, at 6.30 pm, at Bangla Academy. I was asked by the Daily Star representative to look at the literary aspects of the autobiography. I chose to focus on the 'Culture of Geography'.//////The liberation of Bangladesh witnessed a spectacular surge in immigration outside the motherland. Almost every part of Bangladesh, rural and urban, felt the effects of the new trend. But not much research was undertaken in the academic circles on this aspect of the new country.//////It is believed that parents know their children better than anyone else. But do they really? And do they always know what's best for them? Jodi Picoult's The Pact, like several of her other novels, deals with adolescents and their dilemmas. It is an eye-opener, a wake-up call for all parents.//////
