That he was a leader who mattered, that in his hands lay the destiny of Pakistan was made obvious by the glowing tributes paid to him by such leading national newspapers as the Karachi-based Dawn. His sagacity and his vision were all remarked upon. That said, it was for the first time in the Bengali leader's life that his birthday was being observed in the two wings of Pakistan.//////At least five dacoits including two ringleaders of robbery gangs were killed in a shootout with Rapid Action Battalion personnel in Morabhola canal of the Sundarbans yesterday.//////An alleged mugger was killed in a shootout between police and a gang of carjackers in the capital's Mohammadpur yesterday. //////Parliamentarians of home and abroad launched a unique network to engage parliaments and their members across the globe in advocating policies that would help climate victim nations effectively address global warming challenges.//////India yesterday hiked its defence budget by more than 17 percent for fiscal year 2012-13, which starts from April, and announced tax cuts for the salaried class.//////Death toll jumped to 145 in the Meghna launch capsize as rescuers found six more bodies yesterday, three days after the tragedy.//////Former ISI chief Asad Durrani has admitted funding BNP during the 1991 parliamentary elections. //////Bangladesh and India yesterday discussed measures to bring down incidents of firing along their border to a zero level as the chiefs of the border guard forces of the two countries began their meeting here.//////Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (Ruet) was declared closed for 13 days to avoid tensions following the death of a BCL leader yesterday.//////Health researchers said on Thursday they had found a troubling link between higher consumption of rice and Type 2 diabetes, a disease that in some countries is becoming an epidemic.//////The divisional round of The Daily Star Spelling Bee contest begins today from Sylhet division.//////Libyan security forces said on Thursday they had dismantled a human trafficking network smuggling illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Somalia.//////By persisting with its boycott of parliament, neither the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), nor the parliament, nor the nation has gained anything in any way.//////Experts on the environment have urged the government to form a single national river authority under a stringent law to save the country's rivers. Risks to our rivers as identified in a report on the protection of rivers, recently shared at a press conference held on the subject, include the decrease of water level and water flow, river pollution, filling up of rivers, erosion of banks, river grabbing and construction of illegal structures in their places. According to experts, all these problems are created by people with vested, selfish, and commercial interests and the law must be designed so as to deal with these issues and those responsible for them. The issue of India's projects on river-linking and Tipaimukh dam and China's plan to build a dam on the Brahmaputra River were also raised by experts. //////"I don't want to talk rather I want to dance right at this moment.

And yesterday's Asia Cup game at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium became the moment of history all of world cricket had been awaiting for a year and three days. He reached the much-awaited, often much-maligned and ultimately the much-adored milestone of one-hundred international hundreds.//////Shakib Al Hasan is a game-changer.//////There was a lot of doubt whether Sachin Tendulkar would do the post-match press conference after Bangladesh's 5-wicket win over India.

The State organs are largely the objects of people's wrath, rightly or wrongly. The State apparatus left behind by the British standing above and insulated from society with the police as one of its primary agencies always attracted the nationalist leaders. However, there were very little efforts to modify the British Indian State.//////Numbers are important in a parliamentary system and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's assertion that he has them should be assuring to the ruling Congress. After its debacle in state elections of UP and Punjab, the party's anxiety is understandable. //////Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He struggled hard and made great sacrifices to rise to fame and become the Father of the Nation of the newly created state of Bangladesh in 1971.

Concerned citizens and the media have from time to time raised alarms, but they fell on deaf ears.//////Led by Muhammad, the Muslims of Medina defeat the Quraysh of Mecca in theBattle of Badr.//////Three species of vultures endemic to South Asia including Bangladesh, oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis), long-billed vulture (G. indicus) and slender-billed vulture (G. tenuirostris), are listed as being threatened with extinction after rapid population declines in this region. Populations of three Gyps vulture species in parts of their ranges in South Asia fell by more than 95 percent in the 1990s, and all are now classified as Critically Endangered. Unless major steps are taken, all three species could soon be facing extinction. The white-rumped vulture -- once the most populous large bird of prey -- is under particular threat, having declined by 99.9 per cent. During the 1980s the oriental white-backed vulture was so abundant in this region that it was probably the most common large bird of prey in the world. More than 97 per cent of vultures have disappeared from this region's skies in the past 15 years -- the fastest decline ever recorded in a bird population anywhere in the world. Only about 10,000 still exist in the wild in the sub-continent, down from tens of millions in the 1980s.//////In order to contest the escalating risk of climate change, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1994 by a group of proactive governments of the world. Albeit it conceded that GHGs emission needs to be reduced; the convention, however, did not set any mandatory level of reduction for any individual state. Credential of incepting Clean Development Mechanism or in brief CDM as a way of climate change mitigation goes to article 12 of Kyoto Protocol. CDM as a collaborative approach of work for promotion of sustainable development can be accomplished by unique partnership between developing and developed countries toward climate change mitigation. //////They rush in roaring, marching past the pond, over the playground, across the jungle. Their faces painted black and white look grotesque, and they hold blood-drenched swords drawn high above their heads. These are the dreaded gang of robbers. Turn over everything that you have, they demand. Hapless homeowners are seized with fear. But wait, here come the fearless defenders. Oh, what a fight they put up! Bullets fly, smoke gushes. Once the firefight is over, the vanquished robbers surrender unconditionally. //////Nirmal-babu has been a problem ever since he has retired from the college and came to live in Dhaka. He lived in Boro-digha quite contently. The few occasions Krishna visited him were of dire necessity when she stayed in her paternal house nearby. Avita and Ovi stayed with him once and were looked after well by other residents of his quarter. They were students of the college who lived there free of board and lodging and had the common characteristics of being poor and meritorious distant relations. Kobita, Avita and Ovi saw more of him in the earlier part of their lives when he would come to Dhaka during the vacations. Then the visits became less frequent, Krishna got promoted and moved to a larger quarter. Ovi's hair and dress styles took turns that were increasingly and startlingly bizarre in Nirmal-babu's eyes and Avita permanently became Avita Chatterjee through registration in her Secondary School Certificate form. Only close few kept the secret that she was previously known as Sobita Chattopadhay. Only Nirmal-babu had no reason to believe otherwise that she was Sobita Chattopadhay. //////This year winter has not been very generous to us living in Boston. I, a grown up, look forward to snow, just as children do, because snow days are often declared as holidays: no school, no work, no classes and no appointments. You stay at home, drink tea or coffee, watch TV or go on the Internet, listen to music, or do whatever you please. Snow days are unscheduled holidays, and are always welcome, at least to me.//////Over several decades, powerful medicines have been developed to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, AIDS, influenza and many bacterial infections; all medicines used to treat these infections are likely become ineffective because of resistance at some point. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has evolved to become a worldwide health threat. Of critical importance, every antibiotic ever developed is at risk. With a dearth of new antibiotics coming to market, the need for action to avert a developing global crisis in health care is increasingly urgent.//////Some children are born deaf. But with advancement of technology, children with hearing impairment can now hear and learn to listen and talk.//////Women need getting a Pap test  which detects cervical cancer  only once every three years, and do not need to be screened until age 21, even if they are sexually active earlier, according to new guidelines from a U.S. health panel.//////Digital mammography (kind of X-ray) is the gold standard for detection of breast cancer. Only mammography can detect 42% of breast cancer, but when ultrasound is added, diagnostic accuracy is increased up to 78%.//////In a small study on Finnish women who had recently entered menopause, those who stuck to an aerobic exercise programme for six months were less likely to report menopause symptoms like night sweats, hot flashes, mood swings and irritability than women who did not exercise.//////Eating red meat is associated with a sharply increased risk of death from cancer and heart disease, according to a new study. The more of it you eat, the greater the risk.//////The show off by the opposition on March 12 on contentious caretaker government has paralyzed the capital with rest of Bangladesh. The poor nation has lost tens of millions of work hours. Do not matter who win or loose people are the real sufferer. The capital itself gave ghost look more by the denial action by the government than opposition activities. The nation is earnest in the hope that the major players in politics will find peaceful resolution of the differences on political issues duly stamped by the parliament.//////1848 in Europe was the year that wasn't. In the spring and summer of that year, bourgeois intellectuals and working-class radicals staged upheavals from France to the Balkans, shaking ancient regimes and vowing to create new liberal democratic orders. The Arab Spring has periodically been compared to the stirrings of 1848. But with the exception of the toppling of the Orleans monarchy in France, the 1848 revolutions ultimately failed. Dynastic governments reasserted themselves. They did so for a reason that has troubling implications for the Middle East: Conservative regimes in mid-19th century Europe had not only the institutional advantage over their liberal and socialist adversaries but also the moral advantage.//////India's ruling Congress party was trounced in recent state elections especially in the all important province of Uttar Pradesh. The trends reinforced by the results portent trouble for both India and the West.//////Mahboob Alam, after all the years he spent in promoting Bangladesh's diplomacy abroad, could have lapsed into quiet superannuation. Or he could have followed in the footsteps of some of his colleagues in government who, after retirement, opted for a second life as columnists or television talk show guests. Alam chose to do neither. And one is happy that he made a different sort of choice, that of exploring the many unknown facets of history. You could well argue that in Alam there is a historian whose preoccupation happens to be a study of the history behind the curtain, history that has often gone into the making of history as we know it.//////Oratory has since the beginning of civilised existence kept people in thrall. Shakespeare provided a clue to the riveting nature of speeches in his plays. You think here of Brutus and Mark Antony in //////, of the many ways in which they played with words to convince the audience of the justness of the causes they held dear. But that was literature. In life lived from day to day, through the vagaries of politics, oratory has often been raised to the level of art. In Bangladesh's case, the speeches of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were ammunition, over the years, in the defence of liberty. Gandhi was not a rousing speaker, but the calm religiosity he brought into his words drove the point home. And then there was Syed Badrudduja, whose command of Bengali, Urdu and English was demonstrated to huge effect in his speeches, particularly in pre-partition India.//////To review something is an intellectual pursuit which presupposes the idea that there is a complete work, be it a book, a film, a play, radio, TV or any other programme that is to be viewed again. Thus reviewing something is set in the context of an already expressed opinion or viewpoint of someone who produces the work. This brings the reviewer face to face with the writer. Reviewing definitely is a job that involves a critical process of thinking that need not necessarily be for the purpose of expressing disagreement or disapproval unless and until the book in question entails it. For example, the recently published book, ////// by Sarmila Bose, caused much furore among sensible people both at home and abroad, for obvious reasons.//////
