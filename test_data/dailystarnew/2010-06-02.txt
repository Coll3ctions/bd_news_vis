And it is so because it not only flouts international law but also shows the patent defiance of the Zionist state of the global community where its treatment of Palestinians is concerned. In these past three years, for all the opprobrium it has earned over its actions, Israel has continued its blockade of Gaza and so has made it extremely hard for its residents to lead normal lives. One reason for Israel's aggressive moves has been the predominance of Hamas in the region. The unfortunate reality has been that the Tel Aviv government has successfully been able to ward off all calls for a lifting of the siege. No effort expended toward pushing Israel into a less hardline stance has succeeded. The bigger reality is that Israel's friends in the West have, save some temporary pressure from Washington, not quite been able to push it toward a settlement.//////Brazil still have two weeks left before making its World Cup debut, and players are struggling to find ways to overcome their anxiety.//////Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba plans to live up to his reputation as the man for the big occasion by out-gunning his rivals for the World Cup golden boot.//////Abahani-Mohammedan clashes can never be of academic interest and it is no different today when the cross-town rivals face off at the Bangabandhu National Stadium.//////After a 60-year gap, the World Cup returned to its country of birth.

Or perhaps by the time you read this in print, it might already have been withdrawn. But that is not what exercises our minds at this point. What we are upset about is the brusqueness with which the attack on Facebook was made. Of course, if there is anything obscene that has appeared on it, if the reputations of citizens, powerful or meek, have been ridiculed, all that the authorities needed to do was to go after those who indulged in such nefarious deeds.
