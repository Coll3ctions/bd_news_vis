But a new research has shown that our ancient human ancestors were able to control fire even on continuous basis which many experts believe as one of the most important milestones on the path ofcivilization some 400,000 years ago. This new research by the University of Colorado (UoC) and Leiden University, Netherlands (LUN), the details of which have been published in the March 14 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded this finding after inspecting 141 ancient Neanderthal excavation sites (dating from 1.2 million years to 35,000 years B.C) in Europe. Neanderthals, stockier than contemporary humans who still carry a small amount of Neanderthal DNA, once roamed Europe and Central Asia. And also thought to have evolved in Europe around 400,000 to 500,000 years ago and became extinct about 30,000 years ago.
