In other words, the excesses from both the opposition and the ruling parties are leading to highly explosive and violent consequences. //////We note with dismay that a German citizen, an architect by training, on an official visit to the country was on her way back to the capital city when her car was attacked. The fact that her vehicle was vandalized by the protesters goes to illustrate a departure from the standard practice of keeping foreigners out of harm's way. These people are here as guests and need to be shown the hospitality that is synonymous with Bengali culture.//////The Bangladesh cricket team ended their year with a series against the West Indies that can justifiably be called a fruitful one. Not many gave the Tigers much of a chance against a West Indies side that had recently regained the services of explosive opener Chris Gayle, whitewashed New Zealand in a home Test series and won the ICC World Twenty20. The highlight of Bangladesh's campaign against the men from the Caribbean was their 3-2 ODI series victory, but there were positives to take from the Test series that preceded it and the lone T20I that followed.//////India have big questions to answer in the aftermath of the Kolkata Test and the biggest surrounds the attitude of their near god-like top names.//////There was a time when Shahid Afridi's name would have been the first on Pakistan's one-day international teamsheet, but the all-rounder's future looks uncertain after he was dropped for this month's series against arch-rivals India.//////The Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League resumes today, after a 12-day gap due to the national U-23 team's engagement in the Mahinda Rajapakshe International Football Tournament in Sri Lanka, as Feni Soccer Club host Team BJMC at the Shaheed Salam Stadium in Feni.//////The players' auction for the second edition of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) T20 is all set to take place on December 19.

Nowadays, most middle-class as well as poor people can barely afford the bare necessities and when VAT is added to the food bills, they are forced to cut down further on essential items. Even countries like USA, where there is sales tax on most items, do not charge sales tax on grocery items. At present there is no tax on computer mainly because it's connected with education. I believe if the government exempts food and other essential items from VAT, it would give people some relief.//////The recent tragic fire at Tazreen Fashions Ltd. that killed more than 111 garment workers has raised many questions. This is not the first incident of fire at a garment factory. Very often we hear about fires at garment factories. But still there is no safety measures found in the factories. The result was the deadly fire at Tazreen Fashions on November 24. Most of the entrepreneurs are more keen on making profit rather than improving the working conditions of their factories. In Bangladesh more than 4,000 readymade garment factories of different size are earning more than three-quarters of the country's export revenue. Most of the workers of these factories are women. Over the last two decades, these garment factories contributed to changing the role of poor Bangladeshi women who mostly used to work as housemaids. Although the wages are low, this industry has a positive impact on the families of the poor female workers and it has been playing a vital role in empowering them. The factories which do not have sufficient fire escape must arrangements must be shut. The government should not sit idle. It must take necessary steps for improving the working condition of the factories. Why is the factory a prison? Working in a lockup is not at all acceptable. Moreover, action must be taken against the inspectors who issued licenses to those factories without verifying the fire safety measures. //////Ex-prime minister of Israel Ehud Olmert recently criticized the present government of Israel for planning new settlements in the West Bank. He also said that Israel had no reason to oppose Palestine's UN observer state membership. Rather it will be an historical mistake that will be disastrous to the life, to the people and to the future of the state of Israel.//////Bangladesh Agricultural University is nowadays giving extra pressure of academic work on the students. As a result, students are remaining busy all day with their academic work and not having enough time to take part in any extracurricular activities. Even they hardly get time to skim through the daily newspapers before 5 PM as classes start from 8 AM and ends at 4.30 PM. I think the result of this pressure will not be as good as expected. If this extra pressure is not reduced to a tolerable level, it will destroy the creativity of the students.//////The banking system of Bangladesh needs to be upgraded to the international standard, according to the World Bank. The framework followed for the banks in our country needs to be upgraded. Although there are many private and public banks in the country, most of them lack efficiency and stability. There is lack of active state involvement in the financial sector, which if ensured can help maintain the economic stability of the country, stimulate growth and also create employment opportunities. Moreover, the various services provided by the banks like loan classification, provisioning, rescheduling, etc., need to be strengthened in order to reach the global standard. The role of the state needs to be adjusted from direct intervention to less direct involvement as the crisis subsides.//////I am a mother. I have to take my daughter to and from school at Uttara every day and on our way we have to cross the road underneath the airport road flyover 4 times a day. Every time I cross that road I read doa and sura. I wish I knew more doa. I feel that the poles which are supporting the girder are very weak and any time these may collapse on us. I always ask my driver to drive fast at that part of the road. But it is not always possible due to traffic jam. I am more afraid now after the incident of Chittagong. Is Dhaka's Kuril-Airport flyover safe? We request the government to please inspect the flyover with an expert team to know whether it has been built with good quality materials and by maintaining the construction rules and if thit is safe for people. If not, the government should let us know that too and do the construction again. //////I am writing with reference to the Op-Ed: "Conspiracy theory: Fig leaf of an excuse," by Brig Gen Shahedul Anam Khan (Nov. 29).//////Thank you for the article from the New York Times captioned "Walmart blocked safety push in Bangladesh", reprinted in the Business section of The Daily Star of December 9.

A brightly coloured stage, clownish costumes and painted faces of the performers in both plays aroused questions -- does the troupe give priority to colours?

That statement was significant, not to say intriguing, coming as it did within days of the forty-eighth birthday celebrations of her exiled elder son. A very large number of people in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party went quite overboard in singing paeans to the young man, to a point where a senior figure in the party took it upon himself to inform the nation that the elder child of General Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia was the leader of the sixteen crore people of the country. On what basis he made that revelation remains unclear. //////The Eighte-enth Conference of parties (COP18) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended 24 hours over time on December 8 in Doha, Qatar with the adoption of the "Doha Climate Gateway." Even though the package consisted of decisions which were of very low ambition on several key issues some countries, including Russia and Ukraine, tried to stop their adoption and the Qatari President of the COP had to force it through despite their objections. The compromise package emerged after 36 hours of non-stop negotiations at ministerial level on the three critical issues being discussed in Doha.//////India and China are recognised as two significant powers of the "Asian Century." China is India's largest trade partner, but the trade deficit between the two is highly in favour of China. //////Safe migration of Bangladeshi workers to foreign countries has become synonymous with prosperity of their families and growth of the national economy. In October 2012 alone, for example, remittance from migrants reached $1,453 million. Ironically, however, Bangladeshi migrants' rights continue to be violated. Over the past few years, some have even become victims of trafficking. The phenomenon of migration fraud is so pervasive that hundreds of men and women face serious exploitation overseas and/or return with nothing in their hands but nightmarish experiences. //////We at the BDI, Bangladesh Development Initiative (BDI), express deep sorrow at the tragic loss of lives, and offers sincere condolences to the families of the garment workers who died in the recent accidents involving fires in garment factories. //////First Crusade: Massacre of Ma'arrat al-Numan Crusaders breach the town's walls and massacre about 20,000 inhabitants. //////
