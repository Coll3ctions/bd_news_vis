That, at least, is the impression one has now that a fake drugs factory has been discovered in the capital. What does cause amazement is the fact that the spurious medicine factory was unearthed by the law enforcers only a day after the High Court ordered a testing of all medicine samples at present available in the market. With the discovery of this factory and the nabbing of the individuals behind it, one is impelled into asking how such activities can go on and through individuals who appear to have little or no fear of the repercussions of their actions, not only for themselves but also for those who are the targets of their wrong acts. Now that this so-called factory has been exposed, there is the very legitimate fear among citizens that more such dens may be in operation all across the city and indeed at various spots across the country. Judging by the fact that it is not only the young couple involved in this particular case but also a host of other unscrupulous elements engaged with them in the sordid business, one can safely draw the conclusion that a wider network may be at work here.//////At a pre-examination briefing a few days ago, Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid explained that in earlier times, a small percentage of class VIII students used to sit for scholarship exams.

My battery was moving by road through Bihar, undivided Bengal into Arakan in the then Burma. I was appalled by the starvation I saw. It was pathetic. We tried to help by cutting our soldiers' rations in half and distributing it to the people en route. It was a matter of great anguish to me to see the disappointment in the starving people around our field kitchen outside Dhaka when the food for each man, two chappaties and dal/bhaji, ran out. I decided to get more food to distribute. //////It sears the conscience.

It may not be intelligent, but it is loyal. It might not be able to express complex sentences, but it can communicate a bit by growling, howling, etc. It can be smelly, furry and unsightly, but many people are willing to overlook such shortcomings for an animal, which is simple, faithful and predictable. I overheard my wife telling a friend the other day, "They're no trouble, as long as you remember to feed them from time to time."//////I tried my hand at everything, from mathematics to guarding shoes, from painting to Pitman's shorthand, but nothing quite seemed to be my calling, remarked Sankar, wryly recalling his struggle to success. But at the young age of 21 when he took up his pen to write, words flowed effortlessly and the rest, as they say, is history.//////The cavernous hall at Independent University, Bangladesh at Bashundhara, was packed with an august audience to hear Mani Shankar Mukerjee. The invitation was from the Vice Chancellor, Professor Bazlul M. Chowdhury.//////On October 20, the noted Bengali novelist Mani Sankar Mukherji, better known simply as Sankar, spent the day on the new campus of Independent University, Bangladesh.

In many Universities of western world now terrorism is studied giving equal importance as much as given to the other disasters like earthquake, typhoon, flood, drought etc, but why? Because terrorism successfully emerged as a real catastrophic threat to the progress of human development. Terrorism is a man made disaster. Though ironically it is true that scholars are yet to define terrorism properly but concept like counter-terrorism has already emerged. Counter-terrorism involves those offensive measures taken to prevent, deter and respond to terrorism. Bangladesh also entered into that phase with some limited developments. Thanks go to European Union for their recent initiatives taken to build a regional counter-terrorism centre here in Dhaka. The regional Counter-Terrorism Centre will be set up in with financial and technological assistance from European Union to train people across South Asia to combat terrorism. The international standard centre will start functioning by early next year. Renowned counter-terrorism experts from European countries, United States and Canada will train investigators, police and intelligence agency personnel to fight terrorism. The centre will be the second in its type and the first one was established in Indonesia (National Anti-terrorism Agency (BNPT) way back in August this year. Now let us see the implications of BNPT typed centre in Dhaka in the present context of Bangladesh and why not other countries like India and Pakistan were not chosen as a host country.//////Taipei: Taiwan is developing a potent missile system that can strike airfields and harbours on the mainland, in a bid to nip a Chinese invasion in the bud, local media said Tuesday.//////Seoul: North Korea said Tuesday it was ready to provide torpedo samples to back up its denial of responsibility for the deadly sinking of a South Korean warship.//////In late October ended, seventy years ago, the Battle of Britain. Britain roughed up through a barrage of Nazi assault. I read about it and thought about the glory of Britain at that hour, of Churchill's leadership.I was in awe - shabash Britain. I am sure many people from privileged circles in India at the time were also relieved. Being of the present generation and coming of a middle-class family, I can vaguely trace this strain back in my life and it is interesting to me how that has lived on and how I have changed. //////Anne Sexton (1928-1974) has been a prominent figure in American poetry for the past fifty years. A Pulitzer Prize winner and a Phi Beta Kappa poet at Harvard, she was principal poet in delineating bold issues of menstruation, abortion, masturbation, incest, adultery, drug addiction at a time when other poets did not consider these as poetic materials. This 'bold and the beautiful' poet also dealt with love, alienation, loneliness, madness, death etc which has been one of the main themes of her poetry. It is said that poetry is an expression of one's thought and ideas. This is clearly demonstrated well in the poetry of Anne Sexton. The Complete Poems of Anne Sexton comprises ten volumes of verse and six poems from her last years. All the details of her life have been laid bare in this brilliant piece of work. To read the book is to know her in totality.//////Agoonmukha is a terrible and turbulent river in the South Bengal coastal area. There are other rivers also of the same nature. But Agoonmukha has seen a rise in its intensity by the added flow of six other rivers like the Tentulia, the Lohadia, the Buda Gouranga, the Babnabad, the Darchida and the Degri rivers. Owing to the natural play of loss and gain of the river flows some strips of sandy land were raised out of the bed of the rivers or the sea above the water level where fortune-seekers made their shelter from time to time. In course of time the Burmese and Arakanese came to establish links with Bengalis.//////
