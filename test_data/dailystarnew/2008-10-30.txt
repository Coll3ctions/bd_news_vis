How much and how long the government will capitulate to their undue demands? //////Recently, the demand for banning the Islamic political parties is getting momentum these days, although this demand was in the political arena for a long time. For the last one year or so, the demand for trial of liberation war criminals came to the peak and now it seems to be dying out. These demands are coming from political parties or their supporters and affiliated bodies. Why are we really demanding an end to religion based politics?
