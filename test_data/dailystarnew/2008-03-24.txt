To this effect, we understand, an additional 1,200 to 1,500 tonnes of rice will be supplied every day to the OMS outlets until end of April. But, we feel considerable time has been spent by the authorities in taking the vital decision of making food grains available on a wider scale, especially to the ultra poor. The other decision of extending the OMS programme to the rural areas down to union level is a worthwhile decision, but the union council leaders will have to ensure that the allotted rice will reach the needy in their constituencies. //////THE fact that a large number of private and public vehicles were damaged apart from the fact that the only highway, Dhaka-Aricha, connecting the capital with northwestern and eastern parts of the country was blocked for a greater part of two hours evokes instant condemnation. We must have minimum sense to avert such disruptive activities. //////THE nation has been, with bated breath, awaiting what seems will be the mother of all elections. At least that's the impression we derive from the people concerned with election 2008. The ideas that have been hawked so far in this connection aim not only at ensuring the most credible election of the country but also one that would redefine Bangladesh polity and change its political ethos through a series of electoral reforms. The caretaker government undertook measures that will drive sleazy, corrupt and criminalised politicians out of the arena to allow space for those who have been handicapped by the primacy and influence of black money and muscle power in the electoral process.//////IF Dr Manmohan Singh loses the next general election -- predicted for October by the knowledgeable -- he will know whom to blame: his new best friend George Bush.

Uttara thana, which is located in Sector 4, is causing serious health hazard to everybody, especially to the school children of the area. A number of renowned schools like Scholastica Junior cum Middle Section, Uttara School, RAJUK, Turkish Hope, etc are located near this police station. But it has become almost impossible to walk in front of this police station, as all the drivers, who come early in the morning to pay fines to this station, use the drains as urinals. More than that, you will find all the wrecked vehicles in front of this police station, as if it is a junkyard. And nobody is removing the junks even after several years.//////Bazlur Rahman was an enlightened man of our times. It was enlightenment that he brought into the profession of journalism. But his life came to a sudden, quick end. Throughout his life, Rahman epitomised the sense of aesthetics. If he had not died young, and sixty-seven years is being relatively young when one observes the large canvas on which men like Bazlur Rahman work, he would definitively have further enriched the world of Bangladesh's media. Despite all that, however, in more than six decades that he lived, Rahman surely made a difference.//////The media's reports on the former prime minister's ear problem are very confusing.//////It is interesting that two former presidents have formed a coalition to fight in the next election. In fact, Dr. Choudhury was once very critical about the misdeeds of Ershad as president. Now they are speaking about the national government, which is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution.//////Based on the recent media reports that I have read and seen, I have the following questions:-//////The price hike has ruined the lives of common people. The prices are shooting up every day.

It's was really a praiseworthy & timely effort. But it is sad that when any special day comes then we all become aware regarding that, which is just confined to that day! Afterwards we forget that. Very sad!! To keep our body fit & improve our immunity, we should practice it throughout our lives.//////The BBC Bengali service aired a phone in programme recently. A gentleman from the north has raised a fundamental question about the constitutional mandate of the Election Commission regarding its sphere of responsibility. According to him, the EC has the mandate to conduct the general election and not the local government elections. Violation of this constitutional mandate, according to him, is tantamount to corruption (?). //////Driving as a profession has good prospect for lower middle class and poor people. Qualified and trained drivers can ensure better safety on roads for both people and vehicles. We did not give due importance to these factors in the past. Trained Drivers can go abroad and earn money for themselves and for their families. Their foreign currency remittances can have a positive impact on the existing deficit balance of payment. The Bangladesh government has been spending a huge amount of money for general education, religious education but not much for technical and professional education. A big amount of foreign exchange is earned by expatriate Bangladeshis. Most of the Bangladeshi workers perform manual jobs abroad. //////It is regrettable that the media and all those journalists are asking the government to release Khaleda Zia and Hasina and all other so called politicians. Why can't they tell the nation about everything these two ladies did to the country? Why don't they tell what the two sons of Khaleda Zia did and what inheritance money Zia left for those two? The BNP founder brought the Razakars to power. Why are the journalists so scared to tell the truth? //////I felt privileged to be part of this prestigious ceremony, held at Shaheed Suhrawardy indoor stadium, organised by The Daily Star, as a parent of one of the awardees. I was very glad when my son and the other awardees were listening to your motivating plea for them to be dedicated to the country's development as well as to strive to achieve their personal aims of academic and professional excellence, no matter where in the world they are. //////What are we the general citizens supposed to say or do? This is the sector where thousands of crores was looted by the corrupt officials. It has been proved. We the citizens paid this money by paying more and more for general commodities. This price hike is the result of the money drained out of the economy by the miscreants. Those people are being punished now. Fine. By checking these grafts the economy will flourish and the citizens will get their cut. At this point what is driving you, the advisers, to impose new punishment on us? Or do you think we do not deserve to be served good with the only affordable resource of our own? Have you raised the pay scale to meet our daily transport fares resulting from this price hike? The transport fare is already irrational. When there is a 2% increase in the fuel prices, the transport union goes for a 44% fare increase, irrespective of petrol or gas and you cannot control it. //////Our recent series against South Africa has laid bare the weaknesses of the Tigers like an open book like it had on numerous previous occasions. Are we taking lessons from it?//////Following the deplorable defeats in Test & ODI matches of our cricket team against the South Africans, it was expected that the whimsical selectors would resign, but instead of resigning, they boast of making ODI players play Test cricket in place of genuine Test players having patience, experience, form & fitness. //////Rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a Yemeni-brokered agreement on Sunday to open their first direct talks since the Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip nine months ago.

Political and cultural leaders of the country attended the inaugural programme.//////Prior to the invention of washing machines, Monday was a dreaded day for housewives in the west. Clothes worn throughout the week had to be washed -- a truly tedious chore.
