Tareque and I had been in the US for about one year. We didn't really have any particular plan in mind at the time for staying in the states. Rather, it was a "decompression" of sorts, after a hectic period in Bangladesh and India when we had struggled to complete "The Inner Strength," Tareque's documentary film on the life and art of the painter S.M.

The report published in the national dailies on January 19 indicates that religious militants are organizing again in Patuakhali and greater Barisal district under the banner of Hizbut Tauhid. It is an Islamist organization not yet banned but propagating jihad through distributing books and leaflets among villagers and school children, reportedly with the verbal permission of certain government high ups of the locality.

Some are transformational, like Ukraine's Orange Revolution and as the 2008 US presidential elections could be. Others have revolutionary impact: the 1970 elections in undivided Pakistan divided it, materially changing South Asian geopolitics.//////Bangladesh's history in its first decade of freedom was fundamentally a story of bloodletting. You do not have to go into research to arrive at such a morbid conclusion. But you cannot escape feeling a certain sense of irony as you recapitulate the whole episode of the country's actually claiming, and taking, its place in the global community. If the war of liberation in 1971 saw three million Bengalis dying at the hands of the Pakistan armed forces, the post-liberation era turned into a long tale of blood and gore as most of the new nation's founding fathers and war heroes bit the dust through bloody coups d'etat and internecine armed conflict. The series of tragic happenings that engulfed Bangladesh between August and November 1975, followed by the execution of Abu Tahir, a soldier for freedom, in July 1976, will remain a blot on the conscience of a nation which yet struggles to find a way out of the woods for itself.//////Human beings are seekers of truth. ////// is a poignant saga of one man's search for love and his struggles to find the meaning of life.

Other characters and plots, vibrant and richly imagined, enter the story line in the third person. //////Anisur Rahman, a passionate fervent poet, is basically more a poet than an essayist in his//////The publication of ////// by the University Press Limited on 21 January 2008 on the occasion of the 76th birth anniversary of Barrister Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed is surely a commendable move. //////Books about lost love and sacrifice are always available to readers. There are also books about one generation passing on its secrets and lessons to another. There are books about making decisions that can change the track of one's entire life. Marisol's The Lady, The Chef And The Courtesan mirrors all these topics, but does so with such warmth and lan that a reader forgives its familiarity and just loses himself in the book.//////A tale of the dreams that worked in Nigeria in the early years of freedom, this work is perhaps one of the best to have come from a writer with roots in Africa. Adichie writes in a style that brings together local heritage and cosmopolitan behaviour and weaves it all into a pattern that leaves the reader terribly impressed.//////
