One wonders what prompted her to say that it was an isolated incident and suggest that such things could happen anytime? Her remarks may have been construed to make light of a tragedy in which a whole family is reeling and the nation left shocked. This is completely out of sync with her position as the home minister. //////DEATHS due to road mishaps are on the rise. Reports on such fatal mishaps, taking a human toll, appear routinely in print and electronic media. Each death is a tragedy and, if given a closer and deeper look, has a moving human side to it.

Only a few of these sad incidents, that get extensive public attention thanks to the media, make the public aware and the authorities concerned to a new level. //////BRITAIN, Afghanistan and the United Nations co-hosted the 70-nation International Conference on Afghanistan in London on January 28.

News from the euro region however increased worries that the fiscal health in the euro zone was a cause for concern. The euro hit a seven-month low against the dollar, knocked by concerns over the fiscal health of peripheral euro zone countries ahead of a European Central Bank policy decision later on Thursday. Worries over Spain and Portugal have increased as investors speculate the two countries may face similar debt problems to Greece. Such concerns pushed the safe-haven dollar to a six-month high versus a currency basket. Traders said moves in the euro could become volatile should ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet make any strong reference to fiscal problems in the euro zone. He will speak after a policy meeting at which the ECB is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold. Traders sold the single European currency on the view that dismal finances in euro zone countries may hinder any economic improvements in the region, increasing the probability that the US economy may recover faster. Strong US data this week supported this view ahead of non-farm payrolls numbers due on Friday.

Though born into a rich family, he suffered a lot throughout his whole life because of his indomitable will to lead a free life. //////Bishwa Ijtema is undoubtedly one of the most significant religious congregations of Muslims and has become a global event. It is not sure when the first Bishwa Ijtema was held. Some believe that this event started back in 1946. One facet of this religious congregation that has remained alike over time is that the Tabligh Jamaat of Bangladesh organises it every year. Starting out as a tiny event that was attended by a few devotees, it has grown into a massive congregation that is attended by millions from all over the world.//////I was reading A.L. Khatib's narration of the sinister night of August 14, 1975 in Dhaka in The Daily Star. The vivid details of the gruesome murders are once again imprinted on my mind. I am so pleased to know that the senseless massacre of Bangabandhu's family is finally avenged through the legal institutions of our democratic nation. This is a day for Bangladeshis to be proud as a nation. //////Just over a year after taking oath to serve the people of Bangladesh, the Fat Cats have duly emerged from Kahn's White Elephant Stables (KWES). There will now be the descent of Manna from Heaven for the lucky 345 denizens of KWES in the shape of duty-free Gas Guzzling Monstrosities (GGMs).//////Sohel Taj resigned and left the country for months. A new state-minister was appointed to take over his job. And still the government does not know the exact status of Sohel Taj. On his arrival back to Bangladesh, if the news reports were correct, he was accorded the protocol befitting a state minister. It is heartening that Sohel Taj refused the protocol and took a private transport to his home.//////Of late, mobile telephone companies are taking advantage of their knowledge (of our cell numbers) and taking this 'keep connected' mission beyond civic sense even by jungle standards. Mobile telephone companies are rather inquisitive and personal. It is possible that at 2:00am in the morning your sms alert will sound, you would obviously want to know what it is that is so urgent, and the words at the push of your 'read now' button would unveil the company's profoundest desire to learn whether you would like to get the latest ring tone from some Indian movie of a foreign language. And this is a Bangladeshi operator, licensed to operate in Bangladesh in taka and not rupee.//////It is surprising that there is no official reaction to what has happened at the Imperial Hotel, I am not sure whether the PM had been informed of the incident. If she has been, we expect her to visit the wounded players and asked for explanation from the concerned in-charge of the SAF Games and the person in charge of accommodation and safety. Apparently, the hotel management failed to prevent over loading in the lift. This is pure negligence of duty by the hotel management, and do not blame the poor liftman alone.//////My attention has been drawn to the advertisement published in your daily on January 23 last Inviting applications for 2010 higher studies scholarship. This is undoubtedly a good gesture on the part of a bank of ours when, as far as my knowledge is concerned, I have not seen any such endeavour shown by any other institution or agency as yet. This is a praiseworthy step taken by one of our banks for helping and encouraging higher studies by the meritorious students. //////We have become very upset by the activities of cadres of Bangladesh Chhatra League. //////The Ministry of Science and Technology is an applied ministry which deals with so many applied subjects like biotechnology, R and D research project, fellowship and funding to the researchers who are engaged in short and long term research, fellowship to the masters and doctoral students, especially with science background in different universities, different type of prestigious scholarship offered by different countries etc. Two national institutes like Bangabandhu Novo theatre, National Institute of Biotechnology are under this ministry. //////Zia International Airport is one of the important international airports in our region. However, it is a matter of regret that there is no official website of the airport. Many countries in Asia have already launched official websites for their international airports. An airport website helps to promote the airport, its services, and makes it easy for the users to navigate through the airport. Moreover, a website of an airport can help the passengers in many ways. Domestic and international passengers can easily receive relevant information from the website about their travel. //////Even in the USA, when police fail to net some most wanted criminals like serial killers they declare 'price on heads' for bounty hunters. The bounty hunters in the USA is a group manned by ex-police and military personnel who are well equipped with past experience and hunting for money is their business. Their network is so wide that they can penetrate anywhere in the world and catch the absconding criminals in exchange of declared money.//////After an impressive build-up to the Under-19 World Cup Cricket Championship, Bangladesh again comes away with a plate. To me, this is like being the best of the worst. Being the worst of the best at least, would have been a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, we are not good enough for even that. From dreaming to be in the last four we slipped to 9th. We do not seem to be able to do the right thing when it matters most, as we witnessed in this tournament. The score in the last match with Ireland is proof of the fact that the boys from Bangladesh actually belonged in the big league. This is cricket Maybe. You can have good days and bad days Sure. But when you have one bad day after another, this is NOT cricket. This is wandering about in the wilderness. I don't claim to know the answer to this impasse. I know only that there is no quick-fix solution to this problem. But fixed it can be by those who walk the halls of status and prestige of the world of Bangladesh cricket.//////Our leader of the opposition Madam Khaleda Zia refrained from making any comments and also instructed her party men to do the same after the execution of five killers of Bangabandhu and his family. By the way, what is so surprising about that? This attitude, this exercise of caution, certainly reflects her personal feelings towards the whole matter. //////Most people are talking about U.S. President Barack Obama's losing the Senate seat vacated by the demise of Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy without ever mentioning that former President Bill Clinton also lost Congress in 1994 and yet he was re-elected in 1996 with a wider margin. //////The substantive thing that I agree with Mr. Kokoskl's letter of January 31st is that Nazi Germany was a complex period of history. During that period the role of the German Catholic Church in particular and the Vatican in general is at best murky and perplexing. Before the Roman Catholic Church can justify Pope Pius XII's elevation to sainthood there should be responses to numerous answered questions. To begin with, Firstly, why the Vatican was one of the very first independent political entities to recognize Hitler's government, and why it was in such a rush to make its unwise "Reich Concordat" with Hitler, six months after he was in office, thereby giving it unwarranted moral legitimacy in the eyes of the rest of the world?//////India and Pakistan Friday discussed the dates for talks between their foreign secretaries and the scope of their dialogue that could include other issues besides terrorism.//////An "extremely dangerous" blizzard expected to dump record amounts of snow pounded the eastern United States Saturday, closing down the US capital and threatening to trap millions indoors for days.//////Sri Lanka faced criticism yesterday for extending a state of emergency giving sweeping powers to security forces to detain suspects ahead of parliamentary elections due by April.//////Any peace negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan must involve women, a United Nations committee on women's rights warned on Friday following talks in Geneva.//////While the ground-breaking meeting of the home ministers of Saarc to be held in Pakistan has been postponed at Nepal's request, the Himalayan republic has, however, sent its home minister to China as per schedule.//////Former US president Bill Clinton pledged Friday to try to get aid flowing here as he was met by angry Haitians protesting the slow arrival of help since last month's quake.//////Beating their chests with hands, thousands of minority Shia Muslims attended a mass funeral Saturday for those killed in a pair of bombings in Pakistan's largest city.//////The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Friday discussed the spiralling price rise at a meeting, after the Congress President Sonia Gandhi declared it a matter of 'high concern'.//////Even as the US and Pakistani governments are uncertain over death of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Hakeemullah Mehsud, reports indicate that the banned extremist organisation has appointed its new commander.//////Iran's claims to be close to an agreement on its nuclear programme have yet to be backed up by any concrete actions, Western officials said yesterday at a gathering of the world's top defence officials.//////Shia rebels killed 23 Yemeni soldiers in twin attacks in the northern mountains, tribal and rebel sources said on Saturday, as tentative feelers to end their six-year revolt faltered.//////UN chief Ban Ki-moon yesterday told an international security conference in Germany that poverty, hunger and climate change posed a major threat to humanity in the 21st century.//////Google Earth mapping service is letting people use the Internet to dive into the world's oceans or see the ruin that World War II bombings rained on European cities.//////Taliban militants blew up a girls' school yesterday in northwest Pakistan, the latest in a wave of attacks by Islamist extremists targeting educational institutions, a minister said.//////The judges of the Delhi High Court have invested more in their wives' names, thus making their spouses richer.//////President Barack Obama on Friday paid tribute to seven CIA officers killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan, hailing them as "patriots" at a rare memorial service at the spy agency's headquarters.//////Michael Jackson's doctor will be charged in connection with the pop star's death next week, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office confirmed Friday.//////Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray called Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan 'a traitor', but said Sena will not stall his latest film 'My Name Is Khan'.//////Nasa is inviting the public to send questions for the astronauts' abroad space shuttle Endeavour via Twitter and have them answered live from space.//////Apprehensive under the glare of the spotlight, she took a deep breath to ease the tension and anxiety that had taken hold of her.

It would, however, be unreasonable to assume that in such a visit outstanding problems, left festering due to the neglect of previous regimes, would be subject to instantaneous resolution. Nor may we expect that anything would happen to warrant the leader of the opposition laying out a carpet of thorns for the returning delegation or indeed to now launch a political movement to protect our national sovereignty. //////DESPITE solid development performance since independence, at around $600 Bangladesh's per capita income remains very low. Poverty has come down from over 70 percent in the early 1970s to around 40 percent in 2005. Yet this level is very high and rural poverty is even higher at 44 percent. //////IT is a welcome development that the relationship between Bangladesh and India is expected to have turned for the better following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent India visit. It has been reported that trust has been re-established as a result of the goodwill measures taken by Bangladesh in response to India's security and economic needs pertaining to her North-Eastern states. //////NO one expected that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's state visit to India would resolve all outstanding issues. It was a goodwill visit. It was to set the climate for negotiations and lay down a base for communications. //////
