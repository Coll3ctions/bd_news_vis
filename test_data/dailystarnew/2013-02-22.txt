The total loan worth $792.82 million from Japan is for four major projects, of which metro rail is one. The most significant element of this deal is the fact that it is a soft loan that is payable over a 40-year term with a 10-year grace period before the first payment is due.//////Dhaka plays host to a two-day conference on February 23-24 that brings together some fifty analysts from Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar (BCIM) focusing primarily on trade, investment and finance, multimodal connectivity, energy and institutional arrangements.

India captain MS Dhoni hasn't spoken to the press even once before the series, there have been no major controversies in the warm-up matches, there hasn't been too much of the pre-series mind games, and even the broadcasters' TV campaign has changed from the taunting tone it had before the England series to a more sober, cricket-centric one.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president

In 1952 some of our heroic people sacrificed their lives for upholding Bangla as the state language. According to article 3 of our constitution, the state language of the Republic is Bangla. But almost in all government and non-government offices English prevails over Bangla! All the documents there are written in English. Sometimes people who do not know English can't figure out what those documents are about.//////It is time we stood against the rapists and eve-teasers. //////Going for a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) and that too from Russia, having the world's worst safety record of nuclear accidents including the Chernobyl disaster is really a foolhardy decision. Chaudhury's write-up titled "Pros and cons of nuclear power plant", published in DS on 12th February, clearly states that since 2011, new NPPs are not being installed anywhere in the world, except for one in USA which already has 104 NPPs! No plants are coming up in Germany, Japan and Canada, among other developed countries. The current trend of investment in power sector is for gas, oil and clean coal fired power plants.//////Now the retirement age of the public university teachers has been raised from 60 to 65 years. I think the entry age should also be raised from 30 years to 35 years. It may be mentioned here that due to a number of reasons, students fail to complete their courses in due time. Moreover, after graduation from the university, a graduate, in most cases, needs some years to find a suitable job. The PSC also takes quite some time to complete the BCS examinations and recruitment process. The medical and engineering students need more time to complete their respective courses. Under these circumstances, increasing the entry age for becoming university teachers is essential.//////Kamal Gaballa's article about Egypt told of an 'Arab spring' that began with such high hopes, but ended with a collapse of restraint and the rise of violence that Mubarrak threatened would come if the Islamists had their way. (It is always embarrassing when a dictator is proved right....) Now, despite promises by the new president, an Islamist-backed constitution threatens the rights of minorities and a Christian woman appointed to the Upper House, has resigned on those grounds. //////Ambassador Mahmud Hassan's article (DS Feb 19) on the 12th OIC summit points out well the old adage that 'talk is cheap'. Never mind weightier international issues like the Middle East conflict and Syrian uprising, even much closer to home most OIC members act in a manner that is deplorable. Nowhere in the world are Muslims treated with more legalized prejudice than in oil rich countries surrounding the Gulf, as any Bangladeshi, Pakistani, or Indian Muslim worker on those shores well knows. While the OIC raises a ruckus about supposed apartheid in Israel, the fact remains that in Dubai entire residential neighbourhoods are officially off limits to dark skinned Muslims, while Saudi Arabia officially pays white expatriates more than non-white Muslim ones for the same job with the same qualifications. Lectures about the unity of the Ummah would be funny coming from the OIC except that officially sanctioned discrimination is not a matter of joke. I am sick and tired of oil rich bigots lecturing to anyone about brotherhood and apartheid.//////Lately, there have been a lot of concerns regarding the huge arms purchase of our present government from Russia. Many think it was not necessary as we are not at war with any nation. I personally feel that creating a powerful army is primarily concerned with the balance of power with neighbouring countries. It also contributes to the preservation of peace and stability in a region. If our nation would not have a powerful military force, I believe the killings at our border would be 10 times more and it would encourage the neighbouring countries to invade and occupy our land. Besides, I would also like to suggest our government that before purchasing anything they should conduct a feasibility study about the requirement of such multi-million dollar equipment. They should also study how much it's going to cost to maintain such equipment over the years.//////In a democracy, the government will be 'of the people, by the people and for the people'. In a democratic country, both the ruling and opposition parties should work together to increase the per capita income of the country. But unfortunately, our political leaders have forgotten the definition of democracy. Now both the ruling and opposition parties are involved in destructive politics. They are not concerned about common people's well-being. We hope both government and opposition will come forward to solve the problems the country is facing at this time. //////British Prime Minister David Cameron says a giant diamond his country forced India to hand over in the colonial era that was set in a royal crown will not be returned.//////The Taliban vowed yesterday to target government employees and other Afghan civilians they consider linked to the US-led coalition despite a warning from the United Nations that such killings may violate international law.//////The head of the Nato military alliance is urging member countries to stop cutting their defense budgets in response to tough economic times, saying continued reductions will compromise safety.//////A Kenyan official says gunmen have opened fire at a mosque in Kenya's east, killing seven people.//////Venezuela complained Wednesday that the United States meddled when it noted a new election must be called in that country if cancer-stricken President Hugo Chavez is deemed too sick to do his job.//////Saudi Arabia on Wednesday beheaded by the sword a Pakistani man convicted of drug trafficking, the interior ministry said.//////A powerful car bomb exploded yesterday close to ruling party offices in Damascus, killing over 50 people and causing widespread destruction in the Syrian capital's deadliest attack for more than nine months.//////A top Iranian envoy said Wednesday that increased Western pressure over his country's nuclear program could end hopes for a negotiated settlement.//////A US senator has said an estimated 4,700 people, including some civilians, have been killed in the contentious bombing raids of America's secretive drone war, local media reported Wednesday.//////The trial in China of an elderly man accused of murder during the Cultural Revolution has sparked online debate.//////Pakistani police registered an accusation from a businessman yesterday that the country's ambassador to the United States had committed blasphemy, a crime that carries the death penalty, in connection with a 2010 TV talk show.//////Secretary of State John Kerry warned Wednesday against "senseless" spending cuts to diplomacy, saying the United States needed robust engagement to remain an "exceptional" nation.//////US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta will get a fond farewell from his Nato colleagues at a two-day meeting beginning Thursday, as the alliance faces a difficult withdrawal from Afghanistan and looks for a new supreme military commander.//////India said yesterday it will send a $70 million space mission to Mars this year to study the red planet's atmosphere.//////The White House has vowed to fight foreign theft of US trade secrets, a day after a report linked China's military to prolific cyber-theft.//////Disgraced former senior Chinese leader Bo Xilai is refusing to cooperate with a government investigation into him and has staged hunger strikes in protest and at one point was treated in hospital, sources with knowledge of the matter said.//////Seven French hostages kidnapped in Cameroon have been found alive in a house in northern Nigeria and are safe with Nigerian authorities, French television reported on Thursday.//////Egypt's Shura Council, the upper house of parliament, adopted yesterday an electoral law as amended by the Constitutional Court, clearing the way for President Mohamed Mursi to set a date for lower house elections.//////India's public-sector banks and many government offices were shut Thursday on the second day of a general strike called to protest against the government's planned pro-market reforms.//////Myanmar's reformist government on Wednesday held peace talks with a federation of ethnic groups to try to resolve issues including the conflict in the northern state of Kachin.//////Theatre group Padatik Natya Sangsad held a daylong cultural programme yesterday at the Ramna Botomul to mark the Language Martyrs' Day and International Mother Language Day.

Black widow spiders have their females who eat male partners after mating. The wolf spider species have been observed to cannibalise on older females, while preferring mating with virgins. Then there is this European species whose offsprings eat their mothers. Rape commited by men would have been a similar freak of nature if the rapists, for the life of me, could explain how they can respect their own mothers, wives, sisters and daughters after they violate those of others. //////Since February 5, thousands of people have gathered in Shahbagh protesting Jamaat leader Abdul Quader Mollah's life sentence handed down by the International War Crimes Tribunal, and calling for the death sentence for him and all the other 1971 war criminals on trial.
