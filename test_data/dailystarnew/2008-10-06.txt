Manmohan Singh said, on his return from France, that the incidents in Orissa had shamed India before the world. That is important, but far less important than the fact that the violence in Orissa has shamed Indians in India. I measure what Indians do, not by the standards of France but by the values of modern India, which strengthened the spirit of our freedom movement against western colonialism and were enshrined in that noble document called the Constitution of India. The Bajrang Dal has shamed India before Indians.//////AMERICA'S financial crisis has allowed all sorts of people -- from British trade unionists to Asian central bankers to France's mercurial president -- to declare that we're seeing the end of laissez-faire capitalism and free markets. We're not. Let's step back, take a deep breath, and put this in historical context. What is happening now is a deep, wrenching financial crisis unlike any we've seen since the 1930s. It's contributing to a broad slowdown of the American economy. The pain is spreading across the world. It's ugly. But it's not unprecedented. The history of capitalism is filled with credit crises, panics, financial meltdowns, and recessions. It doesn't mean the end of capitalism. But it might well mean the end of a certain kind of global dominance for the United States.//////The national selectors announced a 12-member BCB XI side for tomorrow's limited-over practice match

Moreover, the use of chemical fertilizers costs a lot & due to non-availability of chemical fertilizers farmers have to suffer a lot.

Various types of biofertilizers are now used universally in place of chemical fertilizers without harming the natural ecological balance. It costs less compared to chemical fertilizers. //////The death of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Mahmoud Darwish will be remembered all around the world for years to come because their works always remind us of the pains and sufferings the people have been through.

But at that time it was a decision that had to be taken. After all, you may not get a man like Dalmiya from Kolkata as ICC chief in the next 50 years. Another good thing happened in the period 2002-2005. Call him anything you like, but give the devil its due. Arafat Rahman Koko, the former PM's son, became the chairman of Development Committee of Cricket. He pumped in corporate funds to develop an under-19 squad that included Mohammed Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Shahriyar Nafees, Mashrafe Mortaza, Shakib Al Hasan, Shahdat Hossain Rajib, Syed Rasel and Mehrab Hossain jr. Now they are all in the national side, aren't they? The guys who took the pains in creating all these greenhorns into internationals was an Aussie coach, Richard McInnes.
