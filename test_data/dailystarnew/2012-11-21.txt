These huge billboards not only destroy the beauty of a city but also divert the attention of the vehicle drivers resulting in serious accidents. The advertising companies who build the billboards in collusion with the city corporation have been creating this nuisance since last two decades.//////One day I bought some shingaras and noodles from an eatery, which smelled odd. I will not buy anything from there again as I happened to see the unhygienic environment of the kitchen. People eat tehari as lunch in this eatery but they do not know what is behind the scene. If you take a close look, you will see that most of the eateries have the same unhygienic kitchen. The outlets look okay. The shingaras and puris look mouth-watering. But just behind the doors, foods are cooked in unhygienic environment. The water that is used for cooking curries, rice and tehari is full of deadly germs. Moreover, the same old oil is used over and over again. A piece of shingara goes well with a cup of tea at your office or while sitting in your balcony and enjoying the evening. But the way those snacks are cooked is dangerous for health. After seeing this, I would not buy anything from those places again. Would you?//////The Chinese interest shown on this matter was reported in the pages of an English daily on 12th. November. It was an interesting and attractive proposition. The matter when presented to the authorities should be seriously looked into, and if otherwise financially sound, taken up on an urgent basis. Apart from anything else, it will reduce our need for imported liquid fuel, equipment, spares and manpower needed for operating ferries across many of our rivers. Once work on the Karnaphuli tunnel is taken up, we may consider this option wherever possible. //////From the way Tamim batted on the second day of the Bangladesh-West Indies Test, it has become very much clear that he lacks the temperament to play the longer version of cricket. No doubt, he is good for one-day cricket as well as for T-20 cricket, but not for the Test cricket. He has already played quite a good number of Test crickets 24 in number but yet could not learn the essence of it. It seems he will never learn it. So next time when the Bangladesh cricket bosses will select a Test cricket team, they must think twice before choosing Tamim. If playing only flamboyant shots is his style, then well and good. But he must not play Test cricket. We may not win, but we may at least draw a Test. After twelve years of achieving Test status, if we still say we are learning, that is not acceptable any more. //////US election was successfully ended following a month-long media storm across the world. Re-elected president Barack Obama said in his victory speech that he would talk to Mr. Romney about how they can work together to move US forward. On the other hand, Mr. Romney was quick to congratulate Obama and wish him success as US president.//////Congratulations to Barack Obama for getting re-elected as the president of the US for another four-year term. Like many other developing countries of the world, we too have expectations from the president. We expect to see something new this time from Obama. This time we want to see some upfront measures taken by him that would stop children from crying for their missing parents in the battlefields, would bring smile to the frightened people of the war-torn countries. Any problem can be solved peacefully, if there is honest will. So, we are waiting to see some very positive gestures from the Nobel laureate president while dealing with foreign issues. Hope he will not let us down.//////Bangladesh seems to have become a hotbed of unprincipled politics. The ethical standards of the politicians, irrespective of the party to which they belong, have reached a nadir. The people of Bangladesh have been witnessing mud-slinging matches between the ruling and opposition parties far too long. They have never come together to share power. If numbers alone matter, there is no future for moral standards in politics. Now, in our parliament, political differences have turned into personal animosities. Moreover, it appears that the opposition lawmakers have forgotten their duties as responsible parliamentarians. The passing of many bills are getting expedited without any debate because of their boycott. It is time they called off the boycott. //////Hillary Clinton is en route to the Middle East to join efforts to broker a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas, in a move that suggests a breakthrough is close, reports the Guardian.//////Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said yesterday that Nato member Ankara would formally ask the alliance for Patriot missiles to protect its border with conflict-wracked Syria.//////US President Barack Obama was yesterday set to defy Beijing's protests and use a summit to raise concerns over South China Sea rows that have sent diplomatic and trade shockwaves across the region.//////British prosecutors yesterday said they will charge ex-News International chief Rebekah Brooks and the prime minister's former spokesman Andy Coulson with making illegal payments to public officials.//////A Pakistan court yesterday threw out all charges against a Christian girl accused of blasphemy in a case that drew international condemnation, lawyers said. //////French troops yesterday ended their last combat mission in Afghanistan by withdrawing from Kapisa province as part of an accelerated departure from the war-torn country. //////Amidst talk of a no-confidence motion or a vote on FDI issue, the government yesterday said that it was not afraid of facing any challenge in parliament.//////Nepal's Maoist-led government yesterday called polls to elect a new parliament in April or May, offering hope for an end to the political deadlock that has crippled the deeply-divided nation.//////Sri Lanka's top judge was on Monday asked by parliament to appear before it for an impeachment hearing on Friday after rejecting her appeal for more time to prepare for her case.//////Gunmen yesterday killed the driver of a Nato supply truck in northwest Pakistan on the Afghan border, officials said.//////A man stabbed a security guard at the US embassy in Tel Aviv yesterday and was apprehended, a police spokesman said, and Israel Radio reported the assailant was an Israeli with a criminal background.//////Dozens of people have been killed in clashes between Islamic radicals and secular Tuareg fighters in northern Mali since Friday, witnesses and officials said.//////Federal authorities say four California men have been charged with plotting to kill Americans overseas and in the United States by joining al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. //////The campaign for the resignation of beleagured BJP President Nitin Gadkari yesterday got fresh ammo within the party with its senior leader Yashwant Sinha demanding that he step down immediately.//////India yesterday launched an inquiry into a stampede, which killed 18 women and children when a makeshift bridge collapsed at a Hindu festival, as devotees returned to pray at the scene of the tragedy.//////As part of its yearlong celebration marking its 15th anniversary, one of the leading Bangladeshi theatre troupes, Prachyanat, arranged a three-day street theatre festival at the amphitheatre inside Suhrawardi Udyan in Dhaka.

A dialogue is certainly a healthy thing, considering the proliferation of ideas it generally throws up. Besides, politics is all about dialogue, about an exchange of ideas. But in this particular instance, when activists of the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Chhatra Shibir have been doing all they can to disrupt normal life through pouncing on policemen, the idea that the ruling Awami League should engage the opposition in discussions with it sounds rather queer. The US ambassador could have done something better than suggest a dialogue. On behalf of his government, he could simply have condemned the violence that the Jamaat and its adherents have been resorting to over these past few weeks before throwing in the idea of political engagement between the government and the opposition.//////Unlike the cliffhanger US elections on November 6, the leadership change in China this week was hardly an exercise in suspense -- or democracy.//////On November13, Myanmar opposition leader and Member of Parliament Aung San Suu Kyi paid her first visit to India after almost 40 years. //////As we celebrate the 42nd Armed Forces Day, it is time for the nation to look back and assess the contribution of the Armed Forces to the country. Not many like our country can take pride that their Armed Forces came into being through a war of liberation. The Liberation War had brought more challenges than opportunities for the country and the Armed Forces had endured difficult times during the nation's initial years of freedom and thereafter. However, it has matured over the past four decades and made us proud both within and outside the country. Our Armed Forces have always supported the country in safeguarding its national interests and enhancing national security and development. It fought a long counterinsurgency battle in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) and finally created conditions for a Peace Agreement in December 1997. //////Most parents want their children to grow up to be brain surgeons or lawyers or billionaires.
