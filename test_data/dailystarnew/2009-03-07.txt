On this day in 1971, as the Bengali nation was being made acutely aware of the sinister attempts to deprive it of the mammoth victory it had collectively achieved through the general elections of December 1970, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman prepared to show us a path out of the woods. And that came through the sheer eloquence of the speech he delivered before a million-strong crowd at the Race Course (today's Suhrawardy Udyan). What has come to be known as the March 7 address remains critically important for us because it was a protest against the reluctance of the Pakistan military junta to honour the results of the elections through letting a democratic government take over.

He stood far taller than ever before and with him we too stood taller. He was always known for being a powerful speaker. But that day, 26 years ago, he outperformed himself a thousand times over, and a thousand times more empowered we felt that day. During that crucial March afternoon, and especially through the electrifying moments of the speech he stood towering above the nation, singly shouldering the burden of leading an unprepared people towards sell assertion.//////As Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman rose to speak before the million people gathered at the Race Course in Dhaka, indeed before the seventy five million people of Bangladesh, on March 7, 1971, the moment turned electric with excitement.

The dignity of reason is, more often than not, present through its absence.//////The gruesome killings of defence service officials at Pilkhana on February 25th are deliberate acts of murder by conspiratorial persons gone berserk. While the motive behind the mayhem may take some time to be unearthed, the inability to forestall such a tragedy needs to be looked into. //////The brutal killing of unarmed senior level army officers at BDR headquarters in Pilkhana on February 25 by disgruntled jawans of BDR in collusion with some intruders masquerading as BDR jawans, as reported by some officers escaping quite miraculously from the tragic scene on the following day, was an act of such horror, such barbarism that there is almost no Bangladeshi who does not feel personally ashamed. //////Conservation is the optimum rational use of natural resources and the environment, having regard to the various demands made upon them and the need to safeguard and maintain them for the future.

This year we had the added attraction of the general election, one of the most iconic events in the history of the country. Amidst this entire hullabaloo the nature lovers were on their tracks chasing their wild dreams in the forests and coastal areas of Bangladesh.//////One day when my communist friend and I were walking towards Coffee House, the little boy approached us and held out his hand. He clutched the copper coin I gave him in his twisted hand and put out the other to my friend. Get away, my friend said, walking on. The boy kept pace with us with his outstretched palm, staring silently at him Come on, get away, he shouted again, full of anger and disgust, or I'll call the police. The boy persisted. I put my hand inside my pocket and was about to take out another coin when the boy said, No, him. My friend grimaced, oozing venom from his face, when the boy's eyes lit up with scorn. What's the matter? You have no money? My friend turned away, ran up the steps of Coffee House and took the chair at his usual table. They are a terrible nuisance, you know, he said to me, as I joined him. You shouldn't encourage them. After a pause, he added, This is what gives the country a bad name. Americans with bulging cameras go goggle-eyed over them. It's good for the tourist trade, so they saybut in a socialist state there would be no beggars.//////Reading through the introduction to Penguin India's the triple-decker volumes of ////// (New Delhi: 2007) - one is plunged headlong into the facts behind India's supreme publishing powerhouse: that it began operating at a time when trade publishing in English was virtually unknown in the country (which might be a slight exaggeration since small publication houses were always operating in that country), and that Penguin's operational beginnings were becomingly modest - the company launched its local programme in 1987 with seven titles: two novels in English and one in translation from Bengali, two biographies, a travelogue and a book of poems.//////A butterfly's wings may create changes in the atmosphere that may ultimately alter the path of a tornado //////Not in a hurry to get anywhere//////Nobody's waiting for me either--//////On the bed the scolding sunlight//////Silences the door and window curtains.//////Childlessness may be a tragedy for the married couple and a of marital upset, personal unhappiness and ill health. Infertility often plays a major role in breaking the marital bridge and important cause of separation between partners.//////One of the vital factors for preventing against HIV/AIDS is to spread proper message to large number of population. It is estimated that about 56 million illiterate people of the country are at great risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. Educating them to fight against HIV/AIDS is very challenging.

When a hostile intelligence service succeeds in conducting a well-timed tragic action like the BDR rebellion, it is usually not the end of their wicked design. Successful destruction of Twin Tower, Moscow bombing, Bali (night club) bombing, Islamabad/Mumbai hotel bombing and shooting spree are few recent examples. HIS utilized them only as a catalyst or as initiation of a well devised and elaborate objective. //////Tragedy has again struck Bangladesh at Pilkhana BDR Headquarters. The nation lost more than sixty brave sons. The people join in anger but with solemnity with the armed forces and the soldiers without uniform to pay homage to the departed souls and pray that the families have the strength to bear the irreparable loss. They died young and premature, leaving their families and relatives in utter pain. They were always ready to die for the nation but why at the BDR HQ? Who killed them and why? At this hour of grief, we can only ask questions. The answers must come from the inquiries. The nation wants everything on the table and exemplary punishment for the murderers. //////The tragedy of February 25, 2009 left the government in complete disarray. A crisis of great magnitude was left to be handled by political soldiers. Crises management norms were shunned and a true live show of brinkmanship was put on live display for all to see. Governance was put to test in and around the Headquarters of BDR.//////Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, in a moment of pique, had once famously declared, in reference to Bangladesh, that we can choose our friends, but we cannot choose our neighbours. How true! Bangladesh can, of course, turn the lament around, and that will quite faithfully reflect the roller coaster ride that the state of bilateral relations between Dhaka and New Delhi has undergone since the substantially smaller neighbour emerged as a sovereign independent country. Hemayetuddin, a retired foreign secretary of Bangladesh, and currently working as a director general at OIC, did two tours of duty on his country's behalf to its very large neighbour, first as a junior diplomat, and then as High Commissioner. ////// is Hemayetuddin's account of his, as much as the Bangladesh government's, diplomatic engagement with India, a country that obviously fascinates him. There is a liberal dose of personal anecdotes with diverse personalities, but there is also a good deal of bilateral foreign policy issues that serve to highlight the seesaw nature of relations between Dhaka and New Delhi.//////In an alcoholic tale (literally, because the entire gamut of characters of the novel turn to liquor), Aravind Adiga chooses to expose the evils of Indian society stretching from Laxmangarh to Bangalore via the Indian capital New Delhi. Adiga's journalistic reportage in ////// magazine (he had been a New Delhi correspondent of ////// for quite a few years) definitely makes its mark in his Booker winning debut novel //////. It chronicles the India of the 21st century from the perspective of a lower caste Indian, if not from Adiga himself. The witty and pungent satire used in the novel are at times didactic and prophetic, leaving it to readers to settle whether they should pay heed to the prophecy of a person coming from the North Indian ghetto who likes to introduce himself in a wryly elevated term as an entrepreneur.//////Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a controversial political figure, a freedom fighter, and a champion of free speech. In this profoundly moving memoire she tells of her traditional Muslim childhood and her intellectual awakening..
