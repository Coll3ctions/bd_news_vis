Well, if it is a question of serving warning of an impending tsunami or tidal wave hours before it strikes a coast, there is not much to worry about because enough time is there for people to move to safer locations. The risks to life arise when people have only minutes to evacuate their homes.

Police quoting locals said there was a long-standing dispute over the ownership of a plot of land between Mufti Mia and Saju Mia of the village.

Ministers concerned for Communication and Finance; who have a very important and necessary role in eliminating this un-called for hazard, which can be very easily resolved, if they act on it!//////To be honest, we are stunned by the performance of our national cricket team. What makes it more significant is that they have clinched the series without having two key players. It is Sakib who has made the difference by leading from the front as a captain. Credit goes to the whole team. This victory will raise the confidence level of our players ahead of the world cup, which is just three months away. //////I fully agree with Mr. Minhaj Ahmed's view, expressed in his letter, published in The Daily Star on October 25, 2010, under the caption, 'Unbearable'. In addition to the load shedding, traffic jam, and high prices of essentials, the scarcity of water and gas is affecting people. Many are becoming sick by drinking unsafe water. Crimes of all sorts have gone up alarmingly, ruling party men are engaged in deplorable activities and police are sheltering them. Now conflict has arisen between local people and law enforcers in Rupganj of Narayanganj over forced land purchase for housing project of the army. The locals have said that the army is forcing them to sell land for only Tk. 15 lakh per bigha when the current market price is Tk. 40 lakh. We don't know what to say, this sort of news is very disturbing. Conflict arising between army and common people portrays a very grim picture; we shudder to think the consequences of it.//////Civilians have borne the brunt of modern warfare, with 10 civilians dying for every soldier in wars fought since the mid-20th century, compared with 9 soldiers killed for every civilian in World War I, according to a 2001 study by the International Committee of the Red Cross. //////This time it is Mizanur Rashid, a chemistry teacher of Lokmanpur College of Bagatipara upazila in Natore , who has fallen victim to the sub human treatment of the ruling party's golden boys, who have removed from their way another stumbling block in the shape of a bold teacher, who protested the stalking of the college girls. //////Inter and Intra-party clashes and political killings are so rampant and common in our country that we are fairly accustomed to hearing such news off and on with incurious nonchalance. But the fashion in which the Upazila Chairman of Boraigram in Natore was beaten to death in broad daylight on the national highway is simply awful and stunning. It is alleged that a group of Awami League (AL) activists equipped with firearms and other lethal weapons swooped on the peaceful BNP procession led by Upazila Chairman Sanaullah Noor Babu, also the president of the local BNP unit, and beat him indiscriminately without any provocation. Babu was profusely bleeding and lying unconscious on the road for almost an hour, while the hooligans and the police were watching, possibly enjoying the whole situation. Thus the rowdy ruling party activists murdered an elected representative of the people in the most ignominious and barbarous way. //////A news entitled Nightmare for a 12-yr-old published in The Daily Star on 25th October drew my attention. The event that occurred in Rupganj was merely a sign of barbarism and cruelty of Bangladesh Army. A Rab official forced a twelve-year-old boy at gunpoint to wash the blood of bullet-hit persons from a bridge. Will the teenage boy ever be able to forget the nightmare? We saw a photo of a little girl in the newspaper weeping to see her father. Will our state ensure a normal life for her? //////The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has established the most widely recognised targets. These aim to halve the proportion of the world's population living in extreme poverty between 1990 and 2015, with extreme poverty defined as living on less than US$1 per day. //////The Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray's call for a ban on the use of hijab by Muslim women just because a burqa-clad woman stole an infant from a hospital in Mumbai is ridiculous.//////In a country where underhand dealing, favouritism, corruption and perennial quota system dominate the recruitment process, it is a herculean task to get a job. A few hundred candidates came out successful in the 28th BCS exams. Hardly does anybody feel the pain of a candidate like me who has lost his mother last month. Maybe a good treatment could prolong her life on earth. But I could not save her life for financial crisis.//////Multi-level Marketing (MLM) is a well-known term in our country. This specific kind of business is increasing rapidly. Youths are engaged in this business in general and students in particular. Students are wasting their valuable time in quest of money. If they utilise their time properly, it wont be tough for them to get money in future. They should, therefore, engage themselves in extra curricular activities such as debates, social welfare, etc., beside their education, which will help them to be good citizens. It is a matter of sorrow that we always want to get everything easily in the shortest possible time.//////After fighting for life for 12 days, Natore college teacher Mizanur Rashid died at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Hospital on October 24. On October 12, two local youths attacked Mizanur, a chemistry teacher of Lokmanpur College in Bagatipara upazila, for protesting stalking of college girls. They ran a motorcycle into him, leaving him critically injured. It is a pity that we could not save such a brave heart. At least, let's not forget him. This is one of many such examples of sacrifice people made to uphold humanity from time to time. It epitomizes the kind of protests people have in their heart sometimes exposed and sometimes suppressed. //////The govt. of Sheikh Hasina came to power about 2 years back with a massive mandate from the people. The grand alliance in its election manifesto pledged a lot of things. The progress so far has been very dismal. In my view the main reason behind poor performance is inefficiency of the ministers.

This was a follow-up of the earlier three meetings, the first and the second of which were held in Colombo in October, 2008 and February, 2009 respectively, and the third one in Kabul in November, 2009. These meetings are taking place keeping the launching of the activities of the SFB in abeyance. //////Modern day constitutions or codes of written laws have antecedents which can be traced back thousands of years. Such historic documents have generally enshrined the legal rights of citizens ranging from issues, such as, the protection of the poor from the usury of the rich to that of non-payment of taxes by widows and orphans. In modern times, states have adopted constitutions which are either written or based on 'usage and conventions' catering for either unitary states or federal or supranational entities. But essentially the constitution of a state guarantees its citizens certain clearly laid down rights and entitlements and that state of affair has to be achieved by the creation of institutions, on the one hand, and the establishment of accountability relationship between institutions of state//////Something was wrong. A college student at the time, MA Salam had gone from Jhalakathi to the racecourse maidan in Dhaka in order to witness the historic speech of March 7. He had attended the meetings and processions. After the Pakistani crackdown on the night of March 25, at first it had seemed like trouble, but later he knew that it was war. Independence had been declared and soon he, too, joined the freedom struggle. //////Thanks to the Supreme Court's judgment in the fifth amendment case, we are on board the ship of state, about to journey back to a secular Bangladesh. Anyone who believes in non-discrimination -- which is a peremptory norm of international human rights law -- cannot but be happy with this. We would, however, be living in a fool's paradise if we thought that we could return to that idyllic land that the framers of our Constitution dreamed of in 1972: a society free of "communalism (o-shamprodayikota) in all its forms" and one in which there is no "abuse of religion for political purposes" (original Article 12, Constitution of Bangladesh). Freedom from the various forms of 'communalism' (read racism) can only come if our Constitution not only gets back its stolen pillar of secularism, but is also supplemented with provisions that expressly, accurately and respectfully acknowledge the identities of the different peoples that have lived in Bangladesh since time immemorial. ////// How do you view the recent developments regarding the courts' ruling of the fifth and seventh amendments to the Constitution illegal and void?//////JUSTICE ABM Khairul Haque, in the landmark verdict on the Constitution's Fifth Amendment case, said the modern republican form of democratic government is based on the concept of the right of the people to govern themselves through their own elected representatives. //////
