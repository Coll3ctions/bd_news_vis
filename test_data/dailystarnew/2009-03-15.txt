The violence has resulted in the death of a Shibir leader and a large number of students from both the groups have sustained severe injuries. And not surprisingly, the two educational institutions have been closed indefinitely, throwing the already disrupted schedule into further chaos.//////What has lately been happening in Pakistan is saddening and deeply disquieting. As if the country's troubles with Islamic militants in places like Swat valley were not enough, there are now all the signs of its fledgling democratic politics collapsing in a heap. And if blame were to be pinned on anyone, it is clear that President Asif Ali Zardari is to be held responsible for all the turmoil Pakistanis are going through. There are enough reasons to think that the president has today brought his country face to face with new dangers. In the first place, he has gone back on his deal with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on a curbing of presidential powers. In the second, he has almost brazenly backed out from an agreement to have the judges, dismissed earlier by now departed president Pervez Musharraf, reinstated in office.//////THE BDR mutiny is the worst tragedy which has struck and traumatised the nation since August 15,1975. While the enquiry committees and CID investigations will be trying to find out who conspired and led the mutiny, who killed the officers and looted their houses, and bring to light such facts as would facilitate speedy trial and deterrent punishment of the mutineers, this AL government must not be complacent to think that the crisis is over. //////THE US economy contracted 6.2% in the final quarter of 2008. Unemployment rate has now reached an all-time high of 8.1%, General Motors, long considered as the flagship of American business enterprises has just declared that its auditors have raised substantial doubts about its ability "to continue as a going concern" and all the economic indicators predict that things are going to get worse in the coming months.

The champion Sri Lankan left-hander, however, has done little to justify his abilities in Dhaka cricket so far.

There are, in a day, several hours of supply cut time for the city dwellers during the day and more terribly at night. As a result, children and the old people are the worst victims. However, one wonders why the SSC examinees have to undergo this kind of ordeal every year. //////The International Women's Day is the focal point of what I am writing today. //////A report from Washington, published in a local English daily on March 3, shed light on the issue. This is very much in line with the falsehood that was said against Iraq having WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) for attacking it illegally, against all norms of international law. Later it was proved that it was an outright lie!//////Agriculture is now the main key sector of living all over the world. On the other hand, students are the future of every nation.

I had to wait for about an hour and the banking hour was over. //////Given his young age, his portfolio, and the gravity of the situation, the State Minister for Home should have extended his helping hand to Home Minister Sahara Khatun after the BDR carnage. It has been reported that he was on a personal tour abroad, but he should have flown back to Dhaka immediately. //////Pilkhana carnage is the biggest shock to the nation. But it is too early to comment on the way the crisis was handled. Only time will speak about what has been done and what could have been done when the tragedy had struck. The nation is eagerly awaiting the results of the ongoing investigation. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina looks very serious to identify the perpetrators, their patrons, financiers, conspirators and the motive behind the carnage.//////It is with great alarm that we the ordinary public note the efforts of the Admin cadres to get back some judicial powers. It is only natural that these relics of our colonial past will try every means to regain their undue perks and privileges bestowed on them by the British Raj and later on by the Pakistani occupiers. The colonial rulers needed a compliant and subservient group whose loyalty was to their masters rather than the public. We need people-friendly administrators who consider themselves public servants, rather than masters of the public.//////The above series has come in the court of a politician after facing trouble in the court of cricket bureaucracy. I was so shocked to listen to the minister for sports at prime time news cast on Channel-i. If I am not wrong, the minister was more keen to plan for the protection of the Pakistani players, of course we will do at an appropriate time, than putting due weight to the security of thousands of young men and women who might be allured to attend the proposed cricket match. The proposed date of arrival and possible date of curtailed matches seem to be an wild idea of a few cricket organisers and policy makers. //////For the last couple of days, we the inhabitants of Rahmatgonj, Haji Ballu Road, Water Works Road, Chawkbazar in the old part of Dhaka city are being made to use stinky, foul smelling, black water supplied by Wasa. So stinky is the supplied water that one cannot use it for any purpose whatsoever. I can't describe what we are going through. //////I strongly endorse your recent illuminating editorial on food rationing. //////The nation has seen perhaps the worst attack in its history by a few unruly BDR personnel. The whole nation along with the Bangladeshi communities living abroad are deeply shocked by the loss of lives of military officers as well as other innocent people. It is one of the views now that early intervention could have reduced the number of casualties. However, most of the local and foreign media and representatives of civil society, foreign governments, as well as high officials of the army have agreed that the situation could have deteriorated further if they had intervened earlier. Many more civilians could have been killed instantly, and on the other hand, an intense long-term rivalry would be established between the two forces-- the Army and the BDR. None of these would contribute to bringing back peace to the nation. Therefore, the government deserves thanks for the intelligent and bold steps it took to avoid those unwelcome events. //////Since the most brutal killing of our brave sons at Pilkhana, Begum Zia is making unfounded, aggressive and provocative statements every day which can only divide people, and not unite, at this critical and challenging time. Merrily, our press is giving extensive coverage to her questionable campaign against the just installed democratically elected government.//////The recent efforts by the NBR authorities to widen the tax net and enhance collection of income tax is quite timely and we do support the initiative. But people are still apprehensive about the effort as certain issues are still not smooth and client-friendly. For example, collecting TIN certificate for purchasing land, apartment, seeking permission for establishing industries or taking large loan from the bank is quite all right. But why should it be necessary for renewal of fitness certificates of personal cars every year? Did not the concerned person had his TIN certificate and submitted it while purchasing the car and get it registered earlier? //////Provocation from outside is possible; no, likely. But why do we succumb? There will always be people ready to commit the most heinous crimes for a tiny gain. Lamenting it does not take us very far. We have to develop our own defence. Talking about germs floating in the air around us is no cure. We have to develop our own immunity.//////Palestinian factions in Cairo for marathon unity talks were deadlocked yesterday after failing to agree on the composition and obligations of a unity government, officials said.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Friday to express her "deep concern" over mounting deaths in a government safe zone, a US official said.//////Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah has said that the National Conference was ready to talk to separatists after the upcoming general elections.//////The top US military commander has expressed confidence that his Pakistani counterpart, General Ashfaq Kiyani, is committed to civilian rule and is not plotting a military takeover. //////Cautioning that Pakistan's unity was at stake, Interior Minister Rehman Malik Saturday sought to dispel reports of differences between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani, even as he urged the agitating lawyers to come to the negotiating table rather than marching on Islamabad to enforce their demands.//////Former president George W Bush recast the US relationship with India, forging closer ties.

We assume that the government wants to make Bangladesh fully digitised by 2021 through application of third generation information and communication technology (ICT). //////INDIANS and Pakistanis are the same people. Why then have the two nations moved on such divergent arcs over the last six decades? The idea of India is stronger than the Indian, and the idea of Pakistan weaker than the Pakistani. Multi-religious, multi-ethnic, secular, democratic India was an idea that belonged to the future; one-dimensional Pakistan was a concept borrowed from the fears of the past.//////
