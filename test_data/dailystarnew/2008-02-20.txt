Since the joint forces have been on pursuit of variously labelled terrorist elements on the basis of information, mainly gathered from arrested suspects, the clandestine operatives are on the run. That explains the discovery of abandoned weapons. There is a growing suspicion, however, that substantial number of bombs or firearms may have been hidden away in various parts of the country. The success of the joint forces gives us hope that the remaining arms caches will be unearthed soon. //////KOSOVO's declaration of independence has caused quite a few powerful, and widening, ripples in the international community. With Serbia, from which state the Kosovars have now prised themselves out as a free entity, angrily denouncing the move, it is but natural that Kosovo's leaders will feel some heat in the days ahead. The Serbian foreign minister's statement that Kosovo will never find a place in the United Nations, together with Russian opposition to the independence move, will certainly not scupper Kosovo's status as a free state. But it does point to a situation where the new state will find it hard to find acceptability among a certain section of the global community.//////HOW you take Kosovo's declaration of independence is strictly a matter of opinion. Even so, there is that primeval stirring in the soul which keeps speaking of the beauty of freedom. We in Bangladesh understand, and readily too, what it means to be free, having gone through the collective travails involved in a grim struggle for freedom. Or ask the people of East Timor . They will tell you of their sufferings, their long tale of woe under Indonesian occupation, for years on end, until they came by freedom. And so it is that we are vicariously made aware of the beauty that brings freedom in a package to the people of Kosovo. //////IT is too early to speculate about the next government and its chances.

One settles for unavoidable challenges facing the state, leaving reflection on its prospects for next time. //////FOR the first time in 48 years, a senator will be elected president of the United States of America on November 4.

a timely one which will encourage the farmers. It is learned that Tk.750 crore has been allocated for this purpose. But the question remains, when will the farmers get the subsidy? Here the ground reality should be considered. In the northern part of the country transplantation is going on but in the haor areas it has been already done. Here the farmers have already used a large quantity of diesel in tilling the land by power tillers. Irrigation is now going on in full swing. So farmers have to consume the maximum quantity of diesel now.

It is recognised and accepted in the present-day world that in the eye of law all citizens are equal. But the Bangladesh government is not following this principle in case of imposing personal income tax on its employees. The full salary of a government employee is exempted from personal income tax now. This cannot be fair. //////Thirty six years since independence the country is still reeling in political uncertainly. From the initial socialist form of economy to mixed economy, from parliamentary to presidential system of government, to military takeover and now the caretaker government, Bangladesh has seen it all. The trial and error way of finding the right form of governing a country has become a never-ending fiasco. Perhaps we have missed the truth-- that it is not the form of government which builds a nation but the people who run it do. A flight in a rough weather is as good as the skills of the pilot flying the plane. And now a new mathematical formula of a minus two government, that of leaving out the present heads of the two main political parties from contesting in the election. //////The caretaker government is unusually rude to Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina for reasons not known to us. This government is the result of Hasina's relentless struggle in her bid to foil a staged election by the 4-party alliance government led by the BNP. //////Panic seized me while going through the report in the daily Prothom Alo (on 27th January)-- one Munmun from Joypurhat committed suicide because of eve teasing.

Similarly, hundreds of thousands of parents all over the country feel obliged not to allow their daughters to go to school or college. //////The MSS final exams, session 2003-04 of sociology department of Dhaka University, was held in April 2007 & the dept. is under the supervision of the social science faculty.

Some of them are compelled to change their profession wasting their hard earned technical degree. But opportunity may be created for self employment of the agriculture graduate as Krishi Daktar (Agriculture doctor) if government allows him/her to do practice like a medical doctor after registration.//////I am a Bangladeshi studying engineering in the United States. Until now, I have always represented my country with pride, but today I have to lower my head in shame due to the state of our nation. Those, whom we had entrusted with keeping the honour of the land of Bangla, have done nothing but injustice to those alive (if we can call it being alive in a country where the price of rice equals a day's worth of work for many) and those who have given their lives for our country. //////In my article on Suharto published online, I observed://////The current development of all forms of education system has urged an increase in educational quality which unfortunately is concentrated in the words and pages of the thickest books. Instead of focusing on the moral development of a child our system, with all its might, is trying to make them knowledgeable. Such education might lay a skin on a spoilt mass of flesh. I have been a teacher since I myself was doing my A-levels from a very reputed English medium school. In the journey of my educational and teaching career I have come across many young students and teachers. Lack of communication in the community composed of students and teachers has always seemed vivid to me. In most cases teachers place a veil on the subjects in which the students seem to require more knowledge; such subjects include sexual, religious and ethical issues. Discussions about these subjects among the students themselves have led to ill developed and premature knowledge. This in turn has multiple effects on the psychology of a teenager or any youngster. If we focus on the current subjects of interest of these people we might fail to discover anything but a wild craze about expensive cell phones, fancy clothes, drugs and sex; which more specifically can be termed as an abuse of sex. This is mostly because of the intermingling of cultures in the wrong way. This wrong or destructive mix is because of the way in which our young people have been introduced to different dimensions of socio-cultural facts. Parents have equally contributed to this demolition of morals by restricting a student's freedom of communication with his/her teacher. //////Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif called on Pervez Musharraf to step down yesterday after the Pakistani president's allies conceded defeat in a crucial parliamentary election. //////Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf will become a powerless leader at best -- and could lose his job -- after his parliamentary supporters conceded defeat in elections, analysts said yesterday. //////Pakistani democracy has taken its revenge and voters have expressed their wrath against President Pervez Musharraf, the nation's newspapers said Tuesday after key parliamentary elections. //////Celebratory gunfire and dancing in the streets greeted heavy election losses Tuesday by Pakistan's main alliance of Islamist parties in a key province bordering Afghanistan. //////Serbia withdrew its ambassadors from Washington and other major capitals as the United States and several European powers led international moves to recognise Kosovo's independence. //////The British government on Monday released an early draft of its controversial dossier on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), after losing a bid to keep it secret. //////US Senator John Kerry, in Pakistan as part of a team to observe parliamentary elections, said Tuesday the vote "meets the basic threshold of credibility and legitimacy." //////Nepal's sidelined monarch issued a rare statement yesterday, calling for peace as the ethnically-tense south of the country entered the seventh day of a violent general strike. //////Voters in Wisconsin began casting ballots yesterday for candidates seeking the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations in a contentious race marked by attack ads and accusations of plagiarism. //////All India Peace and Solidarity Organisation (AIPSO) recently organised the Asian regional consultative meeting of World Peace Council in New Delhi, says a press release.//////Two Myanmar journalists working for a weekly newspaper have been arrested, but police gave no reason for their detention, an editor at the paper said yesterday.//////A 46-year-old Buddhist man was shot and then set ablaze as he tried to escape an attack by suspected Islamic separatists yesterday in Thailand's Muslim-majority south, police said.//////As part of ongoing 10th International Short and Independent Film Festival, Dhaka-2008, a national seminar on Filmmaking in Digital Medium: Bangladesh Perspective was held at the Sufia Kamal Auditorium, National Museum on February 18.
