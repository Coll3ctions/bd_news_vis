Such moves will help inaugurate a fresh new democratic spirit in the country, one that we as citizens have for years been advocating. In fact, it has always been the desire of the people of Bangladesh that a productive and genuine democratic order be set in motion as a precondition for the overall development of the country. Within such a programme of democratic reawakening must be included a democratisation of the inner party working process, the right of independent thinking within the parties, indeed the right of party leaders and workers to voice dissent over issues they cannot morally agree with. In other words, for democracy to work, it is for the parties to ensure that freedom of thought characterises their own functioning.//////AT a time when the nation is looking forward to holding a peaceful election for transition of power to a political government, clashes between the activists of student wings of major political parties pose a threat to peace at educational institutions of the country. Violent clashes at Rajshahi Medical College between supporters of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) over a seat at the dormitory a couple of days back have left many students gravely injured. As a measure to avoid backlashes the authorities have had to close down the college until October 10. Then on Friday, activists of JCD assaulted some students of the department of mass communication and journalism of Dhaka University including journalists on the issue of filming a TV serial in front of Teacher Student Centre (TSC). A number of university correspondents of local newspapers had to be taken to hospitals with injuries. //////THE importance of financial intermediation in attacking rural poverty is recognised as well as being rigorously researched. Examples are in abundance that financial constraints -- rather than lack of skills, market opportunities, or supply bottlenecks -- are reported to prevent poor families from making a pie to escape poverty. //////AT the height of popular discontent, when the French people were agitating for bread, Queen Marie Antionette of France had haughtily suggested that if the people could net get bread then they should eat cake. Such indifference, among other causes, led Marie Antionette, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Theresa of Austria, to the gallows. //////IF one was not opposed to the nuclear device on the point of principle, as I am, one would applaud India for having forced its way through the 34-year-old nuclear isolation. From being a nuclear pariah, it has become a nuclear power, an official member of the exclusive club.//////There was no respite for Abahani as Rahmatganj shocked them with a 2-1 victory in the opening match of the Citycell B.

India has felt his power at the crease and will be relieved to be spared any repetition. Never mind that he was patently caught behind the wicket before he had taken command, still Symonds's innings in the ill-mannered Sydney Test match was one of coruscating power. Once he was underway, Anil Kumble and company might as well have been firing popguns at a tank. It was an exceptional assault.//////Harbhajan Singh is confident that Australia's two new spinners will pose little threat to India's batsmen in the upcoming Test series. Australia picked the uncapped Bryce McGain and Jason Krejza as their frontline slow bowlers for the India tour and Harbhajan said while he knew little about them, the two men were clearly a step down from Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill.//////Little Friends and Uttar Baridhara earned identical 1-0 wins in the Second Division Football League at the Kamalapur Stadium yesterday.//////Real Madrid have enough players to compete well in all tournaments this year despite having signed few players over the summer, the reigning Spanish champion's goalkeeper Iker Casillas said Friday. //////The controversy between Sunderland manager Roy Keane and Jack Warner took a new twist on Friday with a letter from the FIFA vice-president hitting out at the former Manchester United star. //////Austrian teenager Tamira Paszek shocked top seed Daniela Hantuchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 to set up a Bali Open final against Switzerland's Patty Schnyder on Saturday.//////Former Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan held shock talks with the Premier League club's owner Mike Ashley on Friday. //////Sir Alex Ferguson has dismissed the threat posed to Manchester United by newly-wealthy Manchester City and ridiculed their ambitions to sign Cristiano Ronaldo as "absurd."//////Blackburn manager Paul Ince has pledged his future to the Premiership club to douse reports he might take over the vacant Newcastle post and team up with former England teammate Dennis Wise. //////Ethiopia were kicked out of the World Cup by FIFA on Friday after the long-running power struggle within the game in the African nation failed to be resolved. //////Oscar "Blade Runner" Pistorius Saturday won his second gold of the Paralym pic Games as China stretched its lead at the top of the medals table.//////Andrew Symonds has joined his good friend Matthew Hayden for a net session in Queensland in what is believed to be his first hit-out since being banished from Australia's squad.

It is very usual. So British supermarket trader late Jack Cohen's business motto -- pile it high, sell it cheap -- does not work much this season. Sellers pile it high indeed, but obviously do not need to sell it that cheap. And buyers also do not care to buy it high. Because it is the Eid time.//////The universe is in constant flux, thought a classical philosopher named Heraclitus, in the sixth century BCE.

car. Whatever convenience and comfort it provides comes at various costs. Cars are the main source of pollutants worldwide. There is no such thing as a clean car; cars just vary in the amount they pollute. Despite increasingly stringent emissions control standards over the decades in the US, cars pollute more than they used tobecause people are driving more. //////What do we need now? What Bangladesh needs most now for its 140 million people and their future? A "BRIDE" we need now! It is a symbolic term here! The political parties , elections and the government are the ornaments of the BRIDE !! The bride is nothing but the "POLICY" of the country which is the most important thing for us now !! It is not important who wins the election and who sits on the opposition benches in parliament, what is important is the right "policy" which must be followed strictly in order to get the proper democratic system started in our country for the first time in history. A policy , which is 100% for the welfare of the general public, nothing else. A policy which will ensure the following most required three things - //////We have a department, a ministry, an adviser and above all a powerful government. They have all along informed the people that such and such steps would be taken to control the rise of the prices of daily necessities during Ramadan. The result is opposite . The latest move by the FBCCI has failed, and they are planning to call for the support of the law enforcing agencies like RAB, BDR and police. The success of the new move is doubtful and might create a panic in the mind of the traders having the same result we saw in the early days of the CTG adopting the terrorising strategy. The efforts to neutralise the terror effect on the market and the traders are being continued by the CTG. The FBCCI has perhaps a major role in pursuing such a reconciliatory move by the CTG. Therefore, they should be well aware of the pros and cons of using the tactics of intimidation and force against the wholesale and retail traders as identified by them..//////There is a growing concern that the Obama effect currently changing the face of politics as usual in the United States by propelling an increasingly large number of Americans, especially the forward looking, educated and young across the colour and racial divides, to cast their precious votes for their candidate of choice, who represents a quantum leap and paradigm shift towards a post-ethnic and post-modern national and international leadership, may turn out to be an euphoria and an Audacity of Hope that is intrinsically ephemeral. In retrospect, would this be construed simply as a pleasure principle that took the United States by the storm briefly, but was eventually caught up by the reality principle implicit in the Bradley Effect, also known as Wilder effect or Dinkins Effect, in which the margin of lead in the primary election enjoyed by yet another very promising African-American candidate was significantly wiped out in the final election because the White voters, who posed as independent and swing voters to conceal their racial affiliations during the primary reverted again to their true colours in the final election unabashedly? Could we bet on Obama's White half-ancestry to tip the balance in the final election to be able to declare that we had finally moved beyond the phenotype incontrovertibly entrenched in the US psyche for generations? //////The holy Ramadan is the month for self-correction and self-sacrifice. But what we are observing in this month --instead of going down, the prices are going up. This is too bad for us, especially for our poor and low-income people. This is a sad truth that when Ramadan comes traders and hoarders hike the prices of essential commodities. The people have nothing to do. They are bound to buy the essentials. The policy makers and the market controllers are blind to this situation. //////The government's declaration that the schools will all have to start at 7:30am is good news to me. At least the government is trying to come out of its negligent attitude. Some schools (and their students know very well to whom I am referring to), keep their students locked up in long, unnecessary lessons. The government should also have mentioned a suitable time for schools to close for the day. //////Bangla has a great heritage and a rich history full of struggle. There is no other language as Bangla which has a similar history. We sacrificed some priceless lives on 21 February 1952 to establish the right of Bangla as a state language of the country. Now 21 February is the International Mother Language Day. //////A very interesting and appropriate headline on the chronic failure of the Bangladesh cricket team. The blame is due for the entire system, the BCCB, selectors, team management including the coach and finally the captain. We only hope that cricket would be governed and run by the cricketers and be kept above the current trend of politics in sports and games.//////There has been extensive coverage of the terrible traffic situation in Dhaka city. One can only sit and read these and feel like "strangling" someone at the total frustration and helplessness we commuters suffer from!//////My elder brother is a student of SUST. He has completed his honours course this year. But it has taken seven years to complete this four year course due to session jam. Student politics is responsible for such jams. In our country, it takes much longer than usual time to complete our academic life. So we can't apply for government jobs in time. //////August 15 has been observed as a day of national mourning. On this day in 1975, the father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujubur Rahman, President of Bangladesh, was brutally killed along with some other members of his family during a military coup. The coup leaders also killed four national leaders in jail on 04 Nov 1975. August 15 is definitely a black day in the history of Bangladesh.//////I will try to say something about the ill fated mother whose letter was published on September 5, 2008. I was surprised after reading her letter "No way out". I couldn't understand how a mother calls herself ill fated when she has two golden super- talented children. Yes, it is painful that her daughter could not manage sponsorship. But why should we think that nothing more is left in life? And why should we think that the USA and the UK are the only places for a brilliant student?//////While there is no question about the integrity and honesty of Anti-Corruption Commission Chairman Lt Gen (retd) Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, the way the ACC is working towards its stated goals of uprooting corruption from the country needs to be reviewed. Except the NAIKO and GATCO cases where procedural irregularities along with financial losses were taken into account, every case so far I know was filed for amassing illegal wealth or concealing information about the wealth when the ACC asked for it from an individual. //////I usually go out early in the morning for a walk, since I developed some symptoms of diabetes, and get a chance to look around, especially wall writings and posters. I have recently noticed there are some talented singers participating in competitions in the electronic media, although I must appreciate it but I feel bad when I see some posters on the wall with the participants asking people to vote for them by SMS. Those who are interested in watching these programmes may send SMS if they like their voice, but it is not clear whether the participants should uses posters for this purpose. Is it the proper way to be a popular singer? //////The people of Bangladesh never got so much hope before, except our great win in the liberation war. A real hope, a great dream & a bright future we could see in the horizon after this caretaker government took over. But unfortunately all our dreams are vanishing day by day. Thanks to Dr Mahboob Hossain for his letter  Election & return of goons and Mr. Rony Ahmed for  The unfortunate nation. //////Hundreds of Russian forces packed up and withdrew from positions Saturday in western Georgia, and a Georgian official said Russia met a deadline for a partial pullout a month after the war between the two former Soviet republics. //////Three lawmakers cautioned the US Congress on Friday against rushing through with a vote on a landmark nuclear pact with India that President George W Bush wants approved before he leaves office in January.//////At least 24 Islamic militants were killed Saturday in fierce fighting with Pakistani government troops hunting Taliban fighters near the Afghan border, a security official said.//////Massive Hurricane Ike ravaged southeast Texas early Saturday, battering the coast with driving rain and ferocious wind gusts as residents who decided too late they should have heeded orders to evacuate made futile calls for rescue. //////Speakers at a view exchange meeting yesterday said around 57,000 people die every year in the country due to smoking and use of tobacco products yesterday.//////Emergency crews found more victims early yesterday, boosting the death toll to 17, as they delicately picked apart the mangled wreckage of a commuter train that collided head-on with a freight train on the same track. //////Six ex-ministers on Saturday warned British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to sharpen up his act, piling on the pressure after a government member broke ranks and called for a leadership challenge.//////A battle-ready BJP today announced the launch of its campaign for elections to five state Assemblies and Lok Sabha with a 14-rally 'Vijay Sankalp Yatra' by party's prime ministerial candidate L K Advani.//////Doctors have diagnosed more than 1,000 acute diarrhoea cases in relief camps in the flood-ravaged plains of northern India, and at least six more people have died of complications from the disease, a health official said Saturday. //////Detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will soon submit her first-ever personal appeal for release to Myanmar's ruling junta, her lawyer told AFP yesterday.//////India yesterday carried out a successful test of a homemade air-to-air missile designed for its air force, defence sources said.//////Nepal's Prime Minister Prachanda on Saturday visited the palace of the king his Maoist party battled to overthrow, which is being turned into a museum.//////Iran on Friday condemned US sanctions on the country's largest shipping line as "illegal and unjustifiable," insisting the company never engaged in any illicit activities such as the transfer of equipment for Tehran's missile and nuclear programmes. //////Top officials from Thailand's ruling party will meet Monday to pick a nominee to be the next prime minister after Samak Sundaravej's bid to return was snuffed out, a candidate told AFP Saturday.//////Insurgents set off two bomb attacks in Iraq yesterday, killing 10 people, most of them members of security forces while 32 others were killed in suicide truck bombings on Friday, officials told AFP.//////Hackers claim they have broken into the computer system of the Large Hadron Collider, the mega-machine designed to expose secrets of the cosmos, British newspapers reported yesterday.//////China's health minister said 432 babies had kidney stones after drinking contaminated milk powder and vowed to punish those responsible as the country's latest product safety scandal escalated yesterday.//////Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has cancelled his tour next month of Germany and Switzerland for health reasons, his office said yesterday.//////Nepal's new prime minister Prachanda's first visit to India, due to start today, is aimed at "building a new and smooth relationship" between the neighbours, a minister said Saturday.//////Md.

He always extended his helping hand to anyone in distress around him. And very often he extended it beyond his immediate capacity. A legal practitioner by profession, he was a cultural as well as a social activist. But was very short-lived. He passed away when only in his mid-forties, cutting short hopes and expectations of so many around him.//////IF things do not change drastically for the Democrats soon, American voters will engender the most colossal upset in the history of US presidential elections, by electing Republican John McCain over Democrat Barack Obama.//////Once an idyllic residential area, Dhanmondi today is almost devoid of gardens, green lawns and big trees with the onslaught of reckless commercialisation and changes in land use pattern. //////A small passage on the ground floor of Mitford Hospital is crammed with scores of people scrambling for going in and coming out.
