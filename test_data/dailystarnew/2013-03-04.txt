It was all lies -- outright and outrageous -- but it worked. Jamaat's propaganda machine used a photoshopped image of Delawar Hossain Sayedee's face on the moon yesterday to entice people to unleash a second wave of terror that left at least 19 people, including a policeman, dead in five districts.//////Absurd it may look, but a picture of convicted war criminal Delawar Hossain Sayedee superimposed on the face of moon posted in Jamaat-Shibir Facebook page Basherkella was actually sold to a large number of people as an omen. //////The government yesterday appealed to the Supreme Court seeking death penalty to Jamaat-e-Islami leader Abdul Quader Mollah for each of the six charges he faced at the International Crimes Tribunal-2.//////The High Court yesterday directed the government to protect until further orders the minority communities and places of worships attacked allegedly by activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and BNP in Noakhali on Thursday. //////British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Gibson yesterday deplored the cruel and unwarranted attacks on places of worship and private property in Bangladesh. //////Indian President Pranab Mukherjee has firmly said his country is committed to implement all agreed decisions with Bangladesh.//////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia has cancelled today's meeting with Indian President Pranab Mukherjee because her party apparently does not want to make key ally Jamaat-e-Islami unhappy. //////In utter inhumanity, Jamaat-Shibir men yesterday gauged out one eye of a policeman and hacked him indiscriminately to death at Sanatanpur police camp under Harinakundo upazila in Jhinaidah. //////The historic ground of Bahadur Shah Park, where the mutineers of the 1857 Sepoy Rebellion were publicly hanged, yesterday resounded with the slogans of the new generation protesters who resolved to build a country based on the values of the Liberation War. //////Three trucks laden with garments for a US buyer were due to take off Sunday morning for Chittagong from Arunima Group's Ashulia factory.//////Three top Jamaat-e-Islami leaders yesterday failed to show up before International Crimes Tribunal-2 for the third time in connection with a contempt of court rule issued against them.//////Sri Lanka's national cricketers dropped a controversial pay demand on Sunday, clearing the way for them to play against Bangladesh in a forthcoming series, a senior official said.//////Prosecution yesterday argued before the International Crimes Tribunal-1 that as a civilian superior, Ghulam Azam was involved in war crimes during the Liberation War in 1971.//////At least 45 people were killed and more than 50 people injured by a bomb explosion in the Pakistani city of Karachi last night, police said.//////The government yesterday announced names of eight eminent personalities for Independence Award 2013 in recognition of their outstanding contributions at national level.//////The Supreme Judicial Council has started investigating the alleged misconduct of High Court Judge Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan, Supreme Court sources said yesterday. //////With virtual bodyguards, panic buttons and maps to pinpoint harassment blackspots, women in urban India are using their smartphones for protection after a notorious gang-rape in New Delhi.//////A crude bomb exploded in a village in eastern India, killing three people involved in protests against a $12 billion steel plant project by South Korean giant Posco, police said yesterday.//////India's hardline nationalist politician Narendra Modi launched a stinging attack yesterday on the ruling Congress party, setting the stage for a pitched political battle in general elections next year.//////Sri Lanka's navy said yesterday it had detained 16 Indian fishermen on a charge of poaching, as tensions rose between India's southern state of Tamil Nadu and the Colombo government.//////Suspected militants on Saturday shot dead two policemen in Indian Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region which has been tense since the hanging of a separatist last month, police said.//////A shallow 5.5-magnitude earthquake hit southwest China yesterday, causing 700 homes to collapse and leaving 20 people injured, state media said.//////Already three consecutive dawn-to-dusk hartals enforced by Jamaat-Shibir had hurt the supply chain of the economy.

It is worthwhile to note that the principal opposition BNP lent moral support to Jamaat called hartals. In other words, with the BNP joining in, the overall hartal situation looks fraught with risks of violence, hardship for the people. //////We note with a great deal of concern that the recent eruptions of political violence have been marked by some attacks on members of Hindu community with their houses and temples vandalised. Reports of such incidents have come from different areas of Noakhali, Chittagong, Barisal, Bagerhat and Gazipur.//////On the first day of the three-day warm-up match, off-spinner Shohag Gazi emerged as the most successful Bangladesh player by taking five wickets against the Sri Lanka Development Emerging Team at the Uyanwatte Stadium yesterday.

A case was filed in this connection under the Copy Right Act.//////The only redeeming feature of the distressing news about the burning of a Hindu temple and of Hindu homes in Bangladesh is the apparent absence of injury to individuals, or worse. These senseless attacks are in greater need of immediate justice than even the trial of war criminals. If we adopt the view of the apparent perpetrators for a moment, we are bound to admit that all minorities, and specifically the Hindus, are dhimmi and fully protected. Nothing can be of greater importance than to reassure the minorities by an immediate and transparent provision of justice to them.//////Nowadays CNG-run auto-rickshaw drivers, in most cases, don't agree to go on meter but on contract demanding 4/5 times the normal fare. They even request passengers to be complicit in their wrongful act if challenged by police. This way, the auto-driver is not only robbing the passenger but also compelling him/her to tell lies. When asked about the reason of such unholy act, the common answer from the auto-drivers is: the auto-owners do not accept the amount fixed by the authorities and they have to pay the owners 2/3 times higher than that. So the auto-drivers are helpless and demand high fare from passengers. The poor passengers can neither speak the truth before the traffic personnel nor can they quit travelling by auto-rickshaws for obvious reasons.//////In the last 40 years many countries with backgrounds similar to us have left us behind in vital areas of human development, and education in particular. The functioning of private universities has filled a huge gap in higher education, although a lot has to be done to ensure their quality. //////Political unrest is endemic in Bangladesh. Political parties use students as their musclemen. When a political party comes to power, student activists of that party turn into demons. They do whatever they like. They vandalise educational campuses, beat up innocent students, insult and humiliate female students and so on. But government does not take any step against them.//////I have always wished to study abroad. However, due to some unavoidable circumstances, I couldn't make it and got admitted to a renowned university in Bangladesh. When I started my classes, I was handed a few assignments which needed fieldwork. I found my group members grumbling, This teacher is so weird, maybe he is a new one. Why go for a fieldwork? Let's just make something. Who will know whether we went to the field for it or not? I was dumbfounded.//////I think religious belief is one's personal matter. One may not believe in religious customs and it is absolutely one's personal matter, but one should not disrespect the religious beliefs of others. The majority of the people of our country are Muslims. If anyone makes any vulgar comments about religion in social networking sites, blogs or media, it hurts the religious feelings of others. These persons should be punished. If not, one may think that he has the right to say or write whatever he likes which will eventually create violence.//////The so-called Islamic coteries are bifurcating our beloved motherland in the name of blasphemy. The Shahbagh Chattar demonstration was not against Islam. But some Islamist groups are deliberately trying to spread rumours against the young generation that they are atheists and against Islam. Another party of our political arena claimed that this movement was not impartial and fuelled by AL. And, no sooner had the Jamaat-Shibir tried to save their leaders by calling strike than the demonstrators added another demand to their list: cancellation of the registration of Jamaat-e-Islami and its affiliated organisations. People should be careful about the conspiracies to create unrest and take stand against all propagandas. //////Rampura is one of the most busy and densely populated areas in Dhaka. Many educational institutions like East West University, Dhaka Imperial College, Aftabnagar Ideal School and College, National Cambrian School are situated here. Every morning thousands of people leave the area for office, while thousands of others come here. The DIT road is the main road of Rampura, so it always remains very busy. Every day office goers and students have to cross this road risking their lives, as there is no foot overbridge around. //////There are systems of providing scholarships to the poor and meritorious students so that they can continue their studies. But only scholarships are not sufficient for the poor students to bear their educational expenses. If government introduces some projects in which these students can work and have some income to support themselves, it will be very beneficial to them.//////The entire nation saw the militant activities of Jamaat- Shibir on 22nd February after the Juma prayers. They vandalised our Shaheed Minar and tore our national flag into pieces and burned it across the country. Through these types activities they have proved that they do not believe in the independence of Bangladesh, have no respect for our language and Liberation War. They do not believe in democracy; rather try to create panic across the country to stop the war crimes trial. //////Hundreds of Syrian troops and rebels were killed in a week-long battle for a police academy in the northern province of Aleppo, with insurgents seizing control of most of the complex, a monitoring group said yesterday.//////Armed forces in Chad claim to have killed Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the commander of an al-Qaeda-linked brigade which carried out a bloody assault to take western hostages at a gas plant in Algeria in January.//////The retrial in Egypt of ousted president Hosni Mubarak on charges related to the killing of protesters during the uprising against him will begin on 13 April, according to the country's state news agency.//////Thousands of delegates from across China meet this week to seal a power transfer to new leaders who have raised expectations with a deluge of propaganda during their first months running the Communist Party.//////Global conservationists converged on Bangkok yesterday for the start of endangered species talks, as host Thailand was forced onto the defensive over the rampant smuggling of ivory through its territory.//////President Barack Obama has appointed a new coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf, the White House announced Saturday.//////Israeli President Shimon Peres on Saturday gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a two-week extension to form a new coalition government, after he failed to do so in an initial four-week period.//////Iran has freed 14 journalist working for reformist papers who were arrested in January and accused of cooperating with a "Western-linked network", the reformist Shargh newspaper reported yesterday.//////A suicide bomber struck in an area between major shrines in the Iraqi Shia holy city of Karbala yesterday, wounding 10 people, security and medical officials said.//////A privately-owned unmanned US space capsule arrived at the International Space Station yesterday, bringing to the space outpost food, scientific materials and other crucial equipment.//////Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf said Friday he would return home within weeks to contest elections after nearly five years in self-imposed exile, but did not set a specific date.//////Five Malaysian policemen and two gunmen died in a fresh clash on Borneo as fears mounted that violence linked to a deadly standoff with Filipino intruders had spread to other areas, police said yesterday.//////Veteran actress Rosy Siddiqui's career in TV has spanned over two decades, while she also has a 23-year strong experience in theatre.

They were blatant, in your face insults to our nationhood, to the core values of our struggle for independence. On the surface these affronts were a reaction of a bigoted minority to the historic upsurge of national ire against war criminals, and justice demanded by our youths against the criminals that was voiced over three weeks in Shahbagh Square. But deep down this is a resurgence and muscle flexing by elements that have inherited the spirit and philosophy of the forces that stood against us, and aided and collaborated with the power that had launched a war against us in 1971. //////Nearly eight years ago, Kuomintang (KMT) elder Lien Chan's ice-breaking visit to Beijing helped ease tensions in one of Asia's most dangerous flashpoints and ushered in the current warm cross-strait ties.//////On February 6, the Election Commission (EC) announced the draft electoral boundaries of all 300 parliamentary constituencies in the country. Delimitation of boundaries is one of the most fundamental pre-election activities, and this has moved the EC one step closer to holding the 10th parliamentary election. //////As an agrarian country in a deltaic environment Bangladesh relies on floods and the fertility of its soil to produce its annual grain requirement. But crop losses due to floods and other natural calamities are a recurring phenomenon which disrupts the entire economy of the country. For example, early monsoon floods, late onset of floods, and other climate variations impact food production and quality of life significantly. In addition to dislocation of cropping practices, large populations have historically suffered greatly in part due to unanticipated climate events that are typical in Bangladesh. When monsoons are delayed and crops fail as a result, farmers often don't know how to pay back the debts they have taken on to purchase seeds. //////Almost every time you pick up the phone in Hong Kong, you end up with a good laugh. Here are seven real-life transcripts of conversations.//////
