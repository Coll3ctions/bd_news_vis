We will constantly be more and more focused on risk, and less on routine tasks. As most of the supervisors are involved in the on-site inspection process, they will be particularly interested in the changes we have planned in on-site supervision. As most of us probably know, the on-site inspections take too long, from the time the inspectors arrive in the bank until the time that the report of inspection is written, approved, and sent to the bank's board of directors. As a result, the findings and conclusions given to the bank, and used by us in requiring corrective action, may be based on out-of-date information. We are seeking to reduce that time significantly through changes in the manner in which staffs are allocated and deployed, and the elimination of routine tasks that do not directly address current and emerging risks. In that way, we can demand that problems be addressed through corrective action at an earlier stage, before they threaten the solvency or liquidity of the bank. //////An International conference on
