On information, fire fighters from the district town rushed to the spot and extinguished the blaze. Sources said the workers of the industry have been demanding Eid bonus for the last 15 days. As the authorities refused to give them bonus in the morning, they went on the rampage.//////The essence of Eid is on air and people of Bangladesh undoubtedly burst out into shopping. The television channels are regularly airing programmes regarding the shopping trends. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard the host affirming a sari, costing Tk. 3 lakh! How ridiculous is that now? The other day I turned the pages of The Daily Star, there was a rickshaw puller standing by the alley, selecting dresses from street vendors for his son. This man trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty could not even afford a shirt costing Tk. 200 and the fact is that in this very same country people are choosing dresses worth Tk. 3 lakh! People, who are affluent can argue back that this is what they have earned with their hard labour, so they possess every right to purchase anything they like, they have every right to enjoy. Well, it is also true enough that people are very much helpless and poor at its lowest level. So, a humble request to all -if you have ability, then help the needy. Eid Mubarak!//////I refer to the harmful effects of chemical additives on Iftar foods sold in many shops (letter 1.9.10). It is not only the chemicals but also the fat and oil of the fried iftar items that is very bad for health. Ramadan is the month of restraint and is an excellent opportunity to lose some weight following religious practices, however because of the tasty and alluring fatty and fried food stuffs, most people put on more weight during this month. It is specially bad for well-to-do people with sedentary habits and life style. A recent health study (widely reported in UK media) has found that beside obesity merely sitting down for any length of time is very bad for cardiovascular health. Men who sit for 23 hours a week have a 64 percent greater chance of dying from cardiovascular disease than men who spend only 11 hours sitting. Another study found that sitting ( like TV viewing, sitting at an office desk etc) increases your chances of dying from any cause, and this is worse for women; those who sat for more than 6 hours per day were 37 percent more likely to die than those who sat for fewer than three hours, regardless of physical activity at other times. Some doctors are therefore advising that in addition to having proper food and exercise we should spend much more time standing on our feet than just sitting down.//////You can kindly see the condition of the lake filled with rubbish & human waste dumped by the shanty dwellers living by the lake side upstream on the south past the connecting bridge.

The allegations that Pakistani players, including their captain, collaborated with a betting racket during the England-Pakistan Test series could have a debilitating impact on the game. The immediate fallout will be felt in Pakistan, a country that has produced some of the game's finest players. Cricket in that country has been in limbo for reasons extraneous to the game. The fallout of the corruption allegation could be more devastating than the temporary break terrorism has forced on cricketing activity in Pakistan.//////Too much has been written about niqaab already. It's time we focus on mini-skirts! Mini-skirt is no less extreme than niqaab. Imagine a teacher looking around the class and all he gets is an unwelcome glimpse of the girl's private parts. Is normal interaction possible in this case? Mini-skirt is an impediment to cultural development and spiritual enlightenment. It increases the risk of sexual harassment. We cannot always depend on men to not rape us and expose ourselves for every random person to leer at. We need to be truly liberated. If these girls wearing mini-skirts are advised to wear even the basics of hijab (not niqaab), which is undoubtedly obligatory in major religions, they quickly retort Hijab cannot be forced. We are free to wear whatever we want. Can the same be said about niqaab? Can a woman be forced to unveil while some girls are given the freedom to roam about in mini-skirts? Can the society itself isolate and rebuke niqaabis so much and overlook these girls donning mini-skirts? There has to be more discussions/write-ups revolving around mini-skirt and its effects on the welfare of society. //////All, who take shelter under the flag of Islam, are to carry out several religious duties. Zakat is one of those religious duties, which is a matter of great importance in Islam. It is the third pillar of Islam. In accordance with the teachings of Islam, Zakat stands for regular and mandatory charity, which is given in Allah's name to the poor and the needy by the Muslim community.//////One hundred new cars are hitting city roads every day. After one or two years you will have to keep your cars at home because you will find no space on road. Solution: education online, job online, banking online, medical treatment online, shopping online, marriage online, raising kids online, politics online, voting online and so on. A digital Bangladesh indeed!//////Facebook has revolutionized both the online world and the manner in which people communicate with each other. According to statistics, Facebook has over 350 million active users worldwide. The Facebook craze has affected everyone. Young children, workaholics, CEOs and elderly people have Facebook account. Facebook facilitates communication, helps people find friends, offers enjoyable games and applications and allows individuals to support causes, organizations and activities. Yet, Facebook can be blamed for some negative impacts. Its popularity, accessibility and information vastness produces some undesired effects. Facebook is responsible for depriving its users of privacy. The term 'Facebook addict' has emerged recently. Many people can sincerely confess that they have become addicted to the platform. Facebook's initial idea was to enable people to get in touch with friends and classmates. Seeing that it has great potential, developers soon added various applications to the platform. The aim of these applications is to keep users online for as long as possible. In this manner, developers created a set of games, quizzes and additional enjoyable activities that can turn a regular user into a Facebook addict. Facebook addicts prefer communicating with friends via the website. Offline communication is no longer seen as desirable. People prefer spending time in front of the computer rather than going outside. The fact is that the website has revolutionized the world of communications. Yet, as every new trend, it could be held responsible for distancing people from each other. Just think of how many people find it easier to wish somebody happy birthday using the Facebook wall rather than simply using the phone to call. //////The newspapers reports suggest that a constitution review committee has been formed to examine the possible changes that could be made to return to original 72 constitution.//////Failure in English is a common matter in our country. Our rural students are most affected by this problem. From childhood, the rural students do not get basic knowledge of English. There is a good number of reasons why students of rural areas fail in English. Firstly, English is a foreign language. Rural students do not have the right approach to English. A teacher of rural area can hardly follow a technique. They fail to convince learners that they have to learn four skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). Most of the teachers of rural areas are not competent and trained. //////A dog took away a bit of a poor man's flesh while both were fighting for the same scrap of food . The report says about 120,000 people, most of whom are Toaki, eat rotten foods from dustbins, drink dirty water from water bodies, lack alternative clothes, sleep without a house and suffer from diseases. As a student of Social Welfare, I got a chance to work with such Tokai or Pothokoli and have so far discovered family violence, abandoned by parents, second marriage of mother or father, extreme poverty, trafficking, homelessness caused by river erosion as the causes of their coming to street. But this isn't over. Drug dealers use them for peddling drugs and so-called politicians use them to throw bombs and sometimes shoot them to make an issue of agitation. And thus, they with political backup one day tremor the city as top terrors and drug dealers. Young girls, on the other hand, fall victim to forced prostitution and eventually become an agent of a deadly disease-- HIV/AIDS.//////Nowadays it is so tough for us to be able to identify someone by name alone.

Honestly, closing down schools is a very poor way of dealing with this scenario. //////There is no doubt that cricket is one of the best sources of entertainment in recent times. And tournaments like IPL and airtel T20 cup have added a new dimension to it. It has also created an opportunity for players of different countries to prove their ability. But there is no doubt that Bangladeshi players like Tamim Iqbal or Shakib Al Hasan are better players than many of the players of other countries. //////Law minister Shafique Ahmed's statement that people who exercise state power were involved in corruption sounds as hollow as Prime Minister's repeated warning to BCL. Politicians say one thing and do quite the opposite. Has the government done anything this far to curb corruption ? Given the fact that the government from its inception were busy grabbing the state facilities for its party members, this statement may not be taken seriously. We have seen how they politicised every apparatus of government and used and are now using those to oppress the opposition. Was not the quashing of cases against ruling party members a glaring example of corruption? Thus steeped in corruption, the government has lost the moral courage to launch a campaign against the corruption in customs, ports, taxes, roads, highways, finance, police, bureaucracy , government tenders and other so many sectors. Will not the people rise from the slumber of being accustomed to corruption?//////Bangladesh, a small and developing country, is beset with multiple problems. Among them, eve-teasing, nowadays, has become a talk of the country owing to its injurious effects on women, especially to the teen aged girls. It's obvious that no conscious citizen of our country is unacquainted with this problem created by evil-doers. Whenever, we put our eyes on daily newspapers, we find the news of suicide of any school or college going girl which is the outcome of eve-teasing.//////Nepal's parliament failed to elect a new prime minister for the seventh time yesterday, prolonging a stalemate that has held up vital public spending and threatened the fragile peace process.//////China is seeking to expand its influence in South Asia at India's expense, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned in rare public criticism of his country's main rival for regional resources and geopolitical clout.//////A 24-hour nationwide strike called by trade unions has caused major disruption in parts of India.//////Thousands of Indian police and paramilitary forces enforced a strict curfew in much of Kashmir yesterday after security forces shot dead four protesters, police and witnesses said.//////China yesterday hailed Myanmar as a "friendly neighbour" and warned the world not to meddle in its upcoming election, as the head of the country's military junta was due to arrive for a state visit.//////The Sri Lankan opposition yesterday launched protests in and outside parliament against proposed constitutional amendments that would boost the powers of the president.//////Sri Lanka's Supreme Court has cleared the way for President Mahinda Rajapakse to run for a third term in office, saying the constitution can be changed by a vote in parliament, officials said yesterday.//////The Hollywood film star Angelina Jolie is in Pakistan to draw attention to the plight of flood victims.//////Western powers must change strategy to focus on the "containment" of al-Qaeda and Taliban militants in Afghanistan instead of on failed efforts at nation-building, a leading think-tank said yesterday.//////The US commander of the Afghan war has warned that his troops' lives will be endangered if a Florida evangelical church goes ahead with a planned burning of the Quran on Saturday's 9/11 anniversary.//////Despite the unexpected turn of events during External Affairs Minister S M Krishna's visit to Islamabad, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday said he was still optimistic about the engagement process and hoped that Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi would accept the invitation to visit India.//////Iran said yesterday that it was within its rights to vet UN inspectors who monitor its nuclear facilities after the UN watchdog said its work was being hampered by the barring of some of its staff.//////Australia's controversial mining tax remained alive but open to change yesterday after independent lawmakers crucial to the victory of Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard insisted on a review.//////Save the Children says there have been four million preventable child deaths over the past 10 years because states have failed to help the poorest.//////North Korea requested a shipment of rice, cement and heavy equipment days after rival South Korea offered relief aid to its communist neighbour to help it recover from recent flooding, Seoul's Unification Ministry said yesterday.//////Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he has not ruled out standing for president again at the 2012 elections.//////US President Barack Obama has caused quite a flutter by accusing his Republican opponents of talking about him 'like a dog' at a rally to launch his embattled Democratic party's election campaign.//////Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he has asked the US to settle a dispute with Israel over settlement expansion that is threatening to derail Mideast peace talks.//////The European Union yesterday condemned the stoning to death sentence passed against an Iranian woman convicted for adultery, saying it was "barbaric beyond words."//////Foreign countries should not interfere in Iran's legal system and stop trying to turn the case of a woman sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery into a human rights issue, Tehran said yesterday.//////It is, I suppose our habit to dig out old bones holding memories and sit with them, our emotions licking on the past. This Eid I remember the Eid-ul-Fitr of 2009. At that time I was in Arkansas, USA. That Eid was spent with my son's family. It was also a day that was spent in the company of other Bangladeshi families living there. For the short time I was in Arkansas, I was touched by the hospitality and love of these expatriate families. They may have migrated to another land but they are extremely loyal to their motherland. All of them seemed to be tied by an invisible thread of brotherhood. They were dressed in the traditional clothes and had chalked out the whole day to be spent together. In the morning they went to the mosque to attend the Eid congregation. The day was filled with the spirit of sharing and joy! Different families were hosting breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. It was a special Eid, spent in a distant land and yet smothered with love and unity.//////Eid is an opportune occasion for all.
