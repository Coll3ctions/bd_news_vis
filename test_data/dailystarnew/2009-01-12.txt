The utterly disgraceful and irresponsible acts unleashed before bothering to find out the truth is totally unacceptable and we strongly condemn the occurrence. We fully echo public sentiment in demanding exemplary and demonstrative punishment to the perpetrators of such horrendous acts of vandalism. It is high time zero tolerance was demonstrated to such destructive behaviour by punishing it. //////THE picture carried by this newspaper on the front page of its yesterday's issue spoke volumes about how our children are still being exploited. It showed under-aged children working in a balloon factory and handling hazardous chemicals. It defies all common sense that the young boys are made to work for more than nine hours a day and for less than Taka two hundred a week. For all we know, there are young boys working in lathe factories, ship breaking yards, chemical factories and the like. These young workers are made to work under the most hazardous and most deplorably unhygienic conditions risking their health.//////UNEASY lies the head that wears the crown, so goes the old adage.

Israeli bombardment hits outside a U.N. school where hundreds of Palestinians had sought refuge on Tuesday. Palestinian medics said at least 34 people died. A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and were in pieces many of them were children. It was the second fatal strike, and the deadliest assault since Israel sent ground forces into Gaza last weekend. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed. Ignoring international calls for a cease-fire, Israeli soldiers edged closer to Gaza's major population centres. A total of 58 Palestinians were killed in Tuesday fighting. Many women and children wheeled in, many children were among the dead. Parents slapping their faces in grief, screaming, some of them collapsed to the floor. They knew their children were dead in the morgue; most of them killed appeared to be children. Nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 100 civilians, according to United Nations and the latest Palestinian figures.//////We read a lot about the bright potential of tourism in Bangladesh, but the sector is not taking off since the last two decades (ignoring the first decade after 1971). Why? Neglect by the political regimes; who have other priorities (short-term, not long-term-not allow the completion of a project by the next succeeding regime--credit trade-off).//////The BNP and the Jamaat must have learnt the lesson of history and should objectively review their failure and open up the door for reform. It is time for the Jammat to turn into a democratic minded part, rather than a religion driven ideology based party. The people have spoken against their exploitation of religion. Compared to the Jamaat, the BNP has a harder task to initiate reform in the party. Their dependency on the Jamaat is one of the major causes of their landslide defeat. The BNP will have to consider seriously their political ideology which has gradually turned them against the foundation of a democratic Bangladesh and introduced a big ideological difference with the creation of Bangladesh. This has made the BNP and the Jamaat a divider of the nation-- a bad political strategy followed by these alliance which made Bangladesh an almost failed state. The people have spoken and now accept the verdict gracefully and make self assessment of failure and put all energies to bring reform in the party to survive democratically and not on failed ideology. We hope good sense will prevail and we will see that necessary reform measures will be taken as soon as possible. The Jamaat has a simple task. The people have cut them to size. Now it is time to stand on democratic values, rather than on politics of religion.//////I have lived in the UK virtually all my life. What I have seen at the conclusion of general elections here is that the defeated leaders always resign. It is a way of conceding that they have failed the party and also that they are bowing to the will of the people. //////Nearly two hundred innocent people including women & children were killed in Mumbai on 26th November '08 by the militant fanatics. Some months back in Assam seventy innocent people were killed in market places in bomb explosion. Twin-tower in the USA or Bali club in Indonesia, Marriott Hotel in Pakistanthe victims are only innocent people which can be termed as "wanton killing" but in the holy name of Islam. //////December 29, polling day, was a historic day. The election took place peacefully with a huge turnout. And the AL bagged most of the seats in the election. Since the beginning of democracy through the election in 1991, it would be the highest number of seats in parliament for a single party. Such landslide victory has opened up a window of opportunity for the AL to run the country efficiently towards better democracy in future. //////A strict electoral code of conduct imposed by the Election Commission (EC) forced all candidates to behave and pursue their campaigns in a decent manner. But the news came just a day after the election that the cadres of a BNP leader in Chittagong intimidated and tortured the minority people and burnt out a house at Nanpur village in Fatikchhari for creating panic and preventing people from casting their votes. It is quite unacceptable that such incidents are still taking place in Bangladesh. //////What is happening in Gaza, the monstrous way Israel is behaving is unbelievable. We are watching the carnage with deep anguish, innocent people including children and women are dying in hordes. The scene is heart rending.//////In the recently held election, the AL won absolute majority, which is no doubt the reply of the people against the misdeeds of the BNP -Jamaat rule. But we will miss a strong opposition and parliament will lose its attraction to a great extent. Absolute majority often leads to autocratic behaviour. Newaz Sharif of Pakistan won two-thirds majority but his misdeeds created the conditions for Pervez Mosharraf's entry into power/politics of that country. Immediately after independence, the AL also obtained the same majority but they had to form BAKSAL which did not meet with popular endorsement. After getting such majority, the BNP-Jamaat forgot everything and tried to have control over every sector and people rejected them by eliminating them from power.//////The attitude of Rajuk has been expressed clearly in regard to fake TIN. The generous intention has been highlighted in all the dailies. Fake TINs are those which have been manufactured and have got no legal support. Rajuk has expressed its intention to cancel allotment of the plots to those who used fake TIN.//////The nation is in hysteria with the landslide mandate that one party received in national elections. The media, both electronic & print, are abuzz with the excitement of experiencing a 'free' and 'fair' election. The spontaneity of the voters is also being praised. The CHANGE we have been looking for in the last two years, the 'din bodoler pala' we have been eagerly awaiting has finally arrived. ...Or, has it?//////It has been a hard fought two years for some. The EC has done a good job. We should appreciate CEC ATM Shamsul Huda, Commissioner Shakhawat Hussain and Commissioner M Sohul Hussain and all other EC officials for the service they have rendered to the nation. //////We know that after 1/11/2007 the present caretaker govt. took charge of Bangladesh. The main duty of this govt. was to hold a free, fair election. They achieved their goal in on 29 December, 2008. They formed an efficient Election Commission and this Commission organised a black money free, fair election. Voters went to the polling centres without any fear and the turnout was 87 percent, which broke all the previous records. //////It is the greatest moment for the many who lived through the tumultuous days of Bangabandhu's uncompromising and unyielding role, that he played for the emancipation and freedom of his beloved Bangalees from the clutches of Pakistanis, and for those still alive by His mercy to see Bangabandhu's daughter Sheikh Hasina trying to translate Bangabandhu's hopes and aspirations for Sonar Bangla into a reality. Sheikh Hasina again made herself uniquely and unequivocally popular to the people of Bangladesh, irrespective of their cast, creed, race or religion, poor or rich which has been impeccably reflected in the 29th December election giving her a grand victory. So our mirth and measure of delight knows no bounds, and I, on behalf of my family and friends, convey to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina my heartiest congratulations and felicitations. //////A letter under the above heading was published in The Daily Star on 5 Jan 09. The letter was highly rated and was very popular with the readers.//////My heartiest congratulations to you and your team on winning the election with such a huge mandate. I also second the opinion of those who say that this election is comparable to the election your father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won in 1970. That too was in the month of December. Had my father been alive, he too would have been a very proud citizen today. The people have indeed spoken clearly. This election has been a verdict against unbridled corruption that has taken endemic proportions in our society. //////How to prevent arms smuggling along the porous border between Gaza and Egypt is at the heart of talks that Cairo is conducting on ending Israel's deadly war on Hamas, officials say.//////US president-elect Barack Obama said in an interview broadcast yesterday he will create a special team that will engage in Middle East peace efforts immediately after he takes office on January 20. //////The only way for Hamas to salvage the Gaza war is to lure Israeli troops into street battles in the crowded enclave's myriad backstreets and hope the toll rises, analysts say.//////Sri Lanka soldiers captured a Tamil Tiger training camp as government troops pressed ahead with their offensive against the guerrillas in the country's embattled north, the military said yesterday.//////An Indonesian passenger ferry sank in a storm Sunday with around 250 passengers and 17 crew onboard after being battered by seven-foot (two-meter) waves, officials and witnesses said.//////The United States of America's Ambassador to India David Mulford does not agree with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh statement that Pakistani state agencies were involved in planning and executing the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.//////Tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied across Europe on Saturday to call for an end to Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip.//////US vice president-elect Joe Biden and President Hamid Karzai met for several hours Saturday, discussing all aspects of US help for Afghanistan's efforts to fight extremists and rebuild, an official said.//////Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip is boosting the popularity of Hamas and other Islamic groups in the Arab world where people are dismayed by the passiveness of their regimes, analysts said yesterday.//////Britain's Prince Harry has apologised for using racist language after a Sunday newspaper reported he had filmed himself calling an army colleague a "Paki" and telling another he looked like a "raghead".//////Thais voted in parliamentary by-elections Sunday in the first test of political strength for Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's ruling coalition since it took power in December after months of unrest.//////President-elect Barack Obama said he expected to "move swiftly" to engage Iran, whose nuclear quest he said would be one of his administration's biggest challenges.//////Pakistani helicopter gunships yesterday shelled radical Muslim militant hideouts in the remote northwest, where nine people were killed in weekend sectarian clashes, a local official said.//////Allies of embattled Jharkhand Chief Minister Shibu Soren have demanded that he quit immediately to clear the political uncertainity following his failure to enter the state assembly.//////Who has not heard or read fairy tales in childhood?

The high-turnout election also saw Bangladeshi voters turn away from the BNP and its alliance partner, Jamaat-e-Islami. //////WHO among us is silent today? Silence is unadulterated culpability. Yet, rejecting the Israeli terrorisation of 1.5 million residents of Gaza should not have to mean supporting Hamas. Censure of the destruction wrought by the IDF does not indicate that there is no problem of Islamic extremism, or that democracy is flourishing in Arab societies. Why are people not allowed to reject terrorism and dictatorship, while also disapproving of the wholesale neglect of human rights by the Israeli government? //////I hate to quote people I do not particularly admire. But Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has put me into a situation when I have to do exactly that. So I will quote Mr. Donald Rumsfeld, former US Secretary of State: "There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't know." This is how I feel about Sheikh Hasina's new cabinet line up. //////US President George W. Bush is shortly to hang up his holster.
