The coastal region of a country has to face tremendous drinking water crisis, as most of the water available is saline. In Bangladesh 19 out of 64 districts are in proximity to the Bay of Bengal. The chief difficulty in the development of appropriate water supply system for the communities in the affected area is that deep aquifers containing sweet water are not found at all possible locations in the coastal region. One of the most convenient options to ensure potable water is to make use of the abundant source of seawater and brackish water. One may think it to be insane - drinking a glass of seawater! Well, to bring down the salinity under specified limit, desalination is widely practised all over the world. Ways of desalination are many. The conventional methods of desalination of salt waters to produce fresh water such as distillation, electrolysis and reverse osmosis are intensive energy techniques. Due to increasing energy costs and declining energy sources, there is a growing interest in the use of low cost technologies. //////A Primordial Black Hole (PBH) is a hypothetical black hole that may have formed in the early, highly compressed stages of the Universe immediately after the big bang.

In that condition, simple fluctuation in the density of matters may have resulted in local regions to get dense enough to create black holes. It is thought that due to the expansion of the Universe, most regions of high density quickly dispersed. However, primordial black hole would still be stable and exist till date. //////Tiny sharks about the size of a human hand have a superpower of sorts: their bellies glow, according to new research that also showed these smalleye pygmy sharks use the glow to hide from predators lurking below.//////Scientists have discovered skeletons in the cyanobacterial closet.
