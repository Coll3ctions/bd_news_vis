At the same time new local investors are finding the bureaucratic formalities for obtaining relevant papers, often from the capital city of Dhaka, taking a toll on their energy and time. It is therefore not unusual that top business leaders of Chittagong would bemoan that if locals feel their enthusiasm waning fast then how can we ever attract foreign investors to the country? Surely such detrimental factors are standing in the way towards the desired growth of industries in the region.//////Although in terms of some social indicators, Bangladesh has been faring well in comparison with her South Asian neighbours, especially in the area of child immunisation, quite ironically, however, the mortality rate among the just born is quite high.

With all the eloquence and concern at their command, reference has been made by our guardians to the sterling performance of the London Metropolitan Police (fondly called 'Bobbies' in remembrance of Sir Robert Peel, the founder of London Metropolitan Police) for emulation and endearment to the community. One would very surely get moved upon hearing the virtues of the 'Bobbies', and wish if only our folks spoke and behaved the same way.//////Former Russian spy Aleksander Litvinenko's recent death from radiation poisoning in London and assassination of prominent Kremlin opponents have reinforced a growing Western perception that President Putin's Russia is abandoning the West. The USA in particular, is also beginning to consider that, as in the days of the Cold War, Russia is setting itself up as a serious rival to its agenda of spreading its version of 'freedom and democracy' around the world. This view has also been reinforced by the manner in which Russia has been using its control over natural resources to convey its viewpoint. Examples of this have been seen during the crisis over Russian gas deliveries to Ukraine in early 2006 and in its decision to challenge western participation in several major oil and gas exploration projects, notably Sakhalin-2, and its prominent support for separatist rebels in Georgia and Moldova.//////Recently the result of a survey conducted by the New York based world renowned Forbes Magazine published in a number of national dailies (The Daily Star December 28, 2007) has caused a stirring among the NGOs and conscious readers.

It may not be in April or May as anticipated earlier, but it looks like taking place in October-November. The political situation in the country is developing in such a way that the ruling Congress may itself dissolve parliament and opt for the polls.

I came face to face with a woman my age and we began talking. We both said that we found each other very familiar and yet we couldn't recall where we had met. Were we in the same school? No, we weren't. Were we in the same college? No, we weren't. Did we meet when we were both studying abroad? Certainly not. Then where had we met? I know for a fact, that we have met before, she said. There was something uncannily familiar about her so I said, I know that we have spent a lot of time together. Then suddenly, it fell into place and we both asked, Did you play cricket in Bibekananda Park? Of course, I did we both exclaimed. So that's where we met!!//////Pakistan is still reeling from the shock, violence, uncertainty, accusations and counter-accusations that have followed Benazir Bhutto's horrific assassination.

The book is now being rushed into print and will be released in February.

Syed has little patience with the proponents of radical Islam, those whose view of the faith embraces some of the most conservative, indeed fanatic assessments of the position Muslim women should hold in society. The increasing alarm that in recent times has been raised over such issues as the use of the niqab and hijab by Muslim women does not, for the writer, emphasise the core of the Islamic faith and indeed goes against history. Not for him the bigotry which has long characterised (and still does characterise) the status of women in Islam. Not for him, therefore, an acquiescence in the thought that women in Islam belong in one place, in this instance the four walls of a male-dominated home. //////A common allegation against physicians in Bangladesh is that they do not discharge their professional responsibilities with a mind of service to humanity, which their profession is meant for. Maybe it is not applicable to all physicians but it is true of a large number of them. There are multifarious reasons for this. As a nation we lack a humanitarian service-rendering tradition; many physicians coming out of poverty-ridden families set money-making as their only goal in life; at the institutional level it is not ensured that physicians will come to patients' service whenever and however necessary; ethics of medical practice are not inculcated properly in a physician's mind; and a wave of capitalism has driven medical practitioners into a rat race for material gains. It is undoubtedly a sorry state of affairs. //////The roots of Kenya's current, sad situation---tribalism and corruption---can be identified in M. G. Vassanji's haunting novel, The In-Between World of Vikram Lall. As the narrator remarks late in the story, The wealthy and the powerful desired no changes. African leaders, reluctant to give up their power, will often do anything (rigged elections, constitutional changes) in order to remain in office. Corruption is often endemic and designed to keep the Big Man's supporters happy; tribalism often impinges on other groups, as in Kenya's situation, because of the significant settler communities of Asians and Europeans.//////No, the woman wasn't made of stone but the stone showed fading traces of a woman who probably was a pagan goddess. And it is to her that the novel's characters disgorge their secrets it must be her silence that made her a worthy listener.//////One of the more authentic approaches to the study of a region and a culture distinctive in its many patterns, this book is the dream of any pupil of Middle Eastern history.
