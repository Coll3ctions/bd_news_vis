members with due solemnity. It remains our belief, as well as that of everyone else who believes in decency and a sense of morality, that the murder of the nation's founding father was a terrible blow to our self-esteem as a nation and to the fabric of our national politics. The question of politics apart, the fact is that throughout his life Bangabandhu symbolised for us the struggle that needed to go, and indeed did go, into the emergence of a people ready and willing to make supreme sacrifices in defence of collective national dignity. When he was cut down on August 15, 1975, it was not merely the fall of an individual but the collapse, however temporarily, of a symbol as well.//////THE EC's move to have tax, wealth and police records of the winners at the city corporation and municipality polls probed by the NBR and the police department for their veracity is a move we support. Set against the backdrop of a universal public demand for a break with the past in terms of having public representatives with clean records and reported apprehensions that persons with dubious distinctions might have crept back into reckoning, this measure by the EC should be helpful in clearing the air of any misgiving. In fact, this step will strengthen newly elected leaders to carry out their task, assuming that they come clean.//////BANGABANDHU Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, with most members of his family, was gunned down in the pre-dawn hours of August 15, 1975. When daylight broke, it was an eerie scene at 32 Dhanmondi, the spot that had been witness to so much of history in the lives of the people of Bangladesh. Bangabandhu's body, as also those of everyone else, lay where they had fallen the whole day and the night that followed. Soldiers swarmed everywhere. Cameramen, all serving the government at different points, were brought in to record what remains the most gruesome episode in the history of Bangladesh. It was not until the next day that most of the dead were buried in Banani. //////IT was Friday, August 15, 1975. It was one of the most tragic days of our history. It reminded us of the dark night of March 25, 1971. The Father of the Nation, loved and respected in Bangladesh and the world over as a great hero, lay dead on the stairs of his famous residence at Road Number 32, Dhanmandi Residential Area. He was only fifty-five. We were twenty-year-old sophomores of Dhaka University. //////"After the torchlight red on sweaty faces//////After the frosty silence in the gardens//////After the agony in stone places//////The shouting and the crying //////Prison and palace and reverberations//////Of thunder of spring over distant mountains//////He who was living is now dead ..." //////What the Thunder said -- T.S.

We often find them as a rickshaw-puller, table boy at restaurant, labourer in construction sites, worker in factories, hawker, etc. To eliminate this inhuman phenomenon, many NGOs are working hard, but they have not achieved much so far. The number of working children is increasing day by day. //////I am a regular commuter of the city bus service, both public and private. For a number of reasons, the authorities concerned should pay more attention to make it user friendly. The city buses simply do not park in the bus terminal or the space designated. Most of them tend to park in the middle of the road and create severe traffic congestion. //////The major environmental concerns for Bangladesh are deforestation, deterioration of water quality, natural disasters, land degradation, salinity, unplanned urbanisation, discharge of untreated sewage, industrial sewage and so on. //////Russia is trying to regain its lost position.

Their arrival at Zia International Airport was after midnight. My son went to receive them, and the driver was on the wheel. Since the driver lives in Gazipur and we live in Gulshan, my son decided to drop him near the bus stop a little distance away from the airport, thinking he would reach home quicker. There the driver got into a baby-taxi ready to leave with three other passengers for Gazipur. Hardly the taxi was in motion when our driver lost consciousness, only to discover himself the next day lying in a field and so were the other two passengers, with their money and belongings gone. //////Professor Mozaffar Ahmed, a distinguished personality, while commenting on the just concluded mayoral and pourashava elections, has reportedly opined that even though the election was peaceful and fair, the expectation of bringing in honest and competent people could not be fulfilled. Yes, we believe, we need honest and competent leaders, but how could we bring them in and elect them if they do not surface and contest in the election and reveal their honesty and clean past? People will not go to search for them, they will have to come and tell the people that they are honest and competent.//////In the mid-sixties, during my short stint as a lecturer in one of the premier colleges of our country, what I experienced is worth remembering in retrospect even after a lapse of about half a century, particularly in the present social context. In those days, except the vernacular subject, teachers used to deliver class lectures in English. Students generally were comfortable with the language. Their verbal presentation of the subject matter in English was quite satisfactory. In the educated segment of society a good number of people used to read, write and often speak English. Civil servants, especially those at the helm, were at ease with the English language. Their conference speech, press briefing etc were a matter of treat, often punctuated with wit and humour.//////It is great news for Asians that the Olympic Games are being held in Asia. We should feel proud of China. //////If Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University is SAU, then what will be the abbreviation of Sylhet Agricultural University?

But it would have been nicer if you mentioned that the unscrupulous manpower recruiting agencies need to be brought to justice. They are really the enemies of our motherland.//////A few weeks back, I was watching a television programme on carrier building. An FCA mentioned that there were around 12,000 posts of qualified Chartered Accountants available in different industrial, commercial, trade and other organisations in Bangladesh. On the other hand, less than 1,100 qualified Chartered Accountants were available in the country. It is known to people concerned that thousands of educated youths are suffering due to unemployment or underemployment. Moreover, the requirement of qualified Chartered Accountants will increase with the expansion of business ventures in the years to come. The service of a professional Chartered Accountant is very much essential to management people who make decisions and to maintain financial discipline in any organisation. //////It is highly regrettable that the teachers of Rajshahi University were assaulted by Shibir men. Last month, a freedom fighter was assaulted by Shibir activists.//////This refers to the UNB report on experts' views on solving city water and sanitation problems in an integrated manner, published in a local daily on 7 August. The basic idea is to recycle the sanitation waste into potable water as practised in Singapore which has a totalitarian type of administration with strict control on everything. Further, Singapore has the reputation of having one of the highest quality standards in the world based on strict and uncompromising technical discipline. //////Recently two autonomous bodies have been established with a view to dealing with corruption and malpractice of the people, politicians, and govt. officials involved in accumulation of wealth illegally. Hence, these two statutory bodies, Truth Commission and the ACC, have been formed to address these issues efficiently.//////I would request you to run a feature on the government's negligence on infrastructure development of higher education institutions in Barisal division.

Adulteration of food is a very old practice of the dishonest traders. They were more or less mixing water with milk, adding lower grade oil with mustard oil etc. in the past. These were not that much harmful to health. But now very harmful chemicals are mixed with foodstuff by the sellers for various reasons. These chemicals cause different diseases and may lead to death. ////// I'm writing on behalf of a team of 3 BUET Architecture Department graduates.

Only law graduates were benefited.//////This refers to a letter of Prof. SAM on the subject in a national daily on 11 August 2008.//////The Supreme Court Bar Association has complained that the judicial magistrates are 'still acting under the directives of the executive' (The Daily Star, 7 January, 2008): a serious allegation indeed! It was hoped that after the separation of judicial magistracy from the executive, the 'impartial justice' would be established and people would get direct relief, as the luminous beginning impressed us in November, 2007. From the above report of the DS, it seems that in Bangladesh 'separation' could not ensure the 'independence' of the judiciary.

The result of this round will be aired on Sunday at 9:30pm. //////Dreamworks is in talks to make a sequel to animated film //////, the movie studio has confirmed.//////AUGUST 1975 was a transitional time in Bangladesh. Mujib was making radical administrative changes and adopting measures that would have a tremendous social impact. There was only one political party in the country now -- the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL). BAKSAL on which all sections of the people, including the armed forces and the police, were represented, would be an integral part of the administration. The importance of bureaucrats would diminish, when the governors-designate of the districts took up their new offices on 1 September 1975. The army was to be split and made to join in productive work at the district level. It was a revolutionary step.//////WHAT was he then? An angel? A superman? Or what? He was none of the kind. He was rather something which very few of us in the country could ever be. He was a total human being with all the qualities of head and heart. A tremendously amiable disposition with his whole existence deeply planted into the alluvial soil of Bangladesh. That was precisely why he couldn't don the personality of a so-called 'gentleman' with double standards. Very truly he was an integral part of the land, its hopes and aspirations.//////A few days ago, in a general knowledge competition, a secondary school student was asked who had made the statement: "Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistan." He thought a little and knitting his brows answered confidently: "Moulana Bhasani." Somewhat taken aback, the questioner gave him another chance, which one of his teammates grabbed and replied rather more assuredly: "It's Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman." The shrewd questioner did not go any further. There was no reaction among the students. //////Energy is the ultimate essence of life itself. Unfortunately, due to increased demand, it is slowly becoming very limited in supply, which is probably one of the evils of modern technology. This, combined with the impact of global warming has necessitated the need for energy conservation and use of renewable energy sources.//////The 2008 Summer Olympics is on full throttle in Beijing and the Chinese government has vowed to make it the most perfect and secure game ever. From making exceptional moves like taking technological help from different non-Chinese companies to the attempt of ensuring a no-rain weather in Beijing, this Olympics is much more than sports alone.//////Samsung Electronics in a glamorous event on August 9 at the Celebrity Hall of Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Center launched three new advanced LCD monitors T Monitor, Myst Plus and Lime and two new products Projectors and Thin Client.//////The new version of Bangladeshdir.com, a website founded by a group of Bangladeshi students in 2005, has been launched with more improved structure and new features. //////INTEL Corp. is unveiling new technology that will let computers wake up from their power-saving sleep state when they receive a phone call over the Internet.//////
