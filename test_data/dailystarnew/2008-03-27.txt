Such national resolve to uphold the principles of the War of Liberation surely augurs well for our future. We note here the rekindling of the old wartime spirit in recent weeks among the people of Bangladesh by such bodies as the Sector Commanders' Forum. Other organisations have also been active in shaping public opinion on such issues as preventing war criminals from taking part in politics and so recreating the ambience in which we waged our war for freedom in 1971. All these bodies, the patriotic men and women behind them, certainly deserve our collective gratitude for the awareness of history they have caused among all of us again. It is thanks to them that today public consciousness of the spirit of the War of Liberation is resurgent. We now build on the momentum to forge ahead.//////AGAINST the background of rising crime and proliferation of criminal networks across the country, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) came into being four years ago to turn the tide on lawlessness. The battalion within no time busted a number of networks of anti-social elements that have been engaged in smuggling, women and child trafficking and organising various other nefarious activities. We believe their biggest success came when they netted the ring-leaders of some terrorist groups and handed them over to the police. RAB's success in penetrating the dens of the dangerously armed and motivated obscurantist elements got words of praise from all quarters. Such focused and unrelenting operations by RAB did counterbalance the modus operandi of criminals and helped in creating a favourable law and order ambience in society to a large extent.//////I feel humbled and inadequate to bear the weight of the Swadhinata Puraskar.

He was giving legal advice to another friend about the vacation of a court injunction. His ancestral land on the North South Road near Bangshal cross-roads has been forcibly occupied by a thuggish city commissioner who is absconding. //////ONE way to understand Bangladesh today after 37 years of her independence is to look at it as an interesting paradox. Bangladesh has made some headway in economic development. Today's sky-high prices of basic necessities combined with a sluggish economy with low purchasing power of the average people should not negate the tangible achievements in the economic development of the country. The economic difficulties which are results of unfavorable global economy combined with bad planning aggravated by some bad weather situations are not intractable. Bangladesh has experienced increase in real per capita income however measured -- in purchasing power parity or by conventional methods. //////ON special days like Independence or Victory days, repeated lamentations on erosion of the spirit of independence since the post-Mujib era have become a clich. To the new generations, especially to many members of the post-liberation generation, this simplistic notion has no special appeal at all. Rather, to them, the spirit of liberation signifies some nostalgic slogans of some members of the older generation. //////SET aside any notion that Asians have no sense of humour. We have a sharp eye for the absurd. "Life being what it is in Asia, we have the choice of laughing or crying, so we may as well laugh," said reader Ameena Chowdhury.
