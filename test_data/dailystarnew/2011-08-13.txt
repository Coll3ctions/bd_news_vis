But now this doesn't hold good. Cumulative lack of maintenance for years has stripped away the advantage. Whatever went in the name of maintenance was patch-work. The money allocated to maintenance is also paltry vis--vis requirement. The upshot is a bonfire of corruption with the little there is instead of any serious repair.//////There remains little doubt that the dynamic role played by the leading non-government organizations (NGOs) in the development sectors of Bangladesh has lifted our status in diverse areas. These include primary and adult education, health, social awareness, poverty alleviation, women empowerment and disaster management. //////Brian Vitori's excellent debut act exposed the Tigers' myth about themselves and their lack of staying power as Zimbabwe cruised to a four-wicket victory by reaching their target in 41.2 overs, with 52 balls to spare in the first one-dayer at the Harare Sports Club yesterday. //////Zimbabwe's discernible initial approach pushed the Tigers' top-order batsmen on to the backfoot, said coach Stuart Law.

The original 1960s series, starring Elizabeth Montgomery as the nose-wrinkling housewife witch, ran for eight seasons and was a huge hit, Contactmusic reported.//////On August 3rd last, Syed Bardul Ahsan, Editor, Current Affairs, 'The Daily Star,' drew our attention to the corrosion in our supposedly democratic dispensation and candidly observed "unless the state swings into action to reform the minds and attitudes of those it employs to provide security to the nation, we will all be headed for a catastrophic point of no return." Admittedly, these are strong words of caution and premonition and surely do not bode well for our fledgling democracy.//////When India and Pakistan are celebrating their 64th independence anniversaries, the scions of the two dominating families are also happily entering adulthood in political arena. Rahul Gandhi in India and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Pakistan are equally conscious of their dynastic clout that gives them the power and privileges they have come to enjoy without holding any government office.//////If a country wants social and economic development it will have to break away from its orthodox and backward mould, and education is a vital tool to achieve that. In these tumultuous times, marked by crisis, division, conflict, and fast deterioration of the value system, educational institutions are the heart of the nation and vital to its well-being and progress.//////Irrespective of social class, women in Bangladesh suffer inequality throughout their lives. Empowerment, equity, MDGs are all buzzwords that we use at various seminars, meetings and talk shows. No matter what term is used, the bottom line is that we want man and woman to be equal and live in a society where both sexes are able to take responsible decisions about what is best for them in a particular situation. To achieve this goal, the government has taken initiatives to increase a girl child's access to education and job opportunities and laws have been enacted to give women strong legal support. //////IT'S EXAM RESULTS WEEK. Grades are being announced.//////If you're a straight A student, you're fine. For the rest of us, let me tell you a true story.//////My dear old dad gave me some advice when I was 15.//////Five coal fields have so far been discovered in Bangladesh having substantial amount of bituminous to sub bituminus coal. Out of five coal fields, Barapukuria is in production and its coal is being used for power plant while Phulbari and Khalashpeer coalfields are expected to undergo in production in near future. Barapukuria coal based power plant is producing reasonable amount of high quality non-toxic fly ash. Proper fly ash capturing, storing, utilisation and proper management can turn it into a resource that can change the future of Bangladesh.//////Most of the cyclones bred in the Bay rush to Bangladesh coast. With extreme poverty and less infrastructural development, the coastal zone habitats can't cope with the impact of disasters that ultimately result in massive loss of life and property and damage of environment. //////Shamsur Rahman, the doyen of Bangla poetry, breathed his last on August 17, 2006. No death ever made me sadder. //////William Shakespeare's faculty of delving deep into the labyrinthine and tortuous intricacies of the human mind has amazed readers as well as theatergoers for more than four hundred years and will do so for many more centuries to come. His portraits of Hamlet, King Lear, Cleopatra, Portia, Othello, and Macbeth all attest to his genius for reaching into the depths of the soul and emerge with its quintessence for all to analyse. But Shakespeare also excelled at identifying and describing the afflictions of the body, such as scurvy, gout, epilepsy, rheumatism, and venereal disease. Each of these afflictionsand scores moresicken the kings and commoners of his plays; they are like the Furies of the Greek Myths reincarnated to torment Medieval and Renaissance England. //////'Where, please?' you enquired //////But didn't expect any answer //////I knew //////O dear friends!//////Our lives blossom barely once//////With night falling and day returning//////The alteration of events happens//////That you can't predict//////One in every five people in the world is an adolescent, and 85 percent of them live in developing countries. Nearly two thirds of premature deaths and one third of the total disease burden in adults are associated with conditions or behaviours that began in youth, including tobacco use, lack of physical activity, unprotected sex or exposure to violence. Promoting healthy practices during adolescence, and efforts that better protect this age group from risks will ensure longer, more productive lives for a future nation.//////Everyday we are exposed to sound-words of a loved one; our favourite music or even basic sounds like the rain transform moments into memories. Hearing is the key to our relationships and our social activities. Despite hearing being such an integral part of our life, many of us, especially children suffering from hearing loss are detected late due to lack of awareness.//////Mothers often ask child specialists whether they should continue breastfeed their babies during fasting hours in holy Ramadan or not? Most of them believe that the production of breast milk reduces during fasting. So they seek advice to add food supplement or formula milk instead or in addition to breast milk during that period.//////Turmeric and cinnamon could neutralise the negative impact of high-fat meals, according to a recent study by Penn State University. Normally, when you eat a high-fat meal, you end up with high levels of triglycerides, a type of fat, in your blood. If this happens too frequently, or if triglyceride levels are raised too much, your risk of heart disease increases. Researchers found that adding spices to a high-fat meal reduced triglyceride response by about 30 percent, compared to a similar meal with no spices added. The findings are reported in the current issue of The Journal of Nutrition. Spices like rosemary, oregano, cinnamon, turmeric, black pepper, cloves, garlic powder and paprika have potent antioxidant activity. When the meal contained a blend of antioxidant spices, antioxidant activity in the blood was increased by 13 percent and insulin response decreased by about 20 percent. Taste the spice when you with fatty meal.//////All patients getting cancer treatment should be told to do two and a half hours of physical exercise every week, says a report by Macmillan Cancer Support. Research shows that exercise can reduce the risk of dying from cancer and minimise the side effects of treatment.//////Parents-to-be wanting to find out their baby's gender can be assured that a blood test on the mother gives an accurate result, say scientists. The tests, which look for foetal DNA in the mother's blood, are sold privately in many countries, including the UK.//////Various international channels and websites informed us what had actually happened in the capital of peace so far. The first concern of the people and Media was to identify the perpetrators of Norway's shooting and bombing attacks. We know that if the criminal was Arab or Muslim, once again the eyes of the world would turn towards the Middle East peace and 'democratic will' of the majority of the population. That the confessed murderer, but unrepentant, is a Norwegian neo-fascist and supporter of ethnic cleansing does not diminish the gravity to attack. The far-right terrorist Anders Breivik had a grim purpose: to draw attention to the growing rejection of the European population to foreigners (especially Muslims) entering their countries. They get great benefits, manage work and education for their children, they try to maintain respect for their cultures and traditions, which is not appreciated by some Norwegians -- though the immigrants are following the law of the host country. //////The Brahmaputra river, which is called Yarlung Tsangpo by the Tibetans and Tsan-Po by the Chinese, is the soul of India. It is the lifeline for those living in Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Assam. People in this region largely depend on the river for irrigation, fishing and transportation of goods.//////London -- With 10,000 additional police officers deployed across London on Tuesday night, looting and arson dipped sharply from the anarchic scenes that shook Britain over the previous three days, even as violence ticked up again in several other major cities, including Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool.////// Tahmima Anam's glorious second novel, The Good Muslim, follows her earlier one (A Golden Age) as the centre volume of a projected trilogy. Readers who did not read the first novel will find the second one totally satisfying, with no confusion. It is a credit to any writer of sequel novels to make them self-contained. If these first two are indications of her enormous talent (and, indeed, they are), Anam has already staked out her claim: Bangladesh, in the years immediately and after its bloody war for independence. Politics, yes, but the human dimension is always central, particularly as it relates to past debts and traumas.//////Only a literary genius would venture into developing a character of a social misfit for physical or psychological reasons. Dostoyevsky created The Idiot and Victor Hugo immortalized The Hunchback Of Notre Dame. There are others, but for Syed Manzurul Islam to embark on a narrative through the eyes of a man who is of unknown birth with ghoulish deformity (a hole for a mouth) needs to be applauded because it demands an awful lot of insight into and empathy with human character. Songs of Our Swampland could feature as a literary masterpiece or the adventure of a human soul in accompanying another soul through the inner journeys of humanity. The events and characters of the book unfold as the liberation war of Bangladesh progresses from early days to victory.//////There are books you want to finish reading, often in a frenzy as it were. Part of the reading is associated with deadlines set by the library you have borrowed some books from, part from a natural desire in you to finish one book before you can lay your grasping hands on another. Desire, ladies and gentlemen, is not merely linked to the pleasures of the flesh or the greed for worldly possessions. It comes, in huge dollops, to those who think of the world as one gigantic library. Read, said God to His Prophet. Reading ought to be digested and chewed, averred Bacon. George Washington thought that the knowledge of books was the basis on which the world stood firmly. Read, said my uncle to me when I was barely out of nursery class. Read, said a recently deceased colleague of my father's on a blustery winter's day forty six years ago as he pushed a weighty encyclopaedia into my hands. //////
