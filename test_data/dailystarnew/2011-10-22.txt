But human-induced global warming-led climate change is now a great issue of concern as with the passage of time it is being exposed in front of us as a crude reality and is showing its increased damaging effect on human beings, biodiversity etcetera. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) defines climate change as the change resulting from long term direct and indirect activities, that induces changes in the compared time which are much more than the natural change.

What is left is the expression of his emotions that sways between hope and despair. And he has expressed his feelings by blending them somewhat with poetical and oblique expressions. Even though Borges has provided an indication of his delight and gripping experience of reading one or two works of Rabindranath, he has given no definite reason for such expressions. It appears that Borges had chained all his superficial expressions to negations, anchored in fathomless depths. The main reason may have been the sharp differences between the artistic nature of Rabindranath and that of Borges. But through these comments Borges did not fully expose the differences between their literary tastes. He did it at a much later stage. //////Osteoporosis is a condition in which bone density decreases and becomes porous leading to frequent fractures.
