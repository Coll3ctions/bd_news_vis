However, the rules of society also contain a set of procedures, the rules for both creating and amending legislation and electing a legislature for changing these societal rules: hence society determines the law.//////The last round of nuclear negotiations with Iran ended in stalemate, and prospects appear dim for a breakthrough at the next meeting in Moscow.//////In a written interview German Federal Foreign Minister Dr. Guido Westerwelle gives his views to Rezaul Karim, Diplomatic Correspondent of The Daily Star, about bilateral development cooperation, German investment in Bangladesh, shipbuilding industry, development of private sector etc. He also talks about troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, economic recession in Europe and rising economy of China and India.

High enrolment in primary education and dazzling pass rates and results in SSC and HSC make us happy. But there are big dark patches that prevent us from being euphoric. The high drop-out rate and steadily falling quality of our education are the dangers that have to be taken into account seriously. One of the main causes of these is lack of quality teachers. //////Thirty four years ago on June 23, the sacred ashes of the mortal remains of ever immortal Atish Dipankar Srigana were handed over by China to Bangladesh.

But for the river Norai running through Khilgaon thana, it is only a tale of tethers tethers of pollution and neglect. Once a free river, the Norai now groans under the weight of waste. Drooping Heejol trees on the river bank pensively peering down at their reflections, lush fields, quaint houses, shrubs and thickets of reeds running along the river course remind of a serene natural beauty now marred by stinking, thick, oily, black solution of waste and water that flows through the Norai river. The Norai is now a case of acute environmental catastrophe a river that breathes fire!//////Almost 400 years after his death the works of Shakespeare show little sign of losing their popularity. Rather the reverse, perhaps, in a year when he is repeatedly both re-written and performed in his original state for television and radio, and produced in his entirety by the RSC at Stratford, with a variety of movies in a variety of costumes and periods. Love him or hate him, it seems Shakespeare is still inspiring passion and firing debate not only in England and America but all over the world, including Bangladesh. A discussion on the relevance of Shakespeare in today's world is undeniable. A reader or a theatergoer does have to be neither a Bardolater nor a Shakesperoid or buff to have delight and wisdom while enjoying his plays or discussions on him.//////Monument of James Princep //////I had the privilege of closely knowing Professor Jahangir Tareque since 1965 when he joined Chittagong College as a lecturer in Bengali. I had joined the same college a year earlier. During those days Chittagong College was one of the biggest and best colleges in the then East Pakistan, having more than one hundred teachers at various levels and with Honours courses in several disciplines. Locally it was known as B.A. College. Some fifteen fresh graduates from Dhaka and Rajshahi joined the college in 1964. Some of those who had joined earlier two to three years back belonged to the same age group. Thus, young teachers constituted a significantly large group with close and cordial relationship among them. During off-time we used to meet in the teachers' room. Sometimes we used to go to the seaside or on picnics, no matter whether it was winter or summer. //////Although Bangladesh has made a commendable success in reducing child mortality, the rate of neonatal death (death within 28 days of birth) is still quite high and one of the major obstacles in achieving Millennium Development Goal. We are lagging far behind the standard in managing newborns properly. Strengthening and establishing more Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) could handle thousands of critically ill newborns and give them a second chance to life.//////Most of the unintended pregnancies are due to contraceptive failure, largely owing to inconsistent or incorrect use. With so many methods available and so many factors to consider, choosing the most effective birth control option can be difficult. A new study was designed to see the effectiveness of contraception that revealed superiority of long acting reversible contraception that will help women choose an efficient one.//////Prepping a patient for surgery usually involves shaving areas where incisions are to be made. Some surgeons believe it is important to remove anything that might obstruct their view. Others see shaving as a way to eliminate bacteria that cling to the hair and can contaminate the surgical site. But research suggests that shaving a patients skin before surgery may raise the risk of an infection.//////A new study published in Archives of Neurology adds to growing evidence that the complications of diabetes may extend to the brain, causing declines in memory, attention and other cognitive skills. The study showed that elderly men and women with diabetes had greater drops in cognitive test scores than other people of a similar age. The more poorly managed their disease, the greater the deterioration in mental function.//////People are risking their health by working on smartphones, tablets and laptops after they have left the office, according to the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.//////Despite many challenges and much of a tense situation, the probable influx or intrusion of Rohingya Muslim minorities, coming to Teknaf area following torture and threats, could have been barred by the Bangladesh government. Because of the fast tame-down of the violence in Rakhine state, where most Rohingyas live along Bangladesh border, after nearly in two weeks amid the loss of over 50 lives and around 2500 houses burned, the number of intruders was less this time compared to the massive inflows of 1991, 1978-82 and earlier. The Rohingyas are the most ignored and deceived community since they are denied citizenship and ethnic identity in Myanmar, a country which had been ruled under military regimes for decades, and still, but now under a relatively liberal ruler who promises massive reforms. //////We all feel desperate watching the horrible killing, feeling the suffering of the bereaved, the whole people. But, what to do? Could it be that the UN, and governments in general, have a tendency to make the same mistake, again and again, of putting the cart before the horse?//////According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading German daily, responsibility for the deaths of 108 people massacred in Houla on May 25 lies not with the Syrian army but with the Syrian 'rebel' forces. The newspaper reported the Syrian guerilla groups functioned as Sunni sectarian death squads, wiping out much of Houla's Shiite Muslim minority. //////The arrest of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy by the martial law regime of General Ayub Khan on 30 January 1962 sparked intense resentment among the student community in East Pakistan, to a point where leading figures of the Chhatra Union, Chhatra League, Chhatra Shakti and the pro-regime National Students Federation felt the need for action. The groups met the next day at Madhu's canteen and decided that the students of the university would observe a general strike on 1 February. Thus, for the first time in the more than three years which had elapsed since Ayub Khan's military takeover in October 1958, a decisive move had been taken by the students, which was an early sign of the troubles the regime would confront in the times ahead.//////Quamrul Hasan was intrigued by haiku when he was in his first year at university doing his honours in English literature. A course was being taught at the time. It was the renowned haiku as practiced by famous writers. As a student Quamrul wanted to be able to compose a few of these three lined, non rhyming poems. Finally he did write a few. A year or so later there was a haiku competition in The New Age Literature Page. As he had already composed some haiku, he sent them to the literary editor, Prof Niaz Zaman. To his utter surprise, his haiku was selected among the ten best haiku and was published in the literature page along with some of his teachers' works. That inspired the young writer and he continued with his endeavours. He was invited to the Japanese ambassador's residence along with the other published writers. Quamrul Hasan didn't have to look back since then.//////
