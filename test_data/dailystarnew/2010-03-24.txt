The Directorate of Family Planning should take into account the factors like what class & percentage of citizen subscribe newspapers, what percentage is literate requiring motivation by writing, and who in fact are over burdening our nation! Considering the noted facts, we should disseminate the message through our audio-visual media; not through an English newspaper! //////I am writing this mail out of frustration and anguish about our beloved national cricket team who conceded defeat in the first Test in Chittagong against England. //////The crisis season has started. Water, gas and electricity problems are disturbingly acute. Load shedding and water with bad smell have become part of our daily life!//////Load shedding is now part and parcel of our life in Bangladesh. I think load shedding will increase further in the coming summer. There is no fixed time for load shedding. That is creating serious problems for people. //////All is not well with the delivery of social services in Bangladesh. There have been reports of poor performance, corruption and inefficiency in the education, health, housing and population sectors. Red tape is said to be a factor in the failure of government sectors to utilise funds allocated to them. The poor state of sanitation and water supply and the weak social safety net testify to the state's inability to provide people basic facilities and services. //////Our Hon. PM does not see any problems in the country and mentioned that her success rate in the 1st year is more than expected. That's why the AL is so happy that they don't see any topic to discuss in parliament. All they would love to discuss is name change and fighting with the BNP. Other 300+ MPs are responsible too. None of them could ever bring up some positive and really important issues like gas, water, electricity, murder, rape, acid violence, corruption etc etc. Why doesn't the govt just take a newspaper and start solving the problems that are mentioned in all newspapers every day. For example, these were the headings in a Bangla newspaper a few days ago. //////Very recently it was decided that a person below 18 years of age won't be given any SIM card. It is undoubtedly a wise decision. I agree that mobile companies had taken many positive initiatives which brought several changes in our social as well as economic life. In our country, many parents are hard-pressed to fulfil the demand of their teenaged sons and daughters. The teenagers are not mature enough to understand the economic condition of their parents. At the same time, it is very difficult to control the emotion of the teenagers. Due to the influence of dish culture, they often try to copy the alien culture. They unnecessarily talk hour after hour through mobile which is also a kind of fashion for them. Moreover, some naughty boys are bold enough to threaten others with the help of the mobile phone. Parents not only become irritated but also worried about the activities of their children. People of this country are not rich enough to spend money for talking unnecessarily. It would be great if the same restriction is imposed upon the Facebook users too. //////Bangladesh and India are two friendly countries and that should remain so for the sake of both the countries since therein lies the well being of both the neighbours. It is very unfortunate that people should die from firing by border forces of either of the countries for any reason whatsoever. Generally, it is the Indian BSF that is reported to kill alleged smugglers, though Bangladesh asserts that those killed are innocent villagers from the bordering territories of Bangladesh. India should look into the matter more seriously and in no way strengthen the hands of anti Indian forces within Bangladesh by allowing these unnecessary killings.//////This refers to Mr. Rahat's letter published on your daily on 15 March 2010 with the headline: Take rickshaws off. To be quite honest, I agree with most of his points. He elaborately discussed how to minimize the traffic jams in Dhaka city. However, I believe that he was a bit rude towards the rickshaw-pullers. In his 11th point he stated as I quote: "The immediate step: Take rickshaws off the main roads. Do it now." I believe he was a bit carried away with his feelings. Taking rickshaws off is not the main thing. I think we always divert from the main issues. It is the large number of people in Dhaka city who are the real culprits. Population of the capital should be reduced and for doing this, our government should take initiatives for forming a decentralized government. As long as Dhaka is centralized, population will keep on growing. Rickshaws were there on Dhaka roads from the beginning. There was hardly any traffic jam even 10 years ago. And now, even in Uttara, it takes 30 minutes to go to Jasimuddin Road from Sector 9. //////I am writing this letter to draw the attention of the banks and relevant institutions. We are visiting the district of Gopalganj for some survey works under the banner of i-Bangla. There are some banks operating in this area and it is so disappointing that the leading banks do not provide any ATM facility. It would not be inappropriate to mention that people from all walks of life are coming here for jobs and business transactions. It is always wise and secure to carry a plastic card, instead of carrying cash for regular expenses. //////I don't understand why Bangladeshi cricketers don't learn from their mistakes!! A student who is known as a good student is always persistent in learning from their mistakes. Repeating mistakes is not a sign of talent. Please stop saying that Bangladeshi players are talented. Look at Kevin Pietersen, he practised more and more against lefty spinners at the net and then got the result when he made 99 against Bangladesh in Chittagong. That is how you can do justice to your talent! You have to have the eagerness to learn. Murali is a great bowler. Now what could he be without his "DUSRA". First time he saw it from Saqlain Mushtaq and then he learned it thoroughly. That is called eagerness! //////Construction work of the flyover at Tongi railway crossing on the Tongi-Kaliganj-Ghorasal- Panchdona highway began in the middle of 2006. The Tongi flyover project was taken to ease the traffic movement on both sides of the Tongi junction enabling the vehicles coming to and from northern and north-western districts to cross the station uninterrupted, the RHD has been implementing the project.//////We have a glorious history of student politics. From the language movement in 1952 to the movement of dethroning the autocratic government in 1990, our students played a crucial role in national politics and proved their worth. Now, in national politics, we have many political leaders who once played vital roles when they were students. We cannot but acknowledge their contribution to national politics. But, unfortunately, what we now experience from our student folk regarding politics is really shocking and ironic. Nowadays, our students concentrate more on politics, an easy shortcut, to them, to being healthy and wealthy, rather than their first and foremost duty-- study. So the result is predictable and in most cases it is found accurate. Now our students seem to be student-cum-businessman. //////Traditionally, when we talk of wind power generation; we automatically think in terms of wind farms. Here a large number of very tall wind turbines convert natural breeze to wind power, connected to the electricity supply grid.

The idea is to go beyond the limitations of our faces."//////Surbahar is a string instrument with deep, melodic and long lasting sound. It is classified as a chordophone in the lute family, and is related to the veena. Surbahar appeared in the musical scene of the subcontinent in the early 19th century, around 1830 to be precise. Although its basic structure resembles that of the sitar, it is much bigger in size and the instrument is tuned to a lower pitch.//////Dhaka Padatik-UCB International Theatre Festival is well underway at National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA).

A pretty senior journalist has just warned the nation's prime minister that if she so much as attempts a removal of the grave of General Ziaur Rahman from its present site, she will find her hands broken. That leaves you not only surprised but shocked as well, for you and I have grown up on values which teach us to respect the individual. And what is happening here is that not only is there no respect but that there is also a clear hurling of a threat at the head of government. Your sense of outrage tells you that such men are dangerous, that they should be brought to heel in the greater public interest. And note that the threat was accompanied by the nonsensical. //////THE government has decided to import rice to meet the domestic demand.
