The opinions expressed in these articles are solely those of the authors.//////The great sense of relief which has moved the Arab world since December 2010 seems to me a major event of our age. I am convinced that it will end by leading those particular countries towards democracy, but only after a number of twists and turns, which, alas, will often be bloody and always misdirected.//////Of all the Arab revolutions, the one that led to the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya remains unique in modern history. Despite the Tunisian and Egyptian precedents, despite the (relative) relinquishing of power by Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, despite the attempted revolution in Bahrain and civil war in Syria, itisdifficult to form a homogeneous revolutionary Arab model. Primarily because similar initial causes produce noticeably different consequences. There are several reasons for this - local political and religious context, economic issues and the revolutionary process which vary greatly from one country to another.//////For a long time, the images of the demonstrations in Tunisia, later in Egypt, recalled images of the the Eastern European Spring.

Some landowners near to Bodh Gaya in Bihar were angry that I was working with members of 'untouchable' castes. I was working with the Gandhian 'Samanvaya Ashram', which is based very close to the main Buddhist temple in Bodh Gaya, the birthplace of Buddhism. It is interesting to note that Samanvaya Ashram was set up to study all religions. At the early morning prayers each day, one day there would be readings from the Quran and then on successive days readings from the Gita, Buddhist Scriptures, the Bible, the Guru Granth Sahib (the Sikhs' holy book).//////The mind is wider than the sky. That was the way Emily Dickinson looked at the world outside her. Or you could say it was the way the soul worked in her. Weigh that statement. There is something of the metaphysical about it. There is a linkage of ideas which comes into a working out of the imagery. Consider the universe you are part of. Or think of yourself, the essential you in whom the universe comes to epitomize itself. That is what comes through in Dickinson, in her use of words, the words shaping a thought, the thought leading you on to a wider ambience of experience.//////Where lies the soul? I may not know its exact abode but there are hundreds of ways that I feel its presence within me. There are many doors to the soul. The soul plays in strange ways. You may not be aware but the soul leads you on, you make choices that seem to be strange to you on a second look. The soul seems to sit at the helm of your life and steer you on, destination unknown. You wonder how and where the soul resides to lead you on. The soul, with invisible wings, soars high and low. At one time it is in the nooks and corners of your house and then suddenly you wonder if it is in the seventh heaven, taking a look at the ethics of your life. At one time the soul seems to be so engrossed with the material possessions that surround you and yet then it is flying around looking for the aesthetic senses to fill the heart. You wonder for the umpteenth time: How many doors are there to the soul? Imagination costs you nothing and you are a free bird as you let yourself keep searching for the whereabouts of the soul. But there is one thing you want, regardless of its exact location, and that is peace of the soul. You want solitude in life.//////My mother called me Adrita--a nickname she apparently selected while I was still in her uterus-- even though everyone else called me by my real name Nazneen. My father was posted in Kishoreganj when I was born, but I took my first breath in Moulvi Bazaar in my grandparent's ancestral home where Amma came to stay for a few days for the delivery of her first child. Amma, then only eighteen years old, was so overjoyed to have her own baby, that she called me Adrita which, she told me as soon as I was old enough to understand, means the beloved one. After me, Amma had six more children, five sons and a daughter, but none of them got any nicknames from her. My numerous aunts and uncles came up with nicknames for my brothers and sister before Amma had any chance, and she just went along with those picked by them. As a consequence, some of my siblings ended up having more than one nicknames--for example, my youngest brother was given two, Bacchoo and Tukon, one from my mother's family and the other from my father's. Anyway, I was Amma's darling when I was growing up and reciprocated by helping her out after my brothers and sister were born and during their adolescent years. After my sister, who was the youngest of us, was born she became the recipient of all my attention and creative energy since I was very happy to finally have a sister after five brothers. I adoringly called her Putul when she was three months old and that's the way it was until she was nine or ten, when she told me that she did not like that name any longer. Since then, I called her by her real name, Naushin. //////Being overweight and obese not only increase peoples risk of heart disease and stoke, but also gradually damage their knee leading to pain and functional impairment.

However, whether it has been universally popular among the readers, given the deeply fractious nature of political opinion existing in the country, is open to question. On very politically sensitive issues writers and conference speakers prefer to steer a safe course, gingerly skirting around subject matters, for fear of offending one or the other major political party/inclination. Political intolerance of opposing views is, and has been, a reality in Bangladesh for some time now. At times such intolerance flares up into physical violence. Such is the sad state of pluralist democracy in this country. //////When the gracious young lady who is helping to organize the Hay Festival assigned this book to me to review, she said breezily, It'll be perfect for you because you're so into cricket!
