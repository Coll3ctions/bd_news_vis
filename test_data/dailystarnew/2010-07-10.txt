We appreciate the highest court's bold directive in this regard. //////IT is an eye-opener of a news report appearing in this paper on Thursday. It reveals in shocking detail the depth and dimension of social prejudice otherwise incipient being at play vis-a-vis members belonging to the lower stratum of society. To be honest, we find it repugnant to our sensibilities to even label them as 'untouchables' or 'dalits', because they are not only one of us, but also the ones who do yeoman's service to society. But for the services of the cobblers, dhopis (washermen), sweepers, janitors and barbers society would have come to a standstill.//////Two-time winners Uruguay and three-time champions Germany clash here on Saturday in a match that neither side wanted to be contesting - the playoff to decide third place.//////The oracle has spoken.

I found President Mohammed Daud in the sixties a fatherly figure who had no idea of what was happening in his country. Even otherwise, he was dependent on provincial warlords, a pattern which has not changed since. But he was not aware of the strong base that the communists, particularly the Khalaq, had developed in the country. This was the period of innocence. //////THE trade regime of Bangladesh immediately after independence was targeted to induce import-substituting industrialisation (ISI) in the country.

It is generally measured at three levels: the variety of species; the genetic diversity found within members of the same species (what makes you different from your neighbour); and the diversity of the ecosystems within which species live. These three levels are intimately connected. Genetic diversity is essential to the prosperity of the species, giving it the resources to adapt. And the number of species within an ecosystem is closely tied to the health and size of the ecosystem itself. //////I didn't know it was the day the heavens would fall. It was a holiday. Holidays are so rare in our life. I wanted to spend part of it with you, over lunch or even dinner outside. I was delighted within, for you might not make an excuse for not going out which you usually do. Because you were already scheduled to. I conveyed my desire the previous night. You spoke of your preoccupation with a meeting till noon. Well, after that?//////In the long echoing life//////Two young minds;//////Found an element so fine,//////Like red wine;//////And sharpened their last breath,//////Through the long echoing death.//////I loved and didn't think //////If it was right or wrong//////There was no time,//////Just as lightning strikes.//////Health is wealth! Since our childhood we have been reading and learning this wise saying from different sources. When we talk about improved health, we talk about food, nutrition, cleanliness, etc. But we hardly consider unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and insufficient hygiene as important factors contributing to poor health. Diseases like diarrhoea are caused by the ingestion of pathogens, especially from drinking of unsafe water, contaminated food or unclean hands.//////The football season is on. World cup fever has affected almost every people in Bangladesh. Many guys are now crazy watching football and playing in the field at the same time.

She was immediately brought to a nearby hospital. Doctors suspected a major head injury and due to the lack of sophisticated setup, they transferred her to Khwaja Yunus Ali Medical College and Hospital (KYAMCH) few hours later. As her father rushed to the emergency room of KYAMCH for his beloved child, he found her restless. Bethee was in excruciating pain and was frightened with the overwhelming event.//////Drug-resistant tuberculosis is posing a great challenge to the control of tuberculosis in Bangladesh.

The 65th birthday of the Noble Laureate on 19th June was another reminder to the guardians of democracy that the generals continue to keep her under house arrest in Yangon for nearly 15 years. Her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), overwhelmingly won Myanmar's last democratic election held 20 years ago but the generals did not want to hand power to an elected government. In many capitals round the world, individuals and rights activists celebrated her birthday while condemning the military junta. Such groups have been observing her birthday every year with no effect on the junta at all. //////AFTER the 2 July 2010 attack on a popular Sufi Mosque in Lahore, Pakistan has once again raised the spotlight of political security in Pakistan.

However, local media reports have speculated that one of the suicide bombers did recently go to Waziristan for terrorist training purposes. As Punjab is starting to witness a new round of terrorist and sectarian clashes, the violence in the province threatens to escalate with a demonstrative effect for regional secessionist groups.//////MINAR Monsur demonstrated unquestionable courage when he first placed this compilation on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman before the country in 1979. And it was courage because of the fearsome nature of the times. Bangladesh was under its earliest spell of military rule. And just how harsh the times were can be gauged from the very fact that it was General Ziaur Rahman who happened to be presiding over the fortunes of the country as its first military dictator. It was dictatorship unbridled and unadulterated and not just because politics was in suspension. That Parliament had returned, with Zia's followers in the majority, really did not matter. What did matter were the sure and steady attempts made to airbrush the Father of the Nation out of Bangladesh's history. References to the 1971 War of Liberation carefully excised Bangabandhu's name as also those of the political leaders instrumental in the formation of the Mujibnagar government. //////MARYAM Mazar's complex character and her memories of her difficult past, form the basis of Yasmin Crowther's very interesting novel, The Saffron Kitchen.//////
