Ali Haider Chowdhury, general secretary of the Association, has claimed that government officers are too inexperienced to pick workers or arrange proper training for them. Is he suggesting that officials who have passed stringent civil service examinations and qualified to hold jobs in the government do not compare with some of the so-called recruiting agents that treat people seeking job abroad as migrant workers heartlessly? They even lure them into selling what little property they own to pay hefty fees to obtain poor-paying jobs under disgraceful conditions.//////Interactions over time in myriad sectors show clearly how a mighty neighbour like India treats a smaller country like Bangladesh.

I request our Prime Minister to rethink this decision and reappoint Obaidul Quader as the railways minister again.//////Once I got a chance to visit a hydro-electricity project.

Her son was suffering from serious lung cancer. But to my utter surprise, I came to know that all her money went missing, which was her last savings for her son's treatment. I learned that this happens quite often here. Majority of the people who come to public hospitals for treatment are poor people. But the thieves do not spare them. Some hospital staff are allegedly involved in this. The hospital authorities should identify those people and punish them. They should take proper steps so that this type of theft never occurs in the hospital.//////There are people around us who struggle through all difficulties in their life. We hardly know about them. They are the real fighters. Their limitations can not stop them from going ahead. They do not give in. Seeing the way they struggle, one finds the strength and motivation not to give in. They are very ordinary people, yet they rise above all!//////The power supply situation is said to have greatly improved over the year in Dhaka but at a great cost, making the lives of consumers more miserable.

Whatever it is, the confession or self-realisation that the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb made in his last days forms the core of a new play, Aurangzeb. The play sees Aurangzeb facing the similar fate that his father, Shah Jahan, endured because of his desire for power. The play tries to establish that the policy taken by Aurangzeb during his reign went wrong. Ignoring his predecessors' strategy, he tried to initiate a new way that finally fell through.//////In recognition to his lifelong contribution to classical music, Nazrul Academy posthumously honoured Shafiur Rahman [of Suddha Sangeet Proshar Goshthi] with the 'Sur-Saaki' award at this month's Nazrul Utshab [festival].

Around the world, two persons celebrate their sixtieth birthday every second! With one in nine persons in the world aged 60 years or over, projected to increase to one in five by 2050, population ageing is a phenomenon that can no longer be ignored.//////The violent demonstrations that have spread across the Muslim world in recent weeks have convinced many in the United States and Europe that the Arab revolutions that began in late 2010 are now officially over and that the democratic project has failed.
