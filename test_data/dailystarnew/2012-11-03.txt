Hence the question must be asked what is so uniquely special about the new banks that allow them to appoint up to 20 directors. From what has been published in the media, the move apparently has something to do with allowing sponsor directors to sell these 'extra' positions at exorbitant prices. If that is indeed the case, precisely what role is Bangladesh Bank (BB), as the regulator, doing about it?//////With 18 lakh cases pending at the lower courts, over 14,000 cases awaiting adjudication at the Appellate Division and 2.82 lakh others at the High Court, case management through digitisation is the right way to go. //////It was once again a 'Tamim Iqbal show' that dominated the beginning of the second round of the National Cricket League.

This was the feeling expressed by an individual commenting on a news item on the CNN website. //////On the outskirts of the village of Shibaloy, just past the brick factory, the car slows to let a cow lumber out of its way. It is a good sign. Twenty years ago there was no brick factory, or any other industry, in this village 60 kilometres west of Dhaka; there were few cows, and no cars. The road was a raised path too narrow for anything except bicycles.//////In 1976, five years after independence, a book appeared called "Bangladesh: The Test Case of Development." It was a test, the authors claimed, because the country was such a disaster that if development could be made to work there, it could surely work anywhere. At the time, many people feared Bangladesh would not survive as an independent state. One famine, three military coups and four catastrophic floods later, the country that Henry Kissinger once dismissed as "a basket case" is still a test. But no longer in the sense of being the bare minimum that others should seek to surpass. Now, Bangladesh has become a standard for others to live up to.//////French playwright, journalist and feminist Olympe de Gouges is guillotined.//////Our entire way of life and all our economic activities rely on energy -- in fact on more of it. However, the world is now facing most serious challenges in energy supply which can be a more devastating crisis than the world wars wrought. Global energy depletion has already begun, although few countries realise it. Presently the energy producing resources like fossil fuel, gas, coal, and uranium have reached their peak position. It is predicted that those non-renewable energy sources are going to decline from that position in every location of the earth sooner than later. //////A couple of weeks ago, Munich Re, one of the world's largest reinsurance firms, issued a study titled Severe Weather in North America. According to the press release that accompanied the report, Nowhere in the world is the rising number of natural catastrophes more evident than in North America. The number of what Munich Re refers to as weather-related loss events, and what the rest of us would probably call weather-related disasters, has quintupled over the last three decades. While many factors have contributed to this trend, including an increase in the number of people living in flood-prone areas, the report identified global warming as one of the major culprits: Climate change particularly affects formation of heat-waves, droughts, intense precipitation events, and in the long run most probably also tropical cyclone intensity.//////Bangladesh is among one of the most natural disaster prone regions of the world. Flood and other natural calamities like cyclones, tornados routinely cause great suffering to people across the country. Government efforts and arrangements are often inadequate to manage these disasters, while NGOs and other private organisations also provide useful service to humanity. //////Sunil Gangopadhyay, poet, story-teller, novelist, playwright and essayist, died at his South Kolkata residence from a massive heart attack in the early hours of October 23, 2012. It was the Nabami of Durga Puja. His wife Swati Ganguly was beside him. Their only son Souvik was in Boston. He came home to perform the last rites on Thursday, October 25. //////His wife left him last Friday. Since then, Farid has been trying to reach her on her cell phone but without much luck. For a day or so, Farid was getting her voice mail, but each time he would hang up since he did not want to leave any message for Amrita. Now, when he tries to reach her number, he gets a weird voice which in the most annoying fashion repeats the standard message: If you have reached this number by mistake please check the number again or call the operator. The whole exercise, and the tone of the voice he finds so annoying that once he felt like screaming back shut the f.. up.//////Chronicle created conduit whether we wanted or not//////It appeared as preordained as many worldly affairs//////Made some cherish and more to screech, but//////The truth is the stream that separated the entirety. //////Cancer is a shocking diagnosis for all of us. The shock increases manifolds when someone receives a diagnosis at a very late stage  when very little can be offered for help. Most of the cancers are curable if these are detected at an earlier stage. Therefore, screening for common cancers is crucial to reduce the number of people who develop and die from cancer.//////Liver disease is fairly common in Indian sub-continet. The most common being Hepatitis C virus and Hepatitis B virus related cirrhosis. Majority of these patients are asymptomatic until they reach the end stage when they may require transplantation. There is an emerging common cause of liver disease (fatty liver disease) which is related to poor diet and obesity  which is in fact emerging globally.//////A cheap test which could detect even low levels of viruses and some cancers has been developed by UK researchers. The colour of a liquid changes to give either a positive or negative result.//////The international effort to eliminate tuberculosis is in real danger, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).//////Downing a cup of beans or lentils every day may help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar and possibly reduce their risk of heart attacks and stroke, according to a small study published in Archives of Internal Medicine.//////Smokers miss an average of two or three more days of work each year than non-smokers, according to a new analysis of 29 past studies. Based on that finding, absenteeism due to smoking cost the UK alone 1.4 billion ($2.25 billion) last year, researchers calculated.//////Khaleda Zia, the leader of Bangladesh's main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is visiting India after nearly six years at the invitation of the Indian government. Since her last visit in 2006 as Prime Minister of Bangladesh, there has been a substantial change in India-Bangladesh relations. Given the proximity of views on communal politics, their socio-cultural disposition and reckoning the historic background of affinity and cooperation between the Awami League of Bangladesh and the Congress Party of India, it was but natural that there would be an upturn in bilateral relations between the two countries with the Awami League and Sheikh Hasina in power. But the Sheikh Hasina Government went even further in its approach towards India, as has been evident on a range of issues such as facilitating transhipment of critical stores (though selectively as for example with respect to the Palaitana gas-based power project of Tripura), enabling the setting up of a number of border haats (markets) for the benefit of people inhabiting border areas, allowing the swapping of enclaves to go through and, above all, controlling the activities of anti-Indian north eastern militants and even nabbing and handing over some of them to the Indian authorities. It will be the endeavour of the Indian authorities to gauge the likely posture of Khaleda Zia, in the event of the BNP's return to power after January 2013, on continuation of cooperation in the areas where a large degree of mutual understanding has already been achieved.//////The US presidential election will be held within few days, and if the polls are correct, the outcome will be extraordinarily close. Many say that the country has never been as deeply divided. Recently, I noted how this year's campaign is far from the most bitter and vitriolic. //////On October 24, two days before Eid, an opinion piece published in the elite US journal Foreign Policy extolled the fact that US forces are winning in Afghanistan, adding, Why doesn't the media notice? In the article, the author suggests that Taliban forces are so decimated and demoralized that they have been resigned to orchestrating sensational attacks to give the perception [their] narrative is winning out and to reassure [their] followers.//////When a group of my MA students at the University of Dhaka chose to work on the impact of 1971 on western literature, they concentrated on George Harrison and the Concert for Bangladesh and Allen Ginsberg's On Jessore Road. Neither they nor I at the time had heard of a British writer by the name of Philip Hensher, who had written a novel on 1971.//////Satyajit Ray has not written his memoirs. Ray, according to his wife Bijoya Ray, had often thought of writing his autobiography but his many commitments kept him from doing so. Who then could be a better person to shed light on various aspects of the multifaceted life of the maestro director than his life-long partner Bijoya? And readers are amply rewarded by Bijoya's book, Manik and I, a Penguin India publication. Manik is the name by which Satyajit Ray was known to his close family members and friends.//////
