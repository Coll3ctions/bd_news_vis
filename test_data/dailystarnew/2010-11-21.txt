They used to come here and be charmed by its colourful landscapes which was like a dream to them. Numerous rivers, canals, marshy lands, boundless green fields and birds of different kinds are symbols of beauty as well as Nature's way of balancing the environment. But irresponsible decisions of some ambitious people are destroying its beauty and environment. In the name of development they are constructing multi-storied buildings, markets and factories by earth-filling rivers, canals and ponds. Many such projects in the Capital, and indeed all over Bangladesh, are going on without impediment. Due to this the country is loosing croplands; as a result our food production is also decreasing by the day. Loss of wetland is also causing unemployment to the fishermen. Such harmful projects must be stopped forthwith, and the government should take immediate steps in this regard. //////Reluctance to use foot over bridge by the pedestrians is one of the important causes of road accidents. They cross the road in front of moving vehicles and consequently fall victims of fatal accidents. Even then they are not keen to use the foot over bridge. There are many over bridges in Dhaka city under the possession of hawkers and beggars. For example, we can mention the Mouchak, Newmarket, Uttara Azampur and Mirpur foot over bridges.//////Bangladesh is one of the smallest countries in South Asia which has a delicate and distinctive tourist attraction of its own to offer. It is a land of enormous beauty, hundreds of rivers and lakes surrounded by evergreen hills, tropical rain forests and beautiful cascades of green tea gardens, world's heritage, Home of the Royal Bengal Tiger and the wild lives, world's longest natural sea beach, rich cultural heritage, relics of ancient Buddist civilization and colourful tribal life. Much of the country has been relatively untouched by modern technology and development; for these reasons foreigners find the rich flora and fauna and colourful tribal life so enchanting.//////Scientists are still exploring as to how the dinosaurs became extinct million of years ago. Some believe they were struck by meteorites falling from the skies, yet others believe disappearance of the female species led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Perhaps we all know that living beings, including human beings, require oxygen for survival and we get this essential element in the atmosphere from plants and trees. //////We are very much familiar with the words system loss. The ultimate result of all these is wastage, which is very much rampant in our country, and is one of the major causes of shortage of electricity. Wastage of food is observed in most of the marriage ceremonies, in dinner parties and in other similar ceremonies. We find that cars, trucks and buses are lying in different office compounds and in the police stations, for years together, which gradually turn into scraps. I have seen many residential buildings constructed under some development project in remote places, which remained vacant and eventually fell into decay.//////150 seats for 9487 students.//////This malady is now at the point of being worries for us all.

It is a well known and reputed university for many reasons. The students of SUST and the other universities are the future leaders of the nation. When many people, including the media and other organizations, are raising their voices to say no to smoking, some of the SUST students are engaging in smoking. It is a regretful matter. What will the society learn from them? There are some small tea stalls in the university campus. They sell cigarettes besides other things. I think if the authority bans the sale of cigarettes in the university premises and keep monitoring regularly, smoking amongst the students will decrease automatically. //////Education is the backbone of a nation. No nation can prosper without education in this competitive world. Bangladesh is a developing country. We have not forgotten that Bangladesh won the inglorious first place as a most corrupt country in the world. Before election, every political party displays their strong commitment against corruption. But after coming to power, they completely forget their commitment.//////Where is our sense of value?

I sincerely appreciate the PM's noble intention of establishing the true values of Islam and reducing the gap in the understanding of the philosophy of Islam within the Muslims and among the followers of other religions. Meanwhile I would like to say one thing that this particular verse is meant for a particular situation.//////A Tender process for 300 MW Power Plant Project in Ghorashal, crucial to mitigating the countries Power Supply crisis, is set to be cancelled in the face of a tussle between the communication minister and power development board The 'Daily Star' November 10, 2010.

Now it becomes like a social rite. Buying costly cattle publicizes the buyer's wealth. Some show it off as the symbol of their social and political status.

In fact, finance is the second most debated issue in climate diplomacy, after burden-sharing in mitigation (emission reduction) by the major emitters. Dr. Huq wrote that, reportedly, only $3 billion out of $30 billion, pledged at Copenhagen as the fast-start finance for 2010-12 by the industrial countries, is likely to be earmarked for adaptation. This is just $3/head for a billion people in the most vulnerable countries (MVCs). This is blatantly unfair, as the Copenhagen Accord purports to provide for a "balanced allocation" between adaptation and mitigation. //////I have serious bad news!
