In the past few years, much has been said and written about the predatory manner in which individuals and organisations have gone about commandeering public as well as privately-owned land across the country. To the shock of the nation, these land grabbers, instead of feeling ashamed, have been acting as if it is the usual thing to seize property from others.

In the stream of life we follow some idealism. We have to work in the team. Team spirit is vital for the overall development. Now I should come to the point. A feature published in the Daily Prothom Alo regarding Bahazuddin, a school teacher of Tangail, strikes in my mind. I came to know that he is a person who did not enjoy a single leave in his thirty years' service life. It impressed me very much. It is his will power that has helped him to attain such credit. God has helped him in this regard. //////In recent days it has become a fashion to blame the past CTG for the 1/11 episode. It is the human nature to pass on one's blame to others to hide one's own failures. Some quarters are even asking for the 'trial' of the persons involved in the changeover. The hula, as can be seen, is masterminded by few controversial influential persons whose role during pre- CTG era came under drastic scrutiny. We all know why and how the then political circumstances and deteriorating law and order situation pushed the country towards the changeover. There was no other alternative whatsoever due to the intransigence of the power hungry groups. The fact, however, remains that the people of this country, except for the few disgruntled politicians, overwhelmingly supported the changeover. Even the international community seeing the internal huge public support came out publicly in support of the CTG. The role of the administration of the CTG in handling the total affairs of the country cannot be termed perfect. But there is no denying that the corruption which bore its firm roots from the pre-CTG era got a tremendous jerk with the changeover. Persons who once considered themselves too powerful and above any kind of law of the country were brought to face charges in the court. Henceforth, I am sure before embarking upon any large scale corruption a person will now think twice about his accountability to the nation, may be at a later date. //////As expected the DMP's expensive toys CCTV, Automatic Signals etc etc have failed to live up to their ambitious billing. The DS has repeatedly (including DS of 12/1/10) reported on the lax implementation, wholesale flaunting of traffic laws, and cosmetic fining of a few offenders unlucky enough to get caught to fulfil the traffic controllers' quotas.//////Allah, the Merciful, created our dearest Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) without an iota of flaw.

He was not in love with status. He had more power in Bengal than most prime ministers have in India. He was content in Kolkata and capable of mounting an offensive from the Red Fortress that could shake the parameters of the Red Fort. V. P. Singh could never have become prime minister without his muscle. The decisive word in "historic blunder" is "historic," not "blunder."
