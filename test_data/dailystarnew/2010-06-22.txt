Even though lately the talk of water on moon has resurfaced, it has always been Mars, which captivated people's imagination as far as extra-terrestrial liquid and life-forms are concerned. Before getting into details it is sensible to point out that the current atmospheric condition of Mars is not hospitable enough to sustain liquid water on its surface. But numerous researches suggest that Mars was once a wet planet with plenty of liquid water flowing down the surface, much like Earth's oceans. And according to a recent study conducted by the University of Colorado (CU) at Boulder, it is likely that a vast ocean covered one-third of the surface of Mars some 3.5 billion years ago. Published in the latest edition of the journal Nature Geoscience, planetary geologists from the United States, after studying a ring of ancient Martian delta deposits and valley networks from the databases of NASA and European Space Agency, strongly imply that up to a third of Mars was under about 30 million cubic miles of liquid water. The study further maintains that the ancient red planet probably had an Earth-like global hydrological cycle, including precipitation, runoff, cloud formation, ice and groundwater accumulation which strongly supports the commonly held idea that the planet may have once harboured a rich array of extra-terrestrial life forms. The river deltas on Mars are of high interest to planetary scientists, mostly because deltas on Earth rapidly bury organic carbon and other biomarkers of life and scientists believe same is the situation in the Martian deltas. According to CU-Boulder researcher and lead author of the study, Gaetano Di Achille, On Earth, deltas and lakes are excellent collectors and preservers of sign of past life. If life ever arose on Mars, deltas may be the key to unlocking Mars. It is important to mention here that the CU-Boulder study is the first to combine the analysis of water-related features including scores of delta deposits and thousands of river valleys to test the existence of an ocean sustained by a global hydrosphere on early Mars. //////SCIENTISTS dropped an experiment nearly five stories down an elevator shaft of sorts to test a possible way to meld the physical theory of the very small - quantum mechanics - with the very large - general relativity, to create a theory of everything. //////Scientists with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have discovered that a species of fly originally from South Georgia, the chironomid midge, has flourished since its accidental introduction to Signy Island in the Antarctic in the 1960s.
