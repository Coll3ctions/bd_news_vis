A raging blaze yesterday reduced the upper levels of the capital's Bashundhara City shopping complex to a skeleton, killing at least seven people and injuring 20 others.//////Even though Bashundhara City building in the capital had several fire hydrants inside, the building's reservoir had no water. This helped the fire to spread and claim the lives of seven persons yesterday.//////Fire fighters could not douse the flames on upper floors of Bashundhara City shopping complex in the capital yesterday as they do not have required logistics and equipment to tame a blaze beyond 13th floor of a building. //////A small crowd lingered into the night, hours after fire fighters battled out the blaze at the Bashundhara City shopping mall yesterday. //////It was 1:40pm yesterday. The Bashundhara City Complex was buzzing with activity as usual. Shoppers were busy bargaining with sellers while a few people were taking exercise in the gym. The food courts were bustling with customers. Movie lovers were eagerly waiting to watch film at the Star Cineplex.//////Like every other day Baki Billah had to "escape" his two children playing tricks to attend office yesterday.

We infer from various reports that a large number of weapons of various descriptions have been taken away by fleeing BDR personnel and their cohorts after perpetrating the carnage inside Pilkhana. And it is most disconcerting that there is no clue as to whether these looted arms and ammunition remain abandoned in some remote places or have already been sold to anti-social elements. //////THE sight of a huge fire engulfing the top floors of the Bashundahara City shopping and office complex, a structure of iconic features in the heart of the metropolis, evoked fear in the minds of the beholders. Holiday shoppers could hardly believe something like this could happen to a modern building supposedly fitted with gadgets to detect smoke and douse out fire at the very outset. They were caught unawares in the shops and food-courts as the blaze spread quickly in the top floors of the office tower but were helped by security personnel to come out safely. As a high wind fanned the fire, falling debris from the top floors posed threat to life of onlookers on the streets below, as fire fighters looked on helplessly. The domineering height of the 20-storied structure made it impossible for them to reach the source of fire with water guns. At the time of writing this editorial (6:30 pm), one person was reported to have lost his life and many others received injuries of various degrees. //////SOUTH Asia has been witness to several significant changes over the last two years.

During this period, the media has acted as a watch-dog and contributed towards this meaningful process.//////COMPARISONS are odious. Yet Nawaz Sharif has made the same call to rebel against President Asif Ali Zardari government as Gandhian Jayaprakash Narain had done in 1975. He too, like Nawaz Sharif, had asked policemen not to obey "illegal and unconstitutional" orders. Mrs Indira Gandhi then imposed the emergency, gagged the press and detained more than 100,000 people without trial. Two years later, when elections were held, she was routed. Nawaz Sharif is, however, talking about the 1971 situation when East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, seceded from Pakistan. The situation is, indeed, somber because the Long March of the lawyers already has Nawaz Sharif, his Muslim League and others participating in it. //////There is an Act passed by the then British-India government in the year 1898 called 'The Lepers Act 1898'. This was meant to control and deal with the people who were suffering from the disease called 'Leprosy'. This was preceded by the Leper Act 1895. All these were prejudicial to the human rights of the people affected by the stigmatizing disease. They were meant for the segregation and ancient unscientific treatment of pauper lepers and to prohibit them from following certain callings or trades. //////Emeka Christian fired two poacher's goal to help Abahani tame a stubborn Chittagong Mohammedan 2-1 in a come-from-behind win yesterday to all but confirm a place in the Citycell Super Cup semifinal.//////New Zealand will seek a confidence-boosting victory in their fifth one-day international against India Saturday, after losing the series 3-0 this week.//////Partex thrived on half centuries by Mushfiqur Rahim and Tariq Ahmed to manage a two-wicket victory over Old DOHS in the Premier Division Cricket League at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////The Australia captain Ricky Ponting has warned of a "really dangerous" future for Test cricket.

It is now almost unequivocally recognised that business firms must move beyond just the strict considerations of profit maximization, and address the wider interests of the society and the environment within the context of which they operate.

That had happened yesterday. Now he was suddenly up against the nightmare. Everybody knew that as soon as evening fell Nutu Mullik liked to down a couple of bottles of Bangla liquor.

He grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and perhaps as befits a poet-in-making, spent chunks of his youth bumming around in that huge country. It included stints in the Pacific Northwestworking in the seasonal salmon industry in Alaska, and as a logger, both very physically demanding jobsexperiences rare for the ambitious, driven first-generation children of Americans of Indian descent, tending as they do to live within cloistered cultural and social frames. He also was a Ph.D student at Columbia University, in its Middle Eastern Languages and Literature department, before abandoning it and going for an M.F.A. Vijay Seshadri's poems, essays, and reviews have appeared in a wide variety of publications, including //////, as well as in many anthologies, including //////, and //////. //////The leaves sweat heavily//////Picking up//////From the molten-gold colour//////An eternity of happiness//////Beneath my feet trembles//////The ground of fallen leaves ---//////Just like adults, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can affect children and may be catastrophic and life threatening incident that leads to high morbidity and mortality.//////Fertility preservation via egg freezing allows women to store their eggs at a younger age for future use and is now an important modality of modern treatment.

Although this hike is about 10% compared to India's budget for 2007-08 but this is the steepest hike of Indian defence budget since the partition of the subcontinent. This boosting of expenditure has been justified due to crossing of a threshold and deterioration of security environment and increased defence spending by China. The budget looks impressive despite the effects of global economic slowdown and it marks an increase of nearly 125% percent over the last one decade from Rs. 47,071 crores in 1999-2000. Indian defence analysts feel that to meet any threats to its vital interests India requires among others, a strong military capability that could safeguard its interests within and outside domestic boundaries including in the vast seas that account for 70% per cent of the country's total trade by value. China has also increased its defence budget to about US $70 billion, which some observers point out that the real expenditure is much more than the announced budget. Point to note that Bangladesh's total national budget for the year 2008-09 was only Tk. 999.62 billion.//////IN 2003 Mahamoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) was imposed as Arafat's Prime Minister by both the Bush administration and the Ariel Sharon regime.
