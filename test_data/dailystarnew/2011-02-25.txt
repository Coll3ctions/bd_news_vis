In these past few days, we have made our views known about the need to contain such spiralling crime if things are not to get any worse. We have pointed to the violent manner of young women being killed as well as the unnatural deaths of some children in recent days. And now that two murders have been committed in broad daylight in the capital, we cannot but serve warning to the authorities that unless serious and drastic steps are taken to halt this on-going spell of criminality, it may become well-nigh impossible for society to come away from the brink.//////The Annual Development programme (ADP) is still dogged by the perennial syndrome of low implementation rate. In keeping with an ambitious budget this fiscal, the ADP allocation, too, was enhanced by around 36 per cent more than the revised ADP for last fiscal. The expectation was that the ministries will be able to perform better at utilising the development money, given the emphasis the prime minister had repeatedly laid on better implementation of the fund. Unfortunately though, this time, too, the utilisation rate, far from improving, has rather been marked by a poorer show at 33 per cent over the first seven months, which is less than that of the last year's 35 per cent during the corresponding period.//////The mood was altogether different prior to Bangladesh's battle against Ireland today; unlike in the opening match against India. It's not only that the buzzing, the madness, and the euphoria from the fans that was missing ahead of the Tigers second Group B match but Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan was also not in his usual joyous disposition while addressing a press conference at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday. //////Police used bamboo sticks to beat back cricket fans trying to buy tickets in Bangalore on Thursday as World Cup organisers criticised Indian officials over growing ticketing chaos.//////Bangladesh U-23 football team suffered a 2-0 defeat to their Kuwaiti counterparts in the first-leg of the pre-Olympic qualifiers at Al Qadsiya Club Stadium in Kuwait on Wednesday.//////Injured Newcastle striker Hatem Ben Arfa could return to action for the league match against Wolverhampton on April 2, Magpies boss Alan Pardew said Wednesday.//////B2M Technologies Limited, one of the country's leading content providers, has acquired the exclusive mobile rights for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011.

Since his last international game in 1999, Simmons devoted his considerable experience to being an international coach, and led a plummeting Zimbabwe till 2005. His prowess as a coach came to the fore, however, when he took over the reins of Ireland for the 2007 World Cup and guided them to the Super Eights stage in their first global tournament. //////Ashes-winning England have spinners who can cause a headache for India if Sunday's World Cup match is played on a turning track, batsman Ravi Bopara said on Thursday.//////Sri Lanka want to win the World Cup as a farewell trophy for legendary spinner and world record holder Muttiah Muralidaran who will retire from international cricket after the tournament.//////The hour has come for Bangladesh to open up its cricketing soul to the rest of the world. In its' own backyard, in the presence of multitudes who do not necessarily know one end of the bat from another, and who are certainly giving jingoism a whole new name. The first big game that is meant to matter the most beckons the Tigers. It is crunchcrunchcrunch time and more besides. Far from prying eyes across the seas the Tigers had succumbed to the Irish once before on the big stage. On home soil such a result again must surely be anathema. Pressure, did I hear someone say? You bet your reverse sweep in the Powerplay it is! Irrespective of all the politically correct statements from the skipper and the coach.//////Australia's cricket team will do all it can to support their New Zealand "brothers" when the teams meet in a World Cup match overshadowed by the Christchurch earthquake, captain Ricky Ponting said.//////Mario Gomez scored a last minute winner to put Bayern Munich firmly in control of their last 16 Champions League tie against Inter Milan on Wednesday.//////Manchester United and Marseille shared the spoils, but no goals, as the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie ended in a drab and forgettable 0-0 draw here on Wednesday.//////Sebastien Squillaci headed the winner at the Emirates Stadium as Arsenal beat Stoke to move within a point of Manchester United at the top of the Premier League here Wednesday.//////Blackburn Rovers captain Ryan Nelsen will wear a black armband against Aston Villa as a tribute to those who have died in an earthquake in his hometown Christchurch.//////Sea freight is expected to be a good source of direct foreign currency for Bangladesh in a few years as big business conglomerates are increasingly buying ocean-going ships cashing in on the troubled US and European economies.//////A three-day Asian pharmaceuticals exposition began yesterday, opening scope for local firms to adopt the latest technologies to make quality drugs and showcase their products to foreign buyers.//////The issuance of certificates to gain zero tariff benefits in garment exports to the European countries increased 37.69 percent in January, compared to the same month last year.//////A credit crisis and lack of confidence pulled down twin bourses yesterday as investors went on a sell-off spree for a third day.//////Two more new aircraft will be added to the national flag carrier Biman Bangladesh fleet in the second half of the year to carry passengers, said Civil Aviation and Tourism Minister GM Quader yesterday.//////The leaders of the two rival groups of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) are in a disagreement now over the issue of its election, which was scheduled for yesterday. //////Zahir Uddin Ahmed has been elected president of Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of angladesh (ICMAB) for 2011.//////Commerce Minister Faruk Khan has called upon Bimstec members to move towards greater integration to fully exploit the potential of intra-regional trade, still largely untapped. //////Excess and disequilibrium in any market is not sustainable overtime and what we have experienced in the capital markets recently is a painful price correction of an overpriced market to a large extent triggered by profit taking, de-leveraging by financial institutions to reduce exposure, some overreaction/panic selling as well as liquidation related to year end book closing by financial institutions. In my view, this is not at all unusual compared to the corrections experienced in many developing markets. Since the market was up over 85 percent in 2010, a correction of 30-40 percent is just logical since 85 percent was not warranted based upon the fundamental growth of the economy and earnings of the listed companies.//////YouTube, the Google-owned video-sharing website, is banking on Bollywood and cricket to make its mark in the Indian market, looking at tie-ups with major studios to expand its movie library.//////Oil surged more than 7.5 percent to its highest since August 2008 on Thursday on concern unrest in Libya could spread to other major oil producers in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh vowed on Thursday to control inflation, a problem that has sparked street protests this week and added pressure on the government already under fire over corruption scandals.//////The International Monetary Fund called for a weaker dollar to help the United States reduce its deficits with the rest of the world and rebalance the global economy, in a report released Wednesday.//////Nigeria's state energy firm wants to boost exports to China as the poorly performing company works to restructure as part of wide-ranging industry reforms, its head said on Wednesday.//////Oil prices surged and Asian stock markets plunged on Thursday, as traders worried about turmoil in Libya and possible further contagion within the Arab world.//////In the report "EBL unveils savings account for students" published yesterday, we inadvertently mentioned that students aged between 11 and 17 years will be eligible for opening the account at EBL branches, individually or jointly with parents.

In spite of best efforts of the Prime Minister, the government is wandering like a rudderless boat. //////An advertisement of 31st BCS was published recently. One thing was noticeable that it invited applications from the graduates and post graduates of Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Soil Science, Environment Science and Forestry discipline for the post of BCS Forest Cadre. I think like other professional cadres, BCS Forest Cadre should be reserved only for the Forestry graduates. Forestry degree is also a professional degree like Engineering, Agriculture etc. This degree is awarded only by three public universities- Khulna University, Chittagong University and Shylet University of Science and Technology in Bangladesh. The students of Forestry dept. study only forest related courses. They mainly learn how to manage forest, forest resources, and wildlife and so on. //////BUET stands for Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. So far BUET is an abbreviated word, it is written in all capital form. But unfortunately, staff correspondent of The Daily Star is making this mistake consistently. On February 4, in the report on convocation it was written as 'Buet' and again on February 5 in the report on reunion it was written as 'Buet'. //////Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched a fierce counter-attack yesterday, fighting gun battles with rebels who have threatened the Libyan leader by seizing important towns close to the capital.//////India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday defended his record in office as his embattled government looked to revive its fortunes during a new parliamentary session.//////Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh has ordered his security forces to offer 'full protection' to anti- and pro-government demonstrators alike.//////A British court has agreed to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to Sweden where he is accused of sex crimes, dismissing claims such a move would breach his human rights.//////New Zealand rescuers refused to give up the hunt for quake survivors yesterday, despite hope fading for hundreds feared trapped two days after a disaster that has killed nearly 100.//////The US has begun talks with Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday about US aid programmes in the country, says the top US diplomat in Burma.//////A US drone strike in a Pakistani tribal area yesterday killed at least three militants, security officials said, the first such incident since a US official shot dead two men in Lahore last month.//////Egyptian police detained former information minister Anas al-Fikki and former state broadcasting chief Osama al-Sheikh yesterday as part of a probe into alleged graft under ousted president Hosni Mubarak, a security official said.//////Opposition candidates who lost in Uganda's election called yesterday on their supporters to stage peaceful protests against veteran President Yoweri Museveni's overwhelming triumph.//////Russia will spend $650 billion to equip its dilapidated military with 600 new warplanes, 100 ships and 1,000 helicopters by 2020, Defence Ministry officials were quoted as saying yesterday.//////A Pakistani court is to begin proceedings today at a hearing into double murder charges against a CIA contractor who shot dead two men in Lahore last month, lawyers said.//////Five soldiers were killed yesterday in an accidental explosion at a military facility in central Spain that includes a demining training centre, police and defence sources said.//////I'm not a classical music connoisseur in the conventional sense; not claiming to be a specialist in the minute details of raga, taal and laye. Appreciation for classical and semi-classical music has been an acquired taste. Zakir Hussain is a name I've been familiar with for as long as I can remember, but my true exposure to his musical prowess happened through the soundtrack of the film "Saaz" [rumoured to be based on the sibling rivalry between Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle]. I listened in awe to the song "Kya Tumne Hai Keh Diya"; particularly Hussain's tabla and bol [interesting fact: the musician played a central character, opposite Shabana Azmi, in the film]. Since then I've been a keen admirer of Hussain's remarkable tabla skills. Naturally, an opportunity to hear the maestro live made for a memorable evening. //////A group of young artistes staged a cultural programme to raise awareness of contemporary social problems prevalent in rural areas.//////Gallery Chitrak will organise a group art exhibition, featuring the works of three noted Chinese painters---Ma Wei, Zhou Linping and Xue He. The exhibition will begin today (February 25) and will continue till March 1 at Gallery Chitrak in Dhanmondi. //////A street play, titled Ekusher Chetona Shudhu Ekti Diner Noy was staged at Thakurgaon Government Boys' High School premises last Tuesday.//////I'm a sports fanatic -- be it football or cricket. However, the latter manages to steal my heart more. I have previously enjoyed a good game in stadiums overseas. But this time around the World Cup has reached our homes. I'll remain content within my four walls as my physical condition will not allow me to go to the venue to watch a game. However, addas have been planned as I had already told directors to keep my schedule free for game days. The passion and excitement have reached a new level as the tournament is at our doorsteps and I can't wait to hear Sakib and his golden boys roar like tigers on the field. Although the first match disappointed me a bit, I haven't lost hope yet. I don't know who will be crowned champions, but I sure wish that Bangladesh will be able to lift the silverware this year. My second favorites are India. I was there at the stadium in Malaysia when Bangladesh won the ICC Trophy in 1997. The experience brought tears to my eyes and I hope for a repetition of such a feat. //////A six-day exhibition of clay jewellery by artiste Shahidul Hasan [of Savar], beginning on February 19, is on in Natore.

The answer is anybody's best guess. Taken by a rule of thumb we spend a significant number of hours waiting, which may add up to one-fourth or one-fifth of a lifetime. In the words of South African playwright Michael Wentworth, we are wasting lots of living in waiting. //////Our finance minister has always been found expounding innovative ideas on administration and governance. Of his many such ideas we may mention two here -- one is decentralisation of budget to district level and the latest one is to adopt American Spoils system in our bureaucratic structure.//////Devils incarnate are beating a retreat.

We all are living like a house without a roof. We are living our lives without the big oak tree that used to give shade to the other trees; whom other trees could lean on for love, support and strength.//////Tbilisi, capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, occupied by Bolshevist Russia.//////Imagine a job where you yourself decide when and how long you will work. Where you don't have to wake up early in the morning and rush through the tiring traffic jam to reach office within the stipulated time and where there is no boss breathing down your neck all the time.
