In any civilised society, it would be the task of government to quickly go into a handling of such a crime, nab the culprits, bring them to trial and thereby restore public confidence in the rule of law.

The National Farmers' Market Week is officially designated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) with a view to encourage consumers to visit their local farmers' market, to purchase locally grown fruits and vegetables and to support economic viability of the farmers.I think, Bangladesh being an agricultural country with economy largely based no farming, we can also organize such Farmers' Market Week by setting temporary markets near the upazila/district railway and bus stations and other suitable places to help and encourage our farmers to sell their agricultural produces directly to the consumers in prices reasonable to both growers and buyers. Such market weeks may be observed during the main harvesting period of different crops.

In contrast, mega 'road projects' are big 'money spinners' and cream is there for the licking! Possibly that logic has predominated the priorities! Who cares for bad roads, better a road than no road. If buses can't ply, there are always bullock carts, to go! So why bother about it?//////In Bangladesh we rarely call someone a hero as the number is very few but when it comes to Tareque Masud, he was, is and will be the ace of all heroes!

He brought glory to our country but still we could not save him. I participated in one of his classes while I was in a film making workshop in Dhaka and there he described what struggle he had to do with 'Matir Moyna'. Thanks to conspiracy, he screened it in many countries but could not show it to the people outside Dhaka. I realized that Tareque Masud did not take filmmaking as a profession but as his life and so he wanted everyone to call him 'feriwala' of films. We don't want to see any more deaths like thiswe don't want to lose any more heroes.//////Every loss does not restore. This loss is one of them. Alas, we have killed two great sons of our country- Tareque Masud and Mishuk Munier! Yes, it was a pre-planned murder, as we have given them poorly designed highways, unlicensed and traffic rule-ignorant drivers,irresponsible and corrupt authorities who prefer to remain indifferent to all these problems. They were performing the holy duty of serving our country with their own brilliance, but in return we have awarded them death.//////The government has become lightheaded from getting so much power that it is taking everything lightly.
