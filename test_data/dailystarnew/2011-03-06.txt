To lose it is again to be expected, for that is the rule with games, indeed with life itself. But when the Bangladesh cricket team put itself and the rest of the nation through misery on Friday, it was not winning or losing we were concerned with. It was something more. It was simple awareness of how much lower a team playing cricket on a global scale could go. To be washed out for a miserable fifty eight runs is deep embarrassment. On Friday, it was a whole country rendered immobile by images of Bangladesh's batsmen stepping on to the pitch and stepping off it in quick progression. It was not just bad cricket. It was no cricket at all.//////Very rarely do a team's actions and words combine to paint as clear a picture as Bangladesh's performance against Ireland and their captain Shakib Al Hasan's words did at the post-match briefing on the Friday before their debacle against the West Indies.

Well, fact and figuratively a bit more than a nap because I missed the whole match. Let me explain, if you are in the mood for it. Having got back from Moses where a whole lot of issues were addressed and many of the world's problems were solved, although those were a different set of stories, I had settled down comfortably for the afternoon matinee, namely WI v Ban. As an armchair critic my comfort levels are important to me. So like a reclining Buddha I was comfortably, and as it turned out though, a bit too comfortably, not too relaxed mind you at that point, in a state of considered preparedness for the Bangladesh innings. Just in time though to catch Kayes being caught low down in front by the keeper. Ignore the unintended pun, please. Tamim I had missed altogether because I was a little late on the draw with the remote, but he was not, as was quite apparent I later learnt, courtesy of several uncomplimentary slowmos. And then, total black out.//////Borussia Dortmund opened up a 15-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Friday night with a 1-0 home win against Cologne to take another step closer to the German league title.//////England's failed 2018 football World Cup bid tried to use Prince Andrew's relationship with the Qatari royal family to secure a voting alliance, a report said Saturday.//////Sir Alex Ferguson has told his Manchester United players that they must show the character of champions and bounce back against Liverpool on Sunday.//////Manchester City defender Kolo Toure's failed drugs test was a result of him using his wife's weight-loss product, his former manager at Arsenal Arsene Wenger said on Friday.//////The title race for this season's professional football league is heating up as Abahani, the defending champions and Muktijodhha Sangsad are giving each other a hard time at the top of the table. //////A fan tried to stab Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho at a Spanish airport but ended up injuring his bodyguard instead, Spain's Cadena Ser radio network reported Friday.//////Food inflation soared 0.9 percentage points to hover around a 30-month high in January, amid rising prices on both domestic and international markets.

The euro hovered near a four-month high and a key resistance area against the dollar on Thursday, supported by expectations a European Central Bank meeting will pave the way for rate rises later in the year. Investors have pushed the euro up about 3 percent from a low hit on Feb. 14 in anticipation that ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet will sharpen the central bank's anti-inflation rhetoric as oil prices continue to soar. Some market players think the bank will switch three-month liquidity operations back to capped-limit, variable rate tenders a mainly symbolic step in the phasing out of crisis support that could also help clear the way for a rate hike. Some traders said there is a risk the euro could slip after the ECB meeting since many market players are already counting on the central bank to send strong signals that it will raise rates to counter inflation. Data showed last week that speculators' long positions in the euro have soared to their highest level since mid-October, pointing to the risk of profit-taking. But market players also said the currency's outlook in the longer term hinges on where oil prices are going, as the dollar comes under pressure from rising oil prices. Many investors believe that higher oil prices will push central banks to raise interest rates to combat inflation but that the Federal Reserve is likely to lag the ECB and others, maintaining broadly simulative policy to support growth. The US currency also hit a one-month low of 81.57 yen on Wednesday, though thick bids around 81.50 yen, were likely to limit further losses in the near-term. //////The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) is erecting tin-shed rooms on the roof of its office building defying objections from Public Works Department. //////Twenty distinguished female personalities in a statement yesterday said Prof Muhammad Yunus' removal brings dishonour to the 20 million poor women who were empowered by Grameen Bank. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday asked the navy to remain ever ready in the nation's interest to resist any sort of aggression through the country's marine borders.//////Speakers at a discussion yesterday urged the government to implement national women development policy and take effective steps to stop violence and repression against women both at home and work.//////Kuwait Ambassador in Dhaka Ali Ahmad Ebraheem S Al Dafiri made a courtesy call on BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia at her Gulshan office yesterday evening.//////Eight people were killed and six others injured in separate road accidents in Coxs Bazar, Satkhira and Dinajpur districts on Friday and yesterday.//////The people of the country need to look back in the War of Liberation to remember their roots and identity, said Foreign minister Dr Dipu Moni.//////Some distinguished personalities in the port city yesterday threatened to launch a massive movement if the government does not overturn its decision to remove Nobel laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus from Grameen Bank.//////LGRD Minister Syed Ashraful Islam yesterday said this is the last chance to try war criminals.//////President Zillur Rahman yesterday emphasised on the need for measures to ensure specialised eye care for the rural people, easily and at a reasonable cost.//////A middle-aged woman jumped to death from a nine-storey building at Mazar Road in the city's Dakshin Khan yesterday.//////Some NGOs yesterday demanded removal of the director general (DG) of Department of Shipping for his alleged involvement in different irregularities.//////State Minister for Science and ICT Yeafesh Osman yesterday urged all to extend their help for building a digital Bangladesh.//////Chairman of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Dr Mizanur Rahman yesterday said the number of extra-judicial killing has been decreased and human rights situation has also been improved in the country.//////The Bangladesh chapter of UK-based English Speaking Union (ESU) yesterday selected two Bangladeshi students for an international public speaking competition to be held in London in May this year.//////Some environmentalists at a rally yesterday demanded the government's effective measures to stop hill cutting to save the environment and biodiversity.//////Nurses Association of Bangladesh (Nab), a body to protect the interest of nurses, was formed on Friday following an emergency meeting presided over the former president of Bangladesh Diploma Nurses Association Khadija Begum.//////A Dhaka University student was critically injured as a lorry hit him at Motijheel in the city last night.//////A three-day long youth leadership summit concluded at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in the city yesterday.//////Today is the 63rd founding anniversary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB).//////A seminar and workshop on "Promoting functional English through academic accreditation in non-English speaking countries" was held at a city hotel recently. //////At least 8,100 tonnes of urea fertiliser have been kept under the open sky for more than a week due to space shortage at Mohendranagar buffer godown in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, making it vulnerable to damage if there is any sudden rain or storm. //////Grameen Bank staff, borrowers as well as general people under the banner of 'conscious citizens' yesterday formed human chains in upazila and district headquarters across the country protesting the move to remove Professor Muhammad Yunus from the bank's managing director (MD) post.//////Workers of Edruk Limited, the oldest pharmaceutical factory of the country, yesterday stopped work to press home their demand for increase in wages and making their jobs permanent.//////Van puller Rabiul Islam, arrested after murder of schoolteacher Arifa Khatun on Saturday last, was sent to jail on expiry of his five days remand yesterday.//////The residence of Kalmakanda Upazila Chairma came under attack allegedly by local Jubo League activists on Friday night.//////At least 150 people were injured in a clash between the inhabitants of two adjacent villages in Baniachang upazila over purchase of a land for a local mosque.//////Security forces yesterday arrested the Rangamati unit president of Pahari Chhattra Parishad (PCP), student front of United People's Democratic Front (UPDF), from Naniachar upazila headquarters.

Even if the batting was good we could not reach the target. It all happened only because the bowlers did not give their best. How could the Indians score 370? It only happened because Mashrafe was not there! He has the heart of a real tiger. This all-rounder had a great contribution in beating India last time and was also the Man of the Match then. The whole nation, especially our captain will now miss the bowling of Mashrafe. Injured Mashrafe could play better than the other bowlers. We miss the 'Narail Express'! //////I bought a ticket of the Agnibina Express two days before my journey to Jamalpur from Dhaka and eagerly waited for a pleasant train journey. //////Currently, I along with my only son have been visiting Bangladesh. We have no words to express our sense of shame at what happened in the country during the last two weeks. That politicians can stoop so low as to indulge in a free and uninhibited use of obscene language and extremely objectionable gestures is something no one in any country can imagine. The nation expects a lot from them. Millions of people elected them and they cannot accept the behaviours some lawmakers displayed and the language they used beginning from Arial Beel issue to ICC World Cup, stock market scam to countrywide strike and many more. Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. It is true that you may fool all the people for some time, you can even fool some people all the time; but you can't fool all the people all the time.//////It was very sad and unexpected news. We all know that in Shariatpur a girl named Hena who was raped by a relative died later after being whipped. But the first post-mortem report found no injury marks on her body! From this we have again learnt how corrupt were the medical and police personnel in this case. //////The editorial of February 9, 2011 titled BNP blamed for prices and shares chaos is a piece of wise reflection. The editorial rightly said that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's remarks "are not only shockingly surprising, but also a clear hint that the government is looking for scapegoats to pin blame over the issues. People are really astonished by the remarks of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. How could she say such preposterous things? By such remarks she is demeaning herself. In future we hope she will refrain from making such remarks.//////Pinaki Roy's front page lead news report and the photographs alongside shows the might of influence, that overrules laws and executive orders, even issued by the government! The opinion by a Shyampur resident, that the land (or river) grabber called Shafiqur, just does not care; as he has the government machinery under his thumb! Powerful 'thumbs' indeed!//////We always need bumps to recall things, to see things. We are such a nation! We need a market to crash before getting to know that the market is dangerously overheated. We need people to be dead squeezed between buses, stamped under wheels to see those reckless drivers driving city buses. We need kids to be hit in the head and paralyzed by bricks falling from under-construction buildings to see that the constructors are not taking precautionary steps to prevent accidents! However, we do not need anything to forget all these in no time! We were shocked to see our government's bizarre attempt to grab huge area of cultivable lands, evict inhabitants from their homes to build Airport when we are facing food scarcity. In Cox's Bazar, those speedboats are dangerously being driven in the shore packed with hundreds of bathing tourists. Any day we would hear somebody is injured or dead having been hit by one of those boats. Then again, we will take steps to repel them off the shore, not before that. After a while they will come back again. //////A day labourer's 14-year-old daughter Hena was whipped to death after being raped recently following a fatwa passed by the Imam of a local mosque in Shariatpur. In the post-mortem report prepared by Shariatpur Sadar Hospital there was no mention of any injury marks on Hena's body. But a fresh post-mortem found severe injury marks on her body. A report was submitted to the High Court in which a huge difference between the two post-mortem reports was found. Receiving the report the HC has directed the authorities concerned to take action against them who were involved in preparing the first post-mortem report. We are grateful to the high court for this.According to the direction of the high court, the government and the authorities concerned should come forward to make people aware and take action against such unlawful fatwa.//////The war against cigarette may be heating up, but a victory for all those out to rid this planet of this addiction is not going to come easily.

They live as quadruple minorities under present social and political institutions. In a patriarchal and male-dominated society, they are a gender minority. In a Muslim-dominated country they are a religious minority. In a nationalist, Bangali-dominated society they are an ethnic minority. Within their own patriarchal community they face marginalisation, exploitation, and increasingly, violence. A strong political movement exists to resist this multiple marginalisation, but it has not been able to create enough resonance within the wider political structure. //////Nurjahan has been made into an icon amongst the Mughal women and her image has been popularised in literature, songs and poetry. However, recent day scholarly studies have somewhat deflated the image of Nurjahan by introducing a whole line of Mughal women who held powerful positions and negotiated important and sensitive political treaties. Yet Nurjahan remains one of the most extraordinary Mughal women because of her assertive female individuality that challenged the normative role of a Muslim woman. //////I was surprised and saddened to turn on the television one day last October and see every channel flagrantly attacking writer-activist Arundhati Roy for a speech she made in favour of Kashmir's independence from India. //////Ho Chi Minh signs an agreement with France which recognizes Vietnam as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the French Union.//////
