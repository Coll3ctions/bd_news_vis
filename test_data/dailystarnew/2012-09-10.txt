Bangladesh government could not settle the Padma bridge issue with the World Bank because of a few dishonest people though the World Bank identified those people long ago. The government did not take any step to punish them in spite of repeated warnings from the World Bank and thus the project loan slipped through the government's fingers. Then the government decided to implement the project with its own fund.//////This is just incredulous how the Awami League-led government succeeded in bringing every important sector of the country to a very precarious position: Education, banking, readymade garment, communications, law and order, share market, gas, power, and water the list will go on.
