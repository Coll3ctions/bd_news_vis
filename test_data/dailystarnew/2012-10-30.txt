Yet it is a metal that never caught the fancy of the world commodity markets. Its price has remained relatively stagnant at around $2,100 per tonne since the '80s. Where copper prices have tripled over the same timeline, aluminum that is found in everything from soda cans to aircraft is an industry in decline. Industry leaders in the West have seen their collective fortunes fade from $200bn a year some five years ago to an estimated $65bn currently. The industry is in the midst of retrenchment and consolidation. Whereas Western aluminum powerhouses are in a state of decline, China is forging ahead with ever-increasing production capacities that defy predictions.//////The fanfare with which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi launched a public service-delivery scheme in Rajasthan based on the ////// (literally, foundation) unique identity (UID) number should cause serious worry in the Congress party -- assuming it has a good survival instinct.//////With Bangladeshi leader of opposition Khaleda Zia in New Delhi for a week-long visit, one can expect a flurry of substantive exchanges. There are two main reasons why Zia's visit is more than a courtesy call. First, Bangladesh goes to polls sometime late next year, and Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could very well come to power. After all, a mere 3% difference in vote share is what separates the current opposition from the ruling Awami League regime. Given the massive anti-incumbency factor that all incumbent governments in Bangladesh face, that's hardly a comfortable margin. Besides, it hasn't helped the Awami one bit that its tenure has seen several (alleged) scams. The BNP will surely try and capitalise on these missteps. //////Visit of Begum Khaleda Zia, leader of opposition and the Chairperson of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), is one of the first such visits by her. There are anticipations and expectations from this visit given BNP's relations with India in the past. From 2001 to 2006, during the four-party alliance government's rule in Bangladesh, the relationship between India and Bangladesh was uneasy and concrete result of that was official ritualistic relation without any substantial progress to showcase. The only visit that Begum Zia took while in office was in 2006 which was followed by a visit to Pakistan, obviously to keep its core constituency at home happy. //////On Monday, in their final debate, Mitt Romney denounced President Obama for creating tension and turmoil with Israel and chided him for having skipped Israel during his travels in the Middle East.

The longest waves, also known as radio waves, can travel far distances making them perfect for transmitting data to televisions, radios and cell phones. The next region of the spectrum is microwaves. These smaller waves carry information to satellites and weather radars, as well as impart energy via microwave ovens. The remaining electromagnetic spectrum consists of terahertz, infrared, visible and ultraviolet radiation as well as x-rays and gamma rays. As with radio and microwaves, these regions are continuously explored and researched for new device applications.//////As much as 44 billion tons of nitrogen and 850 billion tons of carbon stored in arctic permafrost, or frozen ground, could be released into the environment as the region begins to thaw over the next century as a result of a warmer planet, according to a new study led by the U.S. Geological Survey. This nitrogen and carbon are likely to impact ecosystems, the atmosphere, and water resources including rivers and lakes. For context, this is roughly the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere today.//////The need to speed up work on a reliable system for predicting potential aftershocks in the days following a strong earthquake has become more urgent, say US scientists, after a rare quake earlier this year was found to have triggered many large, and potentially damaging, earthquakes around the world.//////There's good news from Antarctica this fall: The seasonal hole in the ozone layer above the continent reached its smallest maximum extent and second smallest average in 20 years thanks to warm air temperatures.//////The ostrich-like dinosaurs that roamed the Earth millions of years ago were adorned with feathers, used to attract a mate or protect offspring rather than for flight, according to the findings of Canadian scientists released on Thursday.//////Stars ripped from their home galaxies as they collide with other galaxies can get slung into giant invisible cocoons of dark matter, researchers say, which might explain mysterious radiation pervading the sky.//////Kirlian photography is a collection of photographic techniques used to capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges.
