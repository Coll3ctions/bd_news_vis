The few who cowered before the Pakistani junta instead of siding with the cause of truth and justice were the scum of the earth. Once again, we need one like Bangabandhu at a time when our enemies from home and abroad are humiliatingly our flag, earned at the price of an ocean of blood. How long will we live in poverty, fear and corruption? Does not that thunderous voice of freedom and justice of our father of the Bangladeshi Nation ring in our minds? Where is everybody? Wake up again!!//////Since the start of stock market disaster, more than a year ago finance minister, BB governor, SEC chief and other experts of stock market regularly gave advice to investors so as to judge the fundamentals of the Public Limited Companies (PCL) before investing their money.

Nowadays life has become largely dependent on technology particularly for the new generation. They need to adapt themselves accordingly in all respects.//////A few days ago we witnessed a tragic accident that occurred in the early morning at the crossing between Bijoy Sarani and Sangsad Bhaban (Northern side) roads.
