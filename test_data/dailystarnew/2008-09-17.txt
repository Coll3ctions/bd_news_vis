It is not that the deteriorating state of law and order has escaped citizens' attention, but when no less an individual than the Home Adviser admits to the growing problem, it says something more about the situation. It was only on Monday that a businessman was killed in broad daylight in the city. And over the past few days, there has generally been a spate of crime committed in different parts of the nation's capital at a time when Eid-ul-Fitr approaches. If such is the condition in Dhaka, the situation in other regions of the country can only be imagined.//////THE drawbacks of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the medicare facility of the last resort for the poor and middle income group patients and the premier medical teaching institution of the country, are much too known to bear anyrepetition. //////A veteran politician was unambiguous about it the other day. Begum Khaleda Zia, he informed the country loudly and with a clearly perceptible sense of happiness, would provide leadership to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party for as long as she lived.

Exhorting the people to resist the evil designs of foreign powers or aliens has been the most popular diversionary tactic used by our leaders. I confess therefore that I have always been highly sceptical about the conspiracy theories floated by our garments industry from time to time as an explanation for the random and increasingly frequent violence plaguing their industry. But the specific events of Diganta Sweaters that occurred a few weeks ago have changed my point of view. I watched at great length the innumerable news reports and talk shows that day and read also many of the newspaper reports on the same. //////The stock market regulator yesterday approved IPO plans of

It always makes me wonder how can these people take the foods so nonchalantly. Is it because they are not aware of the consequences, or just don't care, and the sight and smell of the cuisines are too tempting to resist ? It is quite evident that the conditions that prevail in these mobile restaurants are not up to the standard. Hygiene and cleanliness are apparently missing and preparing of foods is done in a shabby manner, which exposes the consumers to different health hazards. //////The Daily Star carried the story on "Rebellion in Tiger camp" in its front page on 15 September 2008. It reminded us of the traditional fear of facing new challenges (and opportunities) from outside - and the first reaction was no different from the tradition - one that in subtle words flags 'patriotism' but effectively protects the status quo, and despises (rather envies) the new movers to avail market opportunities as 'opportunists'! Unfortunately, such juxtaposition is all too common in our intellectual and media culture! Absolutely, there is no attempt to understand and explain what is going on! The sports reporter owes some obligation to the readers; and I raise some questions to him.//////The Keane Bridge, an icon of the glorious history of Sylhet-- the sacred land of great Muslim saint Hazrat Shahjalal (R)-- was constructed over the river Surma in 1936. From the very beginning, Keane bridge is known all over Bangladesh. Thela is part of this bridge. It is a local word; it indicates those people who help rickshaw pullers pushing their rickshaws from behind. Thela is not available on other bridges. But in this respect Keane bridge is different from others. //////The real picture of the street children of Bangladesh is very pathetic. Today's child is tomorrow's future, but these children are deprived of all sorts of basic rights. They have no particular place to live in. About 5 lakh street children of our country live simply an aimless life and completely depend on others' charity. They are found begging on the street or in different public places or doing risky jobs. It is a matter of great regret that people do not care to notice them.//////There is no doubt that far too many people in Dhaka city, the eleventh mega city of the world, drive cars. This leads to congestion on the roads, pollution in the air and of course, a serious depletion of one the world's most precious natural resources--oil.If more people were to turn the bicycle as a means of transport, think how much more pleasant our city would be! The bicycle costs a mere fraction of the cost of cars and needs far less maintenance. They take up far less parking space and are almost silent, even when ridden at speed. They also provide people with a very healthy form of exercise. This would surely benefit the individual and the nation. //////If a Bangladeshi can hack your site in 11 hours, Pentagon and others would hack it in 11 minutes. How can you arrest them? I hope you are aware that only the exceptionally talented programmers can become successful hackers. If someone wanted to hack your site with bad intention, he was intelligent enough to hide himself from you. So, do not be complacent that you have tracked him down in 24 hours. Use him, utilise him and others like him to make your information safe.//////The present government and especially the law enforcers of Bangladesh are to be given their due credit for taking serious and specific steps in improving Dhaka's traffic condition. //////Over population is the main problem which includes Bangladesh in the category-- third world. Still it is blessed with many treasures and one of them is aquatic being. Fish can improve the country's economic condition as it can be easily exported to other countries. But already many kinds of fish have become extinct due to human activities. Rivers are mostly polluted by industrial effluents. As a result, many aquatic beings are affected by detoxification and finally become extinct. Laws are already there to save different species of fish but none are followed. //////I'm writing about the BCS. I've completed graduation from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. During that time the last political government started corrupt practices for recruiting officials in all departments. Therefore, I became hopeless and decided to go to the USA. I also got a scholarship in the year 2008. But by that time a new government had come to power. After thirty-seven years of liberation, Bangladesh wants to live again. If the people on whom the country's administration is dependent are not honest, courageous and patriotic, then development is never possible. //////The newspapers are full of fall-outs and mergers in different sectors, including economic and political. Dhaka political stock exchange is hot, before the coming elections. The stands and antics of the political parties are confusing for the voters. This is the penalty we are paying for the sustained systems losses since we gained freedom and/or independence in 1971.//////It is a pity that the Awami League leaders could meet and sit together with the Jamaat leaders, after being invited by Saudi Ambassador to an Iftar party. Jaamatis are, by and large, razakars, no doubt about that but how could the Awami League play a dual role in a different context and on a different pretext. Before election, the Awami League could make an alliance even with the fundamentalist groups while claiming that the party is championing the cause of secularism. How long can it play such an hypocritical role? Is this the Awami League that gave overwhelming leadership in 1971 to create an independent secular Bengali nation?//////Recently, the CA has directed all the schools in Dhaka city to start the morning shift at 07:30am just to avoid traffic jam during office hours. Well, it may attain the objective to some extent. We have to think about the consequences of such order related to the level of students, locality, availability of transport, number of children in a family, availability of school bus/van, affordability of parents etc. However, it may be a temporary arrangement and the authorities have to find some other ways to resolve the traffic jam issue. //////Finance ordinance, 2008 which has been given effect to from 1-7-2008, provides that any person responsible for paying any amount on account of interest of post office savings Bank A/C shall deduct tax at 10% on such amount as excludes Tk 1,50,000/- during the year. Now the post office has been realising tax for the financial year 2007-08 at 10% of the interest whatever its amount is, at each withdrawal on deposits made before 1-7-2008 in postal FD/savings A/C. The post office is of the opinion that the benefit of tax relief up to the income of Tk 1,50,000/- shall be allowed only in respect of deposits made on 1-7-2008 and afterwards. In a court order, the Shanchay Patra holders are allowed interest up to 1,50,000/- a year without deduction of tax at source in respect of all Shanchay Patras, no question about those being purchased before 1-7-2008. //////The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) has requested all government employees and officials to submit their wealth statement to the government (The Financial Express, 09 Sept. 08).
