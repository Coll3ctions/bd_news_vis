Such intermittent hope, whenever it is roused in us by the nation's political classes, does wonders for our collective imagination and leads us into thinking that perhaps the time has indeed arrived for democracy to actually dig deeper roots in Bangladesh. It is this kind of feeling which took hold of us on Friday, when parliamentarians from both the ruling Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party gathered on one platform to declare their unity of purpose in alleviating poverty in the country.

The highlight of the week was the yen intervention by the BOJ for the first time in 6 years. The yen edged up against the dollar and other currencies on Thursday as Japanese authorities stayed away from the currency market after their massive yen-selling operation the previous day. The euro hit its highest in more than a month against the dollar and the yen after strong demand at a Spanish bond auction prompted some buying in the single currency, triggering stop-loss buy orders which accelerated its move higher. Speculation Tokyo may step back in to sell the yen capped its upside after Japan sold an estimated 1.8 trillion yen ($21.14 billion) for dollars to stem yen strength on Wednesday. Japan's first currency intervention in six years knocked the yen from a 15-year high versus the dollar and analysts said the move showed Japan was firmly resolved to stem yen strength. Analysts said wariness of more intervention may limit the dollar's downside to 83 yen -- close to where Japan was seen beginning its yen selling on Wednesday. Prime Minister Naoto Kan reiterated on Thursday Japan would take decisive steps on yen rises, Jiji news agency reported, while Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he expected intervention would stabilize the forex market. Investors awaited comments from US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner later in the day for any hints of Washington's reaction to the yen selling as investors focus on how intervention is received by

We never stop to think about how much the little girl who made it gets. Now that's not our fault we're not the ones paying them poor wages. But we can help them.//////Your staff correspondent's interesting report on the matter,published in your pages on 2nd. September, is indeed a very noble step undertaken by 'Prothom Alo', a popular Bangla daily. It enables the blind to listen to the newspaper being read out, which has been established through access to a new website link!//////The Biman, Bangladesh Airlines, authorities have bowed to the demands of the Biman employees. We are not sure if all the demands were logically acceptable. But how far was it worth to accept the way the employees have compelled the authorities to take such a defensive posture? They beat up some of the officers to realise their demands and finally have succeeded.//////Due to negligence of the AG office, the employees of Dhaka Zoo didn't get Eid bonus and the monthly salary for August, 2010. //////Thanks to the Daily Star for its editorial entitled "A matter of rights with obligations. Let our lawmakers pay taxes"(September 5,2010). Let our MPs correct the situation and convince the people of Bangladesh that lawmakers are not and cannot be above the law. Let them begin paying their dues to the republic. The nation's members of parliament are already some of the best-paid legislators in the world, a fact that has drawn fire from their constituents who believe they should be paid less. It is ridiculous that our MPs go home with huge perks per month while professionals like doctors earn less per month though they work more than 12 hours a day seven days a week! Our MPs? A few hours a week with more perks just for showing up! Take the money, but spare us the hypocrisy. Integrity of MPs should be measured by the same ruler they use for the same country. They really don't care about the welfare of ordinary citizens. //////Thank you for your piece on TV advertising (Star Business Wednesday, September 1, 2010). //////Not an engineer, not a doctor, not those brightest students working as teacher in the public universities ( BUET, DU), not those brightest boys and girls who joined in the civil service (not foreign or customs cadres) that will receive higher salary- it is those who joined the central bank (popularly known as Bangladesh Bank in our country) who will receive much higher salaries than those sections stated above. I came to know this from the newspapers some days before and was waiting for the reaction on this issue from respective corners. //////Once Jute was our main exportable commodity and it was called The Golden Fibre of Bangladesh. During the last three decades, farmers became reluctant to grow jute. Because farmers did not get their cost of production.

The report says when the victim was crossing the border, he was caught, beaten up severely by BSF, and not only this, the tendons of his hands and legs were cut off and his body was thrown into the river Padma. How barbaric !!! What are my dear policymakers doing regarding the matter? I think he might have been an ordinary man but his life is as valuable as that of Very Very Important Persons. The authorities concerned are hereby requested to save our poor villagers from BSF's aggression. Effective steps will be taken, I expect. Only flag meeting is not enough to resolve the problem.//////A picture appeared in The Daily Star on Tuesday, Aug 24, which shows some daring women braving the speedy vehicles of the busy road climbing the grilled road divider and crossing the road in a dangerous manner when the foot bridge is just a few yards away. The letter writer (01-09-10) felt very much concerned for such activities and requested others not to cross the road in such a life-threatening manner. But we who are leaving in East Rampura are forced to take such dangerous steps regularly many times in a day as there is no foot over bridge over DIT road at the East Rampura intersection. East Rampura is a thickly populated area where majority are low and middle class people. Kitchen market, other markets, bus stands, mosque etc. are on the other side of the two way DIT road. From dawn till midnight there is continuous flow of vehicles --bumper to bumper- on both sides of the DIT road. Every one leaving in East Rampura has to cross the DIT road endangering his/her life to meet the everyday needs of the life. A foot over bridge is very much essential there. In the last year of the past govt. a foundation stone for a foot over bridge was laid there but with the passage of time it has now vanished. Many accidents occurred there in the past causing even death. Minor accidents have become a regular feature. But the authorities concerned have remained silent. //////I very sincerely thank Saleh Ayub for his letter of September 3rd where he wrote, "Almost every alternate day a poor Bangladeshi is killed by the BSF (Border Security Force) of India." It is not only a matter of shame but also a matter concern for the nation, whose citizens are getting killed on a regular basis by the neighbouring giant and the people keep on watching their movies, television channels, importing their goods and commodities and so on, as if rewarding them for their act of killing. //////The cabinet's decision for the ministers to submit summary tax statements in violation of the AL's electoral manifesto of 2008 reminds me of 'Animal Farm' a fable by George Orwell where Napoleon, the pig, set out some principles to rally the animals against manor farm owner Mr. Jones. But when Napoleon's power was firmly established after exploiting the principle of equality, the principle that 'all animals are equal' were changed into 'all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others' to justify the ruling class's special privilege. //////The recent decision of 10% cut from any fixed deposit or sanchay patra with retrospective effect appears to be irrational. These who went for fixed deposit earlier then July entered into a kind of financial contract with the government that they would get certain percent of interest if they deposit such amount of money. But the sudden decision of the government of reducing the interest on money deposited earlier than July 2010 amounts to a breach of contract. //////Although smoking in public places has been banned by the government for quite some time now, people are still seen smoking anywhere and everywhere. Even during the holy month of Ramadan, smokers are lighting cigarettes and puffing out clouds of smoke onto the faces of other people. If I recall correctly, only a year ago, newspapers were flooded with reports of smokers being penalized publicly. Some wrongdoers also had to endure the humiliation of doing sit-ups in front of the ever curious general masses of Bangladesh. But now it seems everyone has forgotten that smoking publicly was ever a punishable crime. //////With the High Court declaring the 7th amendment to the constitution illegal, H.M.

However, the greed for more without befitting platform and fundamentals, brings its own challenges and questions in people's minds. //////The downhill slide of our polities is continuing unabated. Sadly, nobody seems to pay any heed to this frustrating state of our polities. Ego, vendetta and expediency still reign supreme. Even during the intervention of 1/11, which was initially well received, the feeling that utter misrule and poor governance would be arrested failed to inspire people to promote good politics. The politicians think that all actions of such interventions will be scrapped to free them of the shame, as is happening now.//////
