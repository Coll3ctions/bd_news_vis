understandable. With the higher judiciary directing the Election Commission to allow a number of individuals earlier barred on legal grounds from contesting the general elections to take part in the polls after all, A.T.M.

The CEC, in a clear tone of exasperation, has been sarcastic about these developments. The EC, he has said, will go on accepting candidacies till the day before the polls if the higher judiciary says it must.//////WE express our deep concern at the looming likelihood of mass scale retrenchment of migrant workers around the world as a fallout of the global economic recession.

However, people are left wondering more why BNP that ruled the country in the immediate past failed so miserably to achieve some of the goals like meeting the food gap and energy crisis in their earlier tenure. Strangely, without admitting their lapses and mistakes, both parties are making commitments to redeem their pledges if they are voted to power again. But the mother of all advices for any party vying for power is : do not commit what can't be delivered. And as for BNP, already their load of unfulfilled promises is excessively heavy. //////BANGLADESH can earn a lot of foreign currency based on the tourism products it has. Because tourism products are unique to respective countries and thus cannot be competed. It is being observed that many countries in the world are earning a big amount of foreign currency based on one or two tourism products. For example, our neighbouring country Nepal, with the highest mountain peak Everest in the world has taken a position in the world tourism market and earns huge amount of foreign currency. Bangladesh has a number of tourism products like Cox's Bazar, the longest sea-beach in the world; Kuakata from where one can get the rare chance of viewing the sun-rise and sun-set from the same point; Sundarban the largest mangrove forest in the world with the rare and special Royal Bengal Tiger.

The question is, will we be able to keep such heat within manageable proportion and if electoral malpractices would remain restricted to a bearable minimum? Already two major alliances have accused each other of breach of electoral conduct. One hopes that the 29 December election sets some standard worth emulating, particularly when the reconstituted Election Commission has embarked upon a commendable process aimed at ensuring a fair and free poll.//////IT is a shame that only 13 out of 760 MPs were present to pay tribute to the watch and ward personnel who were shot dead on December 13 in the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament.

One year on after the devastating cyclone many of the surviving victims have overcome the impact with this or that help or support and their perseverance. In this resilient people's pursuit to recovery, microcredit, already a proven tool of poverty alleviation, has played a successful supportive role. One year on many have already recovered, many are still recovering, and many are even advancing further after recovery. Here is a case study.//////One would have expected this, albeit unfortunately, from an undemocratic elected government, but to be handed an anti-people, anti-poor city development plan via the age-old tactful bureaucracy at fag end of an extended caretaker government, whose primary laudable mission was to bring the nation on a virtuous track is downright insulting and a stinker.//////Dhaka will be the second largest megacity by the year 2015.

Around this time of the year shopping malls are usually teeming with serious shoppers on the lookout for bargains. This year, though, the crowds have thinned out considerably. TV show hosts from Oprah to Martha to Steven and Chris are going cheap by brainstorming craft ideas that one can make at home and save that shopping trip to the gift store or avoid dipping into the pockets. Gifts are advertised every day that cost from ten dollars to a hundred. But then again, the spirit of giving can't be denied, so presents have to be bought, sales to be sought and a trip to the shopping malls made. //////(Oral account of Amalesh Sen, 23 years old in 1971, footballer from Bogra)//////Thalassaemia is the most common congenital disorder in the world including Bangladesh.

It could launch Bangladesh as a model of a relatively prosperous Muslim majority country or it could return to the winner-take-all obstructionist politics of previous years. He said the stakes of USA in the 29th December elections are enormous.//////IRRESPECTIVE of religion, caste, creed, tribe or political bias this wakeup call is for every citizen of this country. There was a hair-raising news item printed on the first page of Daily Shangram on 7th December 2008. The news was about a secret meeting held on 5th December night to demolish all the liberation related sculptures in and around Dhaka University. They discussed the plan in details and final executive order was also given. A well thought out plan, perfect in timing and with attention to detail. Had there been no premature blow up of the plan, the perpetrators could have successfully created havoc in the law and order situation of the country. The action could have initiated a total political anarchy, difficult for the government to manage. The worst-case scenario is that the present political process of democracy would have been severely hindered obliging a new government designed by the domestic traitors and foreign perpetrators or Hostile Intelligence Service (HIS). //////Relations between India and Japan have made remarkable progress since Japanese Prime Minister Mori visited New Delhi in 2000. In December 2001, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited Tokyo, and the Indo-Japan Joint Declaration was announced. In 2005, when Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited New Delhi the two countries signed "Indo-Japan Partnership in New Asian Era: Strategic Orientation of Japan -India Global Partnership". In 2006 and 2007, two Prime Ministers, Manmohan Singh and Shinzo Abe held reciprocal visits and signed three declarations including "Indo-Japan Strategic Global Partnership". Significantly, on 22 October 2008, they announced "The Indo-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation". It was exceptional for Japan to establish formal security cooperation with India, making it the third country after the United States and Australia with whom Japan established such cooperation. Japan had restricted to use of force after World War II and the US has been Japan's principal ally since the 1960s. However, after the Gulf War, Japanese foreign policy has been changing gradually. Japan forged security cooperation with Australia in 2007, and India in 2008. The question arises why did Japan choose India as a partner of security cooperation?//////The Iraqi cabinet has approved a bill calling for all foreign soldiers except for American forces to pull out of the country by the end of July, a top official said December 16.//////Russia is ready to lease several Shchuka-B class (NATO codename Akula) nuclear submarines to India, the director of the Russian Federal Service for Military and Technical Cooperation said Dec. 15.//////The UN Security Council on December 16 unanimously adopted a resolution for the first time authorizing international land operations against audacious, armed pirates sheltering in Somalia.//////Two major religious books, namely, ////// and //////, confirm that the conjugality of man and woman and the process of human procreation set in following the great union of Adam and Eve. Later, as societies evolved and governments grew, union between man and woman was formalised through laws and social conventions. Most Muslim societies pursue the dictates of the Holy Quran. //////Fareed Zakaria's work is a masterpiece with great insights into the ever-changing 21st century world. This book is particularly significant when the US is suffering from multiple problems from anti-Americanism to unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, from disappearing dollars to the most-recent hit of subprime disaster and when the rest of the world is emerging with much more economic capability than the military capability which America enjoyed throughout the 20th century. Economic challenges have never been felt so harshly in world history as they are being felt in this 21st century. //////I couldn't believe it. Never in my wildest dreams had I imagined something like this would happen to me. Frustrated, anxious, irritable, I paced to-and-fro from shelf to shelf within the confines of our living room like a hungry tiger.
