We could force India responding to our longstanding demand of proper share of water and resolving boarder and land dispute with our leverage of being in the geo-strategic position. It is not that we are weak as a nation. Our success in garment sectors, peace keeping in the troubled regions of the world and in health, agriculture and microfinance is widely recognised. We have proved our worth in other sectors but unfortunately politicians are continuing to fail us and bungling all our plans to build a self-respecting strong Bangladesh. Who does not want good relation with its neighbours? Our prophet Muhammad (sm) sent letters to the neighbouring empires, with a view to make peace with them by spreading Islam, by not compromising the interest of Mulsim Ummah and Islam. Everybody welcomes relationship with India on the basis of justice and equal status and interest. We may be small in area but not in our mentality. This mentality now reverberates among the public. The sooner the government reads public sentiment, the better.//////It is very disgusting to read in the newspapers how some male teachers of a respected girls' school like Viqarunnisa in Dhaka are harassing female students, taking undue advantage of their position and authority.

It is the deadliest attack in the country since the World War II. The suspect is also a Norwegian, a right-wing fundamentalist Christian. Norway is mostly known as a peaceful country all over the world and such kind of atrocity in a peace-loving country is unbelievable. The prime minister said that the murderer turned the country from heaven to hell. Stern action should be taken against the responsible person so that no such heinous incident occurs in any country of the world.//////It is really unfortunate that a section of traders/retailers unjustly raises price of essential commodities during the holy month of Ramadan.

Mubarak has been detained since April this year on charge of ordering the killing of anti-regime protesters and corruption. However many dictators in the history considered themselves as benevolent rulers. They could not even think that they could do anything wrong. Many of them led very simple life. They believed that they always thought of the wellbeing of their countrymen. They took credit for their capability of taking merciless action against the wrong-doers and showing limitless kindness to the benefactors. //////The minister for education has expressed his dissatisfaction in a discussion meeting recently about private coaching. My daughter is now studying in class IX in a prominent school of this locality. Last year when she was about to appear in her first ever introduced JSC exam, we noticed with utmost dismay that some of the chapters of her textbooks had not even been taught. Having apprehended her misery, I wrote a letter to the rector of the institution seeking her immediate and appropriate action. But all in vain, as she did little with regards to completion of the syllabus.//////These days numerous medical diagnostic centres have sprouted up in the larger cities of Bangladesh but it seems that these have no guardians to look after the interest of the naive patients who do not understand the technicalities of numerous tests and which are beyond the budget of the middle class families.

It recognizes the arrival of the 'Gamchha' as a part of the dress and not just the local version of the towel!//////Banning women from driving is a cultural issue, and not a religious one. There is no evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah which justifies this. Therefore, KSA must present a logical basis for this cultural practice.

The difference is, this time the stage of the carnage was at the headquarters of a peaceful European country. For Norway was never known for flexing its military muscles in the international arena, or having a colonial empire in the past that might make it a legitimate target of international terrorism or militancy. //////WHAT actually happened during the so-called "revolt" of 1977 remains an open question more than thirty years later. It has been argued to me that there was never an actual revolt at all but a "bait and kill" intelligence operation meant to flush out Zia's enemies within the armed forces. The net in clumsy hands was cast widely. What is certain is that a great many men were executed in violation of all legal procedures that ought to have guaranteed them due process under the country's military code of justice. //////The Ottoman Empire is defeated in the Battle of Saint Gotthard by an Austrian army led by Raimondo Montecuccoli, resulting in the Peace of Vasvr.//////
