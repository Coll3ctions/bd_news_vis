The fourth version of the tournament will kick off with hosts Sri Lanka taking on Zimbabwe at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Hambantota today. There will be no glamorous opening ceremony to mark the start of the showpiece event, but many would argue that the fireworks have already begun in the form of the competitive warm-up games which bode well for the quality of the tournament to follow. //////Some eminent jurists yesterday said the politicians should now sit together to find out a solution to the problem regarding formation of a polls-time government. //////The BNP and its allies said the full verdict released on Sunday by the Supreme Court declaring illegal the caretaker government system was of no importance to them as they wanted the non-partisan administration restored. //////Biman passengers yesterday resorted to violent protests at the airport vandalising glasses of a counter of the national carrier in the wake of total collapse in flight schedules. //////Protesters in Afghanistan, Indonesia and Pakistan burnt US flags and chanted "Death to America" yesterday in renewed demonstrations over an anti-Islam film that already has provoked a week of unrest in Muslim world.//////Another prosecution witness yesterday told the International Crimes Tribunal-2 that war crimes accused Abdul Quader Mollah and his accomplices killed journalist Khondaker Abu Taleb at Mirpur's Jalladkhana during the Liberation War.//////Forty-eight Bangladeshi workers yesterday returned to the country from the United Arab Emirates as the authorities had rejected their new employer's plea to let them work on their existing visas. //////A writ petition has sought a High Court directive on the government to immediately recover Tk 3,547 crore taken by Hall-Mark Group and five other companies from the Sonali Bank through forgery.//////Leader of the Opposition Khaleda Zia yesterday strongly condemned the making of a blasphemous film on Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (SM) and urged the US government to immediately ban the film and its screening.//////Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission last night blocked popular video streaming website YouTube.com. //////The cabinet yesterday approved proposals for a law to rein in the multi-level marketing (MLM) business in the country. //////The whistleblower who last year assisted forest officials nabbing a tiger poaching ring came under attack by members of the same gang in the capital's Sayedabad on Friday night. //////Detectives yesterday arrested eight Rohingyas from a Fakirapool hotel in the capital on charge of attempting to go abroad using forged Bangladeshi passports and fake identities.//////A truly independent and strong Election Commission, and not a non-partisan caretaker government, is needed to hold a free, fair and neutral election, the Supreme Court has observed in its verdict on the constitution's 13th amendment case. //////At least three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were injured in a clash between a group of Islami Chhatra Shibir activists, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student organisation, and the law enforcers in front of Chandpur Government College yesterday.//////Prothom Alo Editor Matiur Rahman yesterday termed the recent media report involving him with Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed's refusal to become a minister false, baseless and misleading.//////Over 100 non-resident Bangladeshis (NRB) and Bangladeshi descendants living abroad have urged the prime minister to resolve government's dispute with Nobel Laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus and utilise him for national interest.//////India is going to invite more than a dozen top-ranking political figures from Bangladesh in next couple of months to warm up ties with ruling Awami League and remove "gap and misunderstanding" with the opposition.//////After sixteen months of the short order being passed by the Chief Justice in May 2011, we now have the full verdict on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, declaring the caretaker system void. Given the nature of the case the delay should not have happened. And the fact that the short verdict had very substantively transformed the country's political scenario, we feel constrained to say that to have taken that long to draw up the full verdict was an injudicious act on the part of the former Chief Justice, made even more so by the fact that the judgment was not a unanimous one, something that had not come to the pubic domain till recently, and that the verdict was signed more than a year after the former CJ had retired. //////The parliament is the central institution of democracy, and when it falters in its duties and, indeed the esteem in which it should be held by the people, it is surely a cause for concern. Sadly, this is the story of our growing democracy. //////Bangladesh lost their final warm-up match by five runs against Ireland at the Moors Sports Club Ground in Colombo yesterday -- a timely wake-up call just before their challenge in the tournament proper of the ICC World Twenty20.//////The Ireland team celebrated their five-run success against Bangladesh all the way yesterday regardless of it being just a warm-up game at the Moors Sports Club ground in Colombo. After the match Kevin O'Brien, who actually initiated the middle-order collapse taking three wickets in quick succession, didn't hesitate to say that it was a sweet revenge for their 3-0 loss in the T20 series against the same opponents at home in August this year. He also opined that both teams are now evenly matched after this victory, especially since two of the matches the Irish lost in August were decided in the last over. But Bangladesh's champion all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan was not ready to accept the notion. The reality is that we won the three-match series at their own den recently and winning the match in the last over is very much part of this version, said Shakib.//////Kamran Akmal smashed an unbeaten 92 off 50 balls as Pakistan came from behind to defeat India by five wickets in a warm-up match for the World Twenty20 on Monday.//////After a nine-month long hiatus, the Bangladesh national football team will return to action today when they take on Nepal in the first of two international friendly matches at the Dasrath Stadium in Kathmandu.

Its vision statement reads "for providing energy at just and reasonable cost, and protection of consumers' interest and satisfaction through fair practice." Unfortunately, if one looks BERC's track record over the past year, it has taken steps to the contrary. What has become obvious is that the regulatory body is sorely lacking in technical capacity for analysing the tariff rate under different slabs. The regulator also seems oblivious to higher tariff rate for electricity and its financial and economic implications on consumers both at retail and bulk level. This lack of capacity is perhaps the reason for BERC's continued dependence on outside agencies to come up with formula for tariff regulation, tariff rates and slab fixation.//////Rather than who joined the expanded cabinet after its latest reshuffle, what made news is who did not.

After the Mutiny in 1857 the country was in a bad state financially when the British government took over power.//////It is impossible to read the internet edition of any deshi newspaper without stumbling upon some unpalatable stories about all the three branches of our government.

They are gone, but that miasma has gained significant momentum with the ascendancy of the Moha-Jote government.

Deafness often results from the loss of specialized nerve cells called hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea, the part of the inner ear that converts vibrations into nerve signals the brain understands as sounds. Until now, no one has been able to replace both types of nerve cells.//////Well, you can't blame the chickens. They started out flying, after all. At least their ancestors did. //////
