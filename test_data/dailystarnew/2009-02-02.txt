More to the point, the veteran revolutionary echoes our collective belief that heritage, being a part of a nation's history, cannot be subsumed to interests of a mundane nature. That is why the plans of the Chittagong City Corporation to have the two schools, Aparna Charan City Corporation Girls' High School and Krishna Kumari City Corporation Girls High School, demolished so that a 16-storey structure can be constructed on the premises appear untenable not only to residents of the port city but also citizens all across the country.

Not bad!//////Although Barisal is one of the six divisions, it has been neglected by all governments. All previous governments made promises but their words did not come true. Education is imperative for all development activities but there is no university in Barisal city. If we look at all other divisional cities, we will find a different picture. Even many district towns have public universities. Doesn't it bear testimony to the unequal treatment meted out to Barisal?
