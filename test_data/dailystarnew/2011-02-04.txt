The government expenditure for procuring food is set to shoot up by 42 percent or Tk 3,078 crore in the current fiscal year, as it moves to buy grains from the heated world market that saw a historic peak in food prices.//////US journalist and writer Lawrence Lifschultz in a statement to the High Court yesterday said //////We congratulate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for her wisdom of bowing to public demand in removing the new airport site from Arial Beel area. Given our political culture, leaders often fall prey to their misplaced ego, and consider any criticism of their decision and change of course of any action taken by them to be insulting and a sign of weakness. In fact sycophants are known to feed on such ego-traps and advise their leaders NOT to bow to legitimate criticisms, saying that such a change of course will be interpreted as loss of power leading to all sorts of political repercussions. We had seen that happen too many times in the past and, frankly, we were afraid that the present PM would also fall into such a trap.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said the government is looking for a new site for the proposed Bangabandhu International Airport and possibly it will be on the other side of the Padma. //////Tension was running high among the villagers in Arial Beel area in Munshiganj yesterday despite the prime minister's announcement of not constructing an airport there.//////On February 1 we published the Ministry of Environment and Forests' rejoinder in its entirety. Normally we only reproduce relevant parts of a rejoinder. However, we made an exception due to the seriousness of the issue at hand. This was to communicate to our readers how the ministry failed to respond to issues we had raised in our report. //////The grabbers who reoccupy rivers and canals even after being evicted will be summarily tried and punished under mobile court from now on. //////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia sought support from the four-party alliance partners and like-minded parties to make Monday's hartal successful.//////The East Bengal Legislative Assembly was expected to meet for the first time since the creation of Pakistan on March 15, 1948 in Dhaka. On the eve of the session, a large number of students organised a demonstration before Burdwan House (today's Bangla Academy), the official residence of the chief minister of the province, to protest the police action three days earlier. The Students' Action Committee decided to call a general strike on the day the assembly would meet. It was such a move on the part of the students which compelled the government to soften its stance on the language issue. Moreover, Pakistan's founder and Governor General Mohammad Ali Jinnah, popularly known as Quaid-e-Azam, was scheduled to visit the province beginning March 19. The provincial government was, therefore, not willing to leave anything to chance lest the visit be disrupted.//////The disease that claimed at least 16 lives in Lalmonirhat and Rangpur in the last three days has been identified as encephalitis, a brain infection caused by bacteria, fungi or virus. //////A trial court yesterday ordered further investigation into the carnage at Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) headquarters in February 2009 as names of around 100 more suspects surfaced alongside 824 already charge-sheeted accused.//////Restrictions will be imposed on cars on city streets to reduce congestion, Communications Minister Syed Abul Hossain said yesterday in parliament.//////Two people were shot dead in separate incidents in the city yesterday, police said. //////Six-year-old Arnob, accompanied by his father, was browsing books at Amar Ekushey Boi Mela on the premises of Bangla Academy yesterday afternoon searching for his favourite read.//////Egypt has started a dialogue with "political parties and national forces," state television said yesterday, but the main opposition coalition rejected any talks before President Hosni Mubarak goes.//////Officials of the owning and operating companies of the hijacked Bangladeshi ship MV Jahan Moni yesterday hoped to settle ransom negotiations with Somali pirates within a week. //////A regional commander of Purba Banglar Communist Party (Lal-Pataka) was killed in a 'shootout' between his cohorts and law enforcers at Ataikula in Pabna early yesterday.//////A mob beat four robbers to death and another to injury in Bagerhat sadar last night.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's acknowledgement of popular sentiments regarding a new airport at Arial Beel is to be appreciated. Coming as it does after an eruption of violence that left a policeman dead and scores of others injured, her statement should now help reduce the tension gripping the area. Moreover, her view that there will be a feasibility study before a new site for the proposed airport is selected is proof that the government has taken cognizance of the realities. Such a study should have been undertaken before the decision to build a new airport at Arial Beel was taken. The manner in which the Arial Beel issue was approached was flawed because of two basic reasons. In the first place, the airport-related decision took little note of the adverse impact a new airport would have on the environment of the area. In the second, no effort was made at all to ascertain the wishes of the local people.//////The way a rape victim in a remote village of Shariatpur, far from being redressed for the abuse she was subjected to, was whipped leading to her death has left us reeling from utter shock and outrage. We have no word to condemn the crime committed by the so-called village arbitration body that gave the order to lash the girl based on a fatwa issued by a village imam. In the same breath, we cannot but express our dismay over how such a barbaric medieval drama could be enacted under the very nose of the local administration. How could they be unaware of the High Court rule that declares fatwa illegal and unconstitutional?//////It has often been said that a good fielding team adds runs to the total. This means that, for instance, when defending a score of 220 a fielding side, by being alert to every run-saving opportunity, can actually make the batting side feel that the total they are pursuing is, say, 20 runs higher. //////The cricket lovers thronged locations across the city to be a part of history as the ICC World Cup trophy was put on display for public viewing at different city spots yesterday. But the question on everyone's lips was whether it is a genuine one or a replica.//////Shakib Al Hasan today is the face of Bangladesh cricket. More than his talent with bat and ball it is his solid temperament and alert cricket brain that has taken him to the top of the rankings of ODI allrounders, ahead of such names as South Africa's Jacques Kallis, Pakistan's Shahid Afridi and Australia's Shane Watson. //////When Tamim Iqbal is on song, the Bangladeshi fans hardly have any chance to be disappointed. Expectations run very high whenever the Chittagong lad gets going but the irony is that despite his master blaster reputation Tamim has never scored a century in his own ground. //////It's time for Dhaka to get dolled up for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011.

Breast feeding for six months will develop their immune system and infant mortality rate will be reduced. I urge the government to monitor whether this law is being implemented in all organizations.//////Our local financial daily reported on January 18th about our participation at the International Trade Fair at Guwahati, Assam; where Bangladesh is a partner country. In the report it was stated that we will be having 50 stalls in the fair and that only our art and culture will be displayed! It was disappointing to note, that according to the report, nothing was mentioned about inclusion of the food, medicines, cosmetics and other consumer goods manufactured in Bangladesh being exhibited and sold in the fair! This was an excellent opportunity to exhibit our range of products that can find ready market in Assam, and help to expand our export trade to our neighbours. Priority wise, in my opinion, this is more important than displaying only our art and culture.//////Blood will have blood. said William Shakespeare.

Both the West and the East practice oppression based on sex, colour, language, ethnicity, illiteracy, disability, corruption, envy, greed, jealousy, power, stigmas, superstition and above all poverty. //////A fifteen-year-old girl named Felani died a pathetic death on the border.

But the challenge of getting hands on a ticket means that only few will have smiles across their faces when the matches begin. One of those lucky few is popular TV actress Sumaiya Shimu.

Till then, the acclaimed actress will remain busy shooting for her new TV serials "Nishorgo" and "Chhokka" -- along with "Lolita", "Projapoti" etc which are currently being aired.//////LAST week Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in London: "I am doing politics for the welfare of people, not for my personal gain." Her statement had the reverse twist of a Chinese proverb that says those who seek power for personal ends eventually run afoul of popular opinion. The uncanny sense of history sublimated in the prime minister's voice. It couldn't have been said better or sooner when popular opinion is seeking a resounding resurgence worldwide. //////One of the great follies of the contemporary world is the conversion of the priest, of any faith, into a cartoon character. And so the imam is caricatured with an elongated beard and twisted eye; the pandit has an exaggerated tuft, obese stomach and gloats; the Christian father wears a sanctimonious air barely disguising a leer. //////The political pledge of the government outlined in Vision 2021 to combat poverty, build Digital Bangladesh and move into the ranks of the middle income countries makes strategies and action in education the fulcrum of change.

He arrived when Britain, shorn of empire and with a shattered economy, was seeking to fashion a new society better than the old and when SOAS was itself being transformed.
