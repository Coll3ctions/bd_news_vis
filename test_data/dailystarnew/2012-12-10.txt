Except for the violence, that we had predicted in this very column yesterday, that the programme would engender because of the fact that the siege would be 'enforced' by the 18-party alliance, anything that the BNP-led alliance had wanted to convey to the people was marred by senseless violence and destruction. It sounds ludicrous that the siege, among other things, was to protest against the public sufferings caused by government policies. //////Bangladesh cricket team by wresting a two-wicket victory in the deciding finals of the five-match one dayer series from the formidable West Indies side has done us proud. There were all the elements of drama, steep rise and fall in fortunes, climax and anti-climax, and above all, a nail biting finish to a glorious triumph of the Bangladesh side. It was a well-deserved victory, Bangladesh team had to fight every inch of the way to script a diligent team work performance. //////The Tigers' silent performer Mahmudullah Riyad, who already won the hearts of millions of cricket lovers for his elegant style of batting, was happy with his consistent performance with the bat as well as effective contribution with the ball in Bangladesh's home series against the West Indies, and was delighted with the way his team won the one-day series. The soft-spoken cricketer from Mymensingh hogged the spotlight after the completion of the Test and one-day series but to the stylish batsman the team always comes first. The all-rounder spoke of his philosophy and expectations during a freewheeling conversation with reporters at the poolside of the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel the day after Bangladesh's memorable series victory on Saturday. The following is an excerpt from the encounter.//////Mashrafe Bin Mortaza might not have been in the playing eleven which scripted a two-wicket victory in the fifth and final ODI to clinch a memorable series victory against the formidable West Indies, but the amount of encouragement the brave-heart cricketer provided from behind the scenes played a vital role for the Tigers to achieve their best success in ODI history. //////Mohammad Rubel's life revolved around nothing but playing football and working as a ball-boy since he dropped out of school a year ago because his family could not bear his educational expenses anymore. But the 13-year old boy from Narayanganj can dream again of a good future as he has made the cut as one of the 37 footballers selected for the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Academy in Sylhet. Now he can concentrate on his football as well as studies, which will be taken care of by the academy. //////Bangladesh's ODI series win over the West Indies was undoubtedly the talk of the town yesterday. Right from the addas at roadside tea stalls to the get-togethers in different homes propelled by the road-blockade programme, cricket, it seemed, found the prime spot in almost every conversation that took place in the country.//////Khulna were crowned the cham-pions of the 14th National Cricket League (NCL) as they defeated holders Rajshahi by 33 runs at the Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra yesterday to win their third first-//////Despite a mini-hiccup -- they contrived to be 8-3 in pursuit of the 41 runs required to win -- England completed a second momentous victory in a row within the hour on the fifth day, thus earning themselves a lazy Sunday afternoon in Kolkata. For the rest of the day they had no worries. They could close their eyes and drift away and -- who knows? -- dream of Nagpur, the venue of the final Test match.//////India have dropped Zaheer Khan, Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh for the Nagpur Test.

On information, police recovered the body next morning. They also arrested one Monirul Islam Babu in connection with the killing.//////Death is awaiting us everywhere; violent deaths are happening all the time. In the December 1, 2012 issue of The Daily Star, quite a number of such news were published: Elderly woman killed in capital, road crashes kill 4, female doctor found killed at clinic in capital, two district Awami League leaders killed. It seems people's lives have no value; those are at the mercy of the criminals.//////Recently The Daily Star published news entitled, The government has decided to procure Aman rice at a price of Tk 26 per kg. I think this price is inadequate for the farmers. I would like to request the government to inquire about how much money the farmers have to spend and also how much labour they have to give for growing per kg of rice and fix the price accordingly to do our poor farmers justice. //////Malaysia, a desired labour market for Bangladeshi workers, has officially lifted ban on recruiting Bangladeshi workers after four years. As a result, Bangladesh would be able to send 5 lac workers to Malaysia in the next five years under government programme beginning next January. I would like to congratulate Bangladesh government on its success because this is undoubtedly an outcome of its diplomatic efforts. //////At least 111 people were killed and 100 injured in a devastating fire at Tazreen Fashions Ltd. I cannot accept this as an accident. This is simply genocide. The owners always refer to electrical short circuit as one of the causes of fire. But there is no fire exit or fire safety measures in most of the factories, and workers are not allowed to go out of the factory in situations like this. I am sure those responsible for the deaths will not be punished and after the investigation drama they will be declared innocent. //////I would like to propose the following suggestions to BGMEA for implementing in garment factories. All top officials, including the board members of garment industries, and all top managing and supervising officials of garment factories, must read and understand the Factories Act, as well as Shops and Establishment Act. Further, they should be aware of basic factory accident prevention and safety rules and regulations. It may be useful to have simple booklets in Bangla, where the important sections of these laws and rules can be incorporated. Additionally, simple fire protection and safety do's and don'ts can also be incorporated in this booklet! //////A recent report published in The Daily Star (25.11.2012) titled Bangladesh drops in remittance ranking mentioned that although Bangladesh continues to be the top 10 remittance receiving countries, it has slid one notch down compared to last year. On the other hand, countries like Pakistan and Nigeria have improved in remittance earnings from the previous years. The reason behind the success of Pakistan in remittance ranking position in recent years was the state-driven joint initiative called Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI). Under this framework, the government encouraged the state bank to open dedicated Home Remittance Centres and enhance their activities overseas for collecting remittances. //////About 7 million expatriate workers are now working in different countries all over the world, most of whom are unskilled. Had the 7 million workers been skilled, the amount of foreign remittance would have been more than US$14 billion. Some experts opine that Bangladesh is over-burdened with its huge population while others think this huge population can be a boon for the country if they are properly trained and then sent abroad. It would be wise on the part of the government to set up a modern training centre to provide different skill development trainings to these workers. The sooner the initiative is taken, the better for the nation.//////America is perhaps the champion in bringing equality between men and women but yet disparity prevails here too. I work in a gas station as a cashier, which is located at Woodway Dr, one of the most posh areas in Houston, Texas. One night a middle aged lady rushed into the store and asked whether we could help her fix the punctured tire of her car which she left somewhere nearby. My boss, the owner of the store, was also present there. //////I completely agree with Khandaker Zia Hasan who said in his recent letter, published in your daily on December 5th, that our footpaths are being unnecessarily blocked, causing major problems to the pedestrians. Unfortunately, the example he cited isn't the only one. A bit ahead of the Mohakhali Masjid, at Amtoli bus stand, a part of a footpath is being used by some people for collecting money for the construction of a mosque. Apart from that, they create unnecessary noise using speakers, which causes great disturbance to the nearby South Point School and the residents of that area. The R&H department has a makeshift tenement there. The noise causes discomfort to the sick, elderly and infants. Despite numerous protests, no action has been taken against this. We hope the authorities concerned will read this letter and help clean the environment. //////Egypt's president scrapped a decree that gave him extra powers and ignited violent protests as opposition was set to decide on further possible rallies in Cairo.//////Arab League foreign ministers have agreed during a meeting to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinian Authority to make up for punitive measures imposed by the Israeli government after a successful bid for recognition at the United Nations.//////Ninety per cent of Indians are "idiots" who can easily be misled by mischievous elements in the name of religion, Press Council of India (PCI) chairperson Justice Markandey Katju claimed on Saturday.//////Syrian rebels yesterday seized control of a large sector of Sheikh Suleiman base west of Aleppo, bringing them closer to holding a large swathe of territory extending to the Turkish border in the north.//////Leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez admitted a relapse of his cancer late Saturday and designated vice president Nicolas Maduro as his heir apparent in case "something happened" to him.//////The owners of an Australian radio station at the centre of the British royal prank call scandal Sunday said the tragic death of a nurse was "unforeseeable" and vowed to review its broadcasting processes.//////Heavy rain brought flooding fears in the north of the storm-battered Philippines as Typhoon Bopha returned yesterday, days after slamming into the south of the country and leaving almost 1,400 dead or missing.//////Hundreds of angry demonstrators tried to storm the Iranian consulate in the western Afghan city of Herat yesterday in protest at the alleged killing of Afghan immigrants by Iranian security forces.//////Sri Lanka's main opposition party asked the commonwealth yesterday to investigate the impeachment of the country's chief justice in what it called a breach of the bloc's democratic values.//////US drones targeting a militant compound killed at least three people in a restive Pakistani tribal region near the Afghan border yesterday, officials said.//////Nelson Mandela is "comfortable", the South African government said yesterday after the former president spent the night in hospital, for medical tests described as "consistent with his age".//////Austerity-weary Romanians voted for a new parliament yesterday, with the centre-left ruling coalition on course for a large victory that was likely to trigger fresh tension between the party and rival president Traian Basescu.//////Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti is stepping down, the president's office announced Saturday, just hours after the man he replaced, Silvio Berlusconi, said he would run again for head of government.//////Thirteen people were killed and ten others injured yesterday when a bus they were travelling on plunged into a ravine in a mountainous area of northern Taiwan, rescue workers said.//////Although Nasima Khanam Queenie is quite aptly described as an abstract painter, her work is never non-figurative. Her paintings can be categorised according to the use of varied alien forms as well as detailed compositions. A notable feature of her painting is the way in which the forms seem to push outwards on the way to the viewers at its centre and to gather to pursue each other around the edges of the paintings. This reflects Queenie's longstanding interest in Cubism.//////To celebrate Victory Day, Tarunner Ucchash, an organisation of elocutionists in the port city, held a two-day 'Bijoy Utshab' (Victory Day Festival), featuring a number of cultural programmes with the theme Awndho Boloy Bhangre Ebar Shoili Alo Jele at DC Hill Premises.

Birla Sabhaghar, Ballygunge, Kolkata, India. The event is being hosted by "Shatkahon", a leading cultural organisation of Kolkata. Produced by Nrityanchal the dance drama has been written by a Bangladeshi poet Sheikh Hafizur Rahman.//////Girisha is a girl from the hills. Her house is near the waterfall. The crowing of the wild rooster wakes her up every morning. She roams around in the hills, and plays with the clouds. Girisha from the Hills is just one of the 25 books that 'Room to Read', an international award-winning NGO working for the development of education, is publishing this year, to reach out to the most beginner-level readers with enthralling stories, in the simplest form of their native language. //////An open-air concert was held at Nomani Maidan (ground) in Magura town on December 7 to mark 'Magura Free Day'.//////Popular rock act Souls is participating in the 6th South Asian Band Festival in New Delhi and Jaipur. The festival started on December 6 and will continue till December 11, according to Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre (IGCC) sources.//////Human Rights Day marks the occasion when on December 10, 1948, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). It was the destruction, deaths and incidents of gross human rights violation on an unprecedented scale during the Second World War that propelled the world community to consider the issue of human rights in a new light. As the madness of the war was over, good sense again prevailed. Humanity felt the need to designate a day of the year to observe as human rights day. Formally, that day was declared by the UNGA at one of its plenary meetings held in December 1950. //////After a hard-fought election campaign, costing well in excess of $2 billion, it seems to many observers that not much has changed in American politics: Barack Obama is still president, the Republicans still control the House of Representatives, and the Democrats still have a majority in the Senate. With America facing a "fiscal cliff" -- automatic tax increases and spending cuts at the start of 2013 that will most likely drive the economy into recession unless bipartisan agreement on an alternative fiscal path is reached -- could there be anything worse than continued political gridlock?//////On December 9, through the internet edition of //////, I learned with great sadness in Sydney that Professor Khan Sarwar Murshid had passed away on December 8 in Dhaka. When I left Dhaka I knew that Professor Murshid was seriously ill and was admitted in a hospital. Hoping against hope, I thought that I would meet him in hospital or at his residence on my return.//////I am so saddened to hear of the passing of Prof. Murshid and would like to extend my deepest condolences and sympathy to the bereaved family. My thoughts and prayers are with them in this time of deep sadness. Lets us all pray to the Almighty Allah to rest the departed soul in eternal peace and grant courage to the bereaved family to bear the irreparable loss with fortitude.//////The 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (came into force on January 3, 1976) is the inspiration and guide for many later constitutions for their inclusion of social and economic rights. Its preamble recognises that inherent dignity of all persons is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world and that inherent dignity could not be achieved without enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as civil and political rights. According to Article 2 of the Covenant, each State Party therefore undertakes to take steps, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realisation of these rights by all appropriate means. //////
