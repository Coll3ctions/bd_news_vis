The International Crimes Tribunal-2 was formed two years after the Tribunal-1 came into being, but it has delivered the first verdict as the Tribunal-1 remains bogged down by a flurry of defence petitions, which some say is a delaying tactic. //////There are millions of reasons why we should celebrate last Monday's verdict, the first against the perpetrators of crimes against humanity in 1971. There are as many reasons to rejoice today as there are martyrs of the period, and as there were instances of rape, torture, burning of villages, looting, arson, arrests, etc. For every freedom fighter killed, maimed, tortured, and women raped there were several members of their families who suffered silently in anger and grief over the last 42 years. For all of them, and for the whole nation that waited for law to catch up with the perpetrators of genocide in 1971, there is an indescribable joy in our heart today and an inexpressible reason to celebrate, the thanks for which must go to the prime minister personally, and to the Awami League government. We have said it before, and have no hesitation in repeating, that no other government would have done it. We commend both Sheikh Hasina and all those who have worked hard to make it happen.//////The Anti-Corruption Commission has traced transactions to foreign banks through which some officials of controversial Destiny Group siphoned off huge amounts in five countries.//////At least 50 people were injured in a factional clash of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) activists over submitting tender at Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU) yesterday. //////After 28 long years, the government yesterday increased the house rent allowance for the teachers and employees of non-government education institutions who enjoy Monthly Pay Order (MPO) facilities.//////Home Minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir yesterday said the beating of Opposition Chief Whip Zainul Abdin Farroque by police official Harun-ur-Rashid had been taken into consideration in awarding Harun the President Police Medal.//////The UK said yesterday it supported the war crimes trial in Bangladesh but always opposed capital punishment while Germany and France termed the trial an internal affair of the country.//////The maiden verdict of the war crimes tribunal on Monday was widely covered by the international media.//////Poor maintenance and operation has exposed the vital Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge to various dangers, investigation reveals.//////Dhaka will host several Indian ministers and secretaries in a span of three weeks starting from January 28 to ink some crucial deals in areas of visa, extradition and power generation. //////Maj Gen Ziaur Rahman did not punish those who killed our four national leaders inside the Dhaka Central Jail in November 1975 though he knew well of the incident, a state counsel told the Supreme Court yesterday. //////The Daily Star Spelling Bee yesterday brought 15 divisional round qualifiers by visiting five schools in Dhaka -- Rayhan School, two branches of Viquarunnesa Noon School, Motijheel Govt Boys' School and Motijheel Ideal School.//////Police found the decomposed body of a kidnapped restaurant owner at a residential hotel in the capital's Moghbazar yesterday afternoon.//////The Awami League-led grand alliance government had no failure in the last four years except that it could not publicise its successes properly, a party leader said yesterday. //////War crimes accused Delawar Hossain Sayedee's counsel yesterday placed his closing argument before International Crimes Tribunal-1.//////BNP coordinator Tariqul Islam yesterday said people would not accept if the government only tries "some identified" opposition leaders in connection with crimes against humanity to implement a specific party's agenda.//////A robber was killed in a "gunfight" with Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) at the Sundarbans of Bagerhat yesterday (Tuesday) morning. //////Police yesterday recorded a case against Kazal Mollah, who claims to be an aide to Awami League lawmaker Simin Hossain Rimi, his wife and two others on charges of violating and torturing a domestic help. //////If you're a young, single and adventurous female human and wondering what to do with the womb you have just lying around inside you collecting dust, an opportunity has arisen.

The reason is the sudden rise in the irrigation cost caused by government's untimely decision of increasing the prices of diesel. The farmers' plight should not go addressed. In most parts of the country, seedbeds and saplings of Boro have been damaged due to the unexpected cold wave and dense fog. Many farmers have been victims of loss and many are anxious about getting back their invested money. It is now the peak time for Boro cultivation in the country, but the high cost of irrigation has hit them hard. The government should provide subsidy for Boro cultivation and help farmers to continue their farming activities unhindered. The decision of increasing the price of diesel will also discourage the marginal farmers in Boro cultivation. So, the authorities concerned should consider withdrawing the decision without delay in the interest of Boro farmers. //////Politicians and political parties, except a very few, once in power have been doing their best to put the nation into disgrace. The regime in power led by the daughter of Bangabandhu is no exception.//////We shudder with fear to observe that the law enforcers of this country are now using pepper spray on demonstrators. Policemen have first launched this weapon by splashing this chemical on teachers who staged demonstration demanding their inclusion in the MPO list.

What a fight, as we marched and protested and sang our songs of triumph and spoke our words of courage! What a fight, as we lifted high the banner of equality -- equal rights for all men and women, regardless of colour! What a fight, as we suffered humiliation and setbacks, degradation and injustice! //////Awami League leadership has been assuring people that the next parliamentary election will be absolutely free and fair under the present government. However, the question that remains unanswered is whether a free and fair election can be ensured under Awami League, BNP or any political party of Bangladesh. Some of the AL leaders argue that strengthening Election Commission is the way to ensure fair and free elections. But it is clear to all the political parties- Awami League, BNP or any other partyis apt at politicising each and every organ of the administration to suit their purpose so that it becomes simply impossible to hold a free and fair election under them. The Election Commission alone cannot ensure a fair election unless it is vested with all the executive power of the government including that of the chief executive. Are all the parties prepared to consider this option?//////Bangladesh emerged as an independent country 41 years back. It could not produce even a nail then but now it makes ocean-going ships, produces cold rolled steel coils, assembles air coolers, fridges, motor bikes and so on. Bangladesh is moving towards industrialisation. The number of poor people is also decreasing. It is expected that in the next decade Bangladesh will achieve the status of a middle-income country. The industries will need huge technical and professional manpower. //////Many job circulars of both public and private sectors clearly state that 'no third class is acceptable'. Students from middle class or lower class families have to face various types of crises which sometimes cause harm to their studies and unfortunately they come out with a third class or equivalent grade point. There are many students who have two or three second class or first class but one third class. They can not apply for a job. As a result, despite having merit and efficiency, they are deprived of the right of applying for jobs. Therefore, I on behalf of the unfortunate job seekers urge the government and other authorities concerned to change the provision about one third class and give them chance to apply for jobs.//////I am a student of Jagannath University. I want to say something about the current image of my university. I usually go to my campus by public bus. I have heard the conversations of the passengers about the murder of Bishwajit Das. They have got a negative impression about all the students of JNU. It is a matter of great sorrow for me. Some of my friends have lost their private tuitions because of being the students of JNU. But all the students of JNU are not guilty of this crime. The BCL cadres of JNU have murdered Bishwajit. The general students have nothing to do with that. //////Israelis yesterday voted in an election seen returning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to power with a rightwing coalition charged with tackling the key issues of peace talks and Iran's nuclear drive.//////Proposing that "enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war," US President Barack Obama opened his second term in the White House with a promise of greater American engagement and less confrontation with the world that can "more durably lift suspicion and fear."//////Police in Indian Kashmir have warned residents to build underground bunkers to prepare for a possible nuclear war in the disputed region, which is on edge after a string of deadly border clashes.//////Prince Harry has flown out of Afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour, during which he admitted killing insurgents while piloting his Apache helicopter and spoke in rare depth about the tensions and frustrations of being a royal (video) who craved life out of the spotlight.//////Pakistan's anti-corruption watchdog Monday said it had suspended a probe into a graft scandal involving the prime minister pending an inquiry into the death of an officer investigating the case.//////The Philippines has taken China to a UN tribunal to challenge its claim to most of the South China Sea, including territory belonging to the archipelago, Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said yesterday.//////Thirty-seven foreigners of eight nationalities were killed by Islamist militants in a well-planned attack on a remote gas plant, some of them executed with a bullet to the head, Algeria's premier said.//////The British government yesterday said it was making up to 5,300 army personnel redundant as part of cuts that will see troop numbers brought to the lowest levels since the early 19th century.//////The UN Security Council will order sanctions against North Korea's space agency in a resolution to be passed this week condemning the secretive state's ballistic launch, a diplomat said Monday.//////Hundreds of flights were cancelled and hazardous roads and railways disrupted traffic and caused countless accidents across Europe on Monday as heavy snow and freezing weather gripped the continent.//////Liberian warlord Charles Taylor yesterday began his appeal against a 50-year prison sentence handed down by Sierra Leone's UN-backed special court for fuelling the west African nation's savage civil war.//////A wave of attacks in and around Baghdad and in northern Iraq killed 17 people and wounded dozens of others yesterday, shattering a relative calm after a spate of deadly attacks last week.//////Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak pledged solidarity with the Palestinians on his first trip to Gaza yesterday, and backed reconciliation efforts between Hamas and Fatah.//////Better known as the 'Nayakraaj' or the 'king of heroes', Razzak has made great contributions to the Bangladeshi film industry.

He stood for a while observing the dead Nehru, even as others observed him with something of disbelief and a little of shock. For he bore an uncanny resemblance to the long-missing Subhas Chandra Bose. A day later, some newspapers carried that image, along with the question: was that Bose beside Nehru's remains? Of course, no one could answer the question. And whoever that individual was, he was never seen or heard of again.//////It is reported that India's Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde will be visiting Bangladesh from January 28 for three days. The border killing of civilian Bangladeshis will hopefully be the key topic as it has been a visible spoiler of bilateral relations.//////For half a week in January 2013, many eyes in South Asia, and in much of the world, were focused on a maverick Mullah in Pakistan by the name of Muhammad Tahir-ul Qadri. Many saw him, and still do, as a harbinger of change. A Pakistani combination of India's Anna Hazare and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, he appeared suddenly like a comet on that nation's political horizon, summoning up the largest crowd ever gathered in that challenged country's capital, Islamabad, and nearly toppled the government. Just as suddenly, he melted away as did those myriads of followers who braved the rain and cold at his bidding. Pakistan's version of Xenophon's March of the Ten Thousand was over for now. But not without having left an indelible imprint on its political fabric, demonstrating that people's power still mattered in a system that, through most of its history, has been dominated by the proverbial uniformed "man on horseback" or the military. Qadri appeared for a time to render the streets of Islamabad chaotic. But those gathered around him saw his actions as reflecting a cause: not just for restoring honesty in governance but seeking to do that by using as the tool the tolerant, syncretistic, and Sufistic face of Islam which represents Pakistan's values, urgings and ethos much more than that fierce, fundamentalist, and Salafist version that has been relentlessly battering the Pakistani nation, exhausting it, and sharpening the public's yearning for a positive change.//////
