Last week, the court disqualified Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani from holding a seat in Parliament from the date of his contempt of court conviction on April 26. This was for having failed to pursue corruption charges against President Asif Ali Zardari, the co-chairman of the ruling Pakistan People's Party. This dramatic denouement would have been unnecessary had Pakistan's National Assembly acted on the earlier court ruling. Given its refusal to do so -- with the Speaker declaring that Gilani was not disqualified despite his conviction for contempt of court -- the court has stepped in to make the ambit of its authority clear.//////
