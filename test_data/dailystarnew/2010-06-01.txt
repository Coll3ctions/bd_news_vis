A quick Google search turned up a couple of blogs and a Wikinews post that corroborated it. The final confirmation came from a journalist friend at the BBC (again via Facebook): Facebook, the world's most popular social-networking site, has been temporarily blocked in Bangladesh.

When I asked him about the media community's reaction to this incident, he told me that it is still a "non-issue."

However, the fact is, in this day and age, blocking a social media is just as unfortunate as shutting down a mainstream newspaper or TV channel and just as alarming. //////THE announcement of the budget is an important event in a country's political and economic calendar.
