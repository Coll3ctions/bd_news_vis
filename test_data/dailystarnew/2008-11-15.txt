The people of the USA spoke this time and ushered in change in the most meaningful and effective mode. The manner, in which this was played out, restored to America its standing at the top of the ladder of moral leadership. The electoral process demonstrated once again that given good governance, fairness and a level playing field, a credible election can be held despite difficulties. Like many others, I felt happy to have been alive on this day and to have savoured this magical moment. It kindled in the hearts of many around the world a spring of hope.

The Sunshine Walk was supported by friends and activists and endorsed by many Canadian organisations and individuals. //////Level of sound pollution (also termed as noise pollution) in Dhaka city is now a major concern for the general people because it has already exceeded the tolerance level. Because of this sound or noise pollution millions of people in the country are exposed to a number of health risks -- from deafness to heart attack. On city streets noise pollution can be caused by hydraulic horns of vehicles (the most harmful offenders), microphones and cassette players. The hydraulic horns used by buses, trucks and taxies in the crowded city streets are dangerous for human being. This is also how noise pollution in Dhaka City is affecting the hearing power of thousands of children everyday. Noise intensity is measured in decibel (dB) units. At 45 dB of noise the average person generally cannot sleep. At 120 dB the ear registers pain; hearing damage begins at a much lower level, about 85 dB. Experts say, if a child below three years of age hears a horn emitting 100 dB of noise from a close range, he or she might lose his or her hearing power. A child's health may also be adversely affected by loud sounds from the radio, television, cassette players and, not speak of, microphones, also the sound of mills and factories and any loud noise. //////Butterflies are natural biotic key to biodiversity conservation as well as conservation of any bio-resource in nature. Species 'assemblage and species' richness in any ecosystem, specially in the forest ecosystem, are significantly preserved by the 'dynamism utilization' of butterfly-plant interaction in natural condition. This trophic dynamism happens in nature when the wild state of the butterfly-plant interaction is not disturbed externally, specially by the humans. //////This is the centenary birth year of Manik Bandopadhay. He was born on 19 May 1908 in a small town called Dumka in Bihar. Writing came to him by accident. The story is that when he was a student at Presidency College, during an adda in the college canteen, a friend dared him to publish a story in //////, at that time a well-known Kolkata publication that published only the best of writers and writings. He took up the dare and put in a story in the editor's box. He signed it off as 'Manik' (his nickname) Bandopadhyay. The story, named //////' was published, it created a stir, and at age twenty Manik Bandopadhyay was well launched on his literary career. From now on he would live solely on the earnings from his writing--in fact, in true Marxist fashion he famously said that a writer was a pen-wielding labourer who must be paid for his labour. It was a courageous decision to take, since writing was an ill-paid job in his time, and is sadly reflected in the fact that Manik Bandopadhyay died prematurely in 1956, barely forty-eight years old, dogged by penury and ill-health.//////Today's youngsters won't know it, but the 1960s and '70s were days when South Asian English language writing was not the huge cruise liner it is today, steaming grandly ahead with its Rushdies and Bookers and fat advances, with publishing giants such as PenguinIndia and HarperCollins laying out fancy book launches in plush hotels at the drop of a pen! Those were the bad old days, with nary a publisher in sight. It was in this situation that in 1958, Professor P Lal (full name Purusottama Lal - born 1929), along with some friends, started his Writers Workshop in order to provide a publishing outlet for those lost, benighted souls bent on writing in English. A one-man, one-filing cabinet outfit, hand-typeset books bound in hand-loomed sari cloth. Since then, astonishingly, over 3000 titles have been published. Among them are a host of writers who went to become household names or achieve literary rock star status--and yes, that's right, they started first at Writers Workshop, knocking on its door with manuscript in hand!////// -- Rudyard Kipling//////Diabetes has a great impact on the daily lives of the persons with diabetes. Family members play an important role in the management of diabetes. The Center for Policy Research and Social Responsibility (CPR2) has recently conducted a study to evaluate the impact of family and hospital care for the persons with diabetes. According to the opinion of the respondents (who are family members of diabetics), 58 percent consider diet, drug and discipline  all required for the management of diabetes; whereas, 22 percent consider discipline;17 percent consider diet; and only 3 percent consider drug as important for the management of diabetes.//////Diabetes is globally an increasing threat to public health. The prevalence of diabetes is higher in the developing countries than that of the developed countries.//////Fahim Ahmed was tested as diabetic incidentally after a urine test. That was about ten years ago, and from then on Mr Fahim, like so many other people with diabetes, became fixated on his blood sugar. His doctor warned him to control it or the consequences could be dire  he could end up blind, lose a leg, fail his kidneys and so on.//////When a child is diagnosed with diabetes, along with the child the parents will experience everything as new.//////Good friends may help our life last longer, say researchers at Flinders University, Australia .

The gloomy scenario has been brought into international attention by the Ambassadors of Great Britain and Russia in Kabul.//////WHEN the British left India in 1947, it left two contested borders, Pakistan-Afghanistan border-the Durrand Line, and India-Chinese border, the McMahon Line. Observers believe that one of the most explosive spots on earth today is the so-called Durand Line, the 2640 kilometre border, much of it in harsh mountain country, between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is where the United States and its NATO allies are battling the Taleban and are facing the possibility of military defeat. The Durand Line was established by the British. It was demarcated and then signed into a treaty on November 12, 1893 between the ruler of Afghanistan, Amir Abdul Rahman Khan, and Sir Mortimer Durand, foreign secretary of what was then British India. The idea was to create a buffer zone to protect British India from possible Czarist Russian aggression in what was then the 'Great Game' between the British and Russian empires as the Nobel Laureate Kipling described it. When British India was partitioned between India and Pakistan in 1947, the Durand Line became the Pakistan-Afghan border. Successive Afghan rulers repudiated the Durand Line as the border with Pakistan. There was a demand in the past by Afghan rulers to set up an independent Pakhtoonistan state of Pashtun people. Because of the non-recognition of the Durrand Line as the international boundary, Afghanistan in 1947 voted against the admission of Pakistan in the UN. Even Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's current President, has called the Durand Line a line of hate because by cutting through tribal lands it artificially divides the Pashtun people, whom Kabul would like to claim as Afghans. //////Twelve European Union nations launched a project Nov. 10 to build an EU military air transport fleet to help meet a growing need for planes to carry troops and equipment to the world's trouble spots.//////On the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the hydrocarbon-rich Qatar, India has sought surplus funds from that country to sustain the flow of investments at a time of global credit squeeze, and signed two agreements relating to defence and law enforcement.

Many Lebanese politicians have blamed Syria for the killing, a charge Damascus has vehemently denied... ////// //////Thousands of Islamist militants in the UK are actively supporting jihadist activities at home and abroad, according to a leaked Government document.//////This novel by Marilynne Robinson, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2005, is a first person narrative written in the form of a communiqu from an aged father to his very young son, whose adulthood he does not expect to see because of his advanced years. The novel is set in the in the American Midwest, in a small town bordering the vast prairie area which is both a landscape and a condition that colours the attitudes and responses of the characters in it. It is not a novel in the epistolary or letter form, yet the text divided into sections, which purportedly have been written over many days, addresses the boy, a child of seven, in an attempt to leave not only a memoir of his parent but also to explain and perhaps justify the life that that father has lived, a testament that he hopes the child will read when he is an adult. The intimate, contemplative, often introspective, tone of the book makes the reader almost an accidental bystander, even an eavesdropper.//////At the International Conference for Population & Development ( ICPD ) held in Cairo in 1994, member-states consensually agreed to create a state of complete, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to the functions and processes. The conference reminded all that it was imperative for conscious individuals to equip themselves with knowledge, ability and resources to plan and to preserve reproductive health, such as choice of sexual partners, ability to negotiate safe sex practices, decision about the number of children, and raising healthy children. RH encompasses all aspects of sexuality and reproductive needs during the various stages of the life cycle, health needs of individuals, couples and families. //////There is always something stirring about speeches, especially when they have the soul soar in every possible way. Think of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. It is a simple collection of words and yet it has resonated with generations across the world and time. 'Four score and seven years ago . . .' Who has not recalled these famous opening lines? There was, long before Lincoln, Demosthenes with his 'I have always made common cause with the people'. Demosthenes was an orator, in the way that Pericles was. Oliver Cromwell was slightly different, but when his indignation threw up in 1653 that famous reprimand to parliament, he went into the history books. 'In the name of God, go!' --- and they all scampered off. Puritanism was finally in place.//////
