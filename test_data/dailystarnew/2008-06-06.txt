In the eight days since the government launched what was given out as a drive against known and listed criminals, as many as 12,000 people have been detained and carted off to prison. The sheer scale of the operation along with the ferocity of it has left an entire nation reeling. Most surprising is the fact that despite the government's stress on nabbing criminals there has been a wide-ranging operation against political workers throughout the country. In fact, more political individuals than lawbreakers have been taken into custody, which makes hollow the government's claim that the action is only aimed at people who have committed crimes and who have so long remained outside the bounds of the law.//////The Rome summit on tackling the on-going worldwide food crisis is a sign of the desperation nations are faced with. It is especially the poorer nations that have been at the receiving end, with all the rises in food prices in the past several months. The extent to which food has now assumed the shape of a serious problem can be gauged from the doubling of prices in the last three years. Prices are at a 30-year high, a terrible reality that calls for concerted efforts to be expended in handling the situation. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's belief that global food production must register a huge rise in order to cope with demand is in effect a broad hint of the problem on the world's hands.//////This week has been just like old times.

quite unfortunate that one of our workers in Bahrain committed such a heinous crime as murdering his employer. And for him now around one-lakh Bangladeshi workers' fate is in jeopardy as Bahrain has decided not to renew their work permits. But the question is one should not judge an entire country through the misdeed of one person. There is also an element of discrimination here displayed by the Bahraini lawmakers. Had he been a worker from the USA or Europe they may have refrained from such stern actions. So, we hope that our diplomats will manage to handle the situation appropriately and soon come to a pragmatic solution. In addition, our workers are also the victims of shady manpower agencies. For example, 27 Bangladeshis had to return from Iraq. They were promised by the unscrupulous agents that they would be taken to Dubai but they ended up in Iraq! Thanks to IOM that they have helped to repatriate 118 of our workers from Solaimania. Then there is the case of 45 workers returning from Malaysia with fake passports as their original passports were confiscated by their employers besides being not paid their due wages.

Perhaps, for the first time in their lives the crazy cricket lovers of Calcutta applauded the triumphs of the nightmarish Pakistani fast bowler. Subsequently, megastar SRK was seen to be dancing to celebrate the crucial turn of the match. No, I'm not depicting a bizarre dream sequence. DLF IPL has successfully obliterated the fragile boundary that existed between the facts and fantasies of the cricketing world. In this groundbreaking competition we have witnessed the glorious return of legends like Shane Warne, Pollock, Glen McGrath, and Gilchrist, as if they have been reincarnated to represent this exciting version of cricket, we have also seen world-class cricketers of the same national squad aggressively battling against each other, and we have seen the gracious intermingling of cricket and the glamorous world of Bollywood. I think DLF IPL is a creative concept that's not only promoting the prospect of Twenty-Twenty cricket but it's also providing an opportunity to the international cricketers to get used to this relatively new format of the game. At the same time, the tournament is entertaining the cricket lovers around the world to a great extent. //////Recently, the FBCCI president requested the government to offer black money whitening facility for the last time.

I soon learnt that she was at the local clinic with her five-year old daughter who was being given saline. My heart jumped I remembered that, in the afternoon when I last saw them, she had vomited a few times and now the doctor is saying that she is dehydrated. I felt so bad for her - the poor little thing!//////The number of women coming to the job market is increasing.

Several attempts had been made to introduce separate female bus service in the city but they failed for obvious commercial reasons.//////Working as tutor is a vital source of income for many students. Students, who don't get notable financial support from their families, often depend on tutoring to get themselves through their student days. Some others, despite being well off, prefer it as a source of some extra income. In Dhaka and some other cities, many organisations are playing the role of mediators in providing such jobs to the people, largely students, who are interested in tuition.
