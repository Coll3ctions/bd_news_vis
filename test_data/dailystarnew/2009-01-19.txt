And that has already been mentioned by the newly elected PM as well as her ministers in the cabinet. //////THE world is witnessing a replay of Israel's 34-day war with Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006, with some variations. Israel is unleashing hell to "defend" itself as President Bush and president-elect Obama would have us believe. In 2006, the invaders received a befitting response from Hezbollah, but Hamas has been operating in an occupied zone with severe limitations of finances and training facilities. So, Hamas may be unlikely to give Israel the punishment which Hezbollah inflicted on it.//////THE Satyam scandal has been wrongly called India's Enron, after the gigantic 2001 fraud in the US company.

Jan.) the Hon. Commerce Minister gave a time frame of one month as reported. This naturally should remain this government's top priority agenda. This is what will make or mar this government; of which I am sure they are fully aware.//////The people of Bangladesh have once again asserted that they are serious about their rights and responsibilities; they cannot be sidelined and ignored; and moreover, they are not apolitical. They have delivered their verdict for change and the change is for peace and progress for the entire population across the country. They have clearly ordained that the people's wish is the supreme.//////Plastic product is a threat to health & environment. It destroys the environment in a many ways. Throwing plastic products on land destroys the soil fertility and makes the soil barren and infertile. //////It hasn't even been a week since we got our democracy back and already there have been clashes amongst the student fronts of our political parties over establishing their supremacy at some residential halls of DU. This sort of monkey business will not be tolerated. //////Poverty alleviation in this country is really a mammoth task. Nevertheless, Bangladesh has been struggling hard to get over abject poverty. It is, indeed, a big challenge for our country because poverty is still so deep-rooted here.//////My heart broke, sank deeply when I heard the news of Alok Sir committing suicide. He was my beloved teacher of the Journalism Department of Chittagong University (CU). As a student, I feel guilty that we could not help when he was in distress. Some rotten, filthy people poured so much poison that he couldn't bear. He was so innocent, simple and guileless. The nastiness of this vindictive society did not allow him to live. Shame! //////Reading Syed Badrul Ahsan's invaluable write-ups is a great pleasure always. His writings based on the ground realities reflect the pros and cons of the issues that he pens through. Take the one titled "Diplomacy and enlightened self-interest", for example. Here he makes a pragmatic analysis of diplomacy and the diplomats and their role given the changing situations in the country and abroad.//////As a Bangladeshi, I like our culture. I feel proud when I see that all Bangladeshi people celebrate 21 February, 16 December and Pahela Baishakh. I also become proud when I listen to Rabindra Sangeet, Palliigeeti and Lalongeeti .But at present it is a matter of great regret that our time honoured culture is on the wane. Our own culture and tradition are going to be replaced by alien culture. Our young people are being influenced by such culture.//////Smoking in public places is restricted in our country. Our government has also formulated a law on the issue. But it is a matter of great regret that people are smoking openly violating the law. Even the members of law enforcing agencies violate the law. The government has failed to enforce the law strictly.//////I follow the cricket results in The Daily Star ever so often and would appreciate if the latest scores were included at the top of the article as it proves, in my opinion, quite challenging for readers to gauge the actual score after reading the report. And sometimes people would just like to glance at the scores without reading the entire report.//////Nobel Laureate Professor Dr. Abdus Salam established the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Italy with the objective of developing the third world countries through utilization of basic sciences. Prof. Abdus Salam was from a developing country, Pakistan. He wanted to establish the research centre in a developing country but he was not given support to establish such an important institute by any country of the third world. The reasons are political, social and financial. But the most important reason was lack of importance given by the politicians to the issue. To tell it more clearly many political leaders of the developing countries did not understand what the famous scientist was going to do at that time. Now many politicians and scientists of those countries understand what mistake they committed by turning down the request of Prof. Abdus Salam. //////It was different from the usual report on Bangladesh in German dailies.//////During the BNP-Jamaat rule, the development of Rajshahi and Rangpur was neglected. Most of the ministers were from certain areas and so-called development took place in those areas only. Bogra and even Ishwardi (very near to Rajshahi) got pipeline gas some years ago, but still now Rajshahi is far behind it. There are lots of issues I can mention in this regard. //////Barisal Public University, the name of a unique higher study hub, has been demanded by people of the southern region of Bangladesh. This grand educational pyramid had been coated by golden hopes of millions of common people of Barisal. In 1979 President Ziaur Rahman had pledged to establish this varsity but this dream project was dead along with this visionary. But his political party, the BNP, ruled the country for two five year terms in the last 15 years. In those terms of governance, Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia pledged more than 7 times to establish this university but in reality nothing has been done. //////There is a widespread belief among the general Muslims in our country that native Arabs living in Middle East will be faithful adherents to Islam as they are the inhabitants of the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad(Pbuh). This assumption, however, is not a valid or logical one: just because people live in the birthplace of the Prophet (Pbuh) does not necessarily mean that they will be truly religious in essence. Christianity, for instance, originated in the present day Middle East, nonetheless we will find the majority of faithful Christians living in other places such as the USA, Canada and so on. Similarly, Buddhism originated in present day Nepal, but the vast majority of Nepalese are not Buddhists, rather we see a significant number of practising Buddhists living mainly in the South-East Asia or other regions. //////At present there are over two hundred and fifty govt. colleges in Bangladesh. The number of govt. colleges was about ten in 1970 and their performances were enviable. But during Ershad regime private colleges were nationalized right & left for the sake of cheap popularity. On the one hand, this has resulted in huge recurring expenditures from public funds and on the other hand performance of many of these colleges has gone down dismally. Instead of improvement in teaching standard & performance in exams, the result has been just the opposite because teachers are more interested in private tuition rather than classroom teaching. This is because they feel that their jobs are secure. Performances of many private colleges are much better then a large number of nationalized colleges. //////After independence when people's dream was not being fulfilled, Freedom Fighter Ziaur Rahman emerged in the political arena of Bangladesh and people started gathering en masse behind him. In 1971, people had heard his voice from Kalurhat Betar Kendra and were inspired to a great extent to fight against the Pakistani invaders. If Zia were not a Freedom Fighter, people would not have supported him. Actually Zia appeared in our political sky like a comet. His personal honesty was a great plus point amongst dishonest politicians.//////As Hamas congratulated Palestinians on their "victory" from mosque loudspeakers yesterday, shell-shocked residents surveyed the debris of the deadliest offensive ever launched by Israel on Gaza.//////European and Middle Eastern leaders held a summit in Egypt yesterday aimed at shoring up a fragile truce in the three-week war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza.//////Word has spread among sheltering Gazans that Israel will soon hold its fire, but those who have fled its onslaught are wary of venturing back to homes that may no longer exist.//////An international group of lawyers and jurists said Saturday they would ask the International Criminal Court to probe alleged "war crimes" committed by Israel during its offensive in the Gaza Strip.//////Israel's unilateral ceasefire in Gaza is insufficient, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said yesterday, calling for a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory.//////Nearly a decade ago, the US Marines staged mock urban battles designed to test future tactics for fighting in streets and alleys.

On January 16, a recitation programme titled "Jugalbandi: Abritti o Jiboney" -- featuring eminent reciter couples -- was held. "Balika Ashram", a Muktodhara production, was staged for the fifth time as part of the anniversary programme on January 17. //////Amidst the string of concerts in Delhi, one such event stood out in public memory: The Trio Concert, organised by the Japan Foundation in collaboration with the India International Centre (IIC). In the spotlight were three well known artistes, Mizuno Nobuyuki (horn), Matsuoka Mie (piano) and Kyoko Saburi (violin) who played to an entranced audience. //////Wannabe filmmakers are going to have to want it more than ever now.//////IT would be wonderful if Bangladesh could be transformed into a modern, technologically advanced and prosperous country by 2021, the 50th anniversary of our independence. It is a long term and ambitious objective that is definitely attainable if we can provide modern and appropriate education and training to our young generation, make research and innovation the major focus of our higher education sector, and use science and technology as the major tool for meeting our development goals. Without these, Vision 2021 and "Digital Bangladesh" will be no more than mere election slogans.//////LEADERSHIP is primarily the responsibility of faithful stewardship. Stewardship is the faithful use of all resources and opportunities that is within the care of the government. It is entrusted with the sacred responsibility of profitably using all the resources -- man, material, merit -- for the fulfillment of the hopes and dreams of the people. //////THE UN partition plan of 1947 for British mandated territory of Palestine gave 56% of the land to 31% of the total population who were Jewish. Ironically, the Jewish land ownership in Palestine was less than 7%. The demography of Palestine at the time of partition was 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs and 0.6 million Jews. //////YOUR humble narrator has been travelling for almost 24 hours, right across the world to Europe. I have just settled into a hotel room in The Hague, Holland. It's funny, in cartoons of Holland, you always see windmills and wooden clogs and tulips -- well, the real thing also has all those things in clear view.//////Construction of the proposed wholesale kitchen markets by Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) in the city faces further delay, as land acquisition in three locations could not be completed yet for multiple reasons. //////Wall magazines with stories, poems, cartoons, paintings, science fictions and other articles with beautiful illustrations adorned the walls of the Bangla Academy as a national competition on wall magazines has just ended there.//////
