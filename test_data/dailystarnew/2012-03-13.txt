When does a ruling party let loose its goons upon normal citizens on suspicion that they might attend the opposition rally?

It was shocking to see party goons empowered to coerce, harass and assault political opponents. //////We are concerned at reports of alleged low-quality renovation and development work at Barisal river port, not only causing losses in the crores through damage of vessels, but putting hundreds of lives at risk.
