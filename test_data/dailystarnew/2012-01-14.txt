It is very difficult to accept the spurt in its violent activities. It is equally difficult to understand the ruling party's lack of response to stop these. //////We are appalled to hear the news of eight workers having been forcibly confined to a small room at a brickfield in Khulna. That this could have happened in a part of Khulna city that too near a police station sends worrying signals across.

Some have termed it as secret killings bearing the hallmarks of totalitarian establishment. One rights body has gone to the extreme length of portraying such killings as state sanctioned and is of the view that the same has been resorted to after lessening of extra judicial deaths and so-called crossfire causalities.//////The army chief is in the news in India as well as in Pakistan, but for different reasons. In both cases, the Supreme Court of either country is an arbiter. In India, Chief of Army Staff General V.K. Singh claims that his year of birth is 1950 while the Ministry of Defence has recorded it as 1951. If the government sticks to its date, as it is doing, he retires this May, nearly 10 months before his own calculation of birth date. Not General Singh himself, but some retired top brass have made it a point of honour for the armed forces and want him to vindicate it by challenging the government's decision in the Supreme Court.//////The struggle to raise a nation's standard is undergone first and foremost in the classroom. What has established this idea so unshakably in people's minds is a recent, and to many a rather alarming, phenomenon -- the new intensity of global economic rivalry. The key to economic progress is deeply rooted in a nation's advancement in scientific learning and skill in the application of technical knowledge and a free and unfettered atmosphere for the growth of creative skills//////The latest news in the telecom sector is "International Terrestrial Cable (ITC) license holders will be allowed/issued International Internet Gateway (IIG) license by default."

It is also by nature perhaps the most international business. It cannot be regulated by any national law because its activities go far beyond the borders of any nation. There are many international conventions and protocols that regulate safety and security of maritime operations and protection of the marine environment. There is no international police force to ensure compliance of the provisions of these treaties. //////The adverse impacts of climate change have continued to devastate the lives and livelihoods of millions of people and inflict large economic losses. According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there has been a global increase in weather related disasters between 1980 and 2003. The report estimated that during that period the economic loss due to damage caused by natural disasters is one trillion USD in total. Moreover, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has estimated that in 2008 over 20 million people were displaced by sudden onset of climate-related disasters. It also reported that climate change is already causing 300,000 deaths per year throughout the world and seriously impacting the lives of 325 million people [September 2009].//////Honey comb corals around Saint Martin's island are under stress due to coral bleaching. While the COP 17 -- UN climate convention -- was being held in Durban of South Africa, a Nature Watch Team (NWT) of Ekattor Television watched that a noticeable coral bleaching was defacing the corals of Saint Martin's island of Bangladesh due to global warming. A four-member Scuba diving team moved under water around Saint Martin's during the last week of December, 2011. They observed that the honey comb corals on the east coast of the island are severely affected by the bleaching. In addition, the team also identified corals are getting blanketed by sediments and thus failing to perform their natural physiological activities as a result of over plying of large tourist ships/ferries in the area.//////When the war started, we were unfortunate enough to be based in Pakistan's capital Islamabad. We lived in different countries as part of my husband Syed Najmuddin Hashim's foreign postings. In 1970, he was appointed Executive Director General of Pakistan Council. In that connection, we found ourselves in the official quarters located in the foothills of Margala Hills in Islamabad. Before that we were in Paris, France. //////Razia Khan Amin taught us English literature at the University of Dhaka in the mid-seventies and early eighties. She died at seventy five in a Dhaka hospital of old age complications on December 28, 2011. Kaiser Haq, one of her best students and Bangladesh's premier English language poet, SMS-ed me the news of her death. I was dumbfounded. I didn't even know that she was in a hospital. //////A wintry breeze is towing my soul somewhere//////I go out for a drive to see//////How my city looks when winter emerges//////And roll down the window glass of my car//////To feel the chilly light wind beat in . . .//////It makes me see in my mind's eye//////And whispers in my ears://////'Let go. Let go, my love//////You suffer desperately, weighed down//////By the parting with your beloved//////Somebody belongs to none//////Who you love is only destiny's child!//////Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that affects haemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells) by early destruction. To keep the patient fit and maintain adequate amount of haemoglibin, regular blood transfusion is considered to be essential.

Men who ate more than two servings of red meat each day  which was at the high end of the meat eaters  had a 28 percent increased risk of stroke compared to men who averaged about a third of a serving of red meat each day, the low end of the red meat eaters.//////Walnut consumption helps ward off bad cholesterol and diseases, claims study from University of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Walnuts contain very high levels of polyphenol, an anti-oxidant that can protect the body from molecules which damage tissue.//////On January 5, 2012, President Barack Obama proposed a historic shift in the US military's size and ambitions, scaling back its ability to wage the type of war and occupation that just ended in Iraq as the administration seeks to cut defence spending over the next decade.//////The debate on cyber-terrorism ranges from predictions of an 'Electronic Pearl Harbor,' where chaos and destruction resulting from cyber-terrorism attacks on critical infrastructure and communication systems would result in riots, panic and death, to the dismissal of any genuine threat and attributing the media and government as contributors to the hyperbole. To derive a pragmatic opinion on the contemporary threat posed by cyber-terrorism, a non-partisan analysis of definitions, perceptions and facts must be undertaken.//////War really does strange things to otherwise ordinary human beings. In 1971, the Bengalis of East Pakistan were caught up in a bitter armed struggle to rid itself of West Pakistani hegemony to realize the sovereign independent nation-state of Bangladesh. The rest is history. Snippets of that history are recounted in accurate details in Niaz Zaman's novel A Different Sita. But it is a fictional story that is interspersed with actual political events that led up to the burst of hostilities that the West Pakistani military visited on the Bengali nation on 25 March 1971. Almost the entire novel is restricted to the close to nine months of the conflict that formally ended with the surrender of Lt. Gen. AAK Niazi to Lt. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora on 16 December of that year.//////With the publication of Condoleezza Rice's bulky account of her experience as George W. Bush's closest adviser on foreign policy, the memoirs of the major figures involved in the muddled, fateful decision to invade Iraq almost nine years ago are now nearly all in. We've heard from the president himself, his vice president, defense secretary, CIA chief and, indirectly, from his first secretary of state. (Colin Powell decided it was the better part of valor to let a sympathetic biographer give his version of how he was circumvented and, finally, sidelined.)//////
