A number of factors have been identified as having contributed to the improvement, including free textbook distribution, stipends and certificates for students, training programmes for teachers followed by monitoring and evaluation, better care of students by both teachers and guardians as well as students' own awareness of academic issues.

I think Bangladesh should refer all these killings to the international forums and United Nations as it is clearly a violation of international law. For the sake of peace and prosperity of this region, India must stop killing innocent Bangladeshis. It must control the BSF and investigate all the killings and give punishment to the guilty. By punishing the culprits India can prove that they are really sincere about stopping border killings. In this era of globalisation, no country can expect to live in peace and prosperity without ensuring its neighbours' safety. //////The Durban conference published a draft text at a time when scientists were demanding further radical action to curb carbon emissions. Now global carbon emissions are increasing at the rate of 3 pc per year. The USA and China are the world's biggest emitters but they did not commit to reduce their emissions by a certain percentage under the Kyoto Protocol. Bangladesh is the fifth most vulnerable country in terms of climate change and will face the highest risks because of rising sea levels, floods and other vagaries of Nature in the coming years. Bangladesh could lose nearly one-quarter of the land area by the end of this century. We must raise our voice to hold the rich countries to account for the global climate change and take action immediately.//////The year 2011 will leave behind many a memorable incident of mishaps, terrible crimes, injustice to people, political clashes and upheavals, border killings by the BSF, disappearances of people, diplomatic failures and so on.

We learn about such brutal killings from the newspapers every day. The murders of the Narsingdi mayor Lokman and two BNP leaders, Najmul Islam in Jessore and Wahab in Noakhali, are such cases of secret killing. Besides, very recently, during a pleasure trip by boat in the Changhar canal, two innocent students of Shahjalal Science and Technology University were killed. The government as well as the law enforcers couldn't find out the motive behind such killings. //////The University of Dhaka has long been known as the best educational institution of this country since its inception. The Faculty of Business Studies of this university is one of the best faculties where quality education gets priority and the students get modern facilities to pursue their study. But recently this faculty failed to hold a proper admission test because of the sheer negligence of the members of exam committee. People can now question the quality of education this faculty provides. Penal measures should be taken against the persons who brought disrepute to the faculty. However, this particular incident should not prejudice the image of the faculty or the university as a whole.//////This is about the last wishes of Professor Kabir Chowdhury who died on 13 December 2011, just a day before the 40th Martyred Intellectuals' Day.

A teacher specialised in a particular subject often teaches another subject. //////As a student of a public university, I witnessed many deaths of my fellow students who were either killed in political clashes or by accidents.

To be sure, you do not always agree with Razzak or people who share his political beliefs, but you do know that with such people life is always a matter of principle, to be lived on the high plateau of values. Back in the 1960s, when he was a student, Razzak waged his struggle, along with so many others, against the Ayub Khan regime with a determination which bordered on dignity.

It stated that both prime ministers "approved the principles on the revival of transit trade and the agreement on border trade." //////First and foremost we should acknowledge that the public sentiment now in Bangladesh is inflamed over the Tipaimukh issue. There is a feeling that India is engaged in some kind of conspiracy to implement the Tipaimukh project without paying attention to the legitimate concerns of Bangladesh. Bangladeshis have a right to feel concerned about the decision because in the 21st century water is a very scarce commodity and there are issues regarding water between different states or countries and even between different parts of big provinces. //////A good number of Bangladeshi agriculturists (more than 350 so far) have migrated to Australia since early 1990s. This has been possible because the Australian government's overseas degree recognition authority made the agricultural degrees from Bangladesh equivalent to Australia's degree. This is the only 4-year degree from Bangladesh which has been enjoying equivalent status in Australia since 1989.//////
