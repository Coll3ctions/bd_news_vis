It was a dark day in our history when, through the brazen act, the obscurantists imparted the message that they had no allegiance to the laws of the land. They openly announced that they did not give any credence to the country's constitution. It remains a mystery as to how, with so many members of the intelligence and law enforcing agencies active in the field, so many people could carry bomb making materials to 63 destinations and detonate them without a single one getting caught. //////THE election of new Nepali prime minister augurs well for Nepal in more ways than one. Firstly, it has ended a long political deadlock following the general election which gave the Maoists a clear majority. Secondly, it will, one hopes, prepare the way for a multi-party democratic order in a republican Nepal. Perhaps most important is the election of a rebel leader as the prime minister and the way an insurgent group has got the opportunity of integrating within the body-politics of Nepal, after ten years of violence and disturbance. This reflects a new found maturity in Nepal's polity.//////GREAT events for a nation are few and far between. The nations often create them with sustained bids. Winning the bid to stage the 2008 Olympic was thus justifiably described in China as the realisation of a "century old dream." Ever since, China had awaited with bated breath the arrival of the cherished event amid hostility, cynicism and frustration caused, among others, by the crisis in Tibet. //////A child born in the year that Kishore Kumar died would be 21 years in the first week of August, out of college and already well into the most movie-and-music intense phase of his life. And if he had been born on July 31, 1980, the day Mohammad Rafi died, he would most likely be sharing baby duties with his wife. Would either be aware of the age of melody that they had missed? //////WITH the unpopular Iraq war raging, the economy tanking, and gas and food prices soaring, generic Democrats lead Republicans by about 15% in national polls.

Although we started our journey by introducing parliamentary type of democracy but the journey was halted time and again. After 1990 we got another chance which we failed to sustain. As an inevitable result, we faced 1/11. Now we have got yet another chance to establish a democratic society. But democracy cannot be imposed; it must come from society itself. The political parties must practise democracy within the parties and also adhere to the norms and practices of democracy. //////Amidst boisterous clamours, peremptory assertions, threats of 'resistance' and rejections by our old band of politicians, the elections to a number of municipalities and four corporations were held on 4 August. They were peaceful, free, fair and spontaneously participated by more than 80% of voters. In some centres it was up to 93%. This record turn out sends a message clear and loud. The political parties especially the big two who developed a mindset of leading the nation alternately as self-appointed guardians of the people, do not miss a single opportunity to affirm that they are the voice and conscience of the nation and decisions of the CTG ought to be taken as per their demands and dictates. The vast majority of the people wanted elections at grassroots level for their welfare to be brought about by leaders of the locality. The so-called national leaders' best endeavours to stall the local elections were set at naught forcing them to join the campaign at the end. However, some parties that remained uncompromising in their stance to oppose it found themselves as sick and wounded lions, and ultimately extended support to the rebel party candidates. The elections established the following facts.//////Although the affluent people degrade the environment directly, mostly the poor are affected by environmental degradation. //////Firstly, I would thank the present interim government for their initiative to restructure the PSC. After restructuring of the PSC, I was very optimistic that transparency and accountability would prevail there. Here I would like to say that when the present govt cancelled the final results of the 27the BCS they promised that the viva-voce would be taken as early as possible. //////Due to the rapid development of technology & communication, the world market has become very competitive, especially in manpower export. We know that it is really tough to send our workers to a foreign job market. Unfortunately, we are getting back thousands of workers from the Middle East. It's not clear to us what our embassy officials are doing. It was expected that a high-powered delegation would visit Kuwait and discuss the matter with the Kuwaiti government. //////Since the time of our liberation, till now, the distance between the poor and rich has grown bigger. The economic discrimination among the subcontinent's peoples is a common phenomenon. In case of our country, this discrimination is more visible.//////We are witnessing a dramatic show of power supply. //////According to an earlier government order a sanchaypatra holder who had submitted statement of sanchaypatras purchased by him, had to pay income tax for income above Tk 25,000/-. Subsequently, income up to Tk 1,50,000/- was precluded from taxation, and this order was given retrospective effect to from 1-7-2007 vide Income Tax (Modified) Ordinance, 2007 (Ordinance No 32, 2007) as passed on 29-10-2007. It further enjoined that the excess payment of I/T so made during this period would be paid back to the taxpayer or adjusted against his tax liability. The Income Tax Fixation Ordinance, 2008 and the Income Tax Fixation Supplementary Ordinance, 2008 (Finance Ordinance, 2008), have raised the ceiling of tax from Tk 1,50,000/- to Tk 1,65,000/- for general public and to Tk 1,80,000/- for women and people above 70. But despite the said statutory limits of tax from income, the agencies obtain the statement of sanchaypatras from an individual and realise income tax for income below Tk 1,80,000/- from a woman or a person above 70. Nor do they adjust the refundable excess amount earlier realised while deducting tax.//////There is no alternative to creative education. For effective teaching and learning of English, teachers should use the following ways so that the students can practice the language more and get the opportunity to do better.//////Our attention is drawn to your news report dated 07/8/08" Lobbying may let 2 rental companies off the hook".//////Finance Adviser Mirza Aziz has urged NRBs to remit more foreign currency to Bangladesh. Good piece of advice. But it's also his responsibility to give an idea how the money received so far has been spent. //////It is really sad that we have not learned to take care for our natural resources. Our country has got rivers and lakes but we do not know how to protect them. Rather, we know very well, how to destroy these water bodies. Uttara Lake is one such lakes in Dhaka that has become the victim of human intrusion. The water of the lake has become smelly and it is highly regrettable that human wastes and other waste materials are the cause behind such pollution.//////I was travelling from Calcutta to New Delhi on a train when I came across an Irishman travelling on the same train. We struck a lively conversation and at one stage he asked me, Why is it that people (in India) ask me if I am married? I could not at first reckon what was wrong with the question. I, however, explained that it was customary in the East to ask about marriage, family, etc. The Irishman replied that in his society one wants to know if a person is married only when he or she wishes to marry the latter. The incident was amusing but it made me conscious of the different values that exist in the East and the West. While in the East, especially in the developing countries, the society and culture are mainly family based, in the developed countries of the West the concept of family is literally in bits and pieces.//////Khan's report (Aug;10) on the Rakeen Development Co. from the Middle East getting permission to participate in the house building sector in Bangladesh is a mixed blessing for us. The positive aspect is that it will bring scarce foreign currency into Bangladesh. The important negative aspect is that the investor will naturally repatriate its incomes from Bangladesh from sale of land, buildings and flats. Assuming even a modest return on investment, of say twelve percent, the company will remit back US$1.12 million for every US$1 million brought into Bangladesh, if I am not mistaken! Will it not result in more outflow of foreign currency from Bangladesh?//////On 12 August, most of the newspapers carried the report, as if it were the most important news, "Khaleda is unmoved" to enlist her name as a voter. We know Begum Khaleda Zia is an important person and anything she says or does is news. That is acceptable and people are eager to listen to what she says as she is a former prime minister and chief of a major political party. //////Each nation has a folklore tradition which has been inherited and developed through generations. Our nation is a cultured one with a long history and has inherited and developed its folklore traditions finer than those of other nations. //////Korean scientists used adult stem cells taken from human adipose or fat tissue and differentiated them into smooth muscle cells. They have transformed human stem cells into smooth muscle cells that control blood pressure and allow the normal functioning of organs. //////In recent city corporation elections, some of our fellow citizens have voted and elected some of the (allegedly) corrupt elements. Consequently, we as citizens have sent the wrong signal to our leaders. The election results have indicated that leaders can get away with anything and everything. Our fellow citizens must understand that this signal is bad for our future. It is not the caretaker government's responsibility alone to fight corruption, we as citizens should also take some responsibility.//////In our country most of the school going children have no command over English or computer based programmes which are needed to find a job in future. They can't do progressively well due to our poor educational system//////We often read stories in our newspapers about murder of people by criminals who were arrested before, but were freed on bail. What is the bail given for? As a chance to purify themselves? Is killing supposed to be treated as a result of purification? Is not our judiciary system capable enough to identify which criminals are dangerous enough not to be granted bail?//////Every day if one just has a look at Farmgate bus stand during the peak hours, it will become clear how hard it is to get into a bus. The situation in other bus stands is more or less the same. People have to suffer a lot for the lack of transportation services in the city. //////Water is the most vital thing for the survival of all living organisms including human beings. Access to safe drinking-water is a human right. But, ensuring safe, sweet, potable and drinkable water to the people is a great challenge for Bangladesh. //////Munshiganj is the place where I have been living for many years. It is my birthplace and I love the place a lot.

As the pre-historic people mostly lived in stone-caves, it is commonly thought that there cannot possibly be any trace of humans from that period in Bangladesh. But archaeological excavation of the Wari-Bateshwar site in Narsingdi district indicates just the opposite. Wari-Bateshwar, two neighbouring sites on the Pleistocene flat surface of the eastern Madhupur tract proves the existence of an ancient fort-city (dating back to the year 450 BC) on the bank of the river Buriganga. //////August 15, 2008 marked the 33rd death anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh. On the occasion Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) organised a discussion and a cultural programme at National Theatre Stage, BSA.//////Rajshahi University (RU) students demanded immediate steps to bring the war criminals to justice and staged a daylong cultural programme recently.

The Provincial Assemblies resolution, being tabled in the Punjab Assembly today, also asks for his resignation forthwith.//////AN academic study of public administration must be linked to that of government because the subject is linked to political environment. Policy decisions may be deeply affected by the administrative question of how effectively they can be carried out. //////WALKING the dark streets of Edinburgh late at night, I had a terrifying experience. A crazed-looking gang jumped out of the shadows right into my path. //////Once adored by the Sultans and Nawabs, Jamdani, the descendant of ancient fine muslin cloth, still remains the pride of Dhaka.
