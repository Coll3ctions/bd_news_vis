The verdict follows the submission of a petition filed by Human Rights for Peace for Bangladesh (HRPB) in January this year seeking a directive from the HC regarding the setting up of a national food safety advisory council. The fact that food, or more precisely its consumption, has by now acquired grave importance is underscored by all the efforts that have gone into the movement for consumer rights in Bangladesh. Indeed, with those rights now acknowledged at the political and administrative levels, one might persuade oneself that things are finally falling into place. Such a feeling would be well-placed; and yet there remains much more to be done to ensure that the food citizens consume is safe.//////THESE days you will hear quite a few voices crying hoarse (excuse the clich) about what they think is a threat to national security, and that too symbolised by the Awami League-led grand alliance government.

That too is understandable, given that there are people amongst us who have not been happy with the triumph of secular forces at the December 2008 elections. //////CHITTAGONG University hit the national headlines the other day following the feasting on a trapped antelope by a university teacher.

We should be happy to observe that our next generation is doing well in their assigned jobs and achieving thousands of A plus or even so called 'Golden GPA'. On the very next day of publishing of results, the media informed us that this year also the students would get admission in colleges based on their GPA. This news hurts me, I strongly believe most of the students and guardians feel the same. It's total injustice to merit, it subsides creativity or even 'fair competition' among the admission seekers. It should be stopped right this year. //////A news item a few days ago mentioned that the 400,000 (an inflated figure) rickshaws in Dhaka had been granted a temporary reprieve and allowed to ply on the roads where they had been illegally banned (in contravention to their basic constitutional rights) for over 1-1/2 years, because the DMP 'suddenly realised' that the ban was causing them hardship. What generosity! But does the ordinary traffic cop know about this decision? NO, because he is still insisting on his 'ounce of flesh' to make 'exceptions' (as I can personally testify).//////Dr Manmohan Singh was born on September 26, 1932 in Punjab which is in Pakistan now. He studied at Punjab, Oxford and Cambridge Universities. After leaving Cambridge he spent 9 years as professor in Punjab University. Then he joined in Business and Development Department of UNO in 1966. In 1969 he joined as professor in Delhi School of Economics. He successfully worked as Financial Adviser and finance Secretary to the Government of India. He was the Governor of Reserve Bank, Vice Chairman of Planning Commission and the Chairman of University Grants Commission. After the defeat in Lok Sabha election in 1999 from West Delhi Parliamentary constituency, he did not want to be a politician. But in 2004 he was elected from Assam to the Upper House and became the prime minister of India. When he was the finance minister in PV Narasimha Rao's cabinet when the financial condition of India was very bad. He performed brilliantly at that time. This is his best achievement of his life for which India will remember him forever. //////In recent years, the number of hepatitis patients is increasing rapidly in our country. According to a survey, 15% of the total population of our country is knowingly or unknowingly infected by these fatal diseases. Lack of consciousness & prejudices on hepatitis are the major causes of these virus transmitted diseases. Besides, the carelessness of diagnostic centres, medical centres, unsafe transfusion of blood and drug addiction are the major causes of hepatitis. //////About 400 people, mostly women and children, are trafficked from our country, every month. Majority of the victims are destined for India, Pakistan and the Middle East. The women generally end up as prostitutes in brothels.//////I am sorry to come back again and again to the cantonment house of Begum Zia. Her top lawyer and a high profile member of the party is very strongly referring to the constitution that empowers the president to exercise his supreme power to take action which is not covered by normal law of the country or any other law which is applicable to an ordinary citizen. I am not a lawyer. Therefore, I have no intention to challenge the contention of the BNP party lawyers. But I have the right to ask for a clarification of the article concerned of the constitution. Is it applicable for an ordinary citizen also ? I also do not understand when the case is between Begum Zia and the cantonment board, why the political party of Begum Zia is agitating on the issue. It means that if I have a strong political party and huge supporters I can also use them to fight a legal battle! //////Bangladesh Physiotherapy Students' Association organised a hunger strike for the third time. They want establishment of Bangladesh College of Physiotherapy. Their demand is based on sound logic. In many developing countries, physiotherapy is now considered to be a very important subject. In Canada, entry-level physiotherapy education is offered in 13 universities. Some of these university programmes are at the masters level, meaning that applicants must have already completed an undergraduate degree prior to applying, all of them are slated to be at the post-graduation level by 2010. Many universities also offer graduate programmes in physiotherapy, rehabilitation, or related disciplines at the post graduation or doctoral level. Even in our neighbouring country i.e. India, universities offer undergraduate programmes of physiotherapy with four years of academic and clinical programme and 6 months of compulsory internship. There are over 250 colleges offering undergraduate programmes in physiotherapy (BPT) and more than 50 colleges are offering master's degree in physiotherapy (MPT) with 2 years' duration. PhD in physiotherapy is offered in some universities in the states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.//////The photograph published on page 7 of your newspaper of 26th May, 2009 shows the simply and elegantly dressed Indian Foreign Secretary, Mr. Shiv Shankar Menon, welcoming the new Indian Foreign Minister, Mr. SM Krishna, with a warm handshake and not with a big bunch of flowers. //////The failure to accommodate the ever-growing number of students seeking higher education, among other things, has necessitated the government to open up the sector to non-government operators to run universities. Both public and private universities have been playing a very vital role in spreading higher education across the country, baring some exception. Most of the private universities are Dhaka-centric, only a few have opened campuses outside Dhaka to facilitate and attract a larger segment of students intending to pursue higher education on their chosen disciplines. //////About two years back our Wasa undertook the business of bottled water ('Shanti') like many other private organisations. They invested a huge amount of money in purchasing machineries, paying staff salaries and other overhead expenditures. Although other organisations/ companies are earning considerable profits selling bottled water, Wasa's loss is on the increase. But my question is why Wasa has got involved in such business. Their main duty is to supply water to people of this capital city through the pipeline. But many people in many areas have to remain without water. Wasa's water is not pure and is risky for health. The performance of Wasa is not up to the mark and thus they should concentrate on supplying pure water through a flawless piping network. Bottled water is for the rich and for them there are many private enterprises. Wasa is not a private company. The poor, middle income people and even the rich want pure water from Wasa at a lower price. In the name of shanti it should not bring any ashanti.//////Due to world recession, the govt of Bangladesh has declared several thousand crores taka as rescue package, so that the aggrieved industries or sectors are benefited to some extent. On the other hand, the representatives of FBCCI, DCCI, BGMEA, BKMEA, tanneries, agro sector etc, do often ask the finance minister, commerce minister, BB governor etc to lower bank interest rate. Unfortunately, many public limited companies did manage to raise share capital indicating fatty return on investment but some of them do not pay dividends for years, some do not arrange AGM, some could not be enlisted in stock markets and thus they are enjoying interest free capital for decades. //////Three cheers for The Daily Star for focusing every day in the front page the miserable condition of the lifelines- the four rivers around Dhaka. All citizens of Dhaka, irrespective of their political affiliations, should stand behind this commendable effort undertaken by your newspaper. Because of this bold campaign, the honourable High Court has acted in line with the aspiration of the Dhaka city dwellers. //////Our heartiest thanks to The Daily Star, we laud its concern for our dying rivers, which if not revived will choke our cities. The picture revealed is horrifying, ten feet layer of discarded polythene bags and other waste materials are covering the bed of river Buriganga. Untreated wastes from industries are pouring into the rivers, making them severely polluted, creating a most serious situation.//////Thanks to the Daily Telegraph, British MPs are now beginning to learn the true definition of taxpayers' money.//////The violence erupting among the followers of two sects of people in Maheskhali has become intolerable. The common people are the worst victims. The recent outcome of the violence is the death of two followers of Kawmi sect. Though it is difficult to say clearly who is responsible and who is right or wrong, common people eagerly want a quick remedy. //////Nowadays traffic jam appears to be a big curse in our urban areas. Yes, it is a common phenomenon that city people go to the market and park their vehicles on the road , as if the space of the road is their forefathers' property.//////We all know the story of Frankenstein. In pursuit of vengeance and driven by self-ego, Frankenstein wanted to kill his own creator. In the light of same fictional character, we have witnessed this week such behaviour from Israel to its stalwart ally, the USA, through its open defiance to US proposal to stop Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian lands. Being taken aback by the blunt US proposal to stop further settlements on the Palestinian land, Israel apparently has taken a path of defiance, rather than compliance with the US proposal. //////There is no dearth of talent in our wonderful land - thousands of GPA 5 students. No electricity, no water, dusty, smoky, jam-packed totally unhealthy environment where most of the valuable time is loafed off on the streets - that is our Dhaka city, even then our meritorious students are making this result. Compared to the students of the developed countries, our students have to work harder for this achievement. But what are we doing for them? A great shame indeed. Young sweet children of the parents are being forced to go on hunger strike for the third time. A final decision should be made in time. //////Rajuk has disgraced all of us. We live in England, but send money to relatives in Bangladesh and wish to buy a plot of land in order to be able to settle there in the near future. At first, Rajuk tells the applicants that any proof of Bangladeshi nationality, will suffice, when put with the application form. And then, after many of us have already sent off our application forms, they claim that photocopies of Bangladeshi passports must be enclosed alongside the application form and other documents. Now, as the selection process of application forms is an ongoing process, they inform us that all passports must be valid. If they don't have this information, then they discard the applications. Why, if they truly need the information, do they not request it? They have everyone's email address, they have their house addresses, and telephone numbers. They cannot simply throw away thousands of applications merely for lack of information, which they did not at first, request. A hefty list, is it not? Following on from that aberration, they claimed that they would inform the general public on who had got a plot by the end of the one-month following the deadline, this turned into six months.
