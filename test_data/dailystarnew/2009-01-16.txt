The lawmaker in question, Abdul Quddus, a former minister of state elected from Natore-4 constituency, later defended his acceptance of the gifts as a response to the love of the people. That was as untenable a statement as anyone can imagine, for there was something grossly wrong about the ethics behind the gifts. While those who took the initiative of making those presents to the MP (and they included businessmen and school teachers) should have realised that they were not doing the right thing, it should have been for the MP to dissuade his well-wishers from indulging in such an effusive and eyebrow-raising act. //////AN often overlooked point about the recently concluded elections is the extent to which they signal that we are perhaps now entering into a period of increased political sophistication, both in terms of how elections are conducted as well as, hopefully, how elected governments conduct themselves.//////THE curtain was brought down on 2008 with national elections in Bangladesh.

People with new voter ID exercised their power. //////We are the people of Bangladesh. We know how we achieved our independence in 1971. From the very beginning, we were cherishing the hope that our country would be a prosperous one, but still now we are not capable of translating our dream into reality. After passing a crucial period, we can see a new sun in a new horizon. New and the next generations want to get a new Bangladesh where corruption, violence etc will be absent. //////You have been giving us news for long of massacre of our brethren in Palestine, whose lives were never safe, (but) tell me what could we do, when the rest of the world remains a powerless observer!//////When the winter becomes severe, the destitute people lead their lives in poor condition. We see, especially in Dhaka, that at least 3.5 lakh people have no habitats. //////Change is one of the most critical aspects of effective management or governance. There has never been an age in which change has not taken place. The demographic profile of a country is changing. So the country looking forward for development must adjusts itself with the changing environment. Every individual, organization and country has the responsibility to change themselves or help in changing people, if it is positive! The recent endeavour of Prothom Alo as an organisation to encourage people to change is worth mentioning. Especially the oaths sworn by different group of people given in Radio Foorti or FM are really promising. It will definitely have a positive impact if people have the intention to change. Besides the oaths are easily understandable especially to the people who are illiterate and are turned to radio for entertainment but unfortunately it will be difficult for the illiterate people to understand the slogan as they can not read the slogan given in the advertisement "Bodle jao bodle dao" (change yourself and change others) which was widely displayed all around Dhaka city and other places. Anybody who doesn't know how to read will think that this should be the system, like men should sit and women should stand, or interpret it in their own way. I, out of curiosity asked my helping hand (maid) what she understands from the picture as she cannot read. She just explained that the guys sitting are feeling irritated by the woman as she is standing in front of them! As she is not able to read she understood it in her own way. I always think that the posters should always be positive and should be developed keeping the illiterate people or general people in mind. //////"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever," But the Gulshan-Banani Bridge, the so-called concrete 'beauty' has become a beast for the residents of Gulshan, particularly for my family and I who are the worst victims.//////My heartfelt congratulations to the grand alliance for achieving an unprecedented win in the recently held general election. But they should not forget the people and party workers who gave their lives over the past 7 years just to bring this change and to bring the country back to the path of democracy. Especially, we should not forget Ivy Rahman who lost her life under most tragic circumstances. //////Recently, our newly appointed home minister told that the post-election clashes were the results of internal conflicts in the BNP. She might be right. But holding a highly responsible position she should refrain from blaming others. //////I am very sorry to see that Sheikh Hasina is again making some mistakes from the very beginning. The first priority should be to give autonomy to all media outlets including TV channels which are run by taxpayers' money but fail to talk about the real problems of Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina had made the same mistake in 1996. Which party doesn't want poverty alleviation? So please stop non-specific distraction because people are conscious and today or tomorrow you have to pay for this intentional mistakes. //////Recently, the Awami League President Sheikh Hasina has been sworn in as the new prime minister. Thirty-one others have been inducted into her council of ministers. We have seen that the cabinet comprises 23 ministers and eight state ministers. Of them, only AMA Muhith, Matia Chowdhury, AK Khandaker, Syed Ashraful Islam, Syed Abul Hossain and Dipankar Talukder have previous experience. Three came on technocrat quota. Many senior leaders including presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Abdul Jalil, Suranjit Sengupta, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, and Asaduzzaman Noor were left out. Workers Party President Menon and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal President Inu were not also included though they were widely expected to be ministers.//////We often hear much about human rights from the UN. But when it comes to a Muslim country, the UN remains quite silent. If we look back to the last few days, we can see that more than 900 hundred people have been killed and scores of civilians were wounded in Israeli military operations. Even the injured people are being barred from getting medical treatment. What is more, a mosque in the northern part of Palestine has been hit. Thus Israeli continues its blatant violation of human rights.//////Congratulations to the newly elected MPs. There will be a total of three hundred and 45 MPs, including the selected women MPs. Now if each MP avails the tax free car facility for Tk. 2 crore BMW then with the 200% duty waiver the total amount will be Tk. 1,380 crore. Moreover, many of the cars will be used by unnamed friends and business partners of the MPs.//////I must congratulate the grand alliance for having secured the historic victory. But they should not be overwhelmed by this victory. They should bear in mind that people have elected them with a dream of better life, corruption free good governance and trial of war criminals. However, the prime task of the government must be controlling the prices of essentials. And I believe, the newly formed government will have every scope to control the prices. I believe this from my past experience in the AL tenure after the 1996 election. Nowadays, the prices of crude oil as well as edible oil in the international market have fallen significantly. But we find little reflection of this in our local market. Bus fares had been increased sharply with price hike of crude oil in the international market. But after the price fall, we hoped the bus fares would be reduced but nothing happened The newly formed government can bring about the desired change in this regard by rescheduling the bus fares.//////As the New Year began and a new government took office, I felt I must write a note of thanks to the outgoing caretaker government and the Election Commission for managing the most peaceful, decent, disciplined and efficient national vote ever experienced in this country.//////I am not directly or indirectly related to any political parties but I maintain tacit support to a party over 20 years that sometimes gives some insights for my personal development in fulfilment of some social, moral political obligations.//////The head of India's army on Wednesday confirmed that Pakistan has redeployed troops along the two countries' tense border but said he regarded war as a "last resort."//////Gripping their wailing children, terrified Gaza civilians scuttled for any shelter they could find yesterday as Israeli tanks barrelled into the heart of a residential neighbourhood in Gaza City.//////The "Popular Front for the Liberation of PalestineGeneral Command" the quotation marks are necessary since this outfit controls at most 500 cadres is responsible for all the tin-pot rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon this past week.//////British Foreign Secretary David Miliband on Thursday delivered a sharp critique of outgoing US President George W.
