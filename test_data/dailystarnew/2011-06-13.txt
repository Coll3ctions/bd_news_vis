The BNP's ire has to do with the prime minister's taking a stand recently against a continuation of the caretaker system following a Supreme Court judgement on the matter. Sheikh Hasina has since softened her stance by publicly asking the BNP to make its own position known in the Jatiyo Sangsad. Her unambiguous statement that nothing one-sided will be done should have been taken advantage of by the BNP. Unfortunately, by opting for yet another hartal and implying that there will be more, the opposition has only contributed to a muddying of the waters.//////We find it hard to understand the senseless act of plundering of national wealth, and that too at the behest, reportedly, of a lawmaker.

Among others, local elite, political leaders, development workers, cultural activists and journalists addressed. Speakers urged the authorities concerned for fulfillment of the demands.

Police quoting locals said Yunus stabbed his son Yusuf indiscriminately with a sharp weapon following a quarrel with him, leaving him critically injured. Later, the victim was admitted to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries Saturday evening. Although a case was filed but none was arrested in this connection.//////After watching the headlines of the TV channels I came to know that BNP and Jamaat-e- Islami again called a countrywide dawn-to-dusk hartal on 12th and 13th June with a view to protesting the cancellation of the caretaker government system. I think hartal is not the legal way to stop the amendment on the caretaker government provision. //////The government and the Education Ministry always neglect us who are studying in the National University. Even in the recent budget 2011-12, our Finance Minister gave emphasis only on primary and secondary education. We are the students of session 2008-2009. After our admission three years have passed, but yet we have not got our first year results. How many days do the authorities need to publish the results? They must remember that most of the students are from the middle class background that needs jobs urgently to support their families. We would draw the kind attention of our Honorable Prime Minister, Education Minister and the NU authorities to free us from this session jam and publish the results in time so that we can have a hassle free, smooth educational life.//////I was appalled to hear the news on Channel-i just a couple of days back regarding the physical torture by a teacher of Dhaka Ideal School & College, Banasree Branch, Dhaka. The victim, a student of class four, told the TV reporter about this beast. The butcher teacher beat her with a bunch of scales and broke her hand; she is now under treatment in a city hospital. //////From the famous peaceful city of mosques Dhaka is fast growing into a city foot overbridges, flyovers and expressway.We are doubtful if the growing population of Dhaka which has already exceeded over one crore and fifty lakh people would ever be able to live in peace with electricity, water and gas supply and the road traffic jam would ever be solved? Would our town planners, engineers and Rajuk kindly enlighten us on the matter?//////We thank the government for taking the decision of not increasing or imposing new taxes and not making TIN mandatory for the BO Account holders. This will have positive impact on the capital market. The capital market needs more investment, mainly from the financial institutions and business communities. We should encourage them to invest in shares. The government can play a leading role in this area. This will definitely improve the status of the capital market. We strongly urge the Ministry of Finance to allow investment of undisclosed income in purchase of shares of listed companies by adding section 19D of Income Ordinance 1984 in budget FY 2011-12.//////A few days ago, a fake doctor named A. Wahab Khan has been caught red handed without having any professional medical certificate! It is not an isolated occurrence. There are still many doctors across our country serving the nation not actually being a doctor! //////The multipolar world has become a global reality. Nearly twenty years have passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of US-USSR bipolar world order. The leaders of the four fast growing economies grouped under BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) want their own respective roles in the world economy. Brazil and India also want their economic presence reflected in permanent membership of the UN where China and Russia already have permanent seats. Other major emerging economies, such as South Korea and South Africa also want to play a role in global politics. The global economy is going through a rapid change and the centre of the world both economically and strategically is shifting to the East, mainly Asia.//////We have become very frustrated by the attitude of our politicians. It is surprising that what common people can easily predict, they fail to see. We all know that BNP's demand for a mid term election will never be realized. Awami League-led government will not step down, the sun may rise in the west but stepping down by the present government will never happen. So, our question to the BNP is why they are wasting breath on an issue that is futile. BNP should concentrate on other issues which are making life difficult for the people and compel the government to solve the problems.//////In the present day culture we become used to Share Market intelligence. Almost regularly we find news in both print and electronic media regarding fall or even crash in Stock prices. Recently one young reader of my articles in the newspaper requested me to write something drawing the distinctions between 'Stock' and 'Share'.//////There is a problem in our local politics, it's like a disease. No, I'm not talking abut 'blame game'. Obviously 'blame game' has always been there. I'm talking about the 'superiority complex'. Each one thinks he is better than the other. It's like claiming, "shob paji khali ami valo"; when in reality not one of the major two groups can prove itself better than the other. Both prefer 'hartal' as a way to voice their opinion against government's activities while going to the parliament is a way better option. None thinks constructively, both like destruction.//////BNP Chief Begum Khaleda Zia in a recent press conference said, "Caretaker government will stay; there is no need or scope for dialogue". She extended her order and asked the present government to resign, as if she is the supreme authority of Bangladesh and everything should move as she dictates and all others are to follow orders. But she did not specify to whom this government should submit the resignation and handover power.//////The word 'shood' is grossly misunderstood, misinterpreted and is being used as a religio-political weapon by vested interested parties with ulterior motives. 'Shood' literally means profit or dividend. But an age-old stigma is attached to the word 'shood' because of money lending business. What has been prohibited in Islam is the practice of 'Usury' which is comparable with 'Dadon' or 'Mohajani' business in our country. In Dadon or Mohajani business, the borrower is forced to pay around ten percent interest per month which amounts to 120 percent per year. As an alternative, the borrower is forced to surrender a fixed part of his crop yield or fish yield to the Mahajan. Islam has categorically prohibited this practice. Nowadays, because of accounting, administrative complications, etc., banks and other financial institutions fix up a rate of return for a certain period, and that return is commonly called 'shood'. This practice and the very word 'shood' is misinterpreted by so-called Islamic banks and cunningly used as a tool. They also fan up religious sentiments among the Muslims on this issue. (I found the interest rates of Islamic banks are the highest. They only use catchy Arabic words to attract the depositors) In the above context, I call upon the government, banks, financial institutions etc. to discontinue using the word 'shood and replace it by dividend or 'Labbhangsha'.//////As a Bangladeshi I feel proud for my country and also for Awami League government. This party is known as a secular party. Often anti-liberation groups raise their angry voices against secularism. So, it is the duty of Awami League to make Bangladesh a better place for all castes and creeds.//////A news item published in a national daily of June 8 that the Shoura Council of Saudi Arabia recommended to government to take necessary measures to allow Saudi women to vote in municipal elections. Of course it is encouraging news for the Saudi women as well as the women who are deprived of their voting rights in many societies of the world in the name of Islam. It may be noted that if the Islamic codes are interpreted partially, it may create misconceptions among people about Islam. //////In North America, getting a mobile phone number is as difficult as getting a Visa or Master card. Before allowing a mobile phone number, the serving company does a complete credit check of the applicant and after being fully satisfied, the applicant gets a connection, unlike Pakistan, where you just walk into an outlet, grocery store or a paan-cabin and buy a SIM. //////Syrian troops yesterday fought violent battles with "armed gangs" in flashpoint Jisr Al-Shughur town, state television said, as international outrage mounted at the regime's harsh crackdown on protesters.//////Flooding caused by torrential downpours in central and southern China has killed 94 people and left 78 others missing, the government said yesterday, warning of further heavy downpours ahead.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the death of top African al-Qaeda militant Fazul Abdullah Mohammed is a "significant blow" to the group.//////Talks to resolve Yemen's political crisis have failed after the deputy to wounded President Ali Abdullah Saleh refused to speak with groups demanding he cede power immediately, opposition figures said.//////Embattled fighters in Sudan's flashpoint northern state of Southern Kordofan said yesterday that they had shot down two northern army planes, claims denied by Khartoum.//////Fighting between Muammar Gaddafi's forces and Libyan insurgents raged yesterday across swaths of western Libya, with casualties reported in Zawiyah where rebels launched an offensive after a two-month lull.//////West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee faced the first hiccup since assuming power when her government was forced to withdraw an ordinance aimed at returning 400 acres of land last weekend which the previous Left Front administration had acquired from farmers to build the world's cheapest car plant. //////Thousands of Shia Bahrainis rallied Saturday answering a call from their largest opposition group, Al-Wefaq, in the first demonstration since a mid-march crackdown on Shia-led pro-democracy protests.//////US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords released the first pictures of herself yesterday since she was shot in the head in January.//////An Indian yoga guru on hunger strike for the last eight days in protest at government corruption said yesterday he has called off his fast.//////A Yemeni colonel, two soldiers and four suspected al-Qaeda militants were killed in clashes in the flashpoint southern city of Zinjibar yesterday, a military official and medics said.//////Scientists have uncovered a trio of genes tied to migraine headaches, including one in which the link is exclusive to women, according to a study published yesterday.//////Ash from Chile's volcanic eruptions prompted Australian airline Qantas to ground some domestic services and some flights to New Zealand yesterday, after plumes drifted across the Pacific.//////Turkey's ruling Islamist-rooted party is set for a record landslide win in yesterday's parliamentary polls and a third straight term in power, according to a projection and partial results.//////The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was the target of a sophisticated cyberattack earlier this year, the New York Times reported Saturday, quoting senior officials at the world lender.//////Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was recovering satisfactorily yesterday after undergoing surgery in Cuba and was expected to return home "in the coming days," officials from the presidential entourage said.//////A Filipino blacksmith's son who stopped growing when he was a toddler was declared the world's shortest man yesterday as he celebrated his 18th birthday.//////Russia yesterday protested the arrival of a US Navy cruiser equipped with a ballistic missile defence system in the Black Sea to take part in naval exercises with neighbouring Ukraine, saying it was a threat to its national security.//////Authorities in the Indian city of Mumbai have promised a full investigation after a prominent newspaper crime reporter was killed in a drive-by shooting near his home.//////Thousands of Shia Bahrainis rallied Saturday answering a call from their largest opposition group, Al-Wefaq, in the first demonstration since a mid-march crackdown on Shia-led pro-democracy protests.//////The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas rejected yesterday its rival Fatah's nomination of Salam Fayyad as prime minister in a transitional government.//////Italians began voting yesterday in referendums on nuclear power, water privatisation and a law granting Silvio Berlusconi immunity in what is seen as a vital test for the embattled premier.//////The 54th International Art Exhibition, titled Illuminations, directed by Bice Curiger and organised by la Biennale di Venezia (under the presidency of Paolo Baratta), is generating much interest among artists, art collectors and enthusiasts from all over the world. The biennale is being held at the two main locations of Giardini and the Arsenale, as well as other venues around the city. This year's Biennale is particularly significant to us as Bangladesh is participating in it for the first time.//////A three-day District Cultural Fair ended at Satkhira Shilpakala Academy premises on June 8. The festival was organised by Satkhira District Administration. //////Greg Garcia knew he had the formula right when My Name is Earl began garnering wide acclaim. But four seasons later it was cancelled and Garcia found himself back at the drawing board. And a while later, he gave the world Raising Hope, a show that treads a fine line between being something new and a rehashed version of My Name is Earl. But, there are considerable differences and the clincher is the fact that Raising Hope is much removed from most of the other family shows on TV. //////German film director Roland Emmerich has admitted courting controversy with his film that questions the authorship of Shakespeare's plays.//////Moulvibazar unit of the Nazrul Academy held a discussion and cultural programme last Friday to mark the 112th birth anniversary of National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. The event was held at the Saifur Rahman auditorium. //////Two years after Bangladesh adopted the Right to Information (RTI) Act it is time to ask whether and how well the law is working. //////The proposed budget for the fiscal year 2011-12 could hardly initiate a long debate among different cross-sections of society, when the unanticipated 36-hour hartal was called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies. Though the nationwide shutdown programme was enforced immediately after the day that Finance Minister A.M.A. Muhith placed the budget in the Jatiya Sangsad (JS), it had no connection whatsoever with the budget.//////
