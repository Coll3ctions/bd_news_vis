Still more frightening is the shape it is taking. It has turned in some places communal, regional and ideological. Yet whatever the direction, it indicates a trend where the rule of law is lessening and sheer force is gaining recognition. I had imagined that the political parties would not stoke fires and find a way to douse them. Instead, I find some of them organizing their cadres and arming them to jump into the fray at their asking.

It is reported that while the workers are demanding a threefold increase in the monthly minimum salary - from the existing Taka 1,662 to Taka 5,000 - the factory owners are ready to offer up to only Taka 2,500 a month. Both sides seem to have their own perspectives and reasoning with no meeting point in sight. At the end of the day, however, the government will have to give its verdict anyway. In order to promote good owner-labour relationship and to avoid further labour unrest, it is absolutely essential that the rationale of the government's decision is made clear to all stakeholders. To establish such a rationale, a number of questions need to be answered. //////Power generation and supply in Bangladesh are in a precarious position today. Load shedding is a common feature; day and night! The power is mostly (over 70%) coming from unreliable plants that are over 20 years old.

Unfortunately in Bangladesh the contribution of the environmental goods and services in the national economy has been ignored for a long time. In the changing circumstances of global climate it is high time that we wake up and recognize the contribution of the environment to sustain our economy. //////BANGLADESH is a developing country where fisheries and aquaculture remain very important as a source to supplement animal origin nutrition, employment generation, improving environmental condition and earning revenue in foreign exchange. Environmental pollution now-a-days poses a great threat to human beings as well as to animal kingdom over the world.

Various heavy metal ions such as As, Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Hg etc. are entering into environment through various processes. ////// When Ameena's mother put on a small, gold nose pin on her nose, Ameena felt very special. The nose pin had a sparkling white stone in the middle. It seemed to give her a place of her own among her two older sisters. She was twelve years old when the nose pin was put on her nose. Ma had invited three village women for the special day. They had sung some folk songs and then one of these women had pierced Ameena's nose. It was the first celebration of an event in Ameena'a life. Ameena often wondered why her mother had given her such special treatment. After all, she often heard Baba complaining how, as the third child, she had turned out to be a daughter. She sometimes wished that she could turn the wheel back and become a son, the torchbearer of the family. Why were there so many women in the village who had two daughters and then the third child was a son? And this gave Ameena a feeling of having failed her parents, as if being a third daughter was something to be ashamed of. But the nose pin seemed to raise her spirits a bit. Maybe her mother was not so disappointed after all.//////Professor Jahangir Tareque-- linguist, lexicographer and man of letters-- died on June 29 at the age of 66.

The foreign minister had given the visit a perfect score. She also spoke in a number of seminars arranged to evaluate the visit. In these seminars, she articulated herself brilliantly, based on the agreements and the Joint Communiqu of the visit, to convince everybody that Bangladesh-India relations were poised for a paradigm shift for the better to the mutual benefit of the two countries. She had then said that India's sincerity was amply manifested in its positive response to Bangladesh's power needs in giving Bangladesh a US $1 billion credit and a host of other offers that spoke of India's goodwill in improving Bangladesh-India relations.//////GENERAL David Petraeus, who was credited with turning around the Iraq war, has taken over the responsibility of the commander of the United States-led NATO forces in war-ravaged Afghanistan following the sacking of General Stanley McChrystal for insubordination. The general lost no time in arriving in Kabul following his appointment by President Barack Obama and subsequent approval by the Senate. He has also paid a visit to Pakistan and held talks there with key figures since that country is also inextricably linked with the Afghan tangle in many ways.//////TURKEY and Brazil in a meeting with Iranian President Ahmadinejad managed to secure an agreement which few international observers had thought would be possible. Prior to the meeting, leaders such as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev put the chances of an agreement at 30 per cent, while American leaders scoffed at reaching any achievable agreement. The significance of the 17 May 2010 agreement was that it offered Iran an alternative to processing nuclear fuel to weaponised status, and addressed concerns of enrichment being in the hands of states which it did not trust. However, the caveat to the deal was that it offered too little and came too late for legitimacy with the international community.//////The age of epistolary conversations is over. There is something about technology, about post-modern developments, that often comes in the way of your understanding of life and the bigger meanings which punctuate it at regular intervals. When that is the perception, you try travelling back in time, the objective being a comprehension of the world as it was in the days when ideas took shape in letters, which again came in longhand. And when these letters involve men and women who have passed into history as its defining voices, the pleasure derived from a reading of them becomes all the greater. Deep poignance underlines such missives, or an exchange of them. And it does so through a recreation of the varied processes that once went into a shaping of historical perspectives, into a moulding of perceptions about the place of nations on a global platform.//////
