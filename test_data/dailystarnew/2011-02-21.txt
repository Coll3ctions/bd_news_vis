And these are values we reasserted in February 1952 through our spirited defence of our language when it came under threat from quarters not too happy about according it the place on the political and social pantheon it deserved. In 1952 and before it, the Bengali struggle was not so much against a foreign language as it was a movement against crude attempts to have Bangla take a back seat in our national life. The sadness comes in remembering that it took the lives of Bengali young men for their language to find its niche in the politico-cultural clime of the times. //////It seems that the authorities are least concerned with the many unauthorised and unmanned railway crossings that continue to be the cause of train-bus collisions and deaths with disturbing regularity. The two accidents that occurred in Jessore and Comilla on the 19th of Feb is a stark reminder of the lackadaisical attitude towards public safety. //////Whilst Bangladesh woke up to the grim reality of losing against India in the much-hyped opener of the World Cup, their next opponents, Ireland were in a relaxed mood the next morning. //////The day after the opening match of the World Cup has been one full of sighs and yawns, the lack of interest and people around the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, the premise so much in vogue over the last week or so, could be interpreted in many ways but it would be too hasty to suggest that all is lost for the Tigers.//////Bangladesh U23 football team left here yesterday for Kuwait to play their away match of the pre-Olympic qualifying round with a hope of putting up a good show despite the fact that Robert Rubcic got little time to prepare his charges due to the domestic league.//////Australia launch their World Cup bid against Zimbabwe without their usual favourites tag but banking on fearsome pace duo Brett Lee and Shaun Tait to fire them to a fourth successive title.//////Despite Bangladesh's 87-run defeat against India in the opening match of the World Cup 2011, the Tigers' run-chase came in for praise from Indian cricket writers who termed it as a "bold" attempt.//////Sweden's two-time French Open finalist Robin Soderling won his third tournament of the year here on Sunday, beating unseeded Croat Marin Cilic 6-7 (10/8), 6-3, 6-3 in the final of the Marseille Open.//////Veteran batsman Mahela Jayawardene scored a sparkling century as Sri Lanka crushed Canada by 210 runs in their opening World Cup match at Mahinda Rajapakse Stadium on Sunday.//////New Zealand thrashed Kenya by 10 wickets in the World Cup on Sunday, making a mockery of the African nation's campaign to feature at the slimmed-down 2015 edition.//////When we are all done with the prosaic and mundane, and by that I mean the ubiquitous statistics related to a cricket match, one element stands out; a brilliance so shining and glorious that it shrouded all and everything into pale insignificance.

World Cup 2011 was set alight at Mirpur and its odds on that we may not see the likes of this innings anywhere, least of all in the World Cup, for a very very long time.//////New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori said his team must not lower their guard against tougher opposition after cantering to an easy 10-wicket win over Kenya in the World Cup on Sunday.//////Sri Lanka vice-captain Mahela Jayawardene said Sunday he may quit international cricket after the World Cup.//////Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande was left struggling for answers after a 10-wicket World Cup mauling at the hands of New Zealand nudged them closer to exile from cricket's most exclusive club.//////When Shakib Al Hasan won the toss, the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium erupted in cheer, but soon there was a short pause when the crowd heard that he chose to bowl first.

Engineering programmes, on the other hand, have still restricted themselves into a span of mere four years. However, with the great advancement of technology, the course load has significantly increased with more and more up-to-date science and its corresponding applications that students need to gorge. //////It is indeed a tough task which the international leaders are carrying out right now regarding Egypt by being silent. The cry for democracy in the streets of Cairo is intentionally not being heard by all the pro-democratic leaders of the world. It is quite evident that the leaders of the West, especially of US do not seem to have any problem with the dictatorship as long as it cooperates with their policies. //////Hazrat Shahjalal (R) International Airport, Dhaka needs an official website. New comers and travellers from around the world look for information about the airport and the services it offers.

One cannot imagine using those in shopping malls or any other public places. The government hospitals are glaring examples and many private clinics are no better in that respect. The international airports of Dhaka and Chittagong are quite spick and span but one is disappointed when s/he visits the washrooms-- leaking taps, amenities not working properly, soaps and tissue papers are absent, if by chance there is soap, these are soap bars, not liquid ones, using these are unhygienic. We hope authorities will give proper attention to this important issue and take necessary steps. It is surprising that no one bothers about the harmful effects of their negligence.//////Dictators like Kings, want to rule with the unspoken wish to reign "till death sets them apart"! Kings get away with it, as the tradition is anchored on prehistoric realities. Even today, the kings and queens of England are surviving, because they consciously choose the 'Scepter and Crown', over the authority and power to rule. England is ruled by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, holding full executive authority.//////As per the news appeared in The Daily Star that the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism in a recent letter sent to the management of Biman stated that it was not happy with the explanation towards justifying the loss they incurred which is about over Taka 80 crores despite an increase in the passenger ratio from the previous year. //////Ganja, a highly potent form of cannabis, is most commonly used in all the areas of Dhanmondi.

It is also Language Martyr's Day. It was fifty-nine years ago on this day that Barkat, Rafiq, Jabbar, Shafiur and Salam sacrificed their precious young lives for the honour and preservation of our mother language, Bangla. //////It was indeed a glorious day for all Bangladeshis when the United Nations Educational, Scientific & Cultural Organization (Unesco) proclaimed February 21 as International Mother Language Day. This proclamation was no doubt a significant event because it not only honoured our mother language but also all mother languages round the globe. //////The new millennium opened with international recognition of our language martyrs' sacrifice and our movement for linguistic, cultural and national identity. With the designation of Ekushey February as International Mother Language Day, global recognition was given to our role in vindicating the importance of the mother tongue in the national context and in our private lives. The meaning of the term "mother tongue" is that all children learn their language on their mother's laps.//////One definition of dictatorship, according to Webster's Dictionary, is "absolute power or authority" vested in one individual. So, if there is a government which gives -- officially or unofficially -- absolute power and control of all organs of government in the hands of one individual, it is by definition a dictatorship, even if the government is an elected one.//////
