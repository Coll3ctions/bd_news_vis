the district and sub-district levels instantly strikes a responsive chord in us. These are not meant to be proforma reports, something that is refreshingly revealed through some excerpts of the letter which the establishment secretary had dispatched to the deputy commissioners. //////THE conference on racism that the United Nations has organised in Geneva has run into trouble. It should not have, considering that the issue on the table is of grave importance to the international community. But that does not appear to have been taken into account by the western, largely European, nations which chose to boycott the conference because they did not approve of Iranian President Ahmadinejad's criticism of Israel. The boycott has obviously left UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon feeling justifiably embarrassed. His ire shone through his remarks, in which he clearly notes that nations that could help to forge a path to a better future were not to be seen. And among those nations have been the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Poland and the Netherlands.//////HISTORY, for some men, has regularly been a search for scapegoats to explain away some monumental failures. It is a feature of the collective human experience that will likely not go away any time soon. Watch Saifur Rahman. He has, for yet one more time, decided to retire from politics. There can be nothing wrong with that, considering that Rahman has had a rather long day in the sun and considering too that his party is now in a state of bad health. //////THE G-20 leaders met in London on April 2 to discuss plans to tackle the current global economic crisis.

Actually, it was in the beginning now that I think about it. Thousands of others around me stood together, running shoes, running shorts, with their best runner's faces on, and I was one of them. It was a marathon, 26.2 miles, or 42.2 kilometers, to conquer, and all I had to depend on were my legs and a mind that said I could do it.//////Ahead of the ICC World Twenty20, Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons has his eye more on the world cricketers playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) rather than his two charges -- Mohammad Ashraful and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza -- who are yet to make the first eleven.//////Chris Gayle hammered an explosive 44 not out to power Kolkata Knight Riders to an 11-run victory over Kings XI Punjab in a rain-hit Indian Premier League match on Tuesday.//////Security-hit Pakistan finds shelter in the United Arab Emirates as they host Australia in the first one-day international here on Wednesday, with a hope that the desert venues continue to be their new home of cricket.//////Andrew Strauss has a "fairly good idea" who will be batting No. 3 for England against West Indies and hinted that those candidates in county cricket could edge ahead of those plying their trade in the IPL.//////Australia batsman Phillip Hughes says it will be the realisation of a childhood dream if he plays against England in the Ashes this year.//////Sir Alex Ferguson has leapt to the defence of striker Dimitar Berbatov as Manchester United look to put their season back on track following their unexpected FA Cup exit.//////Didier Drogba believes Chelsea will prove they can last the pace in the Premier League title race by brushing aside fellow FA Cup finalists Everton on Wednesday.//////Football Association (FA) officials admitted Monday that the much criticised pitch at Wembley Stadium needs improvement.//////Michael Mancienne has emerged as a potential candidate for the unenviable role of man-marking Barcelona star Lionel Messi when Chelsea face Barcelona in next week's Champions League semifinal.//////Fitness is an integral part of any modern game and cricket is no exception.

After the captaincy controversy and a disastrous first game, they now have to deal with bouncers and googlies of a different kind - the writing of a mystery blogger, who claims to be a member of the team and seems determined to out every team secret, warts and all. The jury's out on the blogger's identity he blogs as 'Fake IPL Player' - but the writing indicates a keen knowledge of the team's working and the typical daily grind of an overseas tour. Few players are named but the nicknames are unambiguous the blogger's team-mates' include a former India allrounder called Kaan Moolo, an opener called Calypso King, a former captain in Lord Almighty and an opening bowler called Little John. //////Bangladesh Under-19s take on the visiting Sri Lankan Under-19 side in the first three-day match at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium today.//////As with the Kolkata captaincy issue, the showdown between England's two big beasts, Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen, did not quite live up to its billing. The pair did come face to face, but not as everyone had hoped: it was Pietersen, with his lesser-spotted offbreaks, who ended up bowling to Flintoff, with his well-disguised fear of getting out to his international colleague, not - as had been hoped - the other way round. And even then, curious onlookers had to settle for a pulled boundary and a couple of bunted singles. As Pietersen said after claiming he had got an inside edge to the ball from Muttiah Muralitharan that removed him for a golden duck, such is life.//////With five sons, four daughters and a wife to feed, Mohammad Rasheed has become a casualty of Pakistan's descent into the sporting wilderness.//////West Indies coach John Dyson criticised the state of the Grace Road pitch after 14 wickets fell on the first day of his side's opening tour match against Leicestershire here on Monday.//////State Minister for Youth and Sports Ahad Ali Sarkar has been appointed chairman of the National Sports Council (NSC).

cannot but thank him for his observations that will help the authorities conduct the trial in an appropriate way. It is really unpleasant to think that the war criminals will not be punished for the crimes they committed. Without their trial, the sacrifice of martyrs, who laid down their lives for liberating people from slavery of Pakistan, will not be respected, even not upheld. //////I think it's high time that people like us start questioning whether democracy really exists in this country. Lets not go to what's happening outside because we have a lot to do in our homes. If we don't look at the mirror now to see how disgusting we have started to look, then we probably will never realize the point. //////Dhaka is facing a new problem in the form of water crisis because of continuous dry weather condition. Still the people are not paying much attention to this problem. Water is being wasted continuously in household activities and sometimes even water taps are kept open unnecessarily. But time has come to use water in the most judicious manner. Everything in our earth is limited. Water is also limited. If this dry weather continues Dhaka will soon become waterless. Nobody can survive without water. And if we do not take any step to preserve our most precious resource then Dhaka will become a desert. Everybody will have to cry for a drop of water. //////No doubt, student politics is a nuisance for us at present. It is a threat for the smooth progress of Bangladesh. Most of the educational institutions of Bangladesh are vulnerable to this epidemic. The recent decision of our PM Sheikh Hasina to jettison the responsibility of overseeing BCL has perplexed all of us. By quitting the post of the organizational head of the BCL, she has tried to eschew the liability. Actually, she should be more progressive and forward-looking in taking decisions about student politics. We know about the bright credentials of student politics and the people of Bangladesh are thankful for its contribution to the Language Movement and the Liberation War. I was proud of being a resident student of Zahurul Huq Hall of DU, as this hall produced many student leaders like ASM Abdur Rab and Tofael Ahmed. We know that bright students do not join politics any more. Some hooligans use the banner of student politics, that is a win-win situation for both these so-called student leaders and the political parties. Political leaders use these student activists for their personal gains. I am not against student politics. But student politics must be for the students, by the students and of the students. The existing student politics is hindering the normal functioning of the educational institutions. The general students are the victims of this social malady. So, I urge our Honourable PM to rethink about student politics. Please ban student politics by promulgating new laws for the greater benefit of the nation. You know what BCL activists are doing across the country. Are they enhancing the party image? Do they have any contribution to your landslide victory? Will they ensure your next triumph? Do you think that they are really students? They may be, but they are diseased and perverted. //////I am not sure what is playing in the minds of the opposition leaders regarding the cantonment house. The role of the party is more like an adventure of "Bhumi Dosshu". Why they are eager to hit up the street when two other most legitimate and civilized options are opened for the leader to choose from-- the moral and the legal step. I doubt there is any sensible person in the BNP or its Think Tank to advise the leader to take a moral stand and leave the place to its rightful owner. We know that it is the most difficult decision for her to take. The simple reason is that the BNP is born to oppose the AL as a political power and would go to any length to undermine their services to the nation. Our political history is very clear in this respect.//////It was a stroke of genius naming the latest cyclone Bijli. Whoever named it so, deserves a medal because approaching the shores of Bangladesh it fizzled out, bringing cooling breezes to the despairing citizens vigorously waving hand fans and much-needed rain for the parched fields. BIJLI was even a boon for boro because now REB's anaemic bijli would not be required for a few weeks.//////For a couple of days now, people of Mirpur area, especially East Monipur and West Senpara, have been facing uninterrupted power outage. //////Congratulations for the editorial dated 18.04.09 regarding JU VC's rash remarks blaming intruders for the recent spate of violence on the JU campus. //////On 6th April we observed the birthday of Suchitra Sen. On 19th June we will observe the birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi. Both these women are extremely popular.

It is understandable why these MPs are against the ACC. //////The carnage at BDR headquarters undoubtedly was a shameful and heinous incident. The massacre caused massive losses to the country and tarnished its image. //////With much unease at heart I begin to retell how the unauthorized institutions are playing havoc with our education system and the education pursuers in the country in general, and in Chittagong city in particular.//////I have just read a DS report on the formation of three sub-committees by the government to investigate all the 'misdeeds' of the former speaker, Jamiruddin Sircar. Do we really need three sub-committees for that? The new AL-led government seems to have gone mad about forming panels, committees and sub-committees, allegedly, to investigate all the misdeeds that took place under the previous government. My personal opinion on this is that, all these investigations by the newly elected government are absolutely pointless. After wasting a lot of money and time, all these committees and probe-bodies are going to let us what we already know: the BNP-led government plundered our country like never before in our history. Unfortunately, and predictably, Khaleda Zia will deny everything and instead accuse the government of launching a smear campaign against the BNP! //////As the world is getting warmer, the pattern of rainfall is likely to change. It is believed that some of the areas of the globe will become arid owing to a decline in precipitation. On the contrary, some other zones will become wetter because of more rainfall. Simply put, the earth is likely to face erratic weather patterns --a fallout of global warming.//////The word Muslim refers a person who submits his will to the Almighty Allah, follows the commandments given in the glorious Quran, and runs on the path shown by our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). But presently the meaning of Muslim has been altered. Our Creator has certainly forbidden all the evil acts [2:60] .and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth. Our beloved Prophet (pbuh) showed the art of living through his prophetic teachings. But some criminals are committing malevolent acts, using the name of Muslims and Islam.//////Congratulations for conducting the survey, which demonstrates The Daily Star's commitment to truth and facts "without any fear or favour."//////Pahela Baishakh is a cultural expression of the Bengalis and an inseparable part of our own culture and heritage. It is the most colourful and joyous festival of the year. Thousands of people from all walks of life came out on the streets wearing our traditional dresses to celebrate the day. We welcome the New Year with "Esho hey baishakh Esho, Esho" echoing throughout the country. Pahela Baishakh has immense significance in the life of all Bengalis. But the point that is above all other things is our language. Some people are mixing Bangla with English in conversation. They can't speak properly either in Bangla or English. //////This refers to your news item Yunus briefs Hillary about Grameen healthcare plans (DS, 17th April 2009) in which Prof. Yunus discussed with Mrs. Clinton 'the proposed creation of a Grameen Medical College and teaching hospital as joint venture collaboration with a leading school of medicine of a premier US university'.//////Referring to the letter A good novel by Md.
