Well, potatoes are good as long as you prepare them in a healthy manner. Boiled and baked potatoes are good; but french fries and potato chips are two worst foods of this century. Boiled potatoes are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, especially if you eat the skin.

The situation in the Korean Peninsula is again turning into a genuine strategic predicament in the whole region. The recent crisis is centered on the sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean naval vessel, on 26 March 2010 causing the deaths of 46 sailors. The sinking of Cheonan as such did not generate much heat in the Peninsula at the initial stage, because immediately after the incident the South Korean government formed an international investigation team officially known as the Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group (JIG) consisting of experts from the US, the UK, Australia, Sweden and South Korea. It clearly shows the South Korean government has taken the appropriate step to identify the real cause behind the incident. The report of the investigators was finally published on 20 May 2010. The report reveals that a North Korean submarine's torpedo sank the Cheonan on 26 March 2010. As it states, The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine.

It was all too often a long journey into the lands of the imagination. And those lands were peopled by elves, sprites, fairies, ghosts, gnomes and spirits. And we came to know of these supernatural beings from our mothers by and large, from our fathers to a certain extent. There were all the gripping tales of good, innocent men waylaid by ghosts and demons in the shape of wild beasts even as storms lashed the woodlands on the edge of the village. Branches were ripped off the huge trees and unnatural laughter was heard as the leaves scattered in the rainstorm. The weary traveller, having lost his way in the storm, was now at the mercy of the ghostly beings now dancing all around him in eerie manner. He stumbled, he slipped; and he found, to his consternation, that his natural ability to scream out in fear had suddenly and inexplicably left him. And so it went on till dawn, when the evil spirits fled; and the exhausted traveller, by then unconscious and prostrate beside a clear village pond, was rescued by peasants on their way to the fields.////// is a poignant tale of a bygone age, of a group of people veritably vanished from Bangladesh, told by a person who, one can safely assume upon perusing his biographical note, is familiar with much of the period in Bangladesh's history that he sets as the backdrop for his modest-sized novel. ////// though, is a bit more than modest in its putative appeal to the average reader. The era that is now a much-debated period of South Asian history is that of the twilight years of the British raj, and the incipient years of what was properly then East Bengal; the dying breed in Bangladesh is the Anglo-Indian community, a misnomer if ever there was one. Yet the story revolves a male protagonist, Sudhir Sebastian Rosario, a Bengali/native Christian, a group that continues to exist, if not exactly flourish, to this day in this country. //////William Dalrymple has perhaps rightly commented that if there is anyone born to write the Bhutto family's story, it is Fatima Bhutto. ////// published by Penguin and Viking, is a sad but unputdownable.
