We met in his rooms at Balliol College in Oxford. He had invited some friends to listen to some Indian classical music. He provided the accompaniment on the tabla.

Thus in terms of energy concentration, physics was restricted to phenomena at room temperature where the energy exchange per atom was no more than one electron volt which at best modified only the secondary bonds in condensed matter. On the other hand, chemistry dealt with high temperature, where chemical changes were brought about through the changes of covalent bonds involving several electron volts per atom or molecule.//////Carbon nanotubes and asbestos fibers may seem small, but they can be a big, and deadly, deal to cells. Now researchers at Brown University in Providence, R.I. know why. Cells swallow the long fibers tip-first, the researchers report online September 18 in Nature Nanotechnology. Rounded tips on the fibers cause the cell's machinery to gear up for swallowing a sphere. Once the cell has begun engulfing the tube it's too late to stop, and the cell essentially chokes. Snipping off the rounded tips caused the tubes to lie flat on the cell surface, leading the researchers to speculate that modifying the ends of such fibers could make them safer.
