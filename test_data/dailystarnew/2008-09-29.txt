Last week a mother got severely burnt by acid thrown by the rapists of her mentally challenged daughter for filing a case against them. It is a poignant tale of oppression suffered by the vulnerable in society. The rise in acid violence amply speaks of inherent weakness in the implementation of laws by the relevant quarters and lack of awareness among the common people. //////ZHAI Zhigang joins a small yet illustrious company of individuals who have been to space. The achievement takes a somewhat bigger dimension considering that the Chinese astronaut has just taken a walk in space, the first Asian on a specifically Asian space programme to do so. The credit surely goes to China, which has through the space walk entered that most hallowed of clubs --- that of nations which have sent their men and women out into space in search of wider meanings to life and what lies beyond. At a time when the Chinese are basking in the glow of the just-concluded Olympics in Beijing and yet are quite battered by the milk scandal that has had global ramifications, this space success will be balm to a bruised ego.//////FOLLOWING the end of the Cold War in the late eighties, the rules guiding international relations changed. There are, however, doubts that they changed for good. The events unfolding in the caucuses during the last few weeks, it is reckoned, should have dispelled those doubts. In late August, President Bush demanded that Russia's leaders reject their parliament's appeal to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and awaited a positive reply. //////GOVERNANCE is the easy part of being in power. You govern through systems. Institutions protect systems. Institutions grind their way forward on hierarchy, oiled by memory or precedence. When there is need for innovation, change is sifted through a time-consuming committee. The end product may not be brilliant, but it comes with minimal-risk insurance: it will not do damage, and might even do some good.//////WILL someone please put Sarah Palin out of her agony? Is it too much to ask that she come to realise that she wants, in that wonderful phrase in American politics, "to spend more time with her family?"

Lack of clean water impoverishes people and hinders opportunities while better access to water can be an important tool for alleviating poverty. Quality of life is affected not only by physical access to water, but also by the degree of influence people have on decisions about water allocation. Right to water is crucial and contested across the globe. Urbanization, industrialization, environmental degradation, agricultural intensification, rising per capita water use, increasing population, and other social, political, and economic transformations contribute to growing scarcity and demand for better management of water resources. Access to water is essential for improving the lives of poor people. In many parts of the world, growing competition for scarce supplies of freshwater threatens livelihoods and hopes for the future. Inadequate institutions for water governance contribute to social inequity, economic inefficiency, and environmental degradation. //////We are facing the great problem of pollution because of large scale industrialisation and gross negligence of our environmental needs. Pollution is the cause of ailments and death. //////The editorial on the subject on September 18 in a daily hit the nail on the head, fair and square. How long will this government allow public funds to be managed by inexperienced officials toying with Bangladesh Biman?//////In this era of globalisation, a country like Bangladesh just cannot sit back and think of thriving on its own resources. In order to thrive economically we must go out and try to find out alternative sources of wealth. Russia, the United States, Canada and other northern countries are trying to assert jurisdiction over the Arctic, whose oil, gas and minerals until recently were considered too difficult to recover. //////I was reading Mr. Rashid's prescriptions for India to become another global power with some amusement. The question is who needs it and why would Indians even bother to become a global power? Are there any additional benefits that India might have with that status? I have doubts. Have not we seen enough of global powers? Selfish hegemonic activities towards weaker nations? Why shouldn't Indians work towards becoming a truly strong nation with world class education, commerce, culture and a strong defence? No need for India to apply for the 6th permanent seat at the Security Council! It does not need to be rewarded or recognized for its achievement. It should rather project its soft power to change the world for the better!//////Does it bode well for democracy that the BNP's first move after the release of their party leader was to swear unending fealty and declare her their leader for life? She most graciously declined the honour of course, after all there is Sonia Gandhi's example to be followed, or perhaps she too thought it was a little too much. //////It is heartening to see that our women are proving their mettle in almost all professions. This is an absolute requirement for the progress of our country. Women are working as the members of the armed forces also. //////Some of our national cricketers have shot the arrow at the back of our cricket by taking the surprise decision of retiring from the game only to take part in the money-based ICL cricket in India! //////This has reference to the exhaustive article by Mr. Badrul Ahsan on the subject stated above published on 10 September,2008. I agree with the views of Mr. Ahsan that there are occasions when one, with all the displeasure bubbling up within the guts, has to stretch one's palms for shaking , for no other reason but to avoid embarrassment to self and also to the host and particularly to avoid dislocation in the ceremony arranged under the auspices of the state machinery. //////In my observation, Americans are sceptical about Obama's win!

Europe is critical. //////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) finally cleared their position against the rebel cricketers, as the game's governing body in the country came up with a ten-year ban on the rebels.//////Load shedding is one of the regular phenomena in our everyday life.

The CTG also has the same objective when they talk about "Policy Summit" which includes all political leaders. But the problem is the CTG has so far told us of so many dialogue frameworks and formats that there is very little or no creditability left of this CTG. What they say sounds like a new formula to extend the process of stay of the CTG and push forward the much talked about general election. They are still sticking to their idea of holding the upazila election in October as a matter of prestige, that might delay the general election under the pretext of the upazila election. //////The Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) was founded in 1963. Since then it is in charge of water supply in the city. Wasa, a semi-autonomous corporation, introduced the water supply and drainage systems in the city. We can find Wasa working hard to supply water to the people & to maintain regular water supply it has taken up lots of projects. Consumers regularly pay Wasa bills, though they are not getting water on a regular basis. In summer, the water crisis becomes acute. But I am not writing this letter to highlight this particular problem. //////I've been following and monitoring the activities of Hizbut Tahrir (HT) for the best part of 18 years of my life now. It is well known that HT is a non violent intellectual political entity. In fact many so called jihadi movements are highly critical of their non-violent methodology for change around the globe. They are very clear about their stance on taking up arms for political change - it is not their way of doing things, they rely only on their ideas, they do not have a military wing, that is also very well known. Their work is Islamic politics. In fact ever since their inception in 1953, they've lost many of their members in the hands of brutal rulers around the Muslim world from Libya to Iraq, Uzbekistan to Syria, but they remained very consistent - they did not take up arms against them. This is well documented by various well established sources around the world.//////As a practising lawyer, I draw the attention of the Ministry of Law to the fact that people relevant to the practice of law, either Judges or lawyers, should take note not to abuse the legal system in allowing adjournments of cases on account of lawyers being tied up in other courts or even lawyers falling ill.
