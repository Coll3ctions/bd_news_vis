The assassination of Benazir Bhutto is shocking enough with ramifications not only for Pakistan but also for the region as a whole. But now the Pakistan government comes up with the questionable theory that the former prime minister died not from any gunshot wounds or bomb explosion but from hitting her head on the levers of the sunroof on her vehicle. A successful assassination has taken place, with three shots being fired at her before her assailant blew himself up. For the Islamabad authorities now to inform people that a hit on her head as she ducked killed her is not only bizarre but looks like a clear attempt to evade responsibility over their failure to ensure security for the PPP leader. What about all the eye-witness accounts, report by attending doctors, etc.//////One must congratulate all those connected with the project, the Bangladeshi sponsor as well as the Upa Zillah Parishad for developing the island as a tourism and entertainment spot.

The inequity one sees, particularly in the least developed countries like Bangladesh, in people battered by poverty created by both man and nature, lends credence to some scholars' economistic (capitalism versus socialism) theory of democratic development whereby "the developmental principle of democracy is vitiated by the extractive principle of capitalism." //////Once again it has been proved, if any proof was needed, that democracy has struck deep roots in India. The election in Gujarat was free and fair.

Only the grading system has been introduced and every year a large number of students pass their SSC and HSC examinations acquiring Golden GPA-5.

And majority of Bangla-medium students can't even speak English fluently, despite their knowledge of grammar and the introduction of FM method, communicative English and such other processes. In addition to this, The English books of primary level truly lack in quality and standard.

Dr. Azizul Huq retired as Deputy Director of Sir Salimullah Medical Hospital in 1999. He applied for his pension the same year. He died in 2002.

Five more years passed, his wife somehow drew G.P. fund money and 12 months pay after undue persuasion as well as paying enough bribe. She and her unemployed son are still awaiting for the pension money long overdue. Perhaps none in the health ministry reviews the pending pension cases even once in seven years.

Being an educated and liberal-minded woman, she was most hated by these Muslim extremists and they declared a war against her even before her arrival. For them, a woman as head of government is totally unacceptable. //////Dhaka witnessed one of the biggest gathering of NRB professionals at Hotel Sheraton over the past three days.

In fact, formal organisational politics in South Asia started with the formation of the Indian Congress in 1885. The Muslims of India emerged as a separate political entity with the formation of Muslim League about a hundred years back. It is, indeed, a shame for our politicians that we failed to provide truly democratic politics to our people despite having a long political past.
