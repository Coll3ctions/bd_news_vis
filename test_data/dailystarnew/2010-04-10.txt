Deccan Chargers, however, had been let down in that regard, until T Suman stepped up against Bangalore.

Unless key institutions of democratic bodies are strengthened, democracy is sure to receive a body blow. //////NOT many Indians are happy with the prevailing system. Too many disparities have come to be entrenched and too many people have been driven to live on the margin. Corruption of the bureaucracy and the involvement of political masters are too blatant. "Crime has been politicised and politics has been criminalised" may be a clich but it aptly describes the situation.//////IMPLEMENTING public policies is always a major hurdle for any government, democratic or otherwise. Managing them after implementation is even harder for a government when the press and media enjoy complete freedom under democracy.

In this regard at least four recent moves have been facing public scrutiny. //////WHILE unveiling the plaque of the newly built 51 megawatt Fenchuganj rental power plant on April 3 last, the prime minister struck a confident note, promising people 7000 megawatt of power by the year 2013 and ensuring electricity for all by the year 2020. The ground reality is that 2020 is a distant date and people's patience at the present moment of power crisis, the prime minister realizes, is wearing thin. Even though she speaks of the possibility of getting power from India, as experts opine, the modalities would take more than a year to complete before grid connection could be given. //////AT last, the trial of 1971 war criminals has started after 38 years. Needless to say, had Bangabandhu not been assassinated these criminals would have been duly punished. It is indeed an irony of fate that a large number of living freedom fighters and their progeny are suffering from poverty while those anti-freedom criminals are having good life in the independent soil of Bangladesh. //////MOST political pundits wonder why the Awami League with such an excellent ideological coherence and familiar with real-world policymaking, often favours policies that may worsen political crisis.//////NIJHUM is an offshore island in the Bay of Bengal, located in the extreme south of Hatia island separated by Hatia channel.

For there wouldn't have been life on earth had there been no water there. Water is life. We, for that matter all creatures, have right to life, so we, they all have right to water. Why not, water is there in the environment and we are born in it; we stretch our hand or just move around and find it. This was the situation even, say, a thousand years ago. Then and upto a few centuries thereafter, people also dug their own ponds and wells further enhancing water in the environment. Potable water was accessible by any one where it was naturally available except the deserts where it is naturally scarce.//////TO make biodiversity sustainable is one thing; and to practice sustainable use of biodiversity is another.

The crimson of twilight caresses the green creating a glorious ambiance. I look around the room and see it distinctly divided into small spaces by open walls, yet there is this perception of continuity. It is an empty room, no chairs, no furniture. I sit cross-legged by the window with most view. No sound, so serene. The silent voice question me, what matters most? Layers and layers of thoughts, of dreams, of calibrated expectations, of give and takes some calculated, some uncalculated overwhelm my mind. Now and here is the time of gentle meditation, of reflections, yet I am not in unity with peace. I delve in my living, I cannot rewind life, cannot fast forward, I can simply take a pause, nowthis presentI can retrieve bits and pieces of moments, few words, few smiles, few feelings, silence and embrace these glimpses to relive. Sensing the tingling numbness I open my palm, and then the tears flow, uninhibited, as if there is no answer to the question that forms by what I see. //////Little did Onima know how her life was about to be changed forever the day she ventured out after the ////// storm in search of the luscious green mangoes. The setting was none other than Shantiniketan; and that day, by a stroke of fate, she caught the eye of Kobiguru Rabindranath Thakur. //////Music and travelling are my passions. Music rejuvenates my spirit to sail smooth against all odds in life and travelling adds to the treasure of experience that strengthens my being. I love going around places, meeting people, making new friends, learning about different cultures and faith and enjoy the wonders that the Creator has so generously blessed this earth with. One has to realise that such pleasures are 'sans' borders and that is when the universal facet comes in.//////Our day is breaking below //////AT LONG LAST !//////Hail the greying, pale sun//////Keep pussyfooting, blur the view//////of the morons, the sages and the seers//////The long night of winter //////Freezing cold and dark//////The woman standing at the crossway////// of Shere Bangla Nagar //////A supernatural existence////// in misty moonlight !//////The car stops //////While returning home//////The brave journalist enquires : //////'Are you looking for a friend ////// for the evening? //////Let's go, it's very cold outside !'//////When two souls mingle //////We spring out.//////As we grow,//////We see the endless mysteries of nature. //////The cameras of our eyes//////Keep on clicking experiences.//////The printer of our brain //////Keeps on recording feelings. //////Sweltering temperature of this summer can make you sick easily.

The Darbar hall, where the unfortunate carnage had started a year ago, has recently got back to its original use - to sit down with the Jawans for one-to-one communication and exchange of views with the highest commander. The profession of arms with its tough environment and harsh demand in many ways is also democratic where a junior person can ask for redress of grievances or clear doubts from the top most people in the chain. Darbar is the name of those periodical meetings in the BDR and army where free and fruitful discussions take place between the commander and his under-command.//////A very thought provoking and stimulating seminar was held recently at the Policy Research Institute (PRI). The topic was 'Regional cooperation in Africa: Lessons of experience and implications for South Asia.' The keynote presentation was made by Mr. KY Amoako, the founder and President of African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET) and a former vice president of the World Bank. Mr. Praful Patel, also a former vice president of the World Bank assisted Mr. Amoako in his presentation. //////Ever since the Awami League came to power India and Bangladesh are exploring ways to converge and iron out their mutual differences. The political will in New Delhi and Dhaka is clearly visible. In keeping with the present camaraderie the recent declaration by the Home Secretary GK Pillai, of India considering a 'unilateral no-firing' on the border for one year, has been a cause for much cheer for both. The issue of firing at border by the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) has been a major irritant in Indo-Bangla relations. Its resolution needs immediate attention to bolster the already growing stronger bilateral ties. ////// traces a man's return to his village in Bangladesh after an 18-year absence. Adib Khan's novel, however, is not in the tradition of expats who return with a willingness to embrace their native land after years of romanticising it. The central character, 43-year-old Iqbal Ahmed Chaudhary from Shopnoganj, simply isn't in the mood.

However, Iqbal is not too preoccupied to discover that spending nearly two decades in Australia has profoundly altered him, and he is shocked to realise that fitting in might not work out. ////// is a poignant, sometimes painful account of a middle-aged man coping with loss and struggling to identify with a nation, culture and family he is no longer familiar with.//////Rourob is the name of a Hindu hell.

This volume brings together the works of poet Shamsul Alam Khandaker, who has written these poems in a diverse format that have originated from the lands of Japan, known as haiku. For those who are not familiar with this form of Japanese poetry, a haiku verse falls in the category of a non-rhyme poem that expresses an image or feeling in the span of three lines, usually with a seasonal orientation. In the case of Nirbachito Haiku, the poet has playfully assembled all the poems in order to deal with nature and the place of human beings within it. //////
