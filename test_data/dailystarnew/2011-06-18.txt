Though the prime minister had initially ruled out the retention of CTG 'after the court verdict', lately she has been making repeated overtures to the opposition leader urging her to place her formula for CTG reform on the table. This, she felt, was necessitated by the SC verdict as well as the experience with the abuse of the system in 2007-08. //////Food is the basic necessity for life and there is nothing worse than adulterating it. Yet, many fruit orchard owners, traders and distributors are unabashedly ripening and preserving the natural produce using all kinds of unnatural chemicals.

The acrimonious debate centres around the retention or otherwise of the constitutionally incorporated neutral and non-partisan caretaker arrangement that oversees the general election. The apex court while pronouncing on the illegality of the caretaker dispensation has perhaps taken note of the political and administrative reality on ground. It is thus no wonder that while declaring the arrangement prospectively void, it has reportedly recommended the retention of the same for two more general elections.//////It's a welcome development that New Delhi has found time to hold talks with Pakistan in the midst of internal upheavals that the Manmohan Singh government faces. Foreign secretaries of the two countries are meeting later this month at Islamabad. They talked to each other during the summit at Thimpu, Bhutan, in February but apparently found little time to pursue any topic.//////Leaders of the political parties are drifting on the tides, oblivious of the thunderheads piling high on the far horizon.

I decided to write it in support of the candidacy of my friend Jos Graziano da Silva to the office of Director General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).//////In the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of our last Friday's article titled "Maturity, if not statesmanship" the words 'two years' should have read 'two terms'. The author regrets the error. //////Forests occupy approximately one-third of Earth's land area and contain about 70% of carbon present in living things. Forests are a unique economic asset. They are the lungs of our planet and they provide for untapped potential of carbon capture and storage through afforestation, reforestation, and enhanced forest conservation, which is also a major component for climate change mitigation. At the same time, forest is the provider of many other ecosystem services such as freshwater enhancement, soil conservation, biodiversity conservation etc. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) considered forests throughout the world as the basis for more than 5000 products, from aromatic oil distilled leaves to herbal medicines, fuel, food, furniture, and clothing. However, total forestlands of Bangladesh are decreasing day by day. As a signatory to CBD, it is mandatory to emphasize on conservation of every forest to enhance sustainable development including massive afforestation programme. //////Forests and human beings are closely related with each other from the very beginning of the human history. Great social value of forests and their many ecological and economic services render significant contribution towards maintaining life conditions on earth. However, forest resources are being depleted at a great pace worldwide causing increased threat for living conditions on this planet. In the face of continuing deforestation (at 5.2 million hectares worldwide per year) the theme of World Environment Day 2011 Forests: Nature at Your Service appeared rather challenged. At the juncture of global climate change and rapid deforestation in Bangladesh (the annual rate in Bangladesh is 3.3 percent which is 0.6 percent in South Asia), it is now high time to look back at the ecological, economic and cultural roles played by forests. So that appropriate measures are taken before it is too late.//////Successful post-modern Bengali writers of short stories in Bangladesh are few in number. And surely Syed Manzoorul Islam, professor of English at Dhaka University, is among those few who have embellished the genre of short story in many ways. In contemporary Bengali literature Syed Manzoorul Islam is one of the remarkable pioneers of postmodernism and is equally well-versed in writing on a number of genres, namely short story, essay, novel, literary and art criticism. However, he disagrees with the notion of himself as an author of multifarious genres. He simply considers himself to be a storyteller. The way he relates stories is similar to the way Gabriel Garca Mrquez tells his stories. Both move from one point of view to another. //////I was visiting Kolkata after ten long years. It was last December. One of my childhood friends received me at the airport. As he drove down the roads I remembered the times when I would travel with my mother from India to what was then East Pakistan. Night had fallen and I could hardly recognise the roads that took me to the area I was quite acquainted with --- Elliot Road in the Park Circus area. It was the place where I had gone to school. Yes, we, my husband I, were going to live with my friends on Elliot Road, the spot where I spent twelve formative years of my life. It was Loreto Day School which had opened up my world to the world which beckoned outside. The roads seemed more crowded and pollution had increased. But the sounds and smells were the same that I had known earlier. //////The launch of the Bengali-German poetry compilation of Bangladeshi poet Sheikh //////Treating the patient with blood and thus saving valuable lives when all other means of treatment becomes standstill is a miraculous achievement in the history of medicine. This art of treatment gives a sense of doing something for humanity. Millions of people owe their lives to people whom they never met  the heroes who donated blood voluntarily and without any reward.//////New parents always want to take best possible care of their babies. Sometimes they cannot deliver the best care simply because they do not have experience. Very often, parents ask physician about cleaning of babys ear. Is it really necessary to clean the ear? How to clean them safely or how often we should do that? These are frequently asked questions asked by new parents.//////Marijuana use has some common signs among most of its users. If your child is high on Marijuana, they might seem dizzy and have trouble walking; seem silly and giggly for no reason; have very red, bloodshot eyes; and have a hard time remembering things that just happened. When the early effects fade, over a few hours, the user can become very sleepy.//////My first impression of Sobuj was made by his helpless look, a severely ill 18-year old boy, weighing just over 20 kg. He was scared but willing to get treated. For the last two years he had been suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections, oral infections, low grade fever with productive cough, stomachache, running nose and severe diarrhoea. He was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS that was transmitted through contaminated needle.//////Olive oil can help prevent strokes in people over 65, a study published in the Journal Neurology suggests. The study found the stroke risk was 41 percent lower in those who regularly used olive oil compared with those who abstained, once other factors such as diet, exercise and weight were taken into account.//////Hundreds of thousands of babies' lives could be saved each year if pregnant women were screened for syphilis, researchers say. The research study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, showed that testing and antibiotics could more than halve the number of deaths.//////On 27th May 2011, nation received a text message from Armed Forces Division which reads as follows: On "International Day of UN Peacekeepers", May 29, we pay tribute to all peacekeepers and are proud to be number one in UN peacekeeping in the world AFD. It was indeed very good news for the nation to be the leader of Peacekeeping in the World competing with other professional Armed Forces. It is not the first time that we become a world leader; we have been the leader in 2005 too. Thanks to UN and AFD for remembering us and the sacrifice made by our friends and colleagues to bring peace throughout the globe. But this leadership in peacekeeping did not come in a day or two. Bangladesh Armed Forces had to sacrifice a lot to come to this state.//////In addition to improving cooperation on other issues, one of the goals of the Obama Administration's effort to "reset" Russian-American relations was to obtain greater help from Moscow with regard to the Iranian nuclear issue. In 2010, it appeared that this policy was highly successful. In June 2010, Russia joined with the US and most other members of the UN Security Council in imposing increased sanctions on Iran for its continued non-cooperation on the nuclear issue. And in September 2010, Russian President Medvedev announced that Moscow would not be shipping the S-300 air defense missile systems to Tehran that it had earlier agreed to do. So far in 2011, though, Moscow has been backpedaling on Iran. President Medvedev has reverted to the earlier Russian line that there is no proof that Tehran seeks to acquire nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Lavrov has made clear -- repeatedly -- that Moscow not only does not support further sanctions against Iran, but thinks that the time has come to ease them.//////Russia on Sunday protested the arrival of a US Navy cruiser equipped with a ballistic missile defence system in the Black Sea to take part in naval exercises with neighbouring Ukraine, saying it was a threat to its national security.//////Airmen with Global Strike Command recently completed the first command-wide nuclear operational readiness exercise, called Constant Vigilance, without taking a break from scheduled wing-level activities, exercises and training. "This operation energized every part of the command," said Maj. Scott Ryan, the deputy chief for the Air Force Exercise Operations branch at Global Strike Command headquarters. "It allowed our units to train like they fight."//////I was not surprised when presented with a printed copy of Amiya Sadnam Chowdury's debut English novella Wings as I had earlier had an opportunity to have a glimpse of the typed manuscript. What really surprised me was this young writer's grasp of the English language as it is not his mother tongue, nor was he brought up, as far as I know, in an ambience where this foreign language could be a part of his being. But it's not just the language of the novella that kept me almost glued to its pages. His very attractive art of storytelling pulled me along the pages of the rather slim volume of this novella.////// Borrowed is now a major motion picture that people are crowding to watch. This is a book for all people who have friends and know that the world can be a lively place when friends are around. The story is about loyalty to friends and about betrayals. Rachel and Darcy have been friends ever since their childhood. Both girls have grown up as neighbors in Indiana, USA. They have been best friends throughout their elementary and high school. And now both are in New York and are working; and the great thing is that they are still the best of friends. Rachel, the lawyer, is the quiet and steady one and Darcy, working for a private firm, is loquacious, the one who can be out partying all the time. //////Three separate long essays on the Vedas, the concept of God in Hinduism and the philosophy of the Gita comprise the book ////// (Hindu Culture).

Of course, in the days when the Soviet Union was around, Lumumba was accorded immortality through the establishment of a university after him in Moscow. On top of everything, men who have waged bitter struggles against western colonialism around the globe have been relentless in their remembrance of the man who became the Congo's founding prime minister and who, soon afterwards, was pushed to a death in the most horrible of circumstances.//////
