The study termed the NGOs a mid-level corrupt sector that lacked transparency and accountability having irregularities in their dealings. Among the more scathing accusations are: many of them bribe officials to get registered with the government; some exist only on paper; they are accountable to donors only and not to the beneficiaries; only a few NGOs receive 90 percent of the resources from donors and so on. The NGO leaders found those accusations leveled against the entire sector on the basis of the activities of only 20 organisations as "sweeping comments" and voiced their protest through Association of Development Agencies of Bangladesh (ADAB) and Federation of NGOs (FNB).//////Pakistan's military ruler General Pervez Musharraf was on Saturday voted to yet another term of office with the opposition parties, which make up 30 percent of the electoral college, resigning or abstaining from participating in the elections.

And now the military ruler also has to await a decision by the Supreme Court of the country on the results. Pending a decision on the appeals against the eligibility of the election, which may not be forthcoming before 17 October, Musharraf cannot be sure of his victory. //////THE BNP, the immediate past party in power, is already divided into rival groups for reasons convincingly advanced by a score of political analysts. This scribe also gave his considered views last week in this space. Since the Jatiya Party (JP) came about in the same way as the BNP (from the hands of another dictator) it is also inevitably in shreds for similar reasons. //////IN politics, everything is possible, if it is not based on principles. Politics, of course, is all about power. Power is a possession, and like any possession, one is determined to retain it. Power is the great treasure that you often cheated another to have, especially through a military coup. Power makes everything else possible. //////POLITICS prefers soft hands. Why have Indian politicians suddenly started playing with knuckledusters? Democracy functions best when handled gently. Even an unrepentant villain knows that it makes sense to smile and smile even when he wants to be his natural self. That is the law of democratic behaviour. It is a gentle game, even if not a gentleman's game.//////Memories of their worst home defeat ever will haunt the Bangladesh footballers when they host Tajikistan in the first leg of the 2010 World Cup pre-qualifier at the Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////Khaled Mashud promised that his side will continue its spirited effort in the National Cricket League this year, no matter what happened in a practice match before the tournament starts from October 19.//////Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik is confident the return of Inzamamul Haq and Mohammad Yousuf will spur Pakistan to victory over South Africa in the second Test that starts here on Monday.//////Batsman Robin Uthappa denied reports Sunday of a rift between veteran and junior members of India's cricket team after the chief selector made a pitch for the inclusion of more youngsters.//////The second Indo-Bangladesh Bangla Games will be held in the country in February next year.//////England shrugged off the blow of losing the toss in the third one-day international at Dambulla to restrict Sri Lanka 164.

Lots of palaces, temples, mosques and other religious monuments have sunk into the black hole of time.//////Mark Twain once said, History never repeats itself, it rhymes.

An important part of the Committee's work focuses on the examination of human rights questions, including reports of the special procedures of the newly established Human Rights Council. UN General Assembly which is in session now must address the nefarious (state-sponsored) remote terrorism, including dreams terrorism and remote electric-shocking, unleashed on their citizens and direct the member nations to stop this kind of anti-people, anti-democratic, inhuman activities forthwith. Silence on the part of this most important world body signals ill-intentions of the UN itself against human beings, irrespective of the country they live in. Those nations that specialise in remote terrorism must be adequately penalised economically, technologically and in all other possible ways.//////In the recent years some cottage ceramics industries have come up producing handcrafted, hand-painted stoneware and porcelain decorative products in Bangladesh.

There is always the ferocity of instinct submerged in the players to outsmart the opposing teams; immensity of expectations in the minds of the spectators in the fields and beyond: the whole earth, as it appears, gets enveloped into some flares of festivity. That very sense of festivity in the minds that actually triumphs over the literal wins or losses comes wrapped in, in essence, in the frames of jubilation. And in the same breath, even on a broader spectrum of beauty, world women football championship 2007 was held and hailed! //////A few districts of Northern part of Bangladesh face acute problem of employment, thus shrinking their earning for livelihood during certain period of the year i.e. Sept.-Oct. which is termed as Monga in local language. During this period there is no requirement for labour for agricultural purpose and having no other opportunity for part-time job, a large number of people are rendered unemployed. These are mostly landless farmers having no academic qualification. The total number should not exceed more than a million even by a wild guess. This number may vary with other factors like drought, flood and natural calamity. //////Every year as the holy month of Ramadan draws to a close, the sad news hits the front page of the national dailies: deaths of zakat seekers in stampede.

AKM Shamsuddin has written a very good article on hydro-geological state of art pertaining to open-pit mining in the northwestern region of Bangladesh.

I am absolutely with him to opine that the government in the interest of the country must ask Asia Energy to revise its proposal.//////1. Mr. Tajuddin Ahmed.

Mansur Ali, Mr. Nazrul Islam and Mr. Kamruzzaman.//////The Chief Adviser's UN General Assembly address has assured again the people of Bangladesh on the issue of holding a credible election by the end of 2008, which is really admirable. In his 15-minute speech, the CA depicted a pen picture of the bad state of democracy, political violence and rampant corruption in the past. According to the CA,  Democracy is not an event, it is an on going process. It is not just about casting votes and changing government; it is about social justice, accountability and empowerment of people. For a quarter of an hour, the CA focused on all possible national and international issues like election, corruption, judicial independence, duty-free access of LDC products, free labour movements, relentless campaign against international extremism and terrorism, meeting the challenge of global warming and its consequences, seeking the international community's support for Bangladesh to recover the money laundered abroad etc. //////Mr. Sabyasachi Ghosh laments that there is no suitable equivalent of Bengali pratima in English.
