He then waited for the soldiers to come for him. At around 1:00am he was placed under arrest by an elite unit of the Pakistan army and taken to the under-construction National Assembly building (today's Jatiya Sangsad bhaban) at Sher-e-Banglanagar. The commanding officer of the soldiers then called the cantonment, to report: 'Big bird in cage. Little birds have flown.' Did General Tikka Khan wish to have Sheikh Mujibur Rahman brought before him? The general's crude reply: 'I don't want to see his face.' Bangabandhu was then taken to Adamjee College in the cantonment, where he would be lodged for the next few days before being flown to West Pakistan.//////Political unrest sweeping through parts of the Arab world is set to hurt Bangladesh's labour market and remittance earnings, dealing a blow to the economy, according to economists and analysts.//////Western warplanes hit Libyan forces at a strategically important eastern town, trying to land a crippling blow on Muammar Gaddafi's tanks in a nearly week-old campaign that Nato says could last three months.//////The Chokers they remained.

In fact, the then chief justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem was the president and CMLA, and Gen Zia held the office of deputy chief martial law administrator at that time. We regret the error.//////We celebrate today the dawn of an arduous struggle we launched four decades ago even as the might of the Pakistan occupation army sought to quell the spirit of nationalism in us by the genocide it had unleashed on the preceding night. United by a common resolve to be free and sustained by the thought that ours was a struggle that would surely end in triumph, we went to war to reclaim what had always been ours. This morning, we remember with pride the powerful, eloquent leadership provided by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at a time when the forces of darkness seemed to close in on us. His dream, together with the fashioning of battlefield strategy by his competent colleagues in the Mujibnagar government -- Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M. Mansoor Ali and A.H.M. Quamruzzaman -- was to carry our movement through to victory by the end of the year. We also recall the initial revolt by Bengalis in the Pakistan army and those in the erstwhile East Pakistan Rifles, who formed the early nucleus of our armed resistance. We recall too our three million compatriots through whose supreme sacrifices over a long period of nine months we came by the right to live as free citizens of a free land.//////Pre-polls violence has become a regular phenomenon in our country. Starting from union to upazilla level elections we witness pre-poll violence of some form or the other, sometimes even leading to large scale injuries, destruction of property and deaths of political activists and non activists alike. //////It all started with fireworks on a cool February evening at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Motijheel and it ended too with fireworks at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on another pleasant March night thirty-seven days later. But while the physical distance between the two locations is a few short miles at best, the distance travelled by Bangladesh in that period, of a little more than a month, has been astronomical. //////Another World Cup, another South African exit at the knockout stage. A score of 220 seemed too little for New Zealand in yesterday's quarterfinal against the Proteas at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, especially when Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers had taken the score to 108 for the loss of two wickets with more than half the overs left. //////The buzz around the Sri Lankan capital today is as much as it was for Thursday's India-Australia clash with virtually everyone talking about the impending firecracker in Mohali.//////ICC president Sharad Pawar congratulated Bangladesh for the successful hosting of the World Cup.

During that year, Gupta visited Dhaka to participate in the National Poetry Festival. On that evening, poets Mahadev Saha, Nirmalendu Goon, Lutfor Rahman Riton, Aslam Sani and a number of writers sat together and conversed on many contemporary issues. Gupta, however, was a little silent and fortunately I sat beside him. Sometimes I talked to him about his childhood, poetry and his becoming a poet. He could be articulate.//////The last few days it has been overcast and cloudy in Boston, with the sun playing a game of hide and seek with massive patches of clouds, trying to break out of the cover of clouds, but losing the battle more often than not. Cloudy days are not my favorite ones, and during fall and winter, when days are short and nights are long, I am not eager to jump out of bed and start my daily routine if it's cloudy and dark outside. On any given morning, before I get out of bed, I make sure that the sun has made its appearance on the eastern horizon. Why? Because if the sun is not up yet, I feel very little urge to get up myself. During the winter months, when it is dark by 5 PM, and the night sometimes lasts almost 14 hours, I feel the sun gets more rest than we do. I hardly ever get more than seven hours of sleep, whereas the sun has at least twelvetherefore, I don't see why the sun can't be up in the morning before I do. Also, I need the sun to get me started. Nothing wakes me up and energizes me as much as the sight of the rising sun in the morning.//////It was the celebration of The Reading Circle's 5th anniversary and it was the month of the International Mother Language Day. What could have been more appropriate than the reading of the poet Jasimuddin's epic folk Nakshi Kanthar Math that is known to people of both East and West Bengal. The stage of the auditorium decorated with yellow Gandha and green leaves resembled the colours of Falgun. The sound of flute on record gave an image of the Bangladesh rural beauty that is prominent in "Pollikobi" Jasimuddin's poems.//////You are soft as a poem ///////Placid as a mountain stream . . .//////On a wintry night you bought ////// A stonewash shirt//////Headache is the most common clinical syndrome, frequently over-looked as clueless, unless the severity and other manifestations are grossly alarming.

Examining the boy clinically I prescribed medicine and assured the mother. Before leaving my chamber, the mother asked me humbly about any health hazard of energy saving bulbs. I told, probably there is no problem but even then I have to look for if any. I promised her that I would let her know about the fact over phone later on. However, the question of the mother stroke me and I started to browsing to search any health hazard due to energy saving bulb.//////In a study, UK researchers found that a protein-heavy, low-carb diet created certain changes in the colon that could, over time, contribute to colon cancer risk.//////Kaka Babu'r Toyhouse, a book of reminiscences on time spent by a young Muslim boy (Dinu Billah) in a Hindu household Of Prof. Ajit Guha- in 1960s' Dhaka is a remarkable piece of cultural history, a truly unique product. Not only is it an enthralling read as a splendid work of storytelling but it reconstructs for readers the mental landscape of several generations of 'Bangladeshis' Muslims and Hindus- who could well be the most liberal, humanist enlightened Bengalis of them all, this or that Bengal. //////As I was going through Salma A Shafi's ////// I was struck by a sprinkling of emotions, ranging from acute nostalgia for a Dhaka that I had grown up in, then an essentially large town which was not bad to live in, to acute cynicism about what it has essentially turned into, a crime and violence infested glitzy mega-slum, which has, for several years at a stretch, been assessed by an international rating organization to be the worst, or second worst, city to live in anywhere in the world. The capital of Bangladesh has, when judged against even the modest large cities of the planet, with all their attendant problems, simply become unlivable. But people live here, and continue to add to the city's population with each passing day, adding to the woes that have taken an iron grip over it, including that of alarming urban crime and violence.//////Assassins have regularly been part of humanity's darker side. And assassinations have throughout history been an insidious part of politics, or a mutation of it into a calling of the lowest of categories in human behaviour. For those of us who inhabit South Asia, assassinations have done a good deal to undermine our perspectives on politics and on life in general. In Bangladesh, the assassinations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his political associates at the hands of soldiers in 1975 were to leave an entire nation in a tailspin only three years after it had gained freedom from Pakistan in a bloody war of liberation. In Pakistan itself, the judicial murder of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1979 and then the killing of his daughter Benazir Bhutto in 2007 only demonstrated the degree to which assassinations could go in damaging a country. But, of course, Pakistan first went through assassination in October 1951, when its first prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan was murdered in Rawalpindi.//////
