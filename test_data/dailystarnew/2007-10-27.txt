He said this before media displaying veritable arrogance and ire when asked about the role of Jamaat-e-Islami during the nine-month Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.

It hardly needs reemphasizing that our security will be greatly impaired by the degradation of the state of our environment and of our economy because of the effect of climate change brought about by global warming.//////Our battered image has been the subject of intense discussion over the last two weeks. We have had the latest Transparency International (TI) World Corruption Perception Index Report and then the Global Survey Report entitled 'Doing Business' as prepared jointly by the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank. The publication of these reports more or less coincided with the visit to New York of our chief adviser. He was there to attend and participate in the 62nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He also used the opportunity of being in New York to address students and academics in the Columbia University.//////New Delhi and Islamabad are trying to salvage whatever is left from the recent deals they have had. India has put its nuclear deal with America on hold in the hope that the passage of time would whittle down the opposition. Pakistan has a bigger problem because President General Pervez Musharraf's deal with Benazir Bhutto to have a joint rule has gone up in smoke in the wake of terrorists' attack on the welcome throng that went to greet Benazir. He proposes to have an interim government with her nominees to lessen the dent. The blame game is, however, on, both in India and in Pakistan. But there is nothing to suggest that either the Manmohan Singh government at Delhi or the Musharraf government at Islamabad have given up their respective deals. It is not foolhardiness that makes them resurrect the battered deals. It is their long-term thinking. Both Manmohan Singh and Musharraf honestly believe that the paths they have chosen are the best for their countries.//////Charlands in Bangladesh is a unique asset. This extensive stretch of resource can play an extraordinary role in reducing poverty of a huge number landless people of the country. But till date government not being in absolute control of the charlands and most of the these being in possession of a section of land-grabbers and not properly distributed among the actual landless poor, the effective utilisation of thousands of acres of charlands in overall poverty reduction and economic growth of the country could not be achieved. Specially because hundreds of acres of land due to alluvial accretion in rivers not being included in Khas Khatian and not handed over to the actual landless through proper distribution, no expected result has been found in rural poverty alleviation. But proper and correct utilisation of charland could have set a considerably positive trend in effective alleviation of rural poverty. //////Shakib Al Ha-san slammed his maiden first-class hundred as hosts Khulna cashed in against Chittagong on the first day of the second round four-day match of the 9th National Cricket League at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman Stadium yesterday. //////Rajshahi ski-pper Khaled Mashud led from the front on the first day against Barisal in the 9th National Cricket League at the Rajshahi Divisional Stadium yesterday.//////Bangladesh will play three matches on the opening day of the Hong Kong Cricket Sixes tournament at the Kowloon Cricket Club today.//////South Africa cruised to a seven-wicket win over Pakistan to tie the one-day series 2-2 with one match remaining at the Multan Cricket Stadium last night.//////Cricketing superstars and former rivals Shane Warne, Brian Lara and Glenn McGrath will team up this weekend, hoping to fire an all-star team to victory at the Hong Kong Sixes.//////India's national selectors have deferred the appointment of a Test captain, which was scheduled to happen during the selection committee meeting in Ahmedabad on Saturday.

Six months after his final engagement with the team at the World Cup he can't even do that.//////At some point the fork in the path appears before every sportsman. Does he play to the gallery? Or does he play to his strength? In the movies and in slapstick, and occasionally in politics, the two paths might seem to merge. In the more real world of sport, the competitor must choose. It might seem an easy choice on the face of it, surely to win you must play to your strength, but the more you look around the more you realise that there are takers for either path.//////Frank Lampard described Didier Drogba as the best striker in the world on Wednesday and urged the Ivory Coast international to remain at Chelsea. //////Tokai Mirpur emerged champions in the Orient Bread Tokai Kabaddi competition, when they beat Tokai Stadium 61-44 with three creditable lonas in the final at the Kabaddi Stadium yesterday.//////Cricket Australia on Friday denied introducing special security measures to protect Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidaran from crowds Down Under, saying existing measures would catch any offenders.//////Haider Ali bowled Sonali Metro Cricket Academy to a 106-run victory over ACC Blue in a Third Division Qualifying match at the Gulshan Youth Club ground yesterday.//////Nasim Ashraf, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, has asked Shoaib Akhtar to fulfil his role as a senior player and prove his critics wrong with a forceful performance during the tour of India, which begins in the first week of November.//////A potentially low key start to Thursday's UEFA Cup group stage was enlivened in no uncertain fashion with the reports that Spurs manager Martin Jol had been removed from his post. //////Arsene Wenger knows greatness is within Arsenal's grasp but even the Gunners manager concedes this weekend's clash at Liverpool is the true test of his side's title credentials. //////AC Milan host Roma this weekend desperate to do something they haven't managed to accomplish so far this season in Serie A - and that's win at the San Siro. //////Spanish league leaders Real Madrid will be looking to extend their 100 percent home record this season with a convincing display over misfiring Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday. //////After scoring two goals which helped Real Madrid defeat Olympiakos 4-2 in the Champions League, Robinho took his chance on Thursday to explain the other episode which has kept him in the spotlight. //////Patrick Vieira is set to be out of action for the rest of this year after suffering a right calf injury in Inter Milan's Champions League win over CSKA Moscow on Tuesday. //////Sevilla coach Juande Ramos has emerged as the front-runner to take over from Martin Jol after the Dutchman was sacked by struggling English Premiership club Tottenham. //////Foreign aid dropped 31 percent in the first two months of the current fiscal year due to slow implementation of ADP (annual development programme). //////Crude oil prices spiked above $92 in Asia Friday on growing tensions in the Middle East and renewed concern about oil supplies.//////India's stock market regulator on Thursday introduced regulation to control the rising foreign institutional fund flow in the country's bourses which had led to appreciation of the national currency rupee against the US dollar and inflation.//////The Singapore government is pumping in a record sum of more than S$360 million (US$247.47 million) to train 74,000 Singaporeans for tourism jobs. //////France will push for tougher EU standards on food safety and quality to protect the bloc's agriculture industry from "unfair competition," the country's agriculture minister said in an interview published Thursday. //////Four Africa's Indian Ocean nations plan to sign a temporary trade pact with the European Union next month if eastern and southern Africa nations fail to agree on a new deal with the bloc, an official said Thursday. //////Nepal's state-owned monopoly oil company on Thursday hiked prices as much as 22 percent to meet a rising import bill in the landlocked Himalayan nation that depends on India for all supplies. //////After Microsoft Corp. executives laid out plans in July to win at Web search, online advertising, Web-based software and video games, analysts wondered if the world's largest software maker had too many balls in the air.

I never saw the man in normal attire, or ever again, except on his wedding day in that clownish uniform, which is the traditional garb of Bengali-Muslim bridegrooms. At least, I thought it clownish then, because men of that era, without benefit of role models among cinema heroes who now swagger equally in traditional or western attire, were neither able to carry off the long, cream ////// coat and tight pajamas with grace, nor balance that crown of turban and garlands without looking as if it were a basket of vegetables to sell.

A boy of six or seven stood a short distance away from the tracks, alternately terrified and fascinated, not knowing whether the red balls flaming up and raining down would reach him.

Iran's location makes it geopolitically important; its history dates back to pre-historic days; it is the second largest oil producer in the world and it has all the potentials to be a strong regional power in the near future.

Do not disgrace your parents. Have patience. These were the magical words that her mother had taught her for a very successful and happy married life!//////China will probably be the second biggest power in the world in the future", concludes the author. One could not agree more because of the pragmatism of the Chinese leadership demonstrated so far, and in this context one may offer Zbignew Brezinski's rationale that "China will not adopt a confrontational policy, due mainly to its unparalleled economic growth and the possibility of loosening the grip of the communist party over its people."//////Today Islam is in the spotlight on the world stage when presidents, prime ministers and ordinary people in non-Muslim countries are eager to know more about Islam.
