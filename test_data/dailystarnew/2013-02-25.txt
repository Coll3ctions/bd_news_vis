The greenback is currently fetching Tk. 79 per dollar, down from Tk. 81 in June last year. This is, however, reflective of the official rates, in the open market buying and selling rates are different, for all one knows. //////There is little that one can expect of a service provider if it is not given the resources in adequate quantity to perform its designated tasks. To us it seems that the highway police are merely showpiece, and exist in name only. Going by a report in the leading national daily on the travails of the highway police, not only are its assets abjectly inadequate, except for highway accidents the highway police have no authority to file cases of robbery or investigate those. And for every 166 kilo meters of highway there is only one patrol car to exercise control on the traffic. //////An eight-wicket haul by Sanjamul Islam helped BCB North Zone bundle out Walton Central Zone for 247 runs in their second innings on the third day of the five-day final of the Bangladesh Cricket League (BCL) at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.

Mahbubul Haque Hanif, joint secretary of Bangladesh AL, declared the committee.//////The mysterious withdrawal of our government's WB loan request for financing the Padma bridge project has evoked great suspicion in public mind. Hasn't a matter of great national interest been sacrificed at the altar of coterie or individual interest? 30 million people's 'dream' bridge which was within the sight of realisation now seems to have slipped out of hand and a 'fog' of uncertainty shrouds the materialisation of this huge and costly bridge project.//////It is a remarkable sight that so many of our youths are finally getting their voices heard. It is an honour to see people exercising their democratic right with the civil society at large lending support to it. However, superb the protest at Shahbagh be, it faces the question of neutrality. And for any movement, it is common that people will judge or be critical about it. The only way perhaps the protest at Shahbagh can prove its neutrality is by being synonymous with 'justice'. As one may see injustice in the form of corruption, vengeful politics and unrestrained killings have engulfed this country, sabotaging our true potential for development in the 21st century. Hence if the protests at Shahbagh are truly for change, why stop at the injustice of the trial of war criminals only? We should pay attentions to the myriad of more pressing injustices rampant in this country. I hope and pray and chant in unison with our Shahbagh protestors out there that we can all build a truly prosperous and pluralistic country.//////The second edition of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) seemed to suffer a huge setback when PCB did not release their players for the tournament. Running a T20 tournament without any Pakistani or Indian players was a brave thing to do on the part of the governing council. Still, at the end of the tournament, the quality of cricket was appreciable. The Bangladeshi players proved their skills, and players like Shamsur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed got the opportunity to showcase their talent. Shahriar Nafees got back to form, and a half-fit Shakib was enough to help the Gladiators win the title. Not only the Bangladeshi players, players like Nabi, Stirling, Zadran, and Ten Doeschate had a platform where they got to play with the international stars, the likes of Shakib, Tamim, Pollard, Gayle, Oram, Dilshan, etc. //////Trial of an interesting method to fight dengue in the Florida Keys of the USA is going to be approved soon. According to a report in this daily, the trial planned by mosquito control officials of the tourist town Key West and a British Company named Oxitec would release non-biting male mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to pass along birth defect that kill their progeny before reaching maturity. The idea is that the genetically modified mosquitoes will mate with wild Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes (because they can spread dengue fever) and their progeny will die before reproducing. //////Education is the fundamental right of a citizen. Every year, large numbers of students complete their higher secondary education. But they have to leave their dream of studying in public universities due to limited seats. Private universities have a great contribution in providing higher education to the students. But to our utter dismay, most private universities charge high tuition fees from students. As they are mostly from middle class families, they find it hard to bear. Perhaps, high tuition fees result from the commercial mentality of the private university authorities. Can't they keep educational institutions outside the remit of pre commerce? If they can do so, our country will definitely proceed ahead. I urge the authorities of private universities to lower their tuition fees for the greater benefit of students.//////Why does not the government close down all the blog sites that are publishing anti-Islam or for that matter any anti-religion comments that go beyond any civilized norms? The government banned YouTube in Bangladesh because of an anti-Islam film. It can do the same for all such blogs that have created so much confusion and anger amongst all levels of people of this country. What's the government waiting for - a Holy War?//////We commend the young generation as they could unite the people on the war crime trial issue. They have pressed for bringing war crimes charges against Jamat-e-Islami and issued ultimatum to the government to initiate legal process to ban the party by March 26, 2013. We thank the youths for putting pressure on the government. But does the Awami League-led government need pressure on these issues? It will be very happy to oblige the Shahbag protesters as they have one foot forward to take actions against Jamaat-e-Islami. So it seems that the protests have gone in favour of the government. //////It is not a battle of ideas, but a battle between life and death. It is not about democracy or fascism or Islam, it is about something much more fundamental. It is about our right to life. It is about the government protecting its civilians from criminals. //////The United States condemned a Syrian army Scud missile attack that killed dozens of people on Friday in the city of Aleppo, and invited the Syrian opposition for talks on finding a negotiated settlement to the conflict.//////Italians fed up with austerity went to the polls yesterday in elections likely to be won by the centre-left, as Europe held its breath for signs of fresh instability in the eurozone's third economy.//////Students at Oxford University will this week vote on a controversial motion to boycott Israel, after a tumultuous week that has seen hate mail, accusations of racism.//////The UN yesterday expressed deep concern over the latest deadly tribal violence in Sudan's Darfur region, which has hampered assistance for tens of thousands of people forced to flee earlier fighting.//////Regional African leaders yesterday signed a deal aimed at bringing peace and stability to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo after years of unrest.//////North Korea has awarded state medals and other honours to thousands of scientists and workers behind its recent nuclear test, state media said.//////US authorities plan to propose a $16 billion settlement to British energy giant BP for civil claims related to the disastrous 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, The Wall Street Journal said.//////The Maldivian government yesterday denied any deal to allow former president Mohamed Nasheed to end his refuge at the Indian embassy in the capital and resume election campaigning without fear of arrest.//////The noted linguistic, Professor Abdul Hye, once famously remarked that Bengali was the "French language of the East". He was referring to not only the sweetness of the language, but also the profound use of connotation, pronunciation and the subtlety of our mother tongue. An Indo-Aryan language spoken by roughly 230 million people and ranking amongst the top spoken languages in the world on the scale of four to six, Bengali has a long tradition of absorbing the best of the "foreign" influences over the centuries and inter-mingling them with the local dialects.//////Lutfor Rahman Riton is a renowned in the field of children's literature, with many popular books of stories, novels, poems and rhymes under his name.

Minister for Information and Communication Technology, Mostafa Faruque Mohammad, inaugurated the book fair releasing balloons at Munshi Meherullah Ground as the chief guest. The chief guest said, Bangla language is often being practiced in a distorted way in the name of modernism and there is no pride in practicing the language by mixing both Bangla and English. He stressed on using proper Bangla language and said, many teachers still can't speak and write Bangla language accurately, which is appalling. //////A musical soiree, featuring Tagore songs, was held recently in Tangail at the auditorium of Tangail Club. Rabindra Sangeet Sammilan Parishad's Tangail unit arranged the function.//////The final Twilight film has swept the board at Hollywood's Razzie awards, which highlight the year's worst films.//////The events unfolding in Shahbagh consume a significant portion of our attention these days -- and rightly so. Most of our thoughts naturally revolve around the political, human, legal, and, at times, inspirational dimensions of what Shahbagh represents. But what about the lessons that Shahbagh can bring to light for organisational strategy?//////I am surprised over the ease with which a public figure like Pranab Mukherjee has slipped into regal environment of President's office. In six months' time he is a different person in the midst of an array of kamarbandh (a belt-like rope around the waist) who bow whenever he passes their way. I thought he would change the office to bring it nearer to the people. But he has changed himself, to enjoy the ostentatious ness that the British viceroys had displayed when they ruled the country.//////Earlier my article had focused on a few socio-economic indicators needing consideration before deciding to finance the multibillion dollar Padma bridge from our own resources. Here I shall outline the negative impacts this investment might have on our economy as well as on the foreign financing proposals.//////Since signing the US$500 million loan agreement with Russia in financing the construction of the first nuclear power plant at Rooppur, the issue of the nuclear plant's safety has surfaced again. People have particularly become skeptical on this issue after two major nuclear accidents took place: one at Chernobyl, now in Ukraine, in 1986 and another at Fukushima in Japan in 2011.//////Surprisingly, four years have swiftly passed since the death of your band of brothers. In these 48 months your silences ringed out loud and clear in our lives. I know that in line with the laws of existence, we will hear you speak no more. We may try but won't be able to comprehend what went through your minds that fateful day and night. Did you notice the sun shining, the birds chirping either in alarm or silent and frightened away by the gunfire and explosions of the handful of cowards methodically exterminating the brave sentinels of my beloved motherland? //////
