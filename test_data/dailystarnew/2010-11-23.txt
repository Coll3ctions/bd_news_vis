In other words, an event could take place; say a journey from one location to the other, however, the journey in-between, from the point of start to the destined location would remain entirely invisible to the naked eye. Scientists believe this wondrous scientific scheme, which is being referred to as space-time cloak can be the ultimate hiding place, like a hole carved right out of space and time. And the very nature of physics, in this particular case, would manipulate light to such an extent that the actual events in real life would be cut off, just as an editor cuts off scenes from the reel of film that s/he does not want public to watch. This means that this space-time cloak theory is actually based on censoring the flow of events that we generally perceive as a stream of light particles, which are also known as photons that strike the retina of ours and allows us to see the events as they take place. //////The first study to ever explore biological activity in the deepest layer of ocean crust has found bacteria with a remarkable range of capabilities, including eating hydrocarbons and natural gas, and "fixing" or storing carbon.//////Bars of light passing across a massive tangle of cables give the sense of being surrounded by crackling electrical signals and firing neurons as you enter the American Museum of Natural History's new exhibit here.
