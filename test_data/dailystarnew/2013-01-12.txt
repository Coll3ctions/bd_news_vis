You could say it was the twilight in their lives, or in mine. And yet those meetings and all that acquaintance were to inject rich substance into the way I have thought of the world, of the poetry it contains, of the mysticism it thrives on. My friendship with Shawkat Osman was all too brief, a mere four years. It was this great and yet unassuming man of letters who took it upon himself sometime in late 1994 to call me early in the morning, to let me know how much he relished reading my articles. On the banks of the Irrawady. That was the write-up he mentioned, a piece which had appeared in the //////the newspaper I was then working for.

The book under review, with Tagore's sketch and the catchy title (Rabindranath and Today's Relevance), has drawn my attention. I could not resist my temptation to go through it to understand the message coming out of it. The book contains eight chapters related to various aspects in the Tagore persona. We practise Tagore'smessage, indeed his ethos, in different aspects of our national life within the ambience of broad Bengali literature. As Tagore touched upon all branches of literature, it is difficult to discover a full Tagore within this little ambit. The book has tried to deal with different dimensions of Tagore literature and the writer has principally tried to focus on the issue of how relevant these are in these present times ---Tagore's position on films, his thoughts on diverse social issues which he revealed at Santiniketan on different occasions. Most importantly, women's love and discussion of family life and philanthropic endeavours and ideas have been depicted here. Multifarious writings have appeared where critics, researchers and writers have explained Tagore from different angles. The author of this book studied at Santiniketan and thus has felt quite a different emotion which manifests itself in this book.//////How many times has the Romeo and Juliet story been retold? Having asked that question, I'm not certain that Eritrean writer Sulaiman Addonia had Shakespeare in mind when he wrote his evocative story of two star-crossed lovers, not in Eritrea but in Saudi Arabia. However, the publishers of ////// highlight the connection to a story that depicts the near impossibility of love in such a stultifying and repressive country. The young lovers, Naser and Fiore, have Eritrean parentage, but the obstacle they encounter as foreigners attempting to fulfill their love is not familial but religious: fundamentalism.//////For much of his journalistic career, Edgar Snow was shunned by mainstream America. The reason was simple. He had befriended the Chinese communists long before Mao and his men made their way to power in Peking and had indeed afterward continued his association with them. This was the era of the Cold War; and with Joseph McCarthy in mad pursuit of what he called communists and communist sympathisers in the United States, it was only natural that Snow would come under suspicion. The writer could not, of course, be nailed. But the hostility prevailed, all the way up to his death in February 1972. In one of the great ironies of history, the very communists Snow had eulogised over the years in works such as the one under review were now the same communists Richard Nixon was meeting in Peking. //////
