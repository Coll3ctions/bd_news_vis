The Committee, which was a collections of bureaucrats, did what such groups do best, proposed that special permission be sought before ACC could proceed against fellow bureaucrats. If the cabinet approves the proposals, which it is likely to consider on the 15th, it will be making a mistake of historic proportions. Let us explain why.//////The destructive activities of the Chhatra League go on unabated. After some very recent incidents of BCL cadres engaging in vandalism and interfering in the routine work of educational institutions, we now have news that violence resorted to by workers of the organization have forced the authorities of Rajshahi New Model Degree College to suspend admissions to first year classes. The story in this instance is similar to the ones we have come across earlier: BCL men have demanded a quota for themselves, in a clear flouting of the rules, in the matter of new admissions. As before, the rejection of such a demand aroused the wrath of these young elements, to a point where they ended up destroying desks and other property of the college. The sense of outrage we as a people feel can only be imagined. //////From start to finish of the opening day's play of the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium the question was; what's the point of fielding first on a placid surface after loading the side with spinners? //////Kevin Pietersen hogged the spotlight in the one-day series for all the wrong reasons.

It has also re-affirmed belief that Bangladesh can move forward at a faster pace despite slowdown in our export earnings (less by 14.42 percent of the export target for the first half of the current fiscal year). Economists and policy planners have also asserted their self-confidence in the manner in which expected future courses of action have been revealed. //////THE news of charges against a serving police super for attempting to grab other peoples' farmlands in Gopalgonj district makes very disturbing reading. Such an allegation appears credible when subsequently it was found that the same official runs a business in the name of his wife and is reportedly intimidating a regular trader.//////Prices in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) nearly doubled in the half year to January, bringing back uncomfortable memories of 1996. In a few months to October that year, DSE more than trebled. The bull run seemed to have ended in November 1996, when the stock market rose by only 3 percent. Then came the fall -- stock prices halved in the next three months, eventually returning to the January 1996 level by the end of 1997. That kind of sharp rise and fall in asset prices, with little changes in the fundamental economic reality, is what we call bubble. //////Democracy is indeed a process of accommodation involving a combination of division and cohesion and of conflict and consent.

However, there is a difference between mature democracies like United States, Britain or Sweden and countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, which are struggling to achieve democracy. //////Iarrived in Washington in mid-April. No one there had a clear idea of what exactly was going on. My good friend A.M.A. Muhith was still at the embassy. He took a risk and came to receive me at the airport.

The Bangladesh delegation to the grand closing of the year-long Ibsen centenary program in Oslo included Md. Quazi Manzur-i-Mowla, Kamaluddin Nilu, Professor Sonia Nishat Amin, Professor Ahsanuzzaman, Ashish Khondakar and the writer. Foreign participants' visit to the museum was an important part of the closing of the programme. On 23 May 2006, the Norwegian Queen opened the new Ibsen Museum and a comprehensive exhibit featuring Ibsens life and work. On that date exactly 100 years ago, Ibsen passed away at his home in Arbins Gate 1. For the last 11 years of his life he lived in an apartment at Arbins Gate 1, Oslo. We were told that the apartment-turned-museum has the playwright's own furniture as well as the original fixtures, dcor and colors. The visit thus took us backstage and introduced us to his private life, private belongings. The museum tells a personal story about the private life of an aging Ibsen. One gets an authentic impression of the playwright's home. The restoration of floors, walls, ceilings and surfaces was done according to on-site archeological findings supplemented by historic research.//////The sun glares overhead and our shoes squish in the occasional puddles of mud until we enter the courtyard. A sudden gust of wind precedes us, blowing the covering off her hair as she crouches over the clay stove, stirring something with a bronze spatula. Inevitably, she is wearing an unstarched cream sari which had aged just like her, gracefully. My sister and I enter the grounds noiselessly, creep up behind her as she concentrates on the quality of her //////, red spinach, and erupt with a sudden yell.

The slogan of World Kidney Day this year was Protect your kidneys, control Diabetes. World Kidney Days aims to raise awareness about the heavy burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on human lives. //////Human migration, one of the key impacts of climate change has already been well documented. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) revealed in its first assessment report in 1990 (IPCC AR1) that 150 million people will migrate due to adverse impact of climate change by the year 2050.//////Colorectal cancer stands in the top five cancers in Bangladesh and kills many people every year. Cancers arising from the colon, rectum, appendix and anus are called colorectal cancers. Most colorectal cancers develop from pre-existing benign (non-cancerous) polyps  grape like growth inside the colon or rectum. That is why screening to detect this pre-cancerous growth and also diagnose the cancer at early stage is crucial to prevent cancer and save lives.//////A test that shows blood sugar levels over a span of several weeks is not only the best way to diagnose diabetes but also may be better at identifying who is at risk of getting diabetes than standard blood sugar tests, researchers said recently.//////People who are obese are at increased risk of becoming depressed, and people who are depressed are at increased risk of becoming obese, Dutch researchers have found.//////Indigestion may be the upshot of overeating or gobbling up too much food that "disagrees" with you.//////If you get a nosebleed, do not panic.

During her last term, she had undertaken an official visit to China within two months of taking office which was also her first official overseas visit. Whether this delay reflects any displeasure the Chinese have with Bangladesh can only be a subject of speculation. Nevertheless, under the BNP's last term of office and in the one year and a little more of the AL tenure, the Chinese have not seen much from the Bangladesh side to warm their hearts or to reflect their strategic value to Bangladesh.//////In spite of media hype and outside pressures, the recent Indo-Pak dialogue has once again been inconclusive. In fact, it ended without even a commitment for a future meeting. Only promises to stay in-touch have been made. The main thrust has been on a blame-game usually prompted by the respective security establishments, amply demonstrating the huge trust deficit. All meetings end only with photo ops and the real issues remain unresolved. During the last decade these two countries came close to sorting out issues like the Siachin Glacier and Sir Creek but the general mistrust did not allow for clinching these.//////Thailand's government is prepared to confront mass protests as the Supreme Court on 26th found fugitive ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra guilty of abusing his authority to benefit his family telecom company Shin Corp and seized a $1.5 billion chunk of his fortune.//////Pilots and aircrews from the US and Pakistan air forces participated in a joint aerial refuelling information exchange as part of an on-going effort to enhance cooperation and develop the air refuelling capabilities of both nations in early March at Pakistan air force base Chaklala.//////THE period between the beginning of December and the end of March, these four months, symbolize for the Bangalee ethos several aspects --- joy, loss, pride, dedication, patience and courage. These few weeks encapsulate many historical events that are sign posts, that are inter-related and fuse together to create for us the very foundation of our nation.//////Oratory has since the beginning of civilised existence kept people in thrall. Shakespeare provided a clue to the riveting nature of speeches in his plays. You think here of Brutus and Mark Antony in Julius Caesar, of the many ways in which they played with words to convince the audience of the justness of the causes they held dear. But that was literature. In life lived from day to day, through the vagaries of politics, oratory has often been raised to the level of art. In Bangladesh's case, the speeches of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were ammunition, over the years, in the defence of liberty. Gandhi was not a rousing speaker, but the calm religiosity he brought into his words drove the point home. And then there was Syed Badrudduja, whose command of Bengali, Urdu and English was demonstrated to huge effect in his speeches, particularly in pre-partition India.////// is a survival story by Canadian writer Yaan Martel. Ironically, it is perhaps, if not more, a survival story for the writer himself!//////How does a writer affect his society by writing? What should an ideal writer write about? More importantly, where does a writer's words come from? These are the questions asked and discussed by J M Coetzee, from both ends of the spectrum, in Elizabeth Costello. The novel insightfully explores the many aspects of writing and writers, about the capability of evil in goodness and about the neutrality of the one who writes.//////
