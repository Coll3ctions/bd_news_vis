They consider that a free, fair and credible election would be impossible before next month. They have also indicated that a fresh date would be arrived at after consultation with all the political parties.

It amazes us how much we know about villages where more than 100 million Bangladeshis live. The reasons for ignorance are obvious : more than 60 per cent of our villages are not connected by road and power supply to a vast number of villages is still a dream and telecom facilities are still non-existent in many.//////The current mayhem in Kenya is not only tribal but rooted in something equally insidious: greed. The country's largest ethnic group, the Kikuyu (23% of the population), have ruled the country since independence in 1963, when Jomo Kenyatta became president. The Mau Mau revolt, which brought about the end of white rule, was Kikuyu instigated, leading many Kikuyus to conclude that they would dominate the country's politics forever. Before the country's recent election and, indeed, when the returns were beginning to be counted, all indications were that President Mwai Kibaki (seeking a second term) would be defeated by Raila Odinga, a Luo, and that the political arena would no longer be under Kikuyu control.//////Ruhul Amin, the young and bright Bangladesh Ambassador to France, is no more (Innalillahe wa inna Ilaihe rajeun/peace be upon him!)

If one goes to a district headquarters one has the feeling that we are still at the mercy of the East India Company officials. One government in Dhaka is too far, remote, and unreachable to most of the people. Only a directly elected District Council will inject a sense of belonging and accountability to the people. The immediate need is to rationalize and democratize the layers of civil administration to open the window of services to the people. They want an elected and accountable administration at the district level for the vitally important services that has been choked by hardnosed bureaucracy. If the District Chairman is like city fathers, helpless even to the mosquitoes, purpose will not be served. The District Council should have authority over the service agencies, revenue right and subservient bureaucracy. One must also expect a serious vilification campaign by the vested quarters against the elected District Council, if there is one, the way upajilla council was tarnished immediately after their first election to office. //////On 18th December, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh held its first foreign policy dialogue in collaboration with London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies. //////Nothing has changed since Annapolis.

As this very appreciable compilation of his letters demonstrates amply, there was in him, ever since he left what once was East Pakistan and took up residence in the West, a defining degree of nostalgia that often comes to men who think. And Kalam was a thinking man, steeped as he was in literature and the making of it. The problem, as he saw it and not without reason, was the big hurdle that was always there when it came to an appreciation of his literary talents back home in Bangladesh. And the hurdle was geography. As the war for Bangladesh's liberation went on in 1971, Kalam was enthused by the prospect of freedom for a country he did not quite plan on going back to. He kept in touch with Justice Abu Sayeed Chowdhury and with others he knew were directly involved in the cause. Once Bangladesh became a de jure state, Kalam travelled to the new country, met its important men, including Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and came away with the belief that the future appeared bright despite the travails that yet dotted the path.//////Love, the eternal two-faced dream, never stops mesmerizing us. Writers all over the world end up contributing to the ever-increasing definition of love at some point in their writing careers because they find almost every quality of life in love. The kingdom of love is so vast that it reigns over every other human emotion and this, needless to say, heaps on love a dual nature on top of its universality. If love is like a soothing ointment from a beautiful maiden, it is also the sword of an angry lover. If love is the reason behind the magnificent Taj Mahal, it is also the reason behind a burning Troy. If love made Lochinvar valiant, it made Romeo take his own life. In fact, at times it seems that literally everything springs from love the love of money or the love of power or the love of a person or the love of God. While you may categorize the contradictory faces of love by good and evil you can't refuse to acknowledge its mysterious duality which is like a surreal sight.////// Discontent is a richly imagined novel by John Steinbeck. Right from its first chapter, this book plunges the reader into the borderlands between opposing forces; between youth and age, exclusion and privileges. It is a blending into the classical and the familiar, the opalescent and the pure and takes off soaring high into the subsequent chapters. The story is about a New Englander named Ethan Allen Hawley who works as a clerk in a grocery store that he once owned. But fate has turned the hands and the ownership of the store has changed and is now owned by an Italian immigrant named Marullo. Ethan's family, the Hawleys, were sea captains and were respected for their place. Ethan himself had been in the army. But fate, playing its strange games, brought misfortune and the family lost everything. Ethan was left with the drudgery of minding the store. //////Madhubala, aged thirty six, died in February 1969. She had finally succumbed to the pains associated with the lifelong hole in her heart. And then there were all the other pains she went through life in the course of a career that was to etch forever her name on Indian cinema. All these decades after her death, Madhubala remains an icon. Proof of that is to be found in the excitement with which today's generation has responded to the new, all colour version of the Dilip Kumar-Madhubala starrer Mughal-e-Azam. It was the movie that raised the pair to prodigious heights of popularity. There are those who suggest that it was also a point when their real life romance was on the wane. Remember the moment when Dilip caresses Madhubala's cheek with a feather, causing visible sensual thrills in her?//////An interesting work on a man with what has long been looked upon as a sordid reputation.
