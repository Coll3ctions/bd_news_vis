Later, they recovered one foreign made pistol from their possession. //////I was watching a programme named Jole Jongole on ATN recently. The programme showed the evil activities of Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh (WTB). I was shocked to know that this organization is killing our tigers in the name of saving or preserving them. They are doing the same evil experiments again and again by injecting them the wrong tranquilizer named "TENAZOL" which is dangerous for tigers. They knew very well that the tigers could be killed because of that injection, but they still applied it on them. They also put radio collar around their neck. Two tigers died because of wearing this radio collar. It turned out that this organisation and the man Adam who runs it are doing harmful experiments with our tigers. I urge the government to do something about it. We don't want foreigners to come here and kill our tigers.//////In 1975- 4th amendment, in 1979 -5th amendment and in 1982- 7th amendment, all those amendments were the blazing indications for us that the government should not pass any sort of amendment which is not recommended by the main opposition party as well as the majority people of the country. //////It is a matter of great concern that even after paying tax, levies and tariffs on individual income, food items and other imported goods, there is no gratifying facilities even in the urban areas. It is true that a financially healthy government exchequer is essential in this regard, which can be made through proper collection of taxes, levies and tariffs. From a news report it has been known that the government's revenue generation through the collection of taxes, levies and tariffs has substantially increased in recent years, and despite the fact we don't see enough initiatives to repair the city roads. Even in dry season we see damaged and potholed roads in some areas, let alone the condition of roads during rainy season. For instance, the roads of Nikunja-2 Residential Area under Khilkhet police station are damaged severely because no repair work has been done for many days. Almost all the roads are in bad shape and causing daily sufferings to the residents. We drew the attention of the authorities to this issue many times but they turned a blind eye towards the problem. Our appeal to the government-- either stop imposing tax on us or ensure public amenities. //////If someone comes out in the morning for a walk in fresh air in the Dhaka University campus, s/he will be disheartened because of the bad odour from garbage and human fasces. There prevails no hygienic atmosphere. Vagabonds, lunatics, and street urchins are living here and there. //////Barrister Harun ur Rashid in his article entitled 'Manmohan's incredible remarks', published in The Daily Star on July 6th, 2011, failed to accept the fact that the threat of unscrupulous development of fundamentalism globally has a very negative impact in Bangladesh, that the Madrasa system and different terrorist movements in the name of religion must be checked sooner than later. //////From a daily newspaper I came to know that Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, is going to introduce an extraordinary system for the people of Kolkata as well as West Bengal. Traffic jam is grabbing the city which has increased people's sufferings. To mitigate people's sufferings, Mamata Banerjee decided to air the national anthem of India in every traffic signal point whenever the red light is on. This is really a good move. On the other hand, Bangladesh has also been facing the same problem for long. Why is our government not thinking like that? //////Majority in parliament is essential for smooth functioning of a government but absolute majority blinds the govt. absolutely. By doing away with the caretaker government (CTG) system the AL government has proved this truth again. They have scrapped the CTG with the excuse of implementing the apex court's verdict. But they did not follow the advice of the apex court which said the next two elections could be held under CTG, for the sake of peace and public interests. //////The anxieties expressed by the Indian PM Dr. Manmohan Singh are more than unusual. His suspicion may be based on intelligence report but the premises on which the prediction is deduced are not totally reliable. The arrow of suspicion thrown toward Jamaat-e- Islami is reasonably targeted. All the top leaders of Jamaat are in custody facing war crime trials. //////While watching an episode of Mina cartoon on TV the other day, I was reading some reports in various Bengali dailies including Prothom Alo about the rape of a schoolgirl of Viqarunnissa Noon School & College by Porimol Joydhor, a teacher of the same school. The subject matter of Mina cartoon was that we must give school education to female children right in their childhood. But the rape of a student of the most reputed school in Bangladesh by a tainted person in disguise of a teacher is a satire to the Mina cartoon. As a conscious citizen, I demand exemplary punishment of the rapist.//////The sufferings of two female passengers in Abu Dhabi while flying Etihad Airways was well covered in Bangladesh media. I am not trying to shift blame from those who are responsible, but in the matter of stamping of documents, the airline staff has no involvement and no power. Such stamping are done by airport security staff who are non commercial government agencies (normally police), so it would be simplistic to argue that as it was the duty of the airline staff to stamp the boarding card which they had failed to do, they should take the card back and get it stamped to eliminate the queuing problem. The airline is a commercial firm and its staff tends to commercialize matters such as issuing of tickets and boarding passes but they cannot influence or carry out any security procedure. Most of these checks and stamps are anti-terrorist measures and flying through Indian airports I have felt that the number of checks and stampings (of all baggage tags and boarding passes) are most disconcerting. //////Hartal is considered as a democratic way for achieving any right putting a government in pressure, and there was considerable success in the past. Nowadays the environment is totally different; open negotiation is possible to settle an issue and because of the strong stand of media there is no reason to fear any unfair play. Every party in opposition always calls hartal. Did they ever take into account the sentiment of masses about hartal? Did any party count the losses caused by hartals? We request our leaders to go to the parliament and solve the issues through dialogue.//////Indian cities were on a state of high alert yesterday after three blasts shook the financial capital Mumbai (Bombay), killing 18 people and injuring dozens.//////British lawmakers yesterday formally summoned Rupert Murdoch and his son James after they refused to testify next week, while News International boss Rebekah Brooks has agreed to appear, a statement said.//////The unanimity of opinion between Britain's governing coalition and the Labour opposition on the urgent requirement of probing the activities of Rupert Murdoch's News International illustrates the ruffled sensitivities that unprincipled journalism can cause. //////Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has a "suicidal plan" to blow up the capital Tripoli if it is taken by rebels, the Kremlin's special envoy to Libya told a Russian newspaper yesterday.//////Separatist Kurdish rebels killed 13 Turkish soldiers and wounded seven others yesterday in a rare dayside ambush in southeastern Turkey, the deadliest attack on troops in more than three years.//////A widespread drought in East Africa has left millions of facing starvation, but experts argue that while dry spells are cyclical the humanitarian catastrophes they are causing are avoidable.//////Pakistan ordered hundreds of extra paramilitary policemen onto the streets of the country's biggest city yesterday after a fresh night of political and ethnic violence killed 15 people.//////India will remain a soft target for militant attacks until it enforces a radical shift in counter-terror policy that prioritises effective intelligence-gathering, analysts said yesterday.//////The first half of this year was the deadliest six months for civilians in Afghanistan since the decade-old war began, the country's UN mission said yesterday.//////North Korea poses a "very real" threat to peace and is likely to mount fresh attacks on South Korea unless a strong deterrent is in place, the top US military officer said yesterday.//////Talks between the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan will take place as planned at the end of July despite the triple blasts in Mumbai, the Indian foreign ministry said yesterday. //////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday said the perpetrators of Wednesday's blasts in Mumbai must be pursued relentlessly to bring them to justice soon and promised his government will do everything in its power to prevent such attacks in future.//////Israeli jets bombed three sites in Gaza overnight after rockets were fired from the coastal strip, Palestinian officials and the Israeli military said yesterday.//////Media titan Rupert Murdoch overruled his son and likely heir in the decision to back out of the BSkyB deal as a family drama unfolded behind the scenes, the New York Times reported yesterday.//////New satellite images support eyewitness accounts that mass graves were dug in the capital of Sudan's South Kordofan state to bury 100 or more people killed last month, US monitors said yesterday.//////Attacks on the world's seas are soaring as armed and dangerous pirates become increasingly emboldened, seizing more ships than before and taking even bigger risks, an international body said yesterday.//////The General Assembly admitted South Sudan yesterday as the 193rd member of the United Nations, sealing the new African country's independence after decades of conflict.//////Fighting bulls wounded three thrill-seekers in the final bull-run of Spain's San Fermin festival yesterday, bringing the overall tally to more than 40 injured.//////Seven kidnapped Estonians were freed in Lebanon yesterday, almost four months since being abducted by armed men as they entered the country on a bicycle tour from neighbouring Syria.//////On his 69th birth anniversary, late theatre icon Abdullah Al Mamun was remembered by his troupe Theatre with a three-day celebration programme held at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.

A teacher by profession, the only formal training in art that Nasreen has had was a diploma from an art school in Delhi in 1974. Nasreen is the former chairperson of the Department of Philosophy at Tejgaon College, and she currently teaches at Darul Ihsan University. It is evident from her works that much of her interest leans towards oil painting.//////Bhawaiya songs form an inextricable part of the cultural heritage of the people of Rangpur division who have a deep link with this genre of folk songs composed with heart rending tunes in their dialect.//////Humayun Faridee is busier than ever before both as actor and director.

Organised by Green World, the three-day exhibition was inaugurated on July 13. The photos on display are images of the sculpture festival at Cox's Bazar which featured sand sculptures of the heroes of the Liberation War.//////This civilization needs major repairs because it has been showing cracks in critical places. A lewd schoolteacher forced himself on his student and then used his mobile phone to take her pictures. He raped her again a few days later, warning her not to tell anyone because the smutty images were still in his possession. Didn't I say something is wrong with this civilization? A man of learning was disposed to behave like the monster of the monsters. //////Drunk in the heady wine of success, blindfolded to absolute power corrupting absolutely, Rupert Murdoch's media empire is at last getting its comeuppance. Not that its methods passed off as white lilies in the past, but the present avalanche of revelations is sending shock waves down the media landscape.//////The Greek parliament had passed two austerity measures to clear the way for its saviors -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the IMF -- to roll out a bailout package that will prevent a default, at least for now. //////Take one of the most unplanned urban centres in the world, wedge it between four flood-prone rivers in the most densely packed nation in Asia, then squeeze it between the Himalaya mountain range and a body of water that not only generates violent cyclones and the occasional tsunami, but also creeps further inland every year, washing away farmland, tainting drinking water, submerging fertile deltas, and displacing villagers as it approaches -- and there you have it: Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and one of the world's largest mega cities.//////Bangladesh is a rich country. Even if not monetarily, the nation is rich in its soil. We as a nation are fortunate to have soil that facilitates the production of such a wide variety of agricultural products. With agriculture being the most promising asset of Bangladesh as well as considering the ever-increasing price of food, one would expect the farmers of Bangladesh to be anything but poor. //////Acer, one of the largest technology companies in the world, at a hotel in the capital officially launched its Iconia Series in the Bangladeshi market. //////Rapture, a 3-member team from Bangladesh's American International University of Bangladesh, won the Microsoft Imagine Cup People's Choice Award in New York on July 13.//////Hewlett-Packard's decision to enlist funnyman Russell Brand to promote its new TouchPad tablet in a series of online videos seems to have been the right one.
