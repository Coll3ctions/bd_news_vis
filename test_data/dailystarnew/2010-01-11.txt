The last time perhaps after 1986, that the two countries met to discuss the matter, was when the two were facing a standoff in the Bay of Bengal in 2008. //////A fire which destroyed thirty shanties in South Begunbari of Tejgaon and another which left sixteen shops burnt down in Mirpur on Friday raise the old question of how safe city slums as well as tin-shed business establishments are from such frequent disastrous occurrences. In fact, on a bigger scale, incidents of factories and similar establishments catching fire in recent years have consistently been a matter of concern for all of us. There is a certain frequency to these fires which, of course, are not linked to one another. But consider this: every time a fire burns down shanties (and this happens all too frequently), there are all the legitimate questions which come up about why it happens.//////EVERY time there is a political change in the country, meaning a change of guard in the government, there are talks of belt tightening to save available resources to be later invested in nation-state building. The idea is indeed praiseworthy and evocative of a noble prospect. Who knows, it may one day provide a lifeline to the nation during the worst times. So, for any newly established dispensation, austerity has become almost a buzzword, even if it is inconsequential on the ground. So, that is what we saw soon after the present government came to power last year. But talks aside little was done on the ground to minimise waste and conserve whatever little resources we have.//////THE third US President Thomas Jefferson famously said that he would prefer newspapers without government to a government without newspapers. Our ministers should ponder these words as they bash the media for disseminating news to help people to form opinions.//////Much of the talk since the start of the Idea Cup has surrounded the high price of tickets and the consequent low turnout in the matches.

The biggest five polluters namely, the United States, China, India, Brazil & South Africa apart, the rest of the world vented total frustration on the outcome. President Obama, himself on the sideline, gestured his ire, yet he appraised the outcome as a good beginning. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been able to successfully project and showcase the catastrophic effect of climate change on non-player countries with no fault of theirs. //////The education minister, Nurul Islam Nahid, has kept his word in fulfilling his government's commitment --distributing textbooks among most of the madrasa and school students on the opening day of the new academic year. We think and, strongly, believe that if the government is serious and sincere, it can succeed under difficult and even hostile circumstances.//////Bangladesh is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. There are five hundred tourist spots in this small country, most of which are natural. But it is a matter of great regret that we still lag behind in the field of tourism. We are still indifferent and careless in preserving those beautiful places. Another surprising matter is that hundreds of spots are still unknown to the people of Bangladesh. Hence, how can we attract the tourists from abroad to these unknown spots? However, the topmost tourist spots of Bangladesh, which the whole world knows, are the Sundarbans and the sea-beach of Cox's Bazar. Besides, another prospective spot is Saint Martin's, the coral island. But only for lack of care the biodiversity of this island is being ruined. In the meantime, approximately 200 species of birds, many marine creatures, fishes and different types of snails and oysters have been lost. Due to the polythene and human waste, the coral stones, which are the amulet of this island, are dying gradually. Inani, Kuakata, Parki, Patenga, Sonaichari of Sitakunda are being neglected year after year. //////We know that in our country some political groups incessantly engage in blatant anti-Indian propaganda. We must be aware of the fact that Anti-Indian political sentiment can easily be translated into Pro-Pakistan political sentiment. Interestingly, the terms Anti-Indian and Pro-Pakistan often prove to be synonymous and we must try to investigate whether these political parties are actually Anti-Indian or Pro-Pakistan. //////Breaking the serene atmosphere of mosques with grating ring tones is a common occurrence these days. It is an obvious lack of respect towards fellow devotees who find it very difficult to concentrate. It is very common to hear at least one ring tone during the course of prayers and they are not only loud but also very cacophonic. //////The educational arrangement in Bangladesh is three-tiered as well as very subsidized. Existing government projects in Bangladesh have obligatory primary schooling for all, free of charge education for girls up to grade 10, stipends for female students, a countrywide incorporated education system along with a food-for-education literacy movement. A big segment of the country's national budget is reserved to facilitate these programmes into act and to encourage education and make it more available. Current years have seen these hard works pay off and the Bangladesh education structure strides in front of what it were only a few years ago.//////Today we are facing a serious threat to ourselves for not being law-abiding. It is a most common and most noticeable matter that we do not follow traffic rules and car parking codes, that is why we are not able to exempt ourselves from unendurable traffic congestion which has now become a big challenge for city dwellers, especially in Dhaka. //////Media in Dhaka report that Begum Khaleda Zia has threatened to launch a country-wide agitation programme if this govt signs any anti-state agreement with a neighbouring country. She has hinted at, among others, transit to India, Tipaimukh barrage, water sharing deals etc. We object to her early warning because she is not participating in any process of drafting of agenda that would be carried by the prime minister during her visit to India. We feel she is also not sincere in her talks and thoughts. Had she been sincere, she should have joined parliament just a few days before the state visit of the prime minister and could have raised clauses that she wanted to include or delete from the agreements expected to be signed during the visit. We have a lot of disputed issues with this big neighbour which need to be resolved through mutual agreements for our bigger interest than the interest of neighbours who are already enjoying more benefits than us.//////The arms trade is a major cause of human rights abuses. Some governments spend more on military expenditure than on social development, communications infrastructure and health combined. While every nation has the right and the need to ensure its security, in these changing times, arms requirements and procurement processes should also undergo change. //////The government must start import of green environment friendly cars as soon as possible in order to save our fast deteriorating land from global warming and pollution. The government should also vastly reduce taxes on such cars and make them affordable to everyone. //////The report of deployment of Indian special security forces in the High Commission premises has been made an issue by BNP leaders without ascertaining whether this is allowed under the Geneva Conventions. They have two ex-foreign secretaries in the party as advisors. Therefore, they could find out the real position in this regard. But, instead, they raised the bogey of our sovereignty being threatened and so on! //////A few years back, the people of Bangladesh sighed a relief watching the trial of Bangla bhai like militants. They committed atrocities across the country for a long time, and at long last their death sentence brought a message of peace to all. //////Like the old eagle that had been chained so long to a stake in the ground that he'd worn a rut in the ground from walking round and round. When his master finally decided to liberate and set him free, he took the metal ring off and tossed the eagle up into the air. But it just flip-flopped right back down to the ground, walked back over to the old rut and started walking around the rut again! -- No chain. No bird band. Just the old habit!//////This news item was published in almost all daily newspapers on the last day of the last year. But the reality which we will see is that it will remain only news, and not a reality! After all there are "many a slips between the cup and the lips". In this case, India holding the cup, there will be many slips with nothing to be sipped by us! From MoU to MoT (moment of truth), there is a long way. It is more like travelling from here to eternity!//////Fazle Hasan Abed is to be knighted for alleviating poverty at home and abroad. He is to be knighted as the second Bangladeshi. We have a negative image all over the globe and that's why we can't brand our country. Nevertheless, our achievements are remarkable. These achievements will assist us to make Bangladesh a brand which would be a blessing to our country. Our government needs to take a lesson from those people to enhance our goodwill all over the world.//////Women are a major part of our total population. They are working in various sectors and contributing a lot to the development of the country. Nearly 90% of garment workers are women who are doing the jobs of spinning, knitting etc with skill and devotion. In educational institutions, women have been contributing a lot.//////My sincere thanks to The Daily Star and its editorial board for publishing an editorial on January 3, 2010 entitled Begum Zia must not prejudge Delhi outcome.
