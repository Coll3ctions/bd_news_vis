According to researchers, whirlpools aren't unusual after waves of this size.//////Very recently scientists, with the aid of Lawrence Livermore's NanoSIMS-LLNL (nanometer-scale secondary-ion mass spectrometer) found tiny grains of dust of from a meteorite which are proving to be the earliest specimens of the primordial solar system, referring to a time before the Earth was born. It must be mentioned here that LLNL is an instrument that can analyze samples with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. And LLNL scientists in conjunction with NASA Johnson Space Center, University of California, Berkeley and the University of Chicago, have found particles called calcium-aluminium rich inclusions or CAI inside meteoroids which scientists believe is 4.6 billion-year old and acted as tiny travel diaries, tracing their journey through the early solar nebula. The discovery, of which details have been published in the March 4 issue of the journal Science, was led by Dr. Justin Simon, an astro-materials specialist with NASA's Johnson Space Center in Huston. And Dr. Simon chose a pea-size CAI from the Allende meteorite (that crash-landed in Mexico in 1969), the largest carbonaceous ever found on Earth. According to LLNL scientist, Ian Hutcheon, Allende is this very unusual meteorite with all these wonderful inclusions (CAIs). The isotopic measurements indicate that this CAI was transported among several different nebular oxygen isotopic reservoirs, arguably as it passed through into various regions of the proto-planetary disk. //////The latest evidence of the dominant role humans play in changing Earth's climate comes not from observations of Earth's ocean, atmosphere or land surface, but from deep within its molten core.//////NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, captured this image of the star Alpha Camelopardalis, or Alpha Cam, in astronomer-speak, speeding through the sky like a motorcyclist zipping through rush-hour traffic.

A section of seabed is thrust up or driven down by violent movement of the Earth's crust. The rift displaces vast quantities of water that move as waves, able to cover enormous distances over open water, sometimes at the speed of a jet plane.//////
