After dollar remaining stable against taka for about four years (it hovered around Tk 69 a dollar), it has suddenly got stronger and is selling for above Tk 74. It has every potential to shake the economic stability. //////A handmade bomb exploded on Dhaka University campus and at least nine buses were set on fire in the capital on the eve of today's nationwide hartal enforced by the main opposition BNP, police say.//////Leaders of the ruling Awami League-led grand alliance yesterday criticised the government for failure to contain price hike of essentials, and urged it to take immediate steps to reduce the prices of rice and other food items since those have gone beyond purchasing capacity of people.//////Bangladesh will face mounting challenge of resettling and rehabilitating the people displaced by climate change, says an Asian Development Bank study.//////The attempt to purchase land by force for an army housing scheme at Rupganj in Narayanganj is a violation of people's constitutional right to life and livelihood, said rights activists and environmentalists at a press conference yesterday. //////Hundreds of angry investors took to the streets in the financial district of Motijheel once again to protest a slump in share prices yesterday.//////Hazaribagh tannery owners' responses are not at all conducive to implementing the High Court verdict that ordered their factories to be relocated, State Minister for Environment Hasan Mahmud told the House yesterday.//////In the wake of protests from religious bigots, Gazipur district administration yesterday prevented the 87th annual convention of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat slapping section-144 in and around the venue.//////The High Court yesterday directed the Chittagong Port authority to investigate the explosion that killed four workers at a ship-breaking yard in Sitakunda on January 18.//////The High Court yesterday issued a suo moto rule upon the government directing it to submit a report on whether the lower court's injunction against eviction of structures from the Buriganga river has violated a Supreme Court judgement.//////Former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar forced a probe body not to mention NSI officials' involvement in smuggling and offloading arms in the arms haul case probe report, said former home secretary Omar Faruk before a Chittagong court yesterday.//////The death of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in September 1948 pushed Pakistan squarely up against a set of new conditions. A fundamental reason behind that was that Jinnah had combined in himself the powers of governor general, president of the constituent assembly and president of the ruling Muslim League. His successor Khwaja Nazimuddin could not lay claim to such unbridled authority. Besides, there was Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, who was already making it known that power was now his to wield. As for Nazimuddin, he showed not the slightest trace of taking Pakistan to a new direction, but he did make it clear that under him Pakistan would remain firmly on the course its founder had set for it. That included the late founder's position on the language question.//////The government will soon publish a list of war criminals or collaborators, who worked against the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, said State Minister for Liberation War Affairs Capt (retd) AB Tajul Islam yesterday.//////Former Awami League lawmaker AKM Shamim Osman, who was sentenced to jail for 11 years in two graft cases, was sent to jail yesterday after he surrendered before a Narayanganj court.//////The High Court yesterday summoned the officer-in-charge (OC) of Lalpur Police Station in Natore to explain what action he had taken against Captain Shafiqul Islam and his wife for allegedly torturing a nine-year-old child.//////The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday pressed charges against Maj (retd) Sayeed Eskandar, brother of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, in a case filed for amassing wealth illegally and concealing information in his wealth statement.//////Jewel Ahsan Qamrul has flown all the way to Dhaka from Japan to be at the Amar Ekushey Boi Mela. He was very excited to be part of the carnival and also to have his first book published for the fair.//////A withdrawal of the hartal called for today by the BNP, now that the government has stepped back from its plans for an airport at Arial Beel, would have paid the party good dividends. That Begum Zia and her colleagues have refused to do away with the hartal is regrettable. Of course, there is the general feeling that all the cases registered by the authorities in connection with the recent agitation in Arial Beel must be withdrawn if conditions are to return to normal. The BNP would have done better if it had served warning on the authorities on the need to ensure security for the inhabitants of Arial Beel by a quashing of the cases filed against 21,000 people. For the party to now say that the hartal will be underway unless the cases are withdrawn and unless the crises in the areas of gas, electricity and water are resolved is really to shift the goal posts.//////The Prime Minister has echoed the concern of all by adding her own voice to it over doctors' unwillingness to serve in the rural areas. If that be the case who is going to attend to the poor in the villages and remote areas? The mindset of some of the doctors has been taken to such a ludicrous level that not to speak of shunning the villages, many of them even avoid going to remote towns and district headquarters. //////When he bashed India in the 2007 World Cup, commentators were all over the shop with his daredevil shot-making and the phrase 'dancing down the track' was synonymous with Tamim Iqbal's batting. But these days, while the bravado has stayed, the left-hander has added the full arc of shots to his game.//////Tickets for the opening ceremony of the World Cup will be sold from February 10 in ten booths of Dhaka Bank in the capital, confirmed the Bangladesh Cricket Board chief.//////Jamie Siddons feels that Bangladesh need to do something extraordinary to get out of the group stages of the World Cup.//////Bangladesh cricket captain and Think Wise Champion Shakib Al Hasan said it becomes his duty to inform the youth about the horrors of HIV and AIDs and to make others informed about the human rights the afflicted people are entitled to.//////Rahmatganj MFS and Brothers Union won their away matches of the Grameenphone Bangladesh League beating respective rivals at different venues yesterday.//////Sachin Tendulkar said that he too sledged, but only once. "I have never sledged per se merely for the sake of sledging. I did that only once as a part of team strategy. This was at the Kenya Champions Trophy. We were playing Australia." Tendulkar describes how he irked McGrath with a cheeky line. The first thing I said to him was 'Today I will hit you out of the ground.' He got really angry and started spraying the ball around. //////Australia wrapped up an emphatic 6-1 series win over a weary England with a comprehensive 57-run win in the seventh and final one-day international at the WACA Ground in Perth on Sunday.//////Siddikur Rahman completed a remarkable wire-//////Ajantha Mendis and Thisara Perera shared seven wickets as Sri Lanka posted a 26-run win over the West Indies in the third one-day international on Sunday to clinch the series 2-0.//////Salman Butt and Mohammad Aamer returned to Pakistan on Sunday and pledged to clear their names of corruption charges that earned them bans of at least five years each from an International Cricket Council (ICC) tribunal.//////Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram admitted that the lengthy bans handed out to Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamer for corruption on Saturday represented a new low for the besieged sport in the country.//////Mirpur Bangla School and College beat Scholastica in the opening match of //////Usha Krira Chakra made a positive start in the Chow-dhury Group Shaheed Smriti Hockey tournament with a 2-1 win over Bangladesh Navy at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////All the seeded players continued their winning streak in the second round of the Sony National Tennis Tournament 2011 at the National Tennis Complex in Ramna yesterday.

Like millions, I love the rickshaw - not only its convenience and cheapness but the encouragement of a means of earning a living in a way that does not pollute the environment and responds to so many needs. //////Please do not close the bourse again and again because of panic that gripped the whole capital market due to sudden slide in the prices of all shares in general. This unnecessary closure of the bourse will have a very negative impact on the stock markets both in Dhaka and Chittagong.

As we all know that this is a very usual practice in the capital market that market will have ups and downs but that does not necessarily force SEC to stop trading hoping that this will keep the slide at bay. //////The picture with which my mail appeared in these columns on Friday January 14, 2011, took me back to my school days in the 1970's learning about the invention of shoe, most probably a satire, by the world famous poet of the sub-continent. Cleaning a place with broom sticks apparently cleans that particular area or place, but it has a serious adverse impact on the environment and surroundings. I would never have learned about it, had I not have the privilege of living in Houston.//////Living outside the country we are unable to guess the actual situation of law and order in Bangladesh. Our sources of information are generally the print media and some friends who are there. From print media we have learned that the situation is worse than before while some friends say that the situation has improved. We don't know who are correct. //////Everyone brings out the fault lines between the old generation and the new. Every generation is nostalgic about the innocence and purity of its past because it cannot cope with the demands of the changing times. Concepts, like individuals, have their histories and are just as incapable of withstanding the ravages of time as are individuals. But in and through all this they retain a kind of homesickness for the scenes of their childhood. Hors d'oeuvres have always a pathetic interest for me; they remind me of one's childhood that one goes through wondering what the next course is going to be like - and during the rest of the menu one wishes one had eaten more of the hors d'oeuvres.//////M. Emad's letter published on January 23rd is a shame on our authorities. In this case the minister turned down the proposal for awarding the 'Ekushey Padak' to Mumtaj Begum; only because he never heard of her! This confirms the opinion, that without 'Tadbir' with accompanying ' the usual sweets' or 'Nazrana or crisp currency notes' nothing gets done! The 'Nazrana' has real power to crystallize even fiction into fact! No 'Nazrana'; see no good, hear no good, and do no good; that is the fact.//////Nowadays, 'Spa' is a frequently used word among the health conscious people and beauty sensitive ladies. But what does the word 'spa' means? Well, roughly it is, as I would define Jol Chikitsha Babostha (a method of treatment by water) or a health through water' system. The word 'Spa' is derived from the name of a Belgium town Spa meaning 'sprinkles or moistens'. //////Recently the government has launched 14 new buses for the use of school going children only. This initiative has been warmly greeted by the students and guardians. This bus service is cheap, safe and to some extent, reliable. It surely has a good prospect if utilised properly. //////Two years ago, I wrote a novel "After the Road Accident" where I tried to depict the suffering and struggle of a victim of road accident in our country. So far, I had strong confidence upon my novel. But today after seeing Peter Donnelly and listening to his adventurous plan, all my thoughts began to change. Peter is going to make a history. Being a wheelchair user, he has decided to cross five thousand miles to reach his motherland UK. Can you imagine it? In fact, I have read many adventurous stories but never saw any adventurous hero. I also feel proud to think that Peter is going to start his journey from my country. //////No one doubts the outcome of the referendum in southern Sudan. The voters are sure to vote for secession. Some years ago, a similar event occurred in Indonesia which had to cede a part of its territory, Eastern Timor, to become an independent state in a manner identical with the excision of Sudan's south as it also had a large Christian population. //////The government has increased the meter fare of the CNG driven auto rickshaws. But still the drivers are behaving in the same way as before. They are demanding extra fare to go anywhere or they are going on contract basis. This is very irritating. //////Opponents of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's embattled regime yesterday dismissed as insufficient an offer to include them in political reform plans and renewed their demand that he step down.//////Iran said yesterday it has reached an agreement with Afghanistan to supply it with Iranian fuel and that it has started delivering the products to the neighbour's private sector.//////If the popular revolts that have rocked Tunisia and Egypt gain momentum and spread across the Middle East, they could strike a catastrophic blow to Al-Qaeda's violent ideology, experts say.//////Wildfires destroyed homes and flooding claimed the life of a man in embattled Australia yesterday, as officials warned that last week's monster cyclone would compound economic woes.//////The top diplomats of India and Pakistan are due to meet yesterday in Bhutan in the first high-level meeting between the two rival countries since July.//////At least two people were killed and 17 others wounded in northern Tunisia on Saturday when police opened fire to quell a protest after a senior police officer slapped a woman in the face, official and media sources said.//////Fighting erupted yesterday between soldiers along Cambodia's disputed border with Thailand near an 11th century temple for a third day, shattering a shaky cease-fire.//////South Sudan is considering moving its capital to a new site, as the region gears up for expected full independence in July, the information minister said yesterday.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautiously welcomed yesterday the Muslim Brotherhood's involvement in political dialogue in Egypt, saying Washington would "wait and see" how talks develop.//////The much-delayed trial of three young Americans accused of spying against Iran opened yesterday, more than 18 months after they were arrested on the unmarked border with Iraq while on a hiking trip.//////Cape Verdeans began voting yesterday in parliamentary elections across the archipelago of sandy beaches and arid volcanic rock, which is lauded as one of Africa's success stories.//////More than 1,000 Indonesian Muslims clashed yesterday with supporters of a minority sect branded heretical by the government, leaving up to six people dead, a report said.//////The Indian navy and coastguard captured a suspected pirate "mothership" and detained more than 50 people after a firefight yesterday off southwestern India, the defence ministry said.//////Leading Egyptian opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei said he was "not invited" to take part in negotiations yesterday on the future of a post-Mubarak Egypt, and criticized the talks as "opaque."//////Ireland's main Fine Gael opposition party is on course to lead the country's new government after the February 25 general election and has increased its lead, according to an opinion poll yesterday.//////The chief Philippine government negotiator said yesterday he was "seriously concerned" after a feared rebel commander broke from the main Islamic separatist group ahead of peace talks.//////An explosion ripped through a coal mine in western Romania, killing five miners at a depth of some 400 metres (1,000 ft) below ground, authorities said late on Saturday.//////A Tel Aviv court yesterday convicted a young Israeli woman of leaking classified military documents, but dropped espionage charges as part of a plea-bargain agreement, media reports said.//////Mohammad Eunus is one of the leading painters from the '70s, when the nation was caught up in the freedom movement.

Eunus closely observed the changing socio-political and economic conditions of the country.//////Jointly organised by The Daily Star and Bangladesh Patha Natak Parishad, the nationwide street theatre festival ended in the port city last Saturday.//////The 10th World Cup Cricket is all set to kick off on February 17.

Sports channel ESPN will air the inaugural programme live from Bangabandhu Stadium, Dhaka. The first match between the two hosts Bangladesh and India will be held on February 19. //////Born on February 6, 1945, son of a white English-Jamaican father and Afro-Jamaican mother, Nesta Robert 'Bob' Marley spent his entire life facing questions about his racial identity. Growing up as a ghetto child in the heart of Kingston and because of his beliefs in Rastafarianism, Marley identified himself as a black African. His identity crisis reflected in his songs that later became anthems in the third world nations. The 1979 album Survival clearly encompasses his Afro-centric political ideologies. //////Popular Indian Sufi Pop-Rock artiste Kailash Kher is set to give voice to a song for a Bangladeshi film. Kailash will sing "Jotoi Thakish Upor Tolae Gorey Takar Pahar", to be featured in Ananya Mamun's movie "Most Welcome". The song has been written by Bangladeshi lyricist Jahid Akbar. //////The death of 14-year-old Hena of Chamta village in Shariatpur district after she was forced to suffer arbitrary punishment at the hands of self-styled adjudicators is a glaring instance of how vulnerable women still are in our society. The victim girl, who was still in her dreamy adolescent years, could not perhaps imagine in her worst nightmare how heartless and barbaric some of the elders among whom she had been growing up could become -- not at least until the fateful night when she was raped by one of her relatives in his forties. //////Nothing, goes the maxim, clears the head faster than the sight of a noose. This is true for ordinary mortals like you and me. Despots intoxicated by the hallucination of indispensability are either puzzled or terrified by the notion that power is finite. Their cronies have always told them otherwise. Their palaces have insulated them from the street. The international order did business without the whisper of a question. Why bother?//////The recent tiff between the Supreme Court (SC) of Bangladesh and Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB) is a watershed event for all professionals who conduct surveys and the organisations that use them to guide important decisions. In the business world, surveys often guide major strategic decisions. And the use of surveys for political opinion polling is ubiquitous.//////In this sub-continent, elitism in bureaucracy was introduced by the British in order to cement their hold on the colonial people. They needed a subservient, compliant group who would look after the interest of the colonial masters and collect taxes from the subjects for the benefit of the Raj. Hence came the ICS with all their perks and privileges.//////
