A new syndrome spreading its tentacles over society, polity and the economy is partisan and self-serving rule-making, often with corrupt goals in mind. Whether it is in the manipulation of operational rules for the share market or eligibility criteria for new banks or changes in electoral rules to trade bodies or rule changes on appointments, corrupt rule-making has cast a blacker shadow than simple rule-breaking. This new syndrome poses a dilemma for the watchdogs and indeed for the democracy discourse itself because we are analytically unarmed against such misgovernance. What do you do when everything is being done according to "rules" but such rules are themselves the main problem because they have been framed with motivated and corrupt goals in mind? When have "rules" become divorced from "norms"? //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday blamed the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its alliance partner Jamaat-e-Islami for mysterious killings.

The experiment was done at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland. If the Higgs boson is discovered, it will be one of the greatest triumphs of human intellect as it will explain the origin of mass after the big bang.//////It's ironic that most of the men who participated in the "scientific revolution", whose contributions seem so original and innovative, were themselves convinced that they were merely re- discovering the vast body of pristine knowledge that had been possessed by the ancients, but somehow lost and forgotten during the centuries that came to be called the "dark ages" of western civilization. This was not an entirely unreasonable belief, because the great works, both material and intellectual, of the classical civilizations were very imposing. The intellectual culture of Western Europe really did decline during the fall of Rome, and the institutions for preserving and passing along knowledge, as well as the inclination to do so, were severely diminished. Then, after so long an absence, when the ancient texts were re-discovered, the scholars of the Renaissance and later periods were acutely aware of their intellectual inferiority vis--vis "the ancients". Also, the fact that many of the ancient texts were now available only in fragmentary form, often in third- hand translations, and many of the references were to works totally unknown and presumably lost, contributed to the impression that the ancients had known far more, if we could only find it out.//////As U.S. troops are expected to be home from Iraq by Dec. 31, a new report from the Pew Research Center suggests they may have a tough time readjusting to civilian life, though religion seems to help buffer the struggle.//////An international team of astronomers has identified a candidate for the smallest-known black hole using data from NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE).

(The Moon's orbit has a radius of 384,000 km.) The reason for the increase is that the Moon raises tides on the Earth. Because the side of the Earth that faces the Moon is closer, it feels a stronger pull of gravity than the center of the Earth. Similarly, the part of the Earth facing away from the Moon feels less gravity than the center of the Earth. This effect stretches the Earth a bit, making it a little bit oblong. //////
