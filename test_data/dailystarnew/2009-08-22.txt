The democratic governments in Bangladesh since 1991 have repeatedly tried to politicise the civil service in order to achieve their narrow political interests.

The Pakistan authorities have put up 10 reliefs, projecting figures in carving on boards to show how Hindus and Sikhs had killed and looted Muslims during partition. The reliefs have been displayed in such a way that they are visible only from the Indian side. They cannot be seen from the Pakistan side because the back of the reliefs are just blank boards.//////Asecond wave of economic bad news is arriving in several places, according to people in finance. //////For an effective Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) public participation or public consultation is very important. In our country most of the people are still not fully aware of the consequences of bad environment. So their voice remains mute when any project begins in their locality. They only think that it would help them in developing the area and to create employment opportunity. This kind of unawareness makes it easy for the proponent to start a project in the area without considering the environmental issues. On the other hand if in some cases Public Participation (PP) is involved it does not fully serve the purpose because proper participants (significantly affected) are not properly identified and included, only the positive impacts are discussed and briefing on the project and environmental impacts are hard to understand.//////Today you will read this newspaper and maybe tomorrow you will throw it out.

Jasim Foundation and the local district administration jointly organize the fair. A colourful souvenir is also published subsequent to the holding of the fair highlighting the aesthetic values and power of Poet Jasimuddin's literary works.//////A hot political story currently making the headlines in Indian newspapers is the expulsion of veteran BJP leader Jaswant Singh (who had been minister for foreign affairs, finance and defence at various times when the BJP was in power) from the party for his book on Jinnah. The Rashtriya Swayamasevak Sangh (RSS), the militant Hindu fundamentalist organization and the BJP's ideological gatekeeper, is reportedly furious over Singh's assertions in the book that Jinnah has been 'demonised' in official Indian historiography as the sole architect of the Partition, and that Nehru should be held accountable for the tragedy as well. Additional anger was reserved for Singh's denigration of Sardar Patel, the political strongman of Bombay during the pre- and post independence era and a Congressman whom the RSS has appropriated into its iconic line-up. Jinnah is turning out to be the nemesis of rightwing politicians of India - BJP's 'Jinnah Jinx' they're calling it. In 2005, L K Advani faced a similar situation, when on a visit to Pakistan he let loose a hornet's nest around his head by saying that Jinnah was a great man and a secular person. Though that also had not been music to the RSS's saffron ears, Advani's remarks had not invited the kind of harsh retribution it did on Jaswant - Advani, after all, had worked hand in glove with the RSS for a long time and had led the rath jatra that down the line led to destruction of the Babri Masjid. Therefore, three days after handing in his resignation from the BJP president's post, Advani was allowed to limp back into the fold.//////As long as I don't think about it//////Then it's thumbs up, alright, okay//////With the changes in the mealtime, certain drugs dose-schedule have to be altered during Ramadan.

Kenya, where Obama's father lived and died, expected the visit of the President first. Other countries such as South Africa, Nigeria and Liberia thought that the President would visit one of those countries first, but not Ghana.//////Leadership vision is what propels nations to greatness. Across the world, Roosevelt, Churchill, Deng, Mandela and Obama are considered examples of leaders with vision. Ashoka's peace offensive, Akbar's inclusivism, Nehru's development model, the 'Indira doctrine', Rajiv's call towards the twenty-first century and VP Singh's egalitarian initiative are examples closer home. Examples from the recent past include Narasimha Rao's stewardship of liberalization and Vajpayee's reaching out to Pakistan, thrice in his tenure, rates as consistency in vision despite the gravest tests.//////Due to advancements in many technologies such as air travel, television and the Internet, the boundaries of time and space have collapsed and the world has become smaller. It is as easy, today, to place a phone call to a climber abreast Mount Everest as to zoom in on the details of one's own home via satellite images. Amidst this abundance of possibilities, lie the challenges and complexities created by the rapid rates and ranges of change in the economic, social, political and technological spheres. //////THE cover shows the editor of 'Mridubhashan', his smile displaying all the attributes awarded to him by Bengalis.
