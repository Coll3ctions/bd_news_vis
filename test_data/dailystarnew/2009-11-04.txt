Matters get worse when it is noted that the frequent troubles these 'Bangladeshis' get into in places like Saudi Arabia are causing a fairly good number of problems for our bona fide workers there. //////THE problem with capitalism being foisted on poor societies is not hard to understand: it demeans the individual.

However, much more needs to be done to reach the whole community. //////Most dailies, on 18 October headlined on the front page the report which correlated democracy as the means to ease poverty. The other part was on curtailing and eliminating graft to contain poverty. However, this reader could not correlate the relationship between democracy and poverty alleviation! The correlation seemed to be theoretically weak, and rather elusive!//////The Dhaka traffic problem continues to be menacing and is going to be worse with time. Here is something that the government may consider as a cheap alternative until an effective solution like metro, monorail, circular train is developed.//////Here are my comments on Professor Zeba Seraj's article on the recent Education Policy published in the Op-Ed page of your daily on Saturday, the 17th October. Some of the ideas enumerated there are excellent. If our past experience serves as a guide, the implementing machinery falls far short of our expectations. For instance, we know that textbooks published by the Text Book Board are below standard containing unattractive pictures and sometimes disproportionate ones which create wrong impressions among young minds. For instance, a Nature's Study book prescribed for 5th grade shows a tiny moss larger in size than a large fern plant. I brought this discrepancy to the attention of the Chairman Text Book Board but without any effect. He promised to look into the matter but could not do anything because of the environment that prevails in such an organisation. UNESCO, ISESCO can help in the printing of quality books with nice illustrations but such a noble move will be resisted tooth and nail by the interested parties who control the textbooks market. //////We thank Mr. M.Emad for this thoughtful and thought provoking letter with the above heading on 19t October. I would like to add to that subject as to the nature, interference of Pakistan army of the past and present. //////The media has taken a few remarkable steps to popularise some national demand like a. Nadi Bachao, Desh Bachao b. Swine flu public awareness and c. the Prothom Alo introduced a self correction slogan " Badle Jao, Badle Dao" ( of course this could not make any headway because the "heads' did not pay any heed to it).//////The government has recently extended the retirement age of the freedom fighters in government service by two years--a move through which a section of the employees has been given a preferential treatment over others.//////My old friend, Mr Rahat of Malibagh has once again vented his spleen against rickshaws in Dhaka and against the suggestion of Prof Rabbani of DU for a trial period of a few weeks, to garage one's cars and travel around Dhaka in rickshaws. Heavens forbid, (according to him) how could any sensible person make such a horrid suggestion in these modern times when one's ego cannot do without one's luxury cars even for the shortest of errands?//////Bangladesh changes its appearance every season and having six seasons is a rare thing. These are all gifts from the Almighty to Bangladesh. Although its size is small and the population is huge still these problems can be solved.//////You use the word 'lawmaker' for an MP (Member of Parliament), and most of the Bangla print and electronic media use the Bangla word 'Saangsad' for an MP. The use of the word 'lawmaker' for an MP is not correct because it seems many MPs do not know what it means to be a parliamentarian. This is true not only in case of Bangladesh but also about many other parliaments across the world.//////A new building has come up among the Florida State University's usual brick built campus buildings. It is an eco-friendly revolutionary building which runs on solar and hydrogen power only, and with zero carbon emission! This futuristic building has no electric connection from the local electric supply grid. It is a breakthrough solution to the climate change problems; combining traditional technology with unique solar-hydrogen experimental, heat and power source. //////The Honourable Prime Minister has recently directed all concerned to limit the tour of bureaucrats to foreign countries which, in my view, is a timely move. But the question arises when we see the bulging list of entourage of our ministers, including the prime minister, while they go abroad. I personally witnessed on several occasions the foreigners being surprised seeing luxurious foreign tours by our political leaders. //////We expect our leaders to speak in Bangla. Problem is many of them cannot speak proper Bangla; so they try to mix English to hide their shortcomings. This complicates the situation further as their English is not good either. A few days ago I heard one of them using the word "motibeshito', the self-banglafication of the word "motivation". God help Bangla, English and Bangladesh!//////I am not going into details. Through you, I request the AL govt to conduct a survey amongst school going children who make most honest remarks without any favour or fear about the government decision to go ahead with DST in this month of October. Please also include in the survey the guardians. Actually you do not need to conduct a survey. A pro-people government goes by the people's opinion. In this era, everybody knows when the sun rises and sets with the accuracy of seconds but probably not our ministers and bureaucrats. I am not elaborating. Have they got their own children to take to school and that too by bus or rickshaw just after Fazr prayers?//////We are a developing nation, Bangladesh. We are developing very slowly but inevitably, undoubtedly. In our sluggish journey as we are following and copying developed countries like all backward countries do, sometimes adopt awkward activities which were proved wrong later but couldn't be retrieved because there was no other way left. Ah, we are such an imitator, copying straightway what the leaders have done, no matter whether those are appropriate for us or not.//////In any election the Awami League itself is enough to win and it is also enough for its defeat. The AL thinks they win alone but when they are defeated, all the progressive people are also defeated. When the caretaker government was in power, AL leaders were divided into reformists and non-reformists. Some illegal money earners took shelter in the reformist camp to save their name and fame.//////World powers turned up the heat on Iran to accept a UN-brokered nuclear deal, with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying Tehran was at a "pivotal moment" to show it did not want to be isolated.//////North Korea said yesterday that it has completed reprocessing thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods to extract plutonium to bolster its atomic stockpile, raising the stakes in an apparent effort to get the US into direct negotiations.//////Police in China's far west have launched a crackdown on terrorism and stepped up a hunt for suspects who took part in deadly ethnic riots there four months ago, the regional public security ministry said yesterday.//////Two top US envoys began talks with Myanmar's ruling generals yesterday and were set to meet democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi as they made the highest level visit to the military-ruled nation in 14 years.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai vowed yesterday that his new government would eradicate corruption and offered an olive branch to Taliban insurgents, launching his programme for another five years in office.//////Nepal's army and police have been placed on high alert, a government minister said yesterday, after the opposition Maoist party announced plans to blockade the capital and shut down the main airport.//////The 10 weeks of chaos that dogged Afghanistan's tumultuous election were accompanied by a string of diplomatic blunders that ended with the scrapping of a run-off imposed on President Hamid Karzai.//////Pakistan said yesterday troops had stormed into another important Taliban stronghold, killing 16 militants and seeking to expand their control in a blistering air and ground offensive.//////A passenger train smashed into a cargo train on the outskirts of Pakistan's financial capital Karachi yesterday, killing up to 16 people including women and children, authorities said.//////The Palestinians remained pessimistic about the likelihood of relaunching peace talks with Israel despite US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's attempt to clarify earlier remarks about settlements.//////Scientists from several countries have confirmed that the volcanic processes at work beneath the Ethiopian rift are nearly identical to those at the bottom of the world's oceans, and the rift is indeed likely the beginning of a new sea.//////Fiji's military leader Voreqe Bainimarama yesterday ordered the Australian and New Zealand envoys to leave within 24 hours over alleged interference in Fiji's judiciary.//////Notwithstanding US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's clarifications that there was not sufficient evidence to prove India's involvement in terror activities inside Pakistan's territory, Pakistan Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira has said that Islamabad has found 'concrete evidence' regarding New Delhi's role in fanning insurgency in South Waziristan, where the military is engaged in an intense battle with the Taliban.//////Rising numbers of civilians are pouring out of Pakistan's war zone to flee battles between soldiers and Taliban militants but the fate of those left behind is uncertain, humanitarian workers say.//////India's Supreme Court judges have voluntarily disclosed their assets, their website showed yesterday, in a bid to promote transparency and boost confidence in the judicial system.//////Army chief Deepak Kapoor on yesterday warned that 26/11-type Mumbai terror attacks were a possibility and that India has to take all steps to counter such strikes.//////An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has dismissed all charges levelled against a woman allegedly involved in the twin suicide attacks on the convoy of former President General Pervez Musharraf in 2003.//////A wild bear mauled to death two militants of the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit in a south Kashmir forest Monday, officials said.//////November 1 marked the 34th death anniversary of renowned Bangladeshi painter Mubinul Azim.

Time is running out fast and still there are a large number of substantive issues, which must be agreed upon.
