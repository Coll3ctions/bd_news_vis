It all makes clear to us, yet once more, just how much a menace accidents have become in the country. Worse, it also shows a clear inability or unwillingness or both on the part of the authorities to make sure that the roads are kept free of reckless driving.

He demanded Tk 50/- to go to my office from my place, whereas the regular fare is Tk. 20/- . I saw a damaged car in front of my office, the driver was also hurt.

The Tailorbird is known as Tuntuni in Bangladesh which is lovely coloured singing bird. The Tuntuni was screaming perhaps out of fear! I tried to assure the bird that she's safe and secure and I was not going to hurt or catch her. I immediately put off the light so that the Tuntuni could get herself settled. It wasn't possible to drive her out in the midnight!//////Women have gone to either of the two extremes with regards to family and work.
