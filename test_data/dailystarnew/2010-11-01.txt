As a political party and especially if it is convinced that the ruling party has failed to meet the expectations of the people, the onus is on it to substantiate such a claim and try to carry the people with them. The bigger and more potent reality, though, is the question of what the BNP itself has done in these nearly two years since the last election to inform people that it has played its due role as a parliamentary opposition. There might be reasons to think that the Awami League-led government has not performed well in some sectors, indeed may have actually failed to demonstrate the competence expected of it in certain areas.

The last one and the most ridiculous is a just finished three-storied building in a jheel at Norda in the capital's Dakkhinkhan area.

Thanks to the advancement of communication system and technology.
