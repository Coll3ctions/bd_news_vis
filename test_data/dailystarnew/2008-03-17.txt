an earlier piece on the subject by Badrul Ahsan in your daily. Huda concludes the piece appropriately that Police has to be organisationally accountable, operationally autonomous and free and functionally responsive. This conclusion has almost universal acceptance in society and was supported by all leading studies including the first systematic work on police in an UNDP research on Human Security in Bangladesh in1997 in which Huda participated under my guidance. Recently, a Police Reform proposal based on last few years of intensive UNDP research work and other public opinion surveys has been finalized and was expected to be implemented.//////A few days back there were headlines on Rupali Bank news of cancellation of an expected sale deal with a Saudi Prince. The officials of this bank expressed a big sigh of relief and profusely thanked the media for their contribution reportedly in compelling the government to take that decision.

Unfortunately, enhancement of performance by the Bengal TIGERS has stopped after their impressive World Cup campaign. Under the new captain and coach, their recent performances against Sri Lanka, New Zealand and South Africa seemed very depressing to the cricket lovers of Bangladesh. All we witnessed is how our TIGERS were surrendering. This would be hard to accept if it continues this way.//////Despite massive culling by authorities to control the outbreak, the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu continues spreading among the poultry in Bangladesh. A total of 47 districts out of 64 have been affected by this avian flu virus, and more than 50 percent of the poultry farms has been closed. This virus strain is regarded to be the most likely cause of the next human flu pandemic.//////Every year International Women's Day is observed nationally and internationally. This day is significant for women's empowerment and emancipation from all discrimination. But Bangladesh is different from other countries. Women become victims of rape, murder, acid violence, dowry and many types of crimes. We can see this discrimination in all spheres and sectors of life. Every year many women commit suicide because of violence and insecurity. Though in recent years, women are getting involved in all sectors, there is no proper working environment for them. //////Both people and the government of Bangladesh are in great difficulties because of galloping prices of essentials, particularly rice. It is out of the reach of the middle and lower income people, let alone the poor ones. //////The Election Commission is going to conduct its 2nd round of meetings with the political parties. They should invite all the political parties. But EC's stand on inviting the BNP, one of the most popular political parties in Bangladesh, which formed the last political government, is not understood by us. The EC is unnecessarily wasting time on the issue of court verdict. As both the factions of this divided party consist of senior leaders including former ministers, MPs and BNP standing committee members, so what is wrong about holding two separate meetings with the two factions? The meetings are arranged for holding talks between the EC and the political parties, so that they can exchange their views about the upcoming polls. The EC and the political parties will only express their opinions and will give suggestions to make the polls more credible. So, nothing will go wrong if the two factions of the BNP headed by pro-Khaleda leader Khandakar Delwar and reformist leader Saifur Rahman are invited separately. //////Bangladesh lost a very rare opportunity to display its national art treasures in the cultural capital of the western world. The fiasco involving the exhibition of its cultural artefacts in the Musee Guimet in Paris must be treated as a well conceived plan to foil the presentation of the true historical image of Bangladesh as a very old nation of Bengalis before the international community. The eminent persons, celebrities, academics and civil society luminaries including the print media that opposed the exhibition and launched a vigorous campaign to abort the show had played unknowingly into the hands of the forces who want to depict us as a nation without any heritage. It was really very painful to watch the short-sightedness of these standard bearers of Bengali culture who argued that the artefacts would be impounded by the Musee Guimet once they get hold of them!!! It was a laughable assumption. Without being disrespectful to them, I must say that they had no idea how such exchange programmes take place these days among the civilized nations to promote the image of the country as a modern, progressive, developed and tolerant multicultural society.//////The influence of the MPs on upazila administration should be eliminated for good. People's representatives in parliament should concentrate on the parliamentary procedures and on framing appropriate laws for the nation. The tendency to become MP for the purpose of exercising power on local officials should not be allowed to continue in the years to come. Help the bureaucracy act and decide independently. //////News - March 6, 2008 (DS) --Assailants gunned down a thana unit BNP leader last night at Jigatala under Dhanmondi in the capital. //////In response to one of your valued readers, may I please apprise him of the fact that farmers, masons, blacksmiths, butchers, teachers, writers, engineers, singers, military personnel, bureaucrats, doctors ... all participated in our war for freedom. Not only 'farmers and chashis'. Each has a respective place in society and there they look good. A mason should not lead a nation, nor a 'farmer or chashi'.//////As a result of wrong & unscientific belief, a number of foods are excluded from the list of food items by people. Most of these affect pregnant women & lactating mothers & convalescent people greatly. This is a common belief, for instance, that the pregnant mother should eat less to keep the size of the baby minimum for easy delivery. This is totally misleading & dangerous. A pregnant mother should eat one-fourth amount of food more than her normal requirement. Since she needs to eat for her baby as well. Another food taboo prohibits intake of water at the time of delivery of a baby. But the truth is that during delivery a mother loses huge amount of water as sweat , along with blood & delivery fluid. To compensate for this loss, & to save the mother from dehydration, sufficient amount of liquid should be given.//////At least 80 people have been killed in unrest following protests by Tibetans

The immigrant's story, in its basic form, fulfills both of these archetypes. An individual or a family leaves a familiar world, by either choice, necessity or some perceived combination of the two, and arrives in a place that is as strange to the newcomers as they are to it.//////Local troupe, Khagrachhari Theatre, recently staged their production ////// at the Apar Perachhara village under Sadar Upazila.

If you are in a country where people drive in a careful, orderly way, like Japan, cars have a special seatbelt for every bodily protuberance and there's a death penalty for not wearing the lot. But if you are in a country where people drive like suicidal banshees with their tails on fire (like the countries of Indo-China), many cars have no seatbelts and some don't even have doors.
