His brother Sachi Sen was a publisher, who ran an office called the Book World in Hastings. Street in Calcutta. Niranjan Sen told me that if I ever wanted to publish a book, I should certainly look up his brother. I did indeed, after a little over a year, having come out from jail.

She had been married off when she was a child, but her husband, instead of setting up a separate establishment, was living at her mother's house. Rambha was quite healthy, and had a certain beauty too. But she was probably infertile, and maybe in frustration, her behaviour was harsh, she was arrogant in her manners, and her language was extremely rude and obscene. She was the only child of her mother. The first question that I faced immediately on coming back from jail was Rambha's: How will they pay rent now? No one can live here without paying.//////Samaresh Basu was sixteen years younger than Manik Bandyopadhyay, and revered him.

He does it here as a writer in //////, with a very meaningful subtitle, ////// Although it is obvious that the narrative is in line with the travails of the author's discovering and re-discovering his father, nevertheless at the same time it is his finest tribute paid to his wonderful mother who was his friend, philosopher and guide. A burnt offering from a son to his mother when he says in the preface that he sees his mother everyday --- her joy, her capacity for wonder, in his daughters. He does not stop there but adds that "........ what is best in me I owe to her." Thus a weeping soul that oftentimes is tired, somewhat baffled; and although it bends somewhat somewhere, it never breaks.
