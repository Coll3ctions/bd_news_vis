There have been comments justifying as well as criticizing the act of pardon. However, what one finds quite reprehensible is quoting of precedents by the AL in justifying the act on the one hand, while the BNP, on the other hand, quite unwilling to draw any similarity with an oft-quoted pardon granted to a fugitive by it during the BNP's tenure in office in 2005, terming that as fully constitutional. //////Erosion of homesteads and croplands, indeed of whole villages, by fast flowing and rising rivers continues to be a major problem in Bangladesh. It is inevitable, especially in the monsoon season, that rising rivers will threaten lives and land. But what cannot be a fait accompli is the idea that erosion by rivers will go on playing havoc with lives year after year. Measures for securing the rivers, especially through the construction of proper embankments and dykes, should have been in place long ago. That we still go for ad hoc steps to hold our rivers back from flowing further inland is a sad commentary on what governments have not done over the decades.//////Rahul Dravid and Venkatsai Laxman held firm as India eyed a record-breaking chase in the first Test after Matt Prior's unbeaten century had swung the match back England's way at Lord's on Sunday.//////Nafees Iqbal may well have played his last Test five years ago, but the most telling contribution of his 12-match career came on January 18, 2005.//////Bangladesh's hopes of playing among the top 20 Asian teams for the World Cup Qualifying round has been all but shattered after their 4-0 defeat at the hands of Lebanon in the pre-qualifiers on Saturday.

Another student of that class was also waiting for his car. He told his mother to bring the fees of our teacher when she would come to pick him up. Due to poor condition of the road she couldn't arrive at the right time and as our teacher also left, he failed to give the fees. When his mother arrived he aggressively approached towards his car and threw some disgusting words at his mother. I was shocked. I couldn't understand how a young boy like him could humiliate his mother in such a disgraceful way in front of other people on the road and even in front of the driver. Most of the children of our country, especially the teenagers are losing their respect for the elders day by day.

The step has been taken in an apparent bid to bring about a curtailment in the consumption of cigarettes which takes a heavy toll of lives in our country as well as in other parts of the world every year. Smoking is injurious to health and its (smoking) dreadful consequences have prompted the strengthening of the anti-smoking drive around the globe.

However, it is unfortunate that we are not able to utilize them properly. As a result, there is apparently no economic development. Gas resources, for instance, is one of the most important natural resources of Bangladesh as they play a very active role in the development of the infrastructure and superstructure of our country. In thirteen districts, there have been seventeen gas fields discovered up until now. At present only Titas of Brahman Baria, Bakhrabad of Comilla, Haripur and Kailashtila of Sylhet, Chhatak of Sunamganj and Hobiganj gas fields are in use to standardize gas for our utility. This is not adequate for us, and the demand for gas resources is increasing relatively with the immense rise in our population. Nevertheless, if Bangladesh puts particular emphasis on the proper preservation and extraction of natural gas, surely one day we will reach the highest pinnacle of success. //////This imaginative but pragmatic idea was front page main news, in only one local English daily on July 16th!
