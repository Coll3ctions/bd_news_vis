Moreover, there is a great possibility of becoming ill at any time having this water. Meanwhile, the High court has directed the govt to take necessary steps to alleviate the sufferings of city dwellers. It proves that the respective authorities are not concerned in this regard as the city corporation is not also carrying out their responsibilities under proper rules and order.

Teachers are busy all day taking classes not only in their universities but also in private universities. Students also do not want to spend time in extra curricular activities. I think the spotting of new butterfly species at JU is a good example of what good research can bring. //////This kind of headline in the country's major English daily like DS which is widely read by interested readers including foreigners reflects the environment prevailing in the Bangladesh courts and the quality of lawyers. The lawyers supporters of a political party are out to save their corrupt leaders resorting to violence in the courtroom instead of going through the judicial process. The question now arises how did they know beforehand that their leader will not get fair justice in the court? Through their unjust violence, the people got to know that the leader is guilty and she is trying to evade judicial process and opted for wrong path of igniting unrest among her blind supporters to save her. //////I would like to give my heart felt thanks to the editor and the organisers of the award presentation ceremony for the outstanding students of O and A levels.

Originating from rural Bengal, these modest expositions have gone through some makeover and now get much fanfare in the urban areas. Unsurprisingly, mela is a big part of Pahela Baishakh celebrations. Be it the informal neighbourhood congregation, the major event where the crme of Dhaka hobnob, or the vibrant, delightfully gaudy rural affair -- mela gives us an opportunity to let go of our mundane worries for a while and soak up all the fun elements of it -- live music, jatra, putul naach (puppet dance), nagordola (a smaller indigenous version of Ferris wheel), snacks, sweets, clothes, churi (glass bangles), toys and much more. //////"Hindu na Musalman, Bouddho na Christian, shob bhuley jao eshey gechhey Pahela Baishakh": The song calls everyone to come together -- irrespective of religion -- to celebrate Pahela Baishakh, the biggest secular Bengali festival. //////Apart from airing Chhayanaut's New Year celebration live from Ramna Batomul at 6am and Baishakhi festival from Bakultola, Charukola at 9:30, Channel i will air live for the first time Grameenphone-Channel i Baishakhi Fair from Channel i Tejgaon office at 10am.

It is a spirit that has done us well through the centuries. Baishakh is a good deal more than a simple beginning of a new year. It is, indeed, a paean to heritage, a highlighting of the cultural traditions we are heir to. Baishakh is a harkening back to the past in as much as it is a comprehension of the present and a prediction of the future. //////EVERYTHING under the sun looks gay and cheerful and colourful. As we celebrate Pahela Baishakh we remember that the Babylonians were in fact the first observers of New Year about 4,000 years ago. Celebration of the new year is the oldest of all holidays.//////
