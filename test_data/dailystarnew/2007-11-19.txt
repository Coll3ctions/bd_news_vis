Understandably, it is still too early to determine the extent of fatalities, as many remote areas remain impenetrable to the search parties.

Yet, we feel, the enormity of the disaster and its aftermath demand more energetic and well-synchronised relief operations, and this can be best done through prioritising the immediate, mid-term and long-term requirements. //////Democrats in the United States have accused the administration of beating the drums of war against Iran. For its part, the Iranian leadership has been asking President Bush to apologise to Tehran since, in its view, the International Atomic Energy Agency has found no proof that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. The fact of the matter is that the IAEA has acknowledged that Tehran has provided sufficient access to information about its nuclear programme and has responded in a timely manner to the many questions that have been raised around the issue. The UN watchdog body still believes, though, that Iran has not stopped enriching uranium despite warnings from the global body that it do so.//////Bangladesh has the potential to be a middle- income country.

cyclone has struck, leaving behind a devastated coastal belt. All the details are not yet known The actual loss of human lives and properties is yet to be ascertained. We have watched glimpses of the devastation on of our national and international TV channels. These are the occasions when Bangladesh is better known to the west. This is the time when the army-backed caretaker government is required to prove their efficiency in crisis management. The damage to life and property is definitely very high, although immediate reports do not give a complete picture.

So this poor decision must be withdrawn immediately. //////Oh, no! US president George W. Bush has not accepted his defeat at his terror wars in the Middle East.

Intermittent wars are considered vital to protect the national and global interests of the USA. The trumpeting by the Democrats about a sure coming back to White House seems to be in jeopardy, going by his attempts to get back the hearts and minds of the people of the US to his side by wooing them in all possible ways. Maybe, he is right, they appreciate the terror wars being fought in the Islamic world.//////I have just come across the following in my Guardian Weekly of October 26th in an article by George Monbiot saying that the South African ex-golfing champion, Gary Player, should be called to account by environmentalists for the number of golf courses his company is building all over the world.//////A few days ago I went to Chittagong Public Library, searching for some books on American literature, Shakespeare, linguistics, etc. I couldn't find any book not even in the entries in the catalog.

The rift between scientific materialism and pure metaphysical and spiritual thought stream grew deeper with Darwin's discovery of the evolutionary theory and natural selection. Since then there have been two distinctly identifiable schools of thought, each zealously clinching its own ideas but one interesting feature cannot escape notice. Some renowned scientists and positivists took keen interest in the activity of the opposite camp and some of them even started believing in the duality of fundamental concepts thus seemingly creating two pathways - science and pseudo-science. They were the travelers of the shadow-lands of science but by no means science dropouts. //////Much has been said and written on the subject - some of which are highly scholarly and beyond comprehension for the laymen like this scribe. However, I would like to mention a few points: Some time back, the Japanese Foreign Minister (who later became Prime Minister) while visiting Bangladesh remarked that the climatic and topographical conditions of Dhaka city are not suitable for an underground metro system. The report of the experts' committee headed by Dr. Jamilur Reza Chowdhury also did not favour the metro system.//////Fighting between rival Sunni and Shia Muslims in northwestern Pakistan's troubled tribal belt has claimed at least 90 lives, security officials and state media reported yesterday. //////Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad played down talk of a possible US strike against his country, but nonetheless said Saturday that Iran is prepared "to face any development." //////The United States is now tilting toward Pakistan's army elite and moderate forces at the expense of President Pervez Musharraf in a high-stakes move to save a key war-on-terror ally, analysts say. //////India is keeping a close but wary eye on the crisis besetting nuclear rival Pakistan, keen to avoid accusations of meddling, officials and analysts say. //////Science is making headway in predicting how the planet's climate will evolve, but it's anyone's guess what actions policymakers meeting in Bali will take -- or not -- to slow global warming. //////A former guerrilla leader claimed victory yesterday in Kosovo elections and declared that voters had sent the world a message that the disputed Serbian province was now ready for independence. //////A methane blast ripped through a coal mine in eastern Ukraine early Sunday, killing at least 33 miners and leaving about 70 others trapped, emergency officials said. //////A bomb targeting a passenger train exploded yesterday on a railway track in northwestern Pakistan, killing one man, police said. //////Six people, two of them policemen, were killed and 19 wounded in three separate assaults on police across Iraq yesterday, security officials said. //////Prize-winning painter and filmmaker Khalid Mahmoud Mithu's contemporary art exhibition is on at the Bengal Gallery.

The real situation is even worse: the statistics include toilets that are so bad, or shared by so many people that it cannot be regarded as "improved sanitation." Over a billion of the 6 billion people in the world are served by sewerage systems, but much of this sewerage is discharged into rivers, lakes and seas with little or no treatment. Only about 30 % of 1.1 billion people connected to the sewer system have their sewage treated in an environmentally acceptable way (Matsui 2002), which effectively means that the excreta from the remaining, which is 5.7 billion people, are discharged directly into the environment -- on the land and to the receiving water bodies!//////The 21st century is full of discoveries, modernisation, affluence and development. But on the dark side, four out of five people in the world have no form of social security whatsoever and over 1.3 billion people have no access to adequate or affordable health care. //////The pristine landscape and sanctity of Dhaka University campus continue to be marred by reckless installation of commercial advertisement signs.//////Mini Transfer Station is a new feature that has been added recently to the existing solid waste collection scheme of Dhaka City Corporation (DCC).//////The city will soon have 5,000 more CNG-run autorickshaws with the current fleet of around 13,000.
