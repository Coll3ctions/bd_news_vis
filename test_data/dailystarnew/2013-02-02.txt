Curator Hester Keijser, in her presentation at the Goethe-Institut, Dhaka on January 30, focused on various facets of life in the Arabian Gulf. The presentation was not about the typical war-torn and politically violent depictions of the Mid-East, rather it upheld some previously unfocused layers -- ranging from social and cultural aspects to the gradually changing sentiments of people of the region.//////Singer, actress and double Oscar-winner Barbra Streisand is to perform at the Academy Awards for the first time in 36 years, organisers have announced.//////Theatre troupe Aranyak staged one of its early plays, Iblish, after nearly two decades.

Rights activists have termed it as a serious violation of democratic rights. In fact, the coercive nature of policing is what sets the police apart from any other agency within society and what creates the ambivalent relationship between society and its police. Traditionally, society has made legitimate coercion a state monopoly which has been exercised by police, and this monopoly is threatened by attempts to devolve order maintenance or patrolling functions to private security companies, or even to members of the public engaged in anti-crime patrols in their own area.//////Perhaps the best news to emerge concerning Afghanistan over the last few days is the five-day visit of the Afghan Defence Minister Gen.

For victims of sexual abuse, the experience can be all these and more.

In the couple of weeks till January 20, newspaper reports quoting Bangladesh Mohila Parshad indicate that in 2012, 5,616 women were victims of torture, 771 women and girls were raped, and 157 were gang raped. //////Last night I finished a speaking engagement late at night in the middle of nowhere. Everyone else was still partying. I had no idea how to get home. I quite often find myself in that sort of situation.//////Pakistan suggests a six-point agenda with Kashmir after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. //////NIPA Palm (Golpata) is an indicator plant species of the Sundarbans biome albeit it is neither a true littoral nor a high saline resistant species. It grows in the mudflat and fertile riparian habitats where the water slowly rises up and then slowly falls back again. It can grow inland where the tide deposits the seeds.//////Biodiversity almost always refers to the diversity of species found in a given ecosystem. These are its structural components. Identifying the structural components is important, because function flows from structure, and it is the functioning ecosystem that provides the goods and services sustaining human life and enterprises. Can ecosystems lose some species and still retain their functional integrity? Research evidence indicates that it is the dominant plants and animals that determine major ecosystem processes such as energy flow and nutrient cycling. //////Your books are held at the circulation desk for pick up. Well, so far, I have never failed this love of mine, the Morris Library. So, I turn my car around and head towards this calling. As I walk through the library's rotunda I notice many students deeply engaged in books or their laptops, having coffee and/or a sandwich; a few others are attentive to their companions having hushed conversations. I deeply enjoy this composed world. After checking out the books, I go to the third floor to claim my favorite spot. For those of you who are in love with books, surely you have noticed its subtle fragrance? As I walked through the first floor I could literally smell the distinctive aroma of newly arrived books...exciting, strong, inviting. And then there is the Rare Book Collections room, where the long wall-shelves hold books that have aged physically. The reading area in front of these shelves are for those lovers of knowledge who want to consult a reference, or research a topic, or wish to take a stroll along with history, or be in the antiquated stories, or those who simply want to forget the outside world for a few moments. The fragrance of books there is quite different: patient, confident. I do not know how else to define their unique essence!//////A couple of months ago, I went to Jordan to research for my senior thesis on Palestinian refugees and I wanted to come back not only with a wealth of academic information, but also a sharper, more worldly viewpoint. After all, no book, television show or blog quite replaced the lessons on the 3 P's --- people, politics and power --- as stepping foot on to a new land could teach. In my free time, I wandered like a Lion King character around the kingdom of Jordan. I was in love, combing through the homogeneity of Ammani stone buildings, cascading roads and Roman ruins with a heightened sense of feeling and a ready acceptability to all sorts of experience. Despite the high, I realized an unlikely similarity between "home" and abroad/travel. Travel allows a feeling that seems similar to the eerie warmth you sense when an old song from childhood starts playing on the radio, or when you smell the whiff of your mother's cooking after a long time. It is the feeling that you feel when you are nostalgic. //////That's a very nice shirt you are wearing, said a friend of mine the other day. It is a very nice tartan pattern. Where did you get it?

The total death of 8 people this year has been a significant cause for concern. As there is no vaccine or specific drug to treat it, precaution is the best way to cope.//////High blood pressure can easily be manageable. Yet it remains a leading cause of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and kidney disease. As it usually remains silent, many people do not know that they have high blood pressure. In more than half cases, including many receiving treatment, have blood pressure that remains too high to be healthy.//////Dengue is the world's fastest-spreading tropical disease and represents a "pandemic threat", infecting an estimated 50 million people across all continents, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated recently.//////A health portal from Bangladesh named HealthPrior21 offers numerous services to improve health and access healthcare services in an easier ways.//////For kids, time spent inactive seems less of a factor in higher body fat than does a lack of exercise, according to a new study published in the Journal of Paediatrics.//////Newborns deficient in vitamin D are twice as likely as newborns with higher levels to develop respiratory infections, says a new study out of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Researchers have found that low blood levels of vitamin D are linked to markers of respiratory disease, indicating that increased sun exposure or supplementation with the vitamin by mothers during pregnancy may be the solution.//////Post-conflict societies are always difficult, challenging, and fraught with perils and uncertainties. Apart from immense social and political challenges, these societies are often vulnerable to economic hardships; ethnic, tribal and inter-faith tensions; and face the ever great task of institutional building process. However, very few societies or countries successfully weathered through these difficult challenges. Social values, cultural norms and practices that are deeply rooted and entrenched contribute to shape the post-conflict outcome immensely. While Arab Spring offers much promises and prospectsboth for the people of the respective countries and for the entire democratic worldthere is much doubt and suspicion as to how the post-conflict Middle East would really emerge. Middle East societies have some unique social and cultural attributes that could immensely shape the post-Arab Spring democratisation process. Among these, the presence of a set of complex regional and global geopolitical dimensions in this region could significantly facilitate or hinder the region's democratisation efforts.//////On December 15, 2012, Chitra Devi walked across the stage to receive the honour being awarded to individuals and organizations that had great contribution in our Liberation War. Chitra Devi is the wife of Shaheed Sepoy Ansuya Prasad, the youngest recipient of the coveted Mahavir Chakra awarded by the Indian Government to those who demonstrated outstanding courage in India's wars. Sepoy Ansuya Prasad received the Mahavir Chakra for his valour during the operation in Shamshernagar airport area, Sylhet on November 30, 1971 during our Liberation War. He was only 17 years and joined the regiment after completion of his training 11 days prior to the eventful day.//////The Algerian hostage crisis has ended with tragic consequences.//////Khondakar Ashraf Hossain made waves with ////// his seminal poetical work, quite some years back. And since then he has gone on to write not only substantive poetry but also purposeful literary criticism, especially on the various facets of Bengali literature. His pre-eminent position as a poet and critic has again gone with his academic pursuits as a senior teacher in the English department of Dhaka University. It is thus that he has carved a significant niche for himself as a scholar, proof of which comes through this rather riveting study of the degree to which Bangladeshi poetry has been influenced by the incoming breezes and winds which once shaped literary sensibilities in the West. //////If anyone can genuinely and productively help in decisively resolving the latent, at times turning demonstrative, contentious relations between India and Pakistan, then all those ponderous thoughts offered in the book under review for bringing about fruitful cooperation among the nations of the South Asian region will fall into place, post-facto resolution of the thorny issues between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. //////, edited by Zillur R. Khan and Meghna Guhathakurta, longtime academics both, concentrates heavily on the South Asian region, with only a solid analytical-conceptual chapter (Empire, Globalisation and the Political Subject by Ranabir Samaddar) and a distinctly pedestrian one by Abul Kalam justifying the inclusion of Beyond in the book's sub-title. Eleven chapters make up the anthology, which has been dedicated to the memory of Ambassador Fakhruddin Ahmed, once a foreign secretary to the government of Bangladesh. As is often the case, the articles written by a variety of authors are uneven in quality, although the overall quality of the book should satisfy the average reader. //////
