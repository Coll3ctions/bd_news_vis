These past two years have been time enough for the government to fulfill the expectations it had aroused in the people through its promise of change. Before we go into the business of dwelling on whether or not the government has indeed made a difference in the lives of citizens, we need to make it clear to the prime minister and her colleagues that in this third year in power, judgement on their administration will be solely based on how they perform from here on and until the next election. The government will henceforth be under the most rigorous scrutiny and public support or disapproval of it will depend on how it goes about conducting business in this third year.//////The report that 30 cargo vessels have been stranded over a week at the Shibalay point in Manikganj in the river Jamuna is a cause for concern. Unless dredging, which is now under way at the river point in question, is done speedily and effectively, the delay in the supply of the goods that those vessels are carrying will contribute to raising their carrying cost as well as leave its knock-on effect on their price and the overall productive activities in the districts they are bound for. The Shibchar point is one of the 12 vulnerable points in the Jamuna, where the rate of siltation is very high in the lean seasons of the year so much so that a shoal may spring up in a matter of hours. Whereas this is a veritable obstacle to early prognostication of the spots needing immediate dredging, as pointed out by Chief Engineer of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), that should also provide a more compelling reason why there should be constant survey of the intensity of siltation and levels of water at the vulnerable points in place and more dredgers ready for action as and when it is required. But the way the dredged up mud is being reportedly allowed to pile up near the navigation point being cleared of the silt, it is again clogging the river lane in question. As it appears, the problem lies in homing in on the appropriate spot for the dredging where there is also suitable place for dumping the mud. The dredging authority, BIWTA, needs to take these points into due consideration to facilitate their dredging operation. The cargo vessel operators, too, have to remain alert to the declining navigability of the river route under scrutiny so that the weight of their goods-laden vessels itself may not become a barrier to their passage through the shallow waters of the siltation-prone sections of the river. Since the major river routes for transporting vital cargoes to the northern districts are fast choking up with silts and shoals, it calls for emergency action including regional cooperation to address it.//////Cameroonian midfielder Modo Hugues marked his debut with a brilliant goal as newcomers Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club handed a 2-0 defeat to Muktijoddha Sangsad in their Bangladesh League

For them, going to normal commercial banks for financing their working capital, is fairly complicated. It is usually beyond their capabilities to provide the needed guarantees and other documents needed for processing the loan.

I wonder whether he is aware of the four principles of our constitution. He has failed to understand the real meaning of secularism and has no idea about our culture. Secularism does not mean that obscene dance shows can be arranged in a country where nearly 90 percent of the total population is Muslim. What is more, our culture is different from that of Europe. It is true that in the present times it is difficult to follow Islamic rules strictly for many reasons, but should we not believe in Allah the Almighty? Should we forgo the Islamic values in the name of modernism, secularism or something else?//////Allies of Pakistan's assassinated liberal politician Salman Taseer yesterday alluded to his killing as part of a wider plot, slamming security failures that saw his bodyguard charged with murder.//////Ivory Coast's presidential claimant Alassane Ouattara said yesterday he had proof his rival, Laurent Gbagbo, had instigated post-election violence and ordered foreign agents to carry out killings.//////A Palestinian resolution condemning Israel's settlement building could be voted on at the UN Security Council as early as next week, the Palestinian representative to the UN said Wednesday.//////A top US envoy sought China's help yesterday in easing the threat of war on the Korean peninsula, hoping to gain insights about a senior Chinese official's recent meeting with North Korea's absolute leader, Kim Jong Il.//////The US plans to send 1,400 additional Marines to Afghanistan to boost its combat forces ahead of the spring fighting season, the Wall Street Journal reported on yesterday.//////Iranian authorities have detained a 55-year-old US woman on spying charges, a state-owned newspaper reported yesterday.//////Israel's prime minister says he will discuss Mideast peacemaking with Egypt's leader, as well as the common threat posed by Iranian-backed militant groups.//////At least 22 people including six children were killed when their bus plunged into a gorge in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, a police officer told AFP yesterday.//////Rioting youths have set buildings ablaze and hurled stones at police in Algeria amid anger at recent price rises and chronic unemployment.//////Turkey is to blame for the crisis in relations between Israel and Ankara, and the Jewish state will not become a Turkish "punching bag," Israel's foreign minister said yesterday.//////With the theme "Mostok Tulitey Dao Ananto Akashey, Udatto Akashey Muktir Batashey", musical troupe SURMA (Students United for Research in Musical Activities) marked its 10th anniversary at Teachers' and Students' Centre (TSC) on Dhaka University campus on January 5.//////On a chilly January morning, exactly two years ago, a crisp new voice emerged in the air of Dhaka, with a vision to enlighten and entertain people from all walks of life.
