But the draft of the consumers' rights ordinance that has been prepared contains certain provisions which do not go far enough to underpin or protect consumer rights. It has been proposed that the affected consumers will have to lodge a complaint within 10 days of being aggrieved. Clearly, the consumer's interests are not sufficiently underpinned because in some cases it may take a longer time for the consumers to realise that they have been swindled. Secondly, the aggrieved consumers won't be allowed to file a case directly to the court. It has to be routed through a government agency to obtain the right to file a case in the court. In other words, the bureaucracy will practically decide the fate of the consumers' complaints. It is not at all clear why the consumers' right to seek legal aid all by themselves has not been recognised. After all, nothing can be more effective in protecting consumers' rights expect through the law of the land. Like Artha Rin Adalats or loan courts we may have a separate legal setup for redressing grievances related to consumer rights. //////THERE is surely a rationale behind the intention of the government to consider a salary hike for government servants, given the runaway nature of the prices of essential commodities in recent times.

Monday was "democracy day," ending the eight years of military rule. Former army chief Pervez Musharraf, however, refuses to step down, and claims to be the nation's lawful president. Close to a two-thirds majority of the parliament, and an overwhelming majority of lawyers of Pakistan, see Musharraf as a usurper. Facing a hostile parliament and an uncompromising Bar, Musharraf would offer to make a deal. He would relinquish power if he could safely leave the country (and perhaps fly away to the United States). ////// is, for the for the time being, barred from holding office in Malaysia thanks to a politically criminal conviction dating from 1999.

We need the funding to come from outside as I'm sure the effects of Sidr have somewhat depleted our government funds for such projects. I think that the underground system was the incorrect choice and that the sky train would have been much better, easier and cheaper for us right now. Bangkok has both systems, but they did the sky train first, it requires little land and problems of flooding do not affect it. Kuala Lumpur also has both including a simple sky train system covering key areas and upcoming areas. They charge 15 baht a ride in Bangkok (around 30 taka), in Bangladesh it would have to be around 15 taka to make it feasible. I read that some local company has been given the contract for its completion in 4 years.

This govt. is definitely the best, sincere govt. in the last 36 years. This govt. could arrest two former prime ministers who were also two leaders of the opposition along with a number of senior ministers, the son of a former prime minister, a number of top businessmen (better to say land grabbers, manipulators, extortionists) a number of bureaucrats all at a time. Probably no govt. in the world would dare to touch so many powerful demons in political, bureaucratic, business, circles at a time.
