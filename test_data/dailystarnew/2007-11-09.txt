Why such prime land should be given to a club when shrinking space in the urban areas has become a serious public concern is mind-boggling. Environmentalists and other sections of the population are right to demand that the decision be rescinded and that nothing should be done to damage the existing landscape of Suhrawardy Udyan. Over the years the Udyan, formerly known as the Race Course, has lost a good deal of its character through such edifices as the Engineers Institute and the Roads and Highways Department coming up. In the early 1980s, the establishment of a children's park took away a large chunk of land from the Udyan. //////Watching the news this past week, I recalled a comment made to me by eminent Indian journalist Sayeed Naqvi when I met him in Dhaka earlier this year. Mr. Naqvi commented at the time how ridiculous it was that we in South Asia needed to get our information about Afghanistan from the likes of BBC and CNN.//////I am not trying to be discreet here when I say that I have no experience of taking the Yaba pill.

They can shed some quick kilos without much sweat, while feeling weightless all that time!//////Serious differences between the government and the radical leftists on the fate of monarchy in Nepal appear to have narrowed down significantly following the passage of a proposal by parliament asking the government to initiate legal preparations to declare the country a republic.

" - Albert Einstein. //////Parveen's article on the subject (Nov:5) equates nylon-net shopping bags with paper shopping packets made from recycled fertiliser and cement bags. All these are classed as dangerous for health. However, the health hazards are not clearly spelled out with details, nor is there any dependable reference in support of the statement; beyond stating that toxic residues of these containers are a hazard to public health! Small wonder, small traders using these convenient shopping containers are unaware of these issues. They are unfortunately not provided with a simple clarification on the possibilities of health hazards resulting from using these materials.//////On 29/10/07, I believe many people were surprised to hear from the law adviser an amazing question: How do you expect us to put on trial these people for something done 36 years ago?//////Mrs. Asma Kibria's article, 'Is it not yet time for justice?" published in The Daily Star on Wednesday, 24 October, moved me to tears. Mrs Kibria's campaign for justice following the brutal killing of her husband SAMS Kibria on 24 January 2005 is an admirable example of courage, determination and dignity. But in this connection the pertinent question is: How many more years does she have to continue showing this example?//////1. Justice delayed, justice denied: Cases of VIPs and the rich in courts are attended quickly, but those of poor and common people are handled slowly.//////It has already been proved that girls in our country are capable of performing an equal role as their male counterparts, provided the requisite facilities are available. In one are they obtain a higher credit than boys since their presence in society is as exquisite as flowers in the garden. But in an important sphere of life like marriage girls are often not asked to give their opinions. Consequently, marriage, the tie of love becomes a mere shock to many girls. In the existing marriage system few girls are allowed to express their opinions. Recently, I had a frank conversation with many university as well as college going girls and found the majority of them are not independent of their family in the matter of marriage. A great many of them do not dare to argue with their parents regarding marriage to avoid severe punishments.//////Recently I went to visit some tourist spots in different districts of Dhaka, Barisal and Khulna Division with my wife and children using our own car. To plan our routes we bought recently published maps of five different commercial publishing houses of the country. Unfortunately, we found that the road routes shown in these maps are someway different form the reality. We found some excellent highways comparable to British A type roads which were not shown in any of these maps. Secondly, we found some roads shown in the maps which are not in existence. Third, the maps are not properly scaled. Fourth, the maps do not show the existence of ferryboats. There are many other drawbacks. We used roads shown in the maps then when we reached a destination we learnt that we could use shortcuts. //////I thank Mr. Mohammad Badrul Ahsan for his thought-provoking article Mutiny of the magistrates on 26-10-07. He has analyzed the possible reasons behind the resentment among the magistrates against the government decision to separate the judiciary from the administration.//////Now that the top leaders of the two largest political parties have been thoroughly discredited and are unlikely to be able to participate in the next national election (because of the on-going numerous court cases), the Awami League stands a better chance to reorganise and prepare for it. But for that the AL must persuade Sheikh Hasina's son , Sajib Wajed Joy, and entrust him with the task of house cleaning and nominating persons of 'more or less acceptable background' to contest in the election. //////In response to questions in Kennedy School of Government, Boston, our Army Chief replied that Sheikh Hasina is being tried under ordinary laws of the land in an open court and also that he would be happy if she is acquitted. Is this so? Then why after 7/8 years of alleged occurrence of the "crime", some people were taken into custody and why they were released soon after.//////Rab have just arrested 9 of the JMB terrorists who have confessed to direct personal involvement in the grenade attack on the AL meeting on 21 August 2004. Earlier, at the behest of the then govt of the BNP-Jamaat alliance a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of CID in the name of investigation concocted a cock and bull story accusing poor Joj Miah, Mokhlesur Rahman and a few others. Even Joj Miah was made to make a confessional statement before a judicial magistrate, I am sure, under duress. By doing so , the SSP not only violated the relevant laws, he surely betrayed the trust reposed on him by his department and the state. //////President Bush, personally intervening in the political crisis in Pakistan, told President Pervez Musharraf on Wednesday he must hold parliamentary elections soon and step down as army leader. //////Top State Department official John Negroponte Wednesday said continued engagement with Pakistan was the "only option" despite President Pervez Musharraf's declaration of emergency rule. //////President Bush and French President Nicolas Sarkozy stood shoulder-to-shoulder against a nuclear-armed Iran on Wednesday, demonstrating the cozier relationship between the two countries under France's new conservative leader. //////UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari met Myanmar's detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday after warning the junta against a return to the status quo before mass pro-democracy protests shook the nation. //////Georgia was under a 15-day state of emergency Thursday after police clashed violently with anti-government protesters and forced the main opposition television station off air. //////A senior Iranian official urged New Delhi Thursday not to drift too close to Washington, emphasising his country's wish to be a major energy supplier to a "friendly" India. //////A Saudi-based Muslim clerics' organisation has banned the use of Quranic verses as mobile phone ringtones after a six-day meeting in the holy city of Makkah, a statement said on Thursday. //////An 18-year-old gunman opened fire at his high school in this placid town in southern Finland on Wednesday, killing seven other students and the principal before mortally wounding himself in a rampage that stunned a nation where gun crime is rare. //////The head of the UN agency responsible for aiding Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that Israel's near economic blockade of the Gaza Strip is fuelling support for extremists and shattering hopes for a peaceful future. //////Rudraprasad Sengupta is one of the most prominent theatre personalities in the subcontinent.

They have been blissfully married for sixteen years now, and have two talented children -- Arjo and Shiropa. However, their journey from their days of early romance at the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA), to their present days of billing and cooing, have not been without perseverance.//////The 4th Lux Channel i Performance Award will be held at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium amidst razzle-dazzle.

The commission will review and suggest recommendations for the reform of government rules and regulations. In this age of globalisation and regional cooperation many existing rules do not appear to be suitable for a dynamic administration.//////In a Newsweek article on June 11, Fareed Zakaria wrote: "The problem (is) that America is  seen as too arrogant, uncaring and insensitive." That assertion was not made lightly or flippantly. Each time the leaders of 6% of the world's population dictate terms to the community of nations (Iran most recently) and engage with deadly force where interests clash (N. Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, etc), Zakaria's portrayal is reinforced. //////The most recent report on Bangladesh's economic growth strategy, which has been highlighted by the World Bank country director and the chief economist for Bangladesh, deserves our critical attention. I was particularly impressed with the frank and open discussion of the report initiated by its principal author, Sandeep Mahajan. The country director has also been kind enough to write in the popular press, and it is in the spirit of encouraging further dialogue that this comment is written. //////According to some of the world's leading international and development groups, global warming threatens to reverse human advancement and make unattainable all UN targets to lessen poverty. In a journal, Oxfam, Greenpeace, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth, WWF and 15 other groups state that rich governments must immediately address climate change to avoid "obscene levels" of worldwide poverty. "Food production, water supplies, public health and people's livelihoods are already being damaged and undermined," the journal says. "There is no either/or approach possible. The world must meet its commitments to achieve poverty reduction and also tackle climate change. The two are inextricably linked."//////Recently, air and water pollution has drawn the attention of environmentalists in Bangladesh. Air and water are crucial for the survival of all living organisms on earth and the most vital of natural resources. They are needed for human health, breathing, drinking, agriculture use, wildlife, aquatic life, and ecosystem etc. They are vital components of the environment, interlinked with other components and the quality of the environment. Water plays many roles in the biosphere, including being a habitat for millions of species and a part of the hydrological cycle. The environment, economic growth and development of Bangladesh are highly influenced by water -- its regional and seasonal availability, and the quality of surface and groundwater. //////Indigenous communities use the forest with restraint because it provides for their basic needs -- food, shelter, water, medicine, fuel and clothing. The Bambuti people of the Congo refer to the forest as mother or father, and hold it sacred: a deity to ask for help and to thank. The Yanomami of Venezuela and Brazil believe that the natural and spiritual worlds are united: the fates of all people and the environment are inexorably linked. So when people destroy the environment, humanity slowly commits suicide. //////
