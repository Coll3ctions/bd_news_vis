As for the BNP, which has called a hartal today over the issue, its position is clear: it wants the caretaker system to stay and considers any move to scrap it as a 'conspiracy' on the part of the ruling Awami League.//////Mindless parking of vehicles on city roads has become a civic menace to say the least. The problem has come to such a pass that even pedestrian movement along commercial buildings or shopping complexes has become extremely difficult, at times even risky.

The recent storm and heavy waves destroyed the fish farms, and all the shrimps were lost to the tidal wave. As an option, the farmers went back to growing paddy and other food crops; little knowing that their soil is now saturated in saline, and no green crops can be grown! In this case not only have they lost the shrimps; which were financially rewarding; but now no cash crops can be grown, which before farming of shrimps in saline water, used to provide cash crop! Not only they, but possibly the agricultural officials were unaware of this. Otherwise they would have stopped the farmers in wasting money, scarce resources and their labor in trying to plant farm food crops in the saline contaminated soil! Agriculture Department should now take necessary steps, so that all farmers become aware of this problem of soil salinity; so that the farmers know the pros and cons; before opting for fish farming in their farmland.//////ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is a great invention of modern technology, as we know that majority banks of our country are doing trading on-line basis. Banks are providing debit and credit cards to the customers. With the help of those cards, customers can easily withdraw money from booths at any time. ATM booths are playing a vital role in our modern e-banking system. They provide 24 hours service throughout the week. Recently, there was widespread allegation from the customers that they got fake notes from ATM booths. If anyone gets fake notes from ATM, s/he can not produce any evidence of that. So, banks should be more cautious regarding this issue. They should ensure that there will be no more fake notes in ATM. Otherwise customers will reject this popular service. //////Now-a-days, the main problem for the people in Dhaka is bus fare. Huge numbers of students are studying in this city and they have to travel to different places regularly. Some educational institutions have their own transports but they are not sufficient. So, the students have to travel by public buses. Because of increased fuel price, the bus fare has been raised. Quarrels between bus staff and passengers are very common. Sometimes, the helpers behave roughly with the students. In this circumstance, I hope that our Ministry of Communications, BRTA and the owners of the buses arrange separate tickets for students. //////The United States has carried out a series of attacks in northwest Pakistan since 2004 using drones or unmanned aerial vehicles.

Although people know this as a model town, it still bears the smell of the first conceived 'satellite' character. Although RAJUK's plan shows over 25% road area inside the town is over 100 feet wide, Dhaka Eastern By-pass road running along its east side obliquely, and a planned 300 feet road link from Kuril in Dhaka, PNT doesn't have any north-south links that could do justice to the local people of two adjacent upazilas: Rupganj and Kaliganj, each of which has contributed land to it. //////It is the government's duty to see to it that people live in peace and there is stability in the country, but from the activities of Awami League led government, people are getting the impression that the government does not care, and it will stubbornly go ahead with its plan no matter what the outcome is. //////Queen Elizabeth's recent visit to the Republic of Ireland opened a new chapter in the Anglo-Irish relations.

The resultant sea-water intrusion is increasing salinity in coastal drinking water with severe health consequences to surrounding populations. Our research team at Imperial College London and Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies (BCAS) has found expecting mothers in particular, becoming acutely susceptible to the diseases of hypertension and (pre)eclampsia from this salinity exposure. This suggests that climate change is not only breaching our coasts, but is approaching the very shores of motherhood in the womb. //////Today, June 5, is "World Environment Day."
