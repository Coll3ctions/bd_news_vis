The Ministry of Communications and the Roads and Highways Department, unable to see eye to eye on the matter, have now together created a situation where the issue of a tender has effectively put a stop to the upgradation plan, at least for now. That is indeed most sordid business. And it becomes pathetic when a whole plan falters around the question of a so-called performance guarantee being shortened from 28 days to seven days. At this point, there is a clear picture of how officials are blaming one another over the issue, with the ministry claiming that the time slash was a gross violation of the Public Procurement Regulation (PPR) 2008.//////Trees certainly do not figure prominently in the Dhaka City Corporation's scheme of a healthy urban setting. A large number of trees were cut down for no good reason in the past and the latest plan of eliminating 52 old trees from the city's Gulshan area is a shocking reminder of the city fathers' insensitivity to the need for retaining the trees and all green patches in the metropolis.

Some others however, probably more than usual, have referred to emerging negative trends and been harsh. //////Whether politics is guided by morals or not is a moot point. But India has proved that democracy knows no morals. We have fiercely flaunted before the world, particularly our neighbours, oscillating between dictatorship and democracy of sorts, that we have the democratic system in position. But when the time came to prove it, we were found wanting. It is not only the Congress and the BJP which fell from the minimum standards of integrity. All political parties, including the Left, played an opportunistic game.//////Election fever, if I am allowed to say so, is gradually gaining momentum. Quite contrary to the usual practice the process of the general election follows the one for the local government elections across the country. At the first instance, we have by now election schedule declared for a number of municipal and city corporations. Submission of nomination papers, their scrutiny, acceptance and rejection have already been completed. Though yet to take off formally and on a mass scale individual aspirants and their supporters are about to mobilize their respective numerical strength to fall back upon.
