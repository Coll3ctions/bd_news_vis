But unfortunately in hospitals nowadays the hospitality is totally absent, rather they have become money making centres. In the context of present situation the hospitals should better be termed business centre for health care. A grim picture of hospitals was depicted in the news published in The Daily Star on 26-08-10 under the title ICU too costly for poor. Dhaka Medical College Hospital is always under huge pressure and it is good luck for any patient to get admitted there. Obviously, patients are forced to go to private hospitals where many of them receive treatments but come out penniless. Different private hospitals are charging differently for the same facility as there is no government regulation or monitoring. The amount of expenditure in a private hospital is very high for the middle income group and beyond the reach of the low earners. Some private hospitals have agents to refer patients to them where the agents get commission for sending a patient to a selected hospital. It is reported that the government has little or almost no monitoring of the private hospitals. If there were sufficient services available at all public hospitals at district level, poor patients might get medicare. The result is that less privileged people have to either go without treatment or sell all their properties if they are to have treatment in a private hospital. The medical service has been gradually going into the hands of people whose ultimate motive is to make business out of the hapless patients' woes. The high costs have been preventing villagers to seek treatment from qualified doctors. A study reveals that 85% people seek quack remedies. Though the right to medical service is one of the basic human rights, the poor and middle income people are being deprived of the service. The capacities of public hospitals are in need of drastic improvement. They need more equipment, wards, ICU, doctors and nurses. The government should also take guarantee from the private hospitals to earmark some of their wards and ICUs for treating the poor patients. In the interest of the poor and middle income people, the situation calls for the government's regulation and strong monitoring of the hospital service sector.//////A variety of iftar items -- peaju, beguni, jilapi, aloor chop, etc are available in hotels and restaurants during Ramadan.//////Dhaka is an over populated city with 8% area allocated for roads, whereas an ideal city should have 25%. Official figures put the population of Dhaka at around 9.3 million (but we all know how wrong it is), which makes it the fourth most populated city in the world. And the end result is the endless tailbacks at the traffic signals, which we have all fallen victims to. //////The news item captioned 'Biman boss hits back at Quader' published in the front page of your esteemed daily on Thursday, 19th August has caught my attention. //////In the first day of Ramadan I went to a super shop near Gulshan circle- 1 to buy some necessities. As I heard from my relatives that their cars were fined by the police while parking before the shop, so I told my driver to go by the lane next to the shopping area where he could park the car. After completion of my shopping when I got off I found my car before the shop. I asked my driver why he put the car here. He informed me that while he was heading towards the lane as directed, all of a sudden a sergeant came and stopped him and asked for the car's related documents, checked his license and filed a case as the driver could not show legal license and took my car's insurance paper instead of taking his license. //////The number of anthrax infected people is increasing day by day. The outbreak of the disease is seen in an area which is known to be a milk pocket of our country. People got infected by consuming or processing the meat of infected animals. //////In Bangladesh good governance has become the most talked about issue. Every day we find news in the electronic and print media about how lack of good governance is obstructing our progress. There are some key factors that are considered to be the elements of good governance such as reform of judiciary, reform of administration, anti-corruption measures, decentralisation, accountability and transparency. Good governance plays the most important role in establishing rule of law in a country. It upholds the supremacy of the constitution that is vital to establishing democracy in a country. It also ensures fundamental rights and human rights. //////The other day while scanning through TV channels, I saw a gentleman, claiming himself to be a freedom fighter, depicted late President Ziaur Rahman as an ISI agent. I am sorry I do not remember his name, he went on saying that the vanquished Pakistani army could foresee the potential in the late President and decided to deploy him as their agent when he went to the vessel MV Swat anchored at Chittagong Port to accept delivery of arms and ammunition intended for the massacre of the Bengali nation.//////A lot has been said about saving certificates in different newspapers.

But none of our problems have been addressed despite the assurances given by the Honourable Finance Minister.//////This is a very ill thought out project which is only for motorised vehicles. And in a few years the whole expressway will be choked up like the recent 60 mile and 10 day long trunk road jam in China. The expressway exit branches cannot be guaranteed to be free and this will cause the jam on the expressway in the same manner as it is causing now on the present surface roads. Traffic is like water flow and any blockage anywhere will be felt in the whole system including the expressways. Also if there is no clear lane (i.e. 'a hard shoulder' as in motorways in western countries) imagine the problems of rescue in case of accidents on such a long expressway. Such building of expressways will also take away the sky space for any future mass transit sky train system for the city.//////Every day we hear about accidents in which many people are killed and some become maimed and the families become devastated.//////Our Palli Kabi Jasimuddin in his well-known poem Nimontron invited his city friends to come and enjoy different things in his village.

Those who fall in the latter category don't know the difference between right and wrong. They cross a line and enter a different world, a world where money is above everything.//////Barabagh is a densely populated area located at the back of Grameen Bank head office, Mirpur-2, Dhaka. DCC constructed the Barabagh road years ago. This road connects Popular Housing-1, West Monipur, Ahmed Nagar, Far East Housing Paikpara and other areas. A few hundreds of students of Monipur High school use this road daily. In the last one year, this road was gradually getting damaged. Now the situation is so bad that no rickshaw, CNG auto rickshaw or private car can ply this road. Almost every day some sort of accident occurs. The other day I witnessed a rickshaw carrying children of Monipur High School turned turtle and the kids were injured.//////We welcome the historic verdict on the 7th amendment of the constitution. //////A picture was published in the DS of a student hitting a private car the way a teacher punishes a student for any mistake committed by him (DS: 27.08.10).

The court was very much right to pass the comment.//////A picture appeared in The Daily Star on Tuesday, August 24, which shows some daring women braving the speeding vehicles of the busy road climbing the grilled road divider and crossing the road in a dangerous manner when the foot overbridge is just a few yards away. This practice is not only uncivilised but it can also cause severe accident. As a concerned citizen I will request these people not to cross the road in such a life-threatening manner, and use the foot overbridge instead, for their own safety. //////President Barack Obama yesterday marks the symbolic end of US combat operations in Iraq, seven years after an invasion he opposed, and at a time when the country still seems far from being stabilized.//////Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas and Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak have met secretly in Amman ahead of Middle East peace talks that start in Washington this week, Israeli media reported on Tuesday.//////President Nicolas Sarkozy's inner circle has stepped up its anti-immigration rhetoric but splits were beginning to appear Tuesday in a government under mounting political pressure.//////The US government on Monday slapped sanctions on four people and eight organizations accused of aiding North Korea's government through illicit trade, the Treasury Department said.//////Japanese powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa confirmed yesterday he would challenge Prime Minister Naoto Kan in a party vote, setting up a clash that risks creating a policy vacuum as Japan struggles with a strong yen and fragile growth.//////A hardline Iranian newspaper stepped up its attack on French first lady Carla Bruni, saying yesterday that the "Italian prostitute" deserved to die for supporting an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning.//////The US commander of the Afghan war acknowledged yesterday that the Taliban were expanding their footprint across the country even as international forces close in on their traditional southern strongholds.//////Muslim countries and organisations have pledged nearly $1b in cash and supplies to relief efforts for flood victims in Pakistan, the head of a group of Islamic states said yesterday.//////Myanmar's junta chief made an announcement via state media yesterday, dispelling rumours that he had retired from the army as part of a reshuffle ahead of a rare election in the country.//////Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard yesterday rejected a quick return to the polls and welcomed a "new political landscape" after inconclusive national elections prompted the biggest upheaval in decades.//////Mexican police have arrested alleged drug trafficker Edgar Valdez, a US citizen also known as Barbie, Mexico's attorney general says.//////Four African Union (AU) peacekeepers have been killed in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, after al-Shabab fighters fired a mortar at the presidential palace.//////Extortionists mercilessly beat up a businessman and ransacked his house and business establishment as he refused to pay illegal toll in Meherpur. //////Japan cancelled more than 200 flights and many ferry services to its southern islands yesterday as a typhoon churned in before likely heading toward the Korean peninsula.//////Hurricane Earl, now a powerful Category 4 storm, barrelled toward the US coast early yesterday after battering tiny islands across the northeastern Caribbean with heavy rain and winds that damaged homes and toppled power lines.//////A French climber known as "Spiderman" was arrested on the roof of a 57-storey Sydney skyscraper on Monday after scaling the building without ropes or a harness to raise climate change awareness.//////MySpace on Monday began letting users synchronize updates with Facebook, the social networking superstar that supplanted the firm that once ruled in that arena.//////Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables may decrease the risk of some kinds of lung cancer for smokers, according to a study released Monday.//////Sri Lanka's Supreme Court yesterday began assessing a draft bill that would amend the island's constitution to allow President Mahinda Rajapakse to run for office for a third term.//////India yesterday announced an additional USD 20 million aid for flood-ravaged Pakistan.//////India's Supreme Court announced yesterday it would re-examine the sentences given to managers found guilty over the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, which critics said were too lenient, a report said.//////Residents in Indian Kashmir defied a curfew yesterday to hold angry demonstrations after an 11-year-old boy was killed and a relative of a top separatist seriously injured in police fire.//////Young Bangladeshi photographer Munem Wasif is exhibiting his latest series, In God We Trust, at the international photojournalism festival, 'Visa pour l'image' being held in the southern French city of Perpignan.
