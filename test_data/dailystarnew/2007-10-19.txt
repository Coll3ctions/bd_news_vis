The long-felt need for separation of the judiciary from the executive now looks about to be finally met. Indeed, we can reasonably say here that the fundamental and necessary changes being brought about in the way the judiciary will work from now on are an outcome of the long and sustained struggle put up by the nation over the years for the supremacy of law and fairness and efficiency of the justice system. Under the new arrangements, all control over the lower judiciary will pass into the hands of the Supreme Court.

When I first read about it in Maureen Dowd's New York Times column earlier this week, I wasn't sure whether to take it seriously or not. Surely this was just hyperbole on Ms. Dowd's part or she must have gotten hold of the wrong end of the stick or somehow misunderstood.

May be that is the main reason for their interest in having different companies as a smoke screen; basically for satisfying their greed for more management clout and a wide range of perquisites. They simply love their multiple roles.//////No doubt truth is stranger than fiction. We are a nation where most of our people who can influence others are corrupt. Common people are the ultimate victims. We can find corrupt people in every sphere of our populace. But can a truth commission cure this infectious disease? Perhaps not, unless we install a functional system in the society to combat corruption relentlessly. Does it mean that we don't need such a commission? Definitely we need a truth commission for our politicians, where they will make confession and rectify themselves.

For this reason, the number of users is increasing rapidly. So any deal between mobile operators and users is to be fair and square. But in some cases users have to pay more than what is due. For example, we have to pay at least one extra taka in case of recharging. It is also applicable for purchasing card of that amount.

While I was waiting, a women came to the same officer to open a new account with duly completed application form (filled by someone else, signed by her) with introduction from another account holder. After checking the application form thoroughly the officer gave her 2 more forms (1) transaction profile (2) know your customer {KYC}-for filling. The woman, not educated enough, was baffled and requested the officer for help who bluntly refused. The woman then protested saying he could give these forms with the application form so that she could arrange to fill them up by her relative. Then, I offered to help her and while filling these forms, I understood that her brother had recently gone to Dubai and would send Tk 25000-30000 pm for family expense. I wonder, why could not this system be simplified for a small account opener by single statement that transaction will not exceed (say) Tk. 7 lakh pm. in the application form instead of filling 2 additional forms.//////There has definitely been an improvement in the crime situation.

Sometimes a few cyclists also do it, but rarely. Mostly they push the cycles while walking alongside, which is not so objectionable.

It is quite natural that once in a while we would win a match. Whenever we win a match, the media blows it out of proportion and start using words like Greatest Hero, Mahanayak etc. I think this kind of euphoria spoils the boys. And again when we lose (which is the normal regular thing we do), we say we are learning, I think we should put a stop to this kind of exuberance and excuses.

'Prava', in Bangla, means radiance and her name seems to do justice to her appearance. Prava's enthusiastic expressions and infectious smile made the TV commercial (TVC) of Meril beauty soap one of last year's most popular ads. Overnight Prava became a familiar face to millions.

We are conditioned to visualising an ideal environmental framework for decision making. The decision makers are supposed to be rational agents free from human inadequacies and fallibility. //////THE world has reacted with horror to the Burmese regime's brutal crackdown against its own people. Monks, nuns and ordinary citizens took to the streets peacefully in protest at the deterioration of the economic situation in the country. They were met with guns and batons. //////HOLLIS Chenery and Alan Strout are proponents of the "two-gap" model of development. Which is: savings determine investments -- and per capita income determines savings. Since poor countries have low incomes, and, accordingly, low savings, they are caught in a "vicious circle of poverty." Thus, it is argued, investment financed by foreign aid will break this vicious circle and connect LDCs to the virtuous circle of productivity and growth. //////ONLINE shopping is growing rapidly in most developing and developed countries for obvious reasons.

Land-based activities around the aquatic ecosystem have a crucial effect on energy inputs to it. For proper functioning of an ecosystem, there must be a balance between inputs and use of energy. Exceptions to this would be damaging for both the ecosystems. //////
