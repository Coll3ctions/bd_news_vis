However, when I talked to an uncle from Chapainawabganj and heard how increased procurement price has encouraged his fellow farmers/producers to take farming seriously to produce more and not to keep an inch of farmland uncultivated. This also helped them towards optimum utilization of inputs such as fertilizer, seeds and pesticides. //////The ICC World Cup 2011 opening ceremony was an extravaganza of international standard. It gladdened the hearts of millions in Bangladesh. Barring few faux pas and an exercise in political branding it was a worthy show. The event management was done by a company from our neighbouring country, but even that cannot take away the sheen from the success of the show. It was an occasion for the nation to celebrate, and the government is obviously a part of it. //////Normally, I feel little affection for bombs.
