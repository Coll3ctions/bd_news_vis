They shared notes about the band's journey, inspiration and the contemporary music scenario in Kolkata. //////THIS scribe for quite some time has been venturing, apparently unsuccessfully, to impress upon the prime necessity of conducting credible and unbiased criminal investigation of all cases, particularly the nationally significant ones. As such, //////'s editorial premonition (April 16) about the lack of desirable progress in the Ramna Batamul blast case and other such incidents came as a vindication of the public concern of the unsatisfactory state of affairs in this regard.//////THE people of Dhaka are passing through a severe water crisis, which may become worse in the near future. Every year, we face this crisis and the situation, as it appears, is deteriorating. The Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) has admitted that it is beyond their capacity to overcome the crisis alone.//////BHOLA has a notorious tradition of holding violent and irregular elections. In 1997, hundreds of political workers were forced to leave their homes by ruling party cadres because of their allegiance to the party in opposition. In 2003, Brotee (a non-partisan election monitoring organisation) recorded 117 incidences of attack on workers and supporters of the party in opposition by the cadres of the ruling party. The people of Bhola live through this trauma during every election.//////Asociety with a democratic commitment evolves around the dynamics of a multi party system. It is a compelling necessity without which the system simply does not operate. Political parties evolve the programme of social reconstruction and the conduct of the state craft based on certain fundamental political beliefs.

He warned that another ten islands could be at risk. //////GREEN' issues are spearheading discussions on resource management, biodiversity and global warming, while the environmental problems known as 'Brown Agenda' have been neglected for a long time. Challenges in addressing and meeting the brown agenda in the cities have acquired prominence among the planning and development professionals around the world. It is well accepted that rapid urbanisation has aggravated problems like sanitation and drainage, solid waste management, degradation of soil and land, uncontrolled emissions from the domestic and industrial activities, street and abode congestions and improper disposal of hazardous waste resulting in poor health of people. Cities and towns have been hubs of economic development but how this economic development must be achieved in the first place? Do the rapid industrialisation, urbanisation and development of communication network add impetus to economic development at the cost of environment? //////You will certainly not believe any snowfall in Dhaka! But what about an icy river? And that even not in the winter, just in the month of April, 2010? In fact it is a common scene since long. And what about thinking of a north-bound river? You must be thinking something has gone wrong with me.//////Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, Somerset Maugham, Tom Stoppard, John Steinbeck, Aldous Huxley, William Faulkner, Pearl S. Buck, Agatha Christie and many other famous writers have used phrases from Shakespeare as titles for their works. Many writers throughout the world have been greatly influenced by the works of Shakespeare, and as a result, they have quoted him, particularly in the titles they have chosen. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men --- Falstaff's comment is a clue to knowing that Shakespeare's wit inspired others to write and the titles derived from his works reemphasize his greatness over all other writers.//////William Shakespeare is the most famous English dramatist and poet. His contemporary and rival playwright Ben Jonson wrote about him thus: He was not of an age, but for all time. Stephen Greenblatt, the editor of The Norton Shakespeare, writes, Indeed, so absolute is Shakespeare's achievement that he has himself come to seem like great creating nature: the common bond of humankind.//////Mathew Arnold paid the highest tribute to Shakespeare when he said in To Shakespeare, Others abide our question. Thou art free. Arnold's absolution of Shakespeare gives us a measure of the immense influence the Elizabethan bard wields centuries after his death. Again Shakespeare's unquestionable authority is reinforced when A.B. Aldrich heralds in 'King William': Yet 'twas the king of England's kings /The rest with all their pomps and trains / Are mouldered, half-remembered things---/'Tis he alone that lives and reigns!//////The concluding part of Raana Haider's Bargain Bin Books (the first part of which appeared last week) will be published next week.//////For more than 4,000 years, people have been fighting with Malaria. Still, the ancient disease remains the cause of 860,000 deaths every year. Drug resistant malaria, counterfeit anti-malarial drugs, inadequate testing and treatment facility made the fight difficult. It is the high time to shift from the traditional ways, to combat malaria and for counting it out. World Health Organisation (WHO) has published new guideline (2nd edition) for the treatment and procurement of anti-malarial drugs to make the battle successful.//////Health is not just absence of disease but it is a state of wellness in which a person enjoys physical, mental, social and spiritual health. Health is connected to the total well being of an individual. Apart form environmental and social factors, there are subtle factors that affect the health of a person. A clean and pure mind is a prerequisite for healthy life. A pure mind enables the use of time, energy and resources in the best way. Stress or negative thinking has been identified as a leading cause of quite a number of major illnesses.//////Six years after the insect killer DDT was globally outlawed on grounds of environmental damage, two researchers say there are new reasons for doubting the chemical is harmful and are urging its use against malaria.//////Diarrhoea is the most common clinical condition in hot atmosphere. Severe prolonged diarrhoea can lead to dehydration. With little precaution and safety measure we can manage the condition effectively.//////Our teeth become stained over time due to various food and also bacterial action. Other than stains, calculus (stones) develops due to food debris in the mouth and the build-up of calculus can cause gum swelling and infection. Scaling is done to remove calculus while polishing is to clean stains on tooth. This procedure helps keep the gum-tooth interface clean and healthy thus reducing the possibility of gum disease, swelling and bleeding.//////A brain implant made partly of silk can melt onto the surface of the brain, providing an "intimate" connection for recording signals, researchers reported recently.//////Eating a lot of sugar not only makes you fat. It may also increase a person's risk for heart disease, U.S. researchers said recently.//////BANGLADESH is not only a riverine country but also a maritime nation that opens to the south toward Indian Ocean through the Bay of Bengal. //////UNDERSTANDING Cold War international politics was easy. The world then was fairly evenly divided between the two Super Powers and smaller powers belonged to one of the two camps. There was of course a third camp of Non-Aligned countries but most of them too in one way or the other belonged to one of the two camps. One of the themes of relations among nations then was: the enemy's enemy is my friend. //////A top Iranian general said April 12 that the military's newly produced aerial drones, which have aroused U.S. concern, are capable of gathering intelligence and striking at targets.//////Taiwan has unveiled the first images of a high-tech missile corvette specifically designed to counter the threat of China acquiring an aircraft carrier, officials and media said April 12.

The Russian official said that the new warships were needed to replace vessels which have been in service for over 30 years and may soon not be fit for sea missions.//////Running a government, even if it is an interim one, is serious business. And writing about it is a good deal more, which is probably why not many who have had the chance of administering a government have generally opted to stay silent. In Bangladesh, where, constitutionally-ordained caretaker administrations have been the norm in pre-election times since 1990, Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed has clearly not been tempted to recount his experiences as head of the caretaker government following the fall of the Ershad regime in December 1990. But, yes, Justice Latifur Rahman, on whose watch the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-Jamaat e Islami combine triumphed at the October 2001 elections, did have his own story to relate. It did not make much of an impression. As for the future, one will simply need to wait for Fakhruddin Ahmed to enlighten the nation on the tumultuous times during which he presided over a return to parliamentary government in late 2008. Maybe he will come forth with his observations. Maybe he will not. It all depends.//////Professor Mozaffar Hossain, though not a very well acquainted literary figure, has been contributing enormously to the liberal arts in the last decade. A teacher of philosophy, Mozaffar Hossain's most praiseworthy book has been ////// that was published in 2008. Before that his translation from English into the Bangla of ////// by George Thomson, ////// by Thomas Hardy and Islam by Alfred Guillaume drew attention of a good part of the literati of the country. His recent book ////// an autobiographical work in nature, is also worth mentioning as a significant work. ////// is actually a research report composed by two eminent faculty members of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU), Dhaka, Prof. Mohammad Hossain Bhuiyan and Associate Prof. Dr. Md. Sekender Ali and published on the occasion of 25 years of Dipshikha, an international non-formal education, training, and research society for village development. The book contains data-based information with research findings and interpretations about the development activities rendered by Dipshikha during its 25 years of dedicated service to its client system, donor agencies and development workers. In 1984, Dipshikha took birth as a silent social movement from grassroots level initiated by some self-driven and self-motivated non-elites who ranged from school teachers to local leaders. Since its inception Dipshikha has been working with the least educated downtrodden people in the field of agriculture, education, health and sanitation, human rights and good governance and has succeeded in attaining significant achievement in the sector of socio-economic development in Bangladesh and elsewhere.//////
