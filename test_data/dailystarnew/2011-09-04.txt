A very well-equipped civilian population engaged in armed battles against the army for 6 months. It's evident, conceded in many cases, that France, UK and the USA armed civilians and parachuted weapons to rebel groups (The Guardian, UK, June 30, 2011) though Mr. Obama recently started denying it. NATO even provided naval support for the flank attack on Tripoli. I draw your attention to the 'legality' (or the lack thereof) of arming civilian populations - regardless the end. The actions violated the UN arms embargo on Libya, not to mention - the country's sovereignty. In this era of ends justifying means, international courts, laws and conventions will bend over backwards for the rich or well-represented nations. //////Confusions and concerns are increasingly growing over the use of various types of synthetic pharmaceutical drugs, not only because of their serious side effects but also, as experts say, often these drugs do not do any good to settle the symptom.

Perhaps all the diseases can be kept under control if the patient could be assured by some way that s/he has the capability to resist certain disease. //////With the growing population and importance of Dhanmondi for schools, colleges, universities, hospitals and offices, it has become essential to construct two bridges at road number 3 and 4 for smooth flow of traffic.

The proposed two bridges will make life much easier. The city corporation became totally inactive after the present government took charge of the country. DCC should consider this proposal.//////The other day I was enjoying the buffet offer at Pizza Hut. The feast was delicious as always. It was a treat from a junior student of my school.

In the midst of this surreal world, emerged the lovable magical characters -- Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasly -- exercising their supernatural powers to stop the evil Lord Voldemort from steering the world toward a path of devastation. As Harry, with the help of his wizard friends, hunted and destroyed Voldemort's holcruxes (objects where Voldemort stored parts of his tattered soul), the evil lord's face appeared unexpectedly -- angry and intimidating with two slits for a nose and a deadly snake trailing behind -- so close and so real that I almost darted out of the theater! //////Romulus Augustulus, last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, is deposed when Odoacer proclaims himself King of Italy, thus ending the Western Roman Empire.//////
