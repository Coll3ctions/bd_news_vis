Behind our house was the Jamaatkhana of the Bohras and the Goalpara Hindu slum. I was the eldest among three brothers and four sisters. My father was a dentist and my mother a Reader at the radio plus a social activist. Both were supporters of NAP (Bhashani). There were meetings at our place. Like the seniors I too participated in rallies and processions. J. M. Sen Hall was the hub. Motia Chowdhury used to stay with us at times when she was in Chittagong.//////The following morning I went to his (Tajuddin Ahmed's) Hare Road residence. Even before I had arrived, sitting on the second-storey verandah he had begun to go through the files. I sat down on a chair beside him. He was writing very intently in one file. After writing almost two pages, then reading through it and signing it, he began to call out "Lily, Lily," (Begum Zohra Tajuddin). When Mrs. Tajuddin emerged from the room he said to her, "That promotion case, I have okayed it." Mrs. Tajuddin responded, "You are the finance minister of Bangladesh, who you are going to promote or not promote in your ministry is entirely your business; what do I have to do with it?" Tajuddin began to laugh, and replied, "Lily, you are absolutely right, but you have a connection with this particular case and so I thought you should know." I listened to Tajuddin saheb and wondered what this possibly could mean. It was at this moment that Tajuddin, smiling broadly, pushed the file towards me.//////Even today I can smell corpses in the air,//////Even today I discern Death's naked dance in the soil,//////In my trance I still hear the whimper of a raped woman--//////Has this country forgotten that nightmare night, that bloody time?//////March 12 was World Glaucoma Day, the second day of its kind.

The aim of the day is to raise awareness of Glaucoma as a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide.//////After an especially active weekend of hiking or work around the yard, your osteoarthritis might cause pain despite taking your usual pain medication. So you turn to other ways of soothing your aching joints. Reluctant to pop another pill, some people make a run to the drugstore to pick up an over-the-counter joint cream that promises to dull the pain. But can these topical pain medications really offer arthritis pain relief? Here is a look at how topical pain medications work and whether they are a viable arthritis pain relief option.//////People who walk for exercise should aim for a pace of 100 steps per minute to ensure their workout is intense enough, according to researchers.//////A recent study estimates that eating eggs is not that dangerous for heart disease.

Some BDR soldiers (along with some suspected outsiders) carried out a massacre by killing more than 80 people including 72 BDR top brasses (deputed from army). The grisly incident once again proved how badly we manage our national security and how easily one can penetrate through the system. The whole nation mourned and was virtually at a stand still for a few days sensing much trouble in future. However, the situation is easing now. But that left some urgent questions that need to be paid attention to immediately. Although the government has formed an inquiry committee vis--vis allowing the army to enquire the event by its own, will it consider some very crucial geo-political equations in fixing the event? Given the nature of Bangladesh's geographical advantages almost splitting its big neighbor, which has an intention of emerging as a global power, Bangladesh, for many years, has been capitalized by many quarters indulging many extra-territorial activities. The reason, of course, is its unique geographical location which, in any case, can induce huge trouble to its big and ambitious neighbor. Therefore, the conflict of India with other nations can easily be stretched to Bangladeshi territory. And any conflict within Bangladesh can also easily have a link with the interests of many. The BDR carnage is no exception, rather the sophistication of the execution of the plan reminds us that the incident has a much deeper root.//////THE US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for the first time on 6th March following a decision on 5th March by NATO to resume relations between NATO and Russia. It broke off after the Georgia-Russia conflict in August 2008.//////With President Asif Ali Zardari bowing down to public anger, the fragile democracy in Pakistan has survived; it even promises now to grow despite the turbulence. The victory for the lawyers, judges and former PM Nawaz Sharif is decisive, but it will take time to settle the ruffled mood of the nation. Much depends on the synchronization of efforts by the judiciary, army and the political forces, in an environment of cultivated trust and responsibility. The forces threatening democracy and stability of the country are still spreading. The crisis is not between democracy and non-democracy; it is between the violent elements trying to obliterate Pakistan's existence through a civil war and the state institutions and political forces that can hold it together. //////The assassination of President Ziaur Rahman remains a mystery, like so many other mysteries before or since, even now. Precisely who planned to bump him off or what his enemies planned to do once he was out of the way has never been known. In his years in power, General Zia lived a life of danger, in two ways. In the first place, he was a danger to many around him, seeing that each time a coup attempt against him collapsed, he swiftly went into retribution mode. In the second, having survived as many as eighteen known plots to overthrow (and possibly kill) him, he succumbed to the nineteenth in May 1981 in Chittagong.//////Whoever said that the word 'classy' cannot be linked to Bangladeshi food will now have to eat his own words and apologise. Profusely! If you are dead then better come down and see how the word beautifully blends with food that is best savoured when eaten with the hands and not with forks and knives. Of course God will allow it! After all, this is indeed cuisine made for divinity. Shawkat Osman, a businessman and a gourmet, has given us a mouthwatering presentation of dishes and the book not a run of the mill cooking manual is good enough to grace your drawing room. No, it will not make you look shallow but you will show you up as one who is culturally inclined. //////The final journey of John Muir which he undertook just three years before his death is narrated in this book in inspiringly lyrical prose. The author, in a letter to one of his friends, said that God realized His ideas in his creation of nature which reveals itself both physically and spiritually. John Muir observed everything with scientific precision and made equally precise descriptions of them with amazing artistic excellence.//////We have received a letter from Mr. Maqsoodul Haque objecting to the contents of a review (The long tradition of Bengal mysticism) in the Star Books Review of 14 March 2009. We would like it to be noted that the review was based on the contents of the book in question. //////
