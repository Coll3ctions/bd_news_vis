As the first Bengali lawmaker in the Pakistan constituent assembly to demand the use of Bangla in the proceedings of the House in February 1948, he made it clear to the powers that be that ignoring the language of the majority population of the country could only lead to a complex situation. Intriguingly, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, who owed his seat in the assembly to the quota for East Bengal, rejected Dutta's suggestion out of hand. Among those who sided with the prime minister was Khwaja Nazimuddin, the Urdu-speaking chief minister of East Bengal. Nazimuddin even went to the extent of informing the House, falsely as it were, that most people of East Bengal thought Urdu ought to be the state language of Pakistan. //////President Zillur Rahman yesterday asked the army to fully follow the 'command channel' and always remain alert and watchful against any heinous move. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday called upon opposition leader Khaleda Zia to stop playing a suicidal game centring on the army and the caretaker government system in the name of movement. //////Troubled over heavy losses in the share market, a second stockmarket investor committed suicide in Chittagong yesterday.//////Misdeeds of assistant commissioners (land) across the country have ruined the reputation of the department, commented Land Secretary Md Mokhlesur Rahman at a workshop on vested property in the capital yesterday. //////The railway authorities knocked down around 500 illegal structures in an eviction drive along the two-kilometre rail track between Khilgaon and Malibagh in the city yesterday.//////Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda yesterday said free and fair parliamentary polls under a partisan government were possible if electoral laws were amended and some ministries and divisions were controlled by the EC during the elections.//////The High Court yesterday granted anticipatory bail for a month to 489 BNP-Jamaat leaders and activists from different districts in nine separate cases filed on charges of vandalising public property and obstructing police from discharging duties.//////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia appeared before a Dhaka court yesterday and received permanent bail in a case filed for abusing power in setting up Zia Charitable Trust.//////An executive magistrate on Wednesday denied the allegation made against him of ordering police to open fire on some protesters during Sunday's violence in the town that left two persons dead.//////At least 10 leaders and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League were injured in clashes between its two groups at the capital's Suhrawardi Udyan last night over setting up a stall at the Amar Ekushey Book Fair.//////Robert O Blake, the US assistant secretary of state for South and central Asian affairs, will arrive in Dhaka this month to hold meetings with government high-ups and opposition and civil society leaders.//////Leaders of the 14-party alliance have urged all, irrespective of party affiliations, to join the February 7 human chain to foil conspiracies against the ongoing war crimes trial.//////The High Court yesterday directed the government to find out people responsible for the publication of a school textbook with distorted history on the declaration of the country's independence and Liberation War in 1971. //////European Parliament Member Jean Lambert has welcomed Bangladesh's efforts to try war criminals and said he expected that the trial would conform to the highest standard possible.//////The three prosecution witnesses who were supposed to testify against Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delawar Hossain Sayedee yesterday went missing. //////Taliban militants armed with guns and grenades ambushed a police patrol in northwest Pakistan on Thursday, killing three officers and wounding another, police said.//////A woman in southern Vietnam has died after contracting the bird flu virus, health authorities said yesterday, in the country's second human death from the virulent disease in less than a month.//////The Finance Minister AMA Muhith has claimed that the crisis in the economy is not as bad as it was being portrayed by the media and civil society.//////A government order making attestation of all job documents pertaining to overseas employment by the Bangladeshi missions mandatory has taken effect from February 1.

In her speech she pointed out the government's successes. She claimed that law and order was better after her government had taken a tough stance against crime and corruption. Her observation was so preposterous that we were taken aback at that time. Since then one year has passed. Meanwhile, criminal activities have gone up. The prime minister and the home minister do not even acknowledge that criminal incidents are happening. Home Minister Sahara Khatun has said that law and order is better than ever before. How could she say such a thing when every day numerous incidents of robbery, looting, mugging, killing, abduction, rape, and arson are taking place, which are being reported in the print and electronic media.//////The recent circulation of a video footage, which showed a Bangladeshi being stripped, kicked and beaten by the BSF of India, aired by Indian TV channels, has sparked criticism across the country and abroad. At the same time, we have felt embarrassed at the speech delivered by LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam who said that the government is not "much worried" about the recent incident of physical abuse on a Bangladeshi citizen by BSF. While National Human Rights Commission of India has served a notice to the country's home ministry seeking a report on the BSF jawans who were videotaped in the act of assaulting a Bangladeshi youth, such insensitive remark from our minister is totally unacceptable. Despite repeated assurances from Indian authorities that BSF has been instructed to maintain the highest restraint while dealing with smugglers active at the border, such barbaric incidents are continuing unabated. It has to be kept in mind that the government is the a guardian of a country. It cannot ignore what is happening at the border. According to the newspapers, a number of lawmakers of parliament on January 24 have criticised the foreign ministry over its failure to address the issues for the sake of maintaining peace at the border. //////The quest for the elusive century of centuries in international cricket is being overshadowed by the closeness of the time for terminating his career! Seems like there is a race between these two deadlines! Like any long lasting talent, the end of the reign of Tendulkar, a superb batsman, is drawing near. The question provokes all cricket enthusiasts, and surely it is eating into the mind of Tedulkar too! Every sportsman reaches the end of his or her career, and Tendulkar is no exception to this final reality. Starting young, he has had a long and distinguished career in the international cricket arena, studded with high class performance, scoring many thousands of runs. Age is now naturally catching up with him, and the time is drawing near when he will take the final bow from international cricket! It will be the end of an epic chapter in the game. Tendulkar's name will go down in history with the immortals like Bradman, Hammond, Hutton, Pataudi and many others. He will be missed by the many cricket supporters across the world!//////Manholes in Dhaka city are found to be made in such a careless manner that most of these are lying - no matter whether these are on the main roads or small lanes - haphazardly. //////The way the radio jockeys (RJs) speak on radio is extremely disrespectful to our language. They neither speak English nor Bangla. Their language sounds dirty. I draw the attention of the ministry concerned to take immediate action to stop this nonsense. I must admire the ABC radio's exceptional role in this connection. I urge the managements of all FM radio stations, please show some respect to your language. We do not speak and so do not like to listen such a strange language (Banglish!) with an annoying accent.//////There is no doubt that Bangladesh has improved a lot compared to its past. 3000 megawatts of power have been added to our national grid.

Bangladesh has also made its first laptop DOEL. //////The government ministers were giving wrong information about BNP's rally in Dhaka on 29 January 2012. The government tried to brand the rally as a programme with 'evil intention'. The ruling party staged a counter demonstration in the city on the same day, which was nothing but a recipe for political clashes and violence. //////Scrapping of the caretaker government (CTG) system from the constitution was the most unexpected and unwarranted political development during the last three years of Awami League (AL)-led alliance govt. This abrupt and unilateral step ignoring the opinions of all other political parties as well as the general sentiment of the people, is now widely believed to be AL's ill-motivated political manoeuvre to stay in power by hook or by crook.//////Friends play an important role in the life of every man. The young ones socialize with their peers and are greatly influenced by them. A good friend can be a source of inspiration and encouragement and a helping hand in the time of need. But very unfortunately, we have witnessed some tragic incidents in recent times where a person intentionally became the cause of harm for his friend. The greed for money and material possession ripped apart the ties of supposed friendship and prompted one to threaten, hurt or even murder the other. A true friend would never even think of such hideous acts.//////Pakistan's top court yesterday summoned Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to appear February 13 to be indicted with contempt over his refusal to pursue corruption cases against the president.//////UN chief Ban Ki-moon faced angry protests as he visited Gaza yesterday, where he condemned rocket fire from the area and urged Israel to ease its blockade of the territory.//////Pakistan yesterday said it was willing to do whatever Afghans wanted to end 10 years of war with the Taliban, but insisted the process should not be led by the Americans or any other foreign power.//////Republican White House frontrunner Mitt Romney stumbled Wednesday after his big win in Florida, saying he was not concerned about "very poor" Americans -- a gaffe that earned sharp criticism.//////Donald Trump was to make a "major announcement" yesterday about the US presidential race, according to his aides, as media reports said he will endorse Newt Gingrich.//////More than 200 people were plucked from waters off Papua New Guinea yesterday after a ferry sank but many others remained missing, with rescuers scouring the area for further survivors.//////Heavy snow that has blanketed northern Japan for weeks, triggering avalanches and disrupting transport networks, has left at least 56 people dead, officials said yesterday.//////The United States plans to end its combat mission in Afghanistan in 2013 and shift to a training role, one year before most US troops are due to withdraw, Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said Wednesday.//////A self-guiding bullet that can steer itself towards its target is being developed for use by the US military.//////A Cairo court has sentenced Egyptian comedy giant Adel Imam to three months in jail for "defaming Islam" in several roles he played on stage and screen, the actor told AFP yesterday.//////Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday kickstarted her election campaign for UP polls from Deoria, slamming successive non-Congress governments in the state over the last 22 years for failing the common man.//////Launching her campaign to retain the crown in UP, Dalit queen Mayawati cautioned large crowds at her two rallies in Sitapur and Barabanki against Congress's "divide and rule" policy.//////Saudi Arabia yesterday beheaded a man convicted of murder in the kingdom's southwest, the interior ministry said.//////The Times newspaper is being investigated by British police over claims of hacking emails, reports said yesterday.//////Kuwaitis were casting ballots yesterday in a snap vote to elect the fourth parliament in less than six years, with pollsters predicting a solid victory for the Islamist-led opposition.//////In protest of the Central Government's proposal to levy service tax, which would increase costs, filmmakers have decided to go on strike.//////A Cairo court has sentenced Egyptian comedy giant Adel Imam to three months in jail for "defaming Islam" in several roles he played on stage and screen, the actor told AFP yesterday.//////Moinul Ahsan Saber is a seasoned author -- with 75 books to his name -- covering short stories, novel, literature for adolescents and translation.

One small investor committed suicide by hanging himself. Many times more must have died naturally during that week. Others died in road accidents, domestic violence and neighborhood brawls.

It was an alarming sign that another man's death doesn't diminish us anymore. //////The immigration crisis that has roiled American politics for decades has faded into history. Illegal immigration is shrinking to a trickle, if that, and will likely never return to the peak levels of 2000. Just as important, immigrants who arrived in the 1990s and settled here are assimilating in remarkable and unexpected ways.//////BBC Hardtalk on Wednesday featured Dr. Gene Sharp, a political theorist. He was introduced as "the man who has changed the world" or perhaps he can change the world. How?
