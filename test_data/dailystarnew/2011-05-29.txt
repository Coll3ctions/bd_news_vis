Many people in Pakistan are raising this question that if Washington can talk to Taliban then why not Islamabad? Fact is that Pakistan can start talks with their Taliban only if Afghan Taliban will start formal talks with US otherwise Washington can sabotage talks between Pakistan and Taliban anytime. Pakistan tried its level best to push Afghan Taliban for talks with US recently but till today there is no concrete outcome. Very few people in media know that neither the top leaders of Afghan Taliban nor the Pakistani Taliban are interested in talks right now with Kabul or Islamabad because they think that summer is not a talking season. This hot weather is always a fighting season for them. Afghan Taliban killed many US soldiers in last few days but US administration is still running after some people who can facilitate their peace talks with Taliban.//////As the errant bus operators keep charging extra fares from commuters, the communications minister yesterday once again warned the bus owners of tough action if anyone is found guilty of the offence.//////After conquering the Mount Everest, Bangladeshi mountaineer MA Muhit returned home yesterday. //////The condition of pop legend and freedom fighter Azam Khan, who is on life support in city's Square Hospital, remained unchanged yesterday. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the National Vitamin 'A' Plus campaign-2011 at her official residence Gono Bhaban yesterday morning.//////Eight more people have been diagnosed with anthrax in Shahjadpur and Ullahpara upazilas, civil surgeon of the district confirmed yesterday.//////BNP leaders are faulting the advisers to party Chairperson Khaleda Zia on her entourage for their failure to organise any meeting between Khaleda and high profile US policymaker Hillary Clinton. //////The food budget will be increased by 15 percent to Tk 8,400 crore from current Tk 7,287 crore in the next fiscal year with a distribution plan to control food prices through market intervention.//////The main opposition BNP is preparing a budget proposal which the party chairperson will reveal prior to the submission of the national budget in parliament on June 9. //////The police commander for northern Afghanistan was killed in a suicide bomb attack on Takhar province governor's office yesterday. //////The body of a Bangladeshi cattle trader, allegedly tortured to death by Indian Border Security Force (BSF), was found floating in Ichhamati River on Friday evening. //////A suicide bomber targeting a pro-government tribe yesterday killed at least eight people and wounded 11 others at a market in a restive Pakistani tribal area, officials said.//////It is just as well that the government has acted quickly on reports that a toxic ship sold as scrap and bought by an unknown person in Chittagong, by alerting all concerned to prevent its entry into our territory.

His capture ends a sixteen-year period in which the once swaggering Bosnian Serb general evaded the justice that was, and is, his due owing to the murder he organised of tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in the three-year period between 1992 and 1995.

Many people came to Dhaka from the rural areas in search of cash earnings as the rural settings miserably lack employment opportunities. Under the pressure of over population, Dhaka is rapidly moving towards bankruptcy in respect of housing, transport, water-supply, civic amenities and most importantly its environmental status. Perhaps it is the time when the government should attach special attention to generate employment opportunities in the rural setting by establishing agro-based small industries. At the same time, easy access of the farmers to cold-storage and marketing facilities has to be ensured for agricultural produces so that farmers may not sustain losses and lose interest in agricultural occupation.//////Once post offices were the only institutions we used to depend on for communication. In the past, post offices were always crowded with people. Now-a-days, our post offices give a reverse picture. Not many people are there. Only a few visit the place for sending official documents. This has happened only because of a sudden change in the communication technology that is widespread availability of cell phones and e-communications like e-mails, facebook, and also availability of courier services. Our post offices should now change their strategy. They should come out of their traditional services and timing. Post offices should now remain open on weekends and they should render some other services like collecting all utility bills, selling train tickets, banking, selling land revenue stamps, etc. We request the ministries and departments concerned to review these proposals and bring a big change to make our post offices profitable.//////It is known to all that the police force of a country is assigned with the arduous task of keeping the law and order situation at a tolerable level to ensure peace and stability. And to do so police have to go through lots of difficult situations. However, in return, what do they get? They don't get a better pay, comfortable place to live in, or better meals, let alone other promised benefits enjoyed by the officers. I was saddened while going through a local daily which gave a very sorry tale about the condition of low ranking police personnel. Government must take immediate actions to address their plight. If the police don't get enough to live a decent life, how will they perform their duties properly? Obviously, they will resort to other means to make some extra bucks. Our police force should also be adequately equipped with all required logistics to combat crimes effectively. //////On May 24, 2011, I listened to Israeli PM's speech telecast live by CNN. He was speaking to both the houses of congress about the peace plan with Palestine. But the Israeli Prime Minister did not budge from his stance, he rejected the idea of a Palestinian state to be created based on the borders that existed before 1967. He declared that Jerusalem must never be divided, it would remain the capital of Israel, there would be Israeli military presence along the Jordan river, in short, everything in favour of Israel. One can easily imagine the hold Israel has over the US.//////Two weeks ago my nephew who was a month premature, died in a renowned private hospital in Gulshan. Although his condition was improving he was given high antibiotic without our knowledge. As a result, he died the next day of kidney and lungs problem. Two weeks later, the same thing happened to another premature child. Is this what we get in return for paying high amounts of money to these hospitals for our treatment? I would request the authorities concerned to stop this brutality. If this carelessness goes on, we will not be able to trust any doctor.//////I was touched by the article published on 24th May in your daily that was so appreciative of the generosity of the Japanese to Bangladesh in the face of their problems, and, on the same page, the humorous article by Jamal Khan, about the chaos in a Bangladeshi public sector workplace. I think the best way of saying thank you to the Japanese for their donation for the building of the Padma Bridge is to be careful that the work is not spoilt by corruption. I heard that the British consultant for the building of the Pakshey (now the Lalon Shah) Bridge - also funded by the Japanese - got up at 2.00 am to check the quality of the cement going into the uprights//////I was pondering deeply on the issue of approving transit to India. No doubt that transit might appear as a blessing to the country's economy. But the question is whether appropriate infrastructure is available in our country or not. Transporting goods from the port towards north through Dhaka- Chittagong highway is the only option available to the govt. But the condition of the road is so dilapidated that this cannot take the huge load of traffic. Govt. must rethink on the issue prior to giving transit to India. Otherwise this will terminate into a mess. //////In Dhaka hundreds of high-rise buildings are being constructed. But there is no coordination of work and planning between WASA and RAJUK. As a result, the suffering of the people due to acute shortage of water knows no bound. It is reported that most of the owners/developers of the high-rise buildings have illegally installed water pump and connected those with the WASA water pipeline. These pumps divert the water from the WASA's pipeline to their buildings depriving the people of the surrounding buildings of water supply. Would WASA and the authorities concerned kindly look into the matter and take disciplinary action against the dishonest persons and employees of WASA?//////Mohammad Ali Sattar's well written article titled 'A party in disarray', published in your pages on 24th May describes BNP's lack of political outlook and policy. They are only interested in "winning election and ministerial seats". //////The students vomiting the most amount of information get the best results, under the current Bangla medium education system. It doesn't matter if the person's analytical ability or his reasoning power is poor, because he can memorize and reproduce well. These types of students, in my experience, get the shock of their lives in the university levels. Every good university in Bangladesh has an education system based on reasoning and analyzing, case studies, journals, presentations. These students can't present, can't analyze, can't reason, and suddenly, they are completely lost. It is not their fault that they are lost, but it is the fault of the system. Let's be humans, not robots. //////I would like to remind the honorable PM that one of the pledges made by her party before the election was to create job opportunities for at least one member of every family. Obviously, young people were inspired by this pledge and cast their votes in favour of change, but in vain. It is reported that 35 thousand first class non-cadre gazetted posts are vacant in different ministries. But it is a matter of frustration that only 300 out of 2700 candidates of 28th BCS were appointed before the final result of 29th BCS was published. We hope the honorable PM would immediately intervene to solve this problem.//////Santu Larma's organization PCJSS (signed in the Peace Treaty of 1997) is blamed for killing 4 UPDF (raising objection to the Peace Treaty) men including its central leader Animesh Chakma. We have learnt from local media reports that the incident might be a result of ongoing conflict and rivalry between the activists of the United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) and Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS). //////I wrote in this column of DS several times in the past about why BNP is boycotting parliament. Finally Moudud Ahmed has come out with the main reason, because the BNP leadership failed to convince the media, other political parties and our intellectuals. All are blaming the government for failing to bring the opposition in the parliament. According to the intellectuals, it is the duty of the government to bring them in and make parliament functional, as if the opposition has no responsibility to attend voluntarily. Now the time has come for the government to make the parliament functional by withdrawing four cases against Khaleda Zia. The government should act quickly but with conditions as the New York court has done to Kahn, the IMF boss. The government does not need to compel the BNP leadership to wear monitoring devices. But Khaleda should vow that she will not demand withdrawal of cases against her sons and other top leaders like Moudud, Sirker, Abbas and many others. //////Campus violence has become a common issue these days. It has increased the sufferings of the students. I urge the political leaders of our country to take immediate steps so that students can never become victims of politics.//////University is the highest institution of education where students get access to the world of excellence in terms of humanity and professionalism. Students come here to make themselves enlightened. But it is very appalling that in some universities, in the name of 'ragging', the newcomers are tortured by their seniors! Of late, a leading daily reported that freshers at Chittagong Marine Academy were severely tortured by the seniors. The level of torture was so high that some of the students were admitted to the emergency units of the hospitals with acute physical and mental problems. Some of them even died! Though ragging is prohibited, this is going on unabated!//////Egypt yesterday reopened its Rafah border crossing with Gaza, allowing people to cross freely for the first time in four years, in a move hailed by Hamas but criticised by Israel.//////Nepal's ruling parties were locked in 11th-hour negotiations to try to avert a fresh political crisis yesterday, with hours to go before parliament's term expires.//////Nato carried out fresh bombing raids at the heart of Tripoli's regime yesterday, the military alliance said after G8 world powers intensified the pressure on Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi to go.//////Top Pakistani military officials are concerned that their ranks have been penetrated by Islamists aiding militants in a campaign against the state, The Washington Post reported late Friday.//////An informal ceasefire between President Ali Abdullah Saleh's security forces and a tribal group brought a pause in fighting yesterday after nearly a week of deadly clashes left Yemen near civil war.//////Osama bin Laden considered seeking a deal with Pakistan under which al-Qaeda leaders in the country would be protected and, in return, al-Qaeda would refrain from attacking Pakistan, a US official told CNN Friday.//////South Sudan's vice president flew to Khartoum yesterday on a mission to "ease tensions" over Abyei, one week after northern troops overran the contested border region, a southern official said.//////Serbia vowed yesterday to track down those who helped Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic evade justice for so long, as fresh details emerged of his arrest after 16 years on the run.//////Syrian security forces shot dead 12 demonstrators on Friday during protests against Baath Party rule that erupted in 91 locations across Syria, the Syrian National Organisation for Human Rights said.//////The death toll from one of the worst tornadoes ever to hit the United States has risen to 132 as crews continued to search the rubble for survivors and victims.//////Defence Minister AK Antony said it would be difficult to have permanent cooperation in IndoPak relations without Islamabad dismantling terrorist camps functioning in Pakistan.//////An Egyptian court yesterday fined ousted President Hosni Mubarak and two former officials $90.64 million for cutting off mobile and internet services during January protests, a court source said.//////US President Barack Obama has reaffirmed relations between the US and Poland yesterday, as his six-day tour of Europe drew to a close.//////Suzanne al-Houby, a Palestinian who lives in the United Arab Emirates, has become the first Arab woman to scale Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.//////A local court here yesterday issued non-bailable warrant against actor Sanjay Dutt for not appearing before it in connection with a violation of model code of conduct case lodged during last Lok Sabha elections.//////Interpol has issued a worldwide alert yesterday for 417 fugitives of an Afghan jailbreak, including Taliban considered "a major threat to global security."//////Two British soldiers were killed by a homemade bomb while on patrol in southern Afghanistan, defence officials in London said yesterday.//////Moscow police yesterday detained three prominent global gay rights leaders as violence broke out at an unprecedented rally that activists tried to stage near the Kremlin wall.//////The national celebration marking poet Kazi Nazrul Islam's 112th birth anniversary began at the Nazrul Mancha (stage) at Darirampur in Trishal here on May 25.

Jatiya Lok-Sahitya Sangraha and Gabeshona Kendra (an organisation that collects and conducts research on folklore and rural traditions) organised the festival to observe the birth anniversary of National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.//////Rabindranath Tagore is reputed for his extensive repertoire of short stories in his unmistakeably lyrical prose. A ghost story that makes ones hair stand on end seems far from Tagore's ambit. The Hungry Stones (Khudhito Pashan), written in 1895, is a notable exception. Recently dramatised readings with a multi-media presentation of The Hungry Stones were presented at the Indian International Centre in New Delhi.//////Noted Indian actor Irrfan Khan is likely to play the role of Grameen Bank founder Dr. Muhammad Yunus in a film on the Nobel Peace Prize winner, being made by Italian director Marco Amenta, media reports here said.//////It is forty years since the birth of Bangladesh.

From a non-existent industrial base it has moved to a country which produces much of its essential consumer items.//////The rich are, as was well said, different from you and I: they have more money. In India, they have more lawyers. Does this mean that they are also more guilty? The law must take its course; no argument about that. What happens, however, when law becomes part of the public discourse?//////Is there any particular reason for the return Ma'am?" I heard the salesman ask. Turning around I noticed a young woman at the cash register with a bag full of clothes she wished to return. This is not an unusual sight in a store in America -- everyday people bring back merchandise that they want to exchange or return. However, what struck me was the insouciance with which the woman shrugged her shoulders and responded: "I've changed my mind -- don't want them any more." The sales representative patiently scanned the item tags, punched the required information in the register, and the transaction was completed in less than five minutes!//////Since 2003, United Nations (UN) has been observing "International Day for UN Peacekeepers" on May 29 every year. The purpose of this day is two-fold; one, to honour the memory of UN peacekeepers who lost their lives in the cause of peace; two, to pay tribute to all men and women who have served and continue to serve in the UN Peacekeeping Operations (UNPKO) for their high level of professionalism, dedication and courage. //////The weather is already warming up as Bangladeshis start preparing for a long, sweltering summer.
