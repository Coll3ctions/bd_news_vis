The EC made it clear in the draft that if any candidate attempts to hide or give false information about personal records or election expenditure, his/her election results will be cancelled and the seat will be declared vacant. There will be provision for holding re-election for that seat at a later date. The other pertinent point is that political parties will also face cancellation of registration for failing to submit an authentic election expenditure record of the party and individual candidates. Here we find the provision of outright cancellation a bit severe, and feel a system of issuing a first warning and then suspension for a specific period could be introduced. If a party failed for the third time to come up with the accounts, EC will then take the final decision regarding cancellation of registration. Nevertheless, we strongly hold the view that these are some of the basic tenets without which no credible election can be held. //////The call by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for a top-level task force to address the issue of the spiraling cost of food worldwide is precisely the kind of co-ordinated global action that is necessary at this precarious moment in history, and could not have come at a better time.//////Quite often we refer to certain countries in Southeast Asia as 'emerging tigers'. Their economies and their progressive economic development are analysed and extolled for their performance. Such an approach also draws our attention not only to the manner in which such countries identified the weaknesses within their development paradigm but also how such measures to overcome challenges subsequently facilitated foreign direct investment.//////The philosophy behind penology consists of the following elements: deterrence, retribution and reformation. We may refer to the Holy Quran's Surah Al-Bakara - A178/179 wherein Allah ordains 'Kesas', which 'ensures security to life'. If one would fathom the depth of its deeper meaning one will realize that it essentially points towards 'deterrence through retribution' which is likely to reduce the recurrence of crime, particularly, the heinous ones and ensure security to life.//////The escalating violence in the country is frightening. Still more frightening is the shape it is taking. Somewhere it has turned communal, somewhere regional and somewhere ideological. Whatever the direction, it indicates a trend where the rule of law is lessening and where the use of force is gaining legitimacy. //////The employees of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) spent a very panicky May Day due to a rumour that the newly elected executive committee has asked all the staff to resign.//////Russel Hassan Rony slotted the first hattrick of the Green Delta Insurance Premier Hockey League as Abahani brushed aside Bangladesh Sporting Club 7-0 at the at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////The national football team left Dhaka for Kyrgyzstan capital Bishkek yesterday morning to take part in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers.//////A crushing 182-run defeat at the hands of India gave Bangladesh women's cricket team their first real taste of international cricket in their opening Asia Cup match at Welegedara Stadium in Kurunegala yesterday.//////Shamsur Rahman staved off the disciplined Pakistan Cricket Academy bowling attack to ensure GP-BCB National Cricket Academy (NCA) were still batting after the end of the first day in the second four-day match at the Rajshahi Divisional Stadium yesterday.//////Defending champions Bangladesh Ansar led the NCC Bank 32nd National Cycling Championships medal table with seven gold after the second day's competition at the Paltan Maidan yesterday.//////Bangladesh Under-15 cricket team's campaign ended when they Pakistan beat them by six wickets in the semifinal at the Clico International Under-15 Cricket Championship at La Sagesse Park in Grenada on Thursday.//////Grandmaster Ziaur Rahman defeated Debaraj Chatterjee in the 11th round of the 34th National Chess Championship yesterday to stay atop the points table.//////There were plenty of star batsmen on show but the two best innings of an absorbing encounter came from two youngsters.

'All the King's men' might be Kolkata's advertising tagline, referring to team owner Shah Rukh Khan, but here it was a more apt description of Shane Warne and his team. His decision to bat first -- allowing his bowlers respite from the Jaipur heat -- was justified by attacking half-centuries from debutant Swapnil Asnodkar and Yusuf Pathan, and disciplined bowling by the Rajasthan quicks.//////Zenit St Petersburg booked their first UEFA Cup final place in Manchester on May 14 after out-classing Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with a 4-0 rout in Russia on Thursday night.//////Manchester United and Chelsea, who already have a date in the Champions League final to determine continental bragging rights, first must settle the matter of domestic dominance this weekend entering the final strait of a thrilling English Premiership season.//////Didier Drogba sent Chelsea to their first Champions League final and got revenge on Rafa Benitez as his double strike clinched a 3-2 win against Liverpool in Wednesday's semifinal second leg.//////The champagne is on ice for Real Madrid as they travel to Osasuna this Sunday knowing a win would secure a 31st championship with three games to spare.//////Plucky Rangers reached the UEFA Cup final after a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over Fiorentina in the semifinal second leg here on Thursday.//////Mark Viduka is to have an injection to help him recover from a niggling Achilles problem but will not require full-scale surgery, Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan revealed on Friday.//////Joe Cole on Thursday hailed teammate Frank Lampard after the England midfielder's penalty helped Chelsea to reach their first ever Champions League final.//////Cristiano Ronaldo been voted footballer of the year by English Football Writers' Association, completing a double after receiving the same accolade from his professional peers last week.//////German international midfielder Bernd Schneider has lost his battle to be fit for Euro 2008 after undergoing a back operation, the German Football Federation (DFB) announced on Friday.//////Andrew Flintoff could make his Test comeback as part of a four-man attack against New Zealand at Lord's on May 15, after England's captain, Michael Vaughan, told The Times that he was in favour of throwing his allrounder back into international cricket as a No. 7 batsman and out-and-out strike bowler.//////Gautam Gambhir and Shikhar Dhawan laid out the carpet and Glenn McGrath, returning the best figures in the IPL's brief history, walked over it as the Delhi Daredevils got themselves back on track after a blip in their last game. It wasn't a comfortable win, as the Bangalore Royal Challengers kept them to 191 for 5 when 205 seemed an easy total and later when Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid threatened to chase it down, but another choke from the visiting side - who for the third game running left Misbahul Haq on the bench - put Delhi at second in the points table.//////The Indian Premier League is yet to finalise its position on barring Shoaib Akhtar, the banned Pakistan fast bowler, from playing in the inaugural season of the tournament.//////Sachin Tendulkar is one step closer to getting fit.

Curiously enough, a good number of such impassioned advocates of freedom and liberty were conspicuously quiet when the very durability of our democratic polity became doubtful in the not-too-distant past.//////Alleging corrupt practice in higher education, Dr. Akbar Ali Khan's call to introduce a rating system for universities hit the headlines recently (DS April 26). Any reference to corruption is explosive substance -- and rightly so -- especially when the education system is concerned. //////SME has been considered as the thrust sector in the economic development of the country with growing importance from all walks of life. It is evident that, substantial increase in SME and Retail Credit portfolios along with commercial, corporate and institutional lending, would lead the banks to its higher trajectory of growth, minimizing the risk of lending through portfolio diversification. As such, most of the banks have taken up aggressive marketing policy to augment their exposure in SME and Retail Credit. Though SME concept is nothing new, as evident from the establishment of Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), but a fresh look into and endeavour to boosting the sector are still imperative. Bangladesh Bank re-finance scheme for SME is laudable. The role of IFC-SEDF for creating awareness among the entrepreneurs and banks/NBFIs to be more focused in SME deserve appreciation.//////It is common knowledge in Bangladesh that our forests have been decimated in recent decades. Less apparent than the loss of forests is the loss of other goods and services that forests provide particularly to the neighbouring poor people whose well being and livelihoods depend on these forests.//////To all intents and purposes, the Kyoto Protocol is dead, and unless urgent action is taken its successor, the Copenhagen process, may turn out to be dead on arrival or comatose. Kyoto never delivered reductions of CO2 emissions, but still binds 174 nations until 2012. Meanwhile, global greenhouse gas emissions have steadily increased since the reference year of 1990. //////Halku came into the house and said to his wife, The moneylender's man has come. Give him the money we have; let's get him off our backs.//////My relocating to Brooklyn in 2003 was the result of an abrupt decision. My expectations were not too high and neither did I have much enthusiasm. But on the bright side what if I had to move to someplace like Albuquerque or Idaho? What would my life be like then? At the time I needed a change. I had graduated with a degree in computer science and gotten a so-so job at Time Warner Cable. Like any American I started to pay my student loan, $20,000 that the federal student loan program had given the City University of New York. I also managed to save enough money to buy a 3-year-old silver Ford Taurus, which in course of time became my companion for many occasions. //////One of the oft-told stories about Premchand, considered the greatest fiction writer in Hindi, is of a literary seminar organised in Patna. Premchand was to preside over it. He was to arrive a day before the seminar. A number of people came to the railway station to meet his train, but as it happened, none of them had met the author before. They only had a photograph to go by.//////Darkness descends//////In a limitless, soundless stream://////A hushed-blood, tired western sky,//////Above the parched tuberose//////Evening's stunned laughter.//////With the rise of temperature in summer, the incidences of heat-related illness increase significantly to rush into hospitals. The scorching heat can beat our body leading to heatstroke, gastro-enteritis, diarrhoea, water borne diseases like typhoid, jaundice, skin diseases, eye injuries, lethargy and loss of appetite. With a little precaution and appropriate measures, we can remain proactive, heal and hearty during summer.//////Whenever we think about health we usually think of three 'D'  Disease, Doctor and Drug. In other words we think of hospitals and doctors' chamber. But this perception is only half of what healthcare is all about. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), health is a complete state of physical, mental, social and spiritual well being and not merely the absence of disease or disability.//////Exercise will not cut the risk of heart disease in those who are overweight unless they also slim down, according to a study of thousands of U.S. women published on Monday.//////An excessive noise level is a general threat to health and well-being. Although loud sounds like thunder storm are part of nature, in recent times big cities have become chronically very noisy. Even the towns are increasingly noisy.//////Mr Syedur Rahman, lecturer of a private college in Sylhet was worried about the health of his mother Anowara Khatun, a house wife staying at Rajshahi and suffering from severe pain in the joints of her legs and back. Though it is a relatively common problem among the older ladies of our country, he could not arrange any consultation with a physician for her mother due to the distance between Sylhet and Rajshahi.//////An Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) task force urges drug companies should be banned from offering giveaways to doctors, staff, and students at medical institutions, reports the New York Times.//////I once sat in a high profile meeting when the country had an elected government as a Director General in the Foreign Ministry. Those who attended that meeting were the Ministers of Foreign and Home Affairs with their respective Secretary and top level representatives of civil and military intelligence. Security issues were on top of the agenda of that meeting. I was astonished to learn at that meeting that on crucial national security issues, the Foreign Minister was in total darkness and that intelligence available to the military was unknown to the civil intelligence. At the Home Ministry, what the Secretary knew was not in his Minister's knowledge. Since that strange meeting, I always felt Bangladesh needed a National Security Council for a professional and transparent way to deal with national security and intelligence issues that are vital for formulating the country's foreign and defense policies.//////Islam is being invariably associated with terrorism both in media as well as in political circles, especially in Western countries. When they hear it being condemned by Muslim theologians, it is celebrated as something unusual. It is strange irony of both misunderstanding and motivated propaganda that if a small band of Osama's followers give call for jihad, it is taken as authentic Islamic call and if it is condemned by mainstream Islamic theologians, it is accepted with mixed feelings of celebration and skepticism. The mainstream condemnation of terrorism is somehow not accepted with conviction.//////South Korea will buy 21 fighter jets from Boeing by 2012, bringing to 61 the total number of its next-generation fighters, the defence ministry said April 25.//////Although not unprecedented, yet ////// assuredly is rather unique in the sense of its being the product of a research work carried out systematically and that in turn attains academic standard as a thesis. The book raises a number of questions, diagnoses the malaise that has been eating into the vitals of our film industry, in particular since the 1980s. Once the diagnosis is made correctly, etiology is determined and thus very confidently the writers come up with a prescription to be administered to cure the ills of the disease prevalent in the films that are there. //////The first question that would possibly pop up in one's mind even before one starts reading ////// is why Tarquin Hall wanted to write a book on Brick Lane. But, then, when you begin reading the book, you will discover the fact that the writer must have felt passionately about the whole of the East End neighbourhood. His ////// is an honest account of what led Tarquin to be in Brick Lane and what happened once he was there.//////Zaitoon, a young girl of sixteen, is going to the hilly regions to be married to a tribal whom her father has chosen for her. She has been brought up by Qasim since the partition of India in 1947. As the British fled the country after ruling for over 200 years, they sowed the seeds of communalism. The Muslims and the Hindus have since been rivals. There were riots in every part of the subcontinent in order to make it their respective strongholds. No one knew which part would belong to whom even till the last minute while the country was being demographically changed. Lahore, a stronghold of the wealthy Hindus, was supposed to become part of India. But it went to Pakistan. Jullander, Sikh territory, was allocated to India. Qasim flees from Jullander; on the same train travel Sikander and Zohra with their two children from Ludhiana. When the train reaches Lahore men squatting on both sides torch the train and kill as many people as they can. Munni loses her parents and holds on to Qasim, who finds solace in holding a child who reminds him of his lost one. After that they live as father and daughter.//////The Bangla terms 'darshan' and 'darshonic' imply very grave meanings which are related to philosophy and philosophers respectively. The inner meanings of these terms are comparatively clear to students and teachers of philosophy. Ordinary men's understanding of them is of course rather different, perhaps even difficult. And yet ordinary people can understand 'darshan' easily when it means 'to look at' or 'to see'. But a 'seer' or 'onlooker' cannot be a 'darshonic' in any sense. The author of the well-known, notable prize-winning book ////// has rightly claimed himself as an onlooker of the birth and death of Pakistan and also as an expositor of the philosophy of its birth and death in light of the traditional socio-political history of our subcontinent.//////
