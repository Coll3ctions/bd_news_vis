I am a student of 3rd year of the English department. My session is 2007-2008. This year we were supposed to have appeared in the Honours final exam but still we are waiting for our 3rd year final exam to be held. What is the reason behind this situation at the NU? Classes are not held regularly; teachers are busy with private tuition at home; exam papers are not examined in given time; and results are also not published in time. To our utter surprise, teachers give more importance to money making and considers education a commodity. Have they forgotten that teaching is a noble profession? //////Recently the World Bank revealed a survey report that says 80 pc farmers are using mobile phone to get direct entrance in the market. Our farmers do not get proper price of their products. So it is encouraging that farmers are realising the importance of electronic devices in marketing their goods. But experts indicate that this is not enough to reduce the differences the prices of agricultural commodities between field level and the market. To change this situation, the government needs to adopt a holistic business model. Storage, transportation and food processing facilities should be improved. The government should also continue to provide power and fertilisers subsidies to the farmers.//////Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the major killer diseases in this century.

In the South East Asian region, especially in India, Thailand and Myanmar, a high number of people are carrying HIV virus. A large number of Bangladeshis are working in the Middle East and Africa. Many of us are frequently travelling in highly positive areas including our neighbouring countries. //////According to a report of the daily Prothom Alo of 22nd July, 100,000 MRP passports have been rejected by the Department of Immigration and Passport. It is very sad that 2,080 MRPs were stolen from the concerned department. How could this happen? Who were involved in this? Have the authorities identified them and taken proper steps against them? To remove the hassles of the innocent applicants, the list of rejected MRPs should be published in the newspapers as early as possible. At the same time, the perpetrators must be identified and punished. //////Maybe Bangladesh is the only Muslim country in the world where police have to take special security measures to prevent criminal activities during the month of Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitr. From the July 20, 2012 issue of The Daily Star we learned that Dhaka Metropolitan Police is stepping up its security system.//////Being tolerant is good. Letting people take advantage of you is not. And that's exactly what we are guilty of. We, the people of Bangladesh, turn a blind eye to every other flaw that appears in our daily life. It's almost like we like to suffer, silently. Every year we let our beloved utility providers dig up the roads, and somehow it's always the rainy season when it's easier to misappropriate funds, and no one has the power to do anything. The roads of the capital city are full of potholes. Disgraceful, but we can't care enough to react. Kitchen market prices have increased beyond the reach of even the middle class families, but what can we do? The government's attempt to reduce the prices of essential commodities or the CNG fares has been nothing more than just an attempt of misdirection. And the best part is, it works. I look around, and I see no one doing anything. What happened? Did all the courageous souls die in the War of Independence, leaving just pathetic citizens behind?//////The whole nation is still mourning the death of Humayun Ahmed, an author, dramatist, screenwriter, playwright and filmmaker. Some noted writers of West Bengal have also expressed their deep shock over the death of our great writer. Sunil Gangopaddhay said: I can not think that my friend is no more in this world, he (Humayun Ahmed) had a mastery over all the spheres of literature. His death is an irreparable loss to Bangla literature. Famous writer Samaresh Majumder has said that the contribution of Humayun Ahmed in Bangla literature would remain alive for decades. His supervisor got very surprised to know about his command over literature while he was doing his Ph.D in polymer chemistry in North Dakota State University in US. Apart from his literary works, I am also impressed with his great dream of building a cancer hospital and an institution like Shantiniketan. His dreams remained unfulfilled in his lifetime. But I think all the fans of Humayun Ahmed, his relatives and the government should come forward and make all out efforts to translate his great dreams into reality.//////Every local daily has published the disastrous power grid failure leading to blackout all over India. In some locations, power failure has been catastrophic. The sad part was that when about forty percent of power was restored, the supply grid failure happened again! All this misery happened during the hot Indian summer, when naturally electric power demand is at the highest. Compared to that, we should consider ourselves lucky. Despite our outdated, lame and limping power generation equipment, we have thankfully been spared such disasters now occurring in India. Fortunately, we have been spared any large scale electric power blackouts due to technical failure.//////On July 20, 2012, a very painful and tragic incident took place during a midnight show of Christopher Nolan's super hit film "The Dark Knight Rises" wherein a gunman wearing a gas mask opened fire inside a theatre in Aurora, Colorado. Twelve movie-goers were killed and more than 58 injured during the indiscriminate shooting. //////Stephen Sackur interviewed our prime minister for the BBC Hardtalk. At the end part of the interview he suggested that the prime minister should leave the stage for new. We think a foreign journalist cannot give such a suggestion to an elected prime minister of a sovereign country in an interview. Mind that she is elected by the people. It is a gross violation of etiquette. We, the Bangladeshi people, may disagree with our prime minister on many policy matters, but after all she is our elected prime minister. Her dignity is our nation's dignity which must not be hurt.//////Grameen Bank//////International envoy Kofi Annan is stepping down, UN chief Ban Ki-moon announced yesterday "with deep regret," as his April peace plan for Syria in tatters in the face of raging violence.//////The mother of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is lobbying Ecuador to grant him asylum, says she is worried her son could face execution if extradited to the United States.//////Afghan security forces killed five insurgents and wounded one during a pre-dawn raid in Kabul yesterday, with authorities saying they had thwarted a mass attack and captured intelligence pointing to the militant Haqqani network.//////Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi swore in a new cabinet yesterday that retained military chief Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi as defence minister while giving the Islamists and their allies several portfolios.//////Afghanistan's finance minister will be investigated after large amounts of money were found to have been deposited into his bank account and transferred abroad, the nation's anti-corruption chief said yesterday.//////A teenager has been arrested after killing eight people and wounding five others in a knife attack in northeast China, state media reported yesterday.//////The US commander in Afghanistan yesterday said that "significant progress" was being made in improving cooperation with Pakistan, after his first visit since Islamabad ended a blockade on Nato supplies.//////Regional powers are pouring in money and guns, jihadists are joining rebels battling to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, while his own well-armed but hard-pressed forces are fighting back ruthlessly with combat aircraft and artillery.//////Drilling of the seabed off Antarctica has revealed that rainforest grew on the frozen continent 52 million years ago, scientists said yesterday, warning it could be ice-free again within decades.//////Facebook has revealed that it believes there are now more than 83 million fake users on the social network.//////Tens of thousands of flood-hit North Korean families urgently need clean drinking water to prevent disease outbreaks, UN agencies yesterday said. //////Federal anti-terror agents joined local police in the western Indian city of Pune yesterday to probe a series of low-intensity blasts the night before when the new home minister had been due to visit.//////Beijing reacted furiously Wednesday to new US sanctions imposed on a Chinese bank over transactions with Iran, urging Washington to revoke them and saying it would lodge an official protest.//////Typhoon Saola pounded Taiwan with fierce winds and torrential rain that left six people dead and forced nearly the entire island to shut down yesterday, rescuers and media said.//////Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's popularity has plummeted to its lowest point since his election in 2009 after he pushed through a series of tough austerity measures, a poll showed yesterday.//////Police in southern Spain arrested three suspected al-Qaeda members in possession of explosives and poison, Spanish media yesterday said.//////After a hiatus, noted artist Ranjit Das is holding a solo painting exhibition.

There is Gyankosh where a gift such as a doll or a book or paint box set maybe bought at a reasonable price. A gift has to be liked. It should be useful. It doesn't have to be expensive.

The first one is from our finance minister, who, in his staccato style of cryptic delivery in a stentorian voice, meant to say either that Syed Abul Hossain, former ICT minister, who was also former communication minister, had stepped down or succumbed to the pressure to quit his job. If brevity is the soul of wit, our finance minister is amazing at times. He can be brief even in his wit and soul.//////By the time this article appears it is possible, though not certain, that President Assad's heavily armed forces will have re-established control of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city and its commercial and economic hub.//////Sheikh Hasina born to political adversity and growing up through a hostile environment appears to have an uncanny ability to brave and tackle tough encounters. //////It's been just over a month since Google officially announced the latest version of Android operating system code named Jelly Bean.
