Going by BGMEA counts, life is worth one lakh taka or less than 2,000 dollars. In an industry where only a few manufacturers meet the minimal required amenities for workers while the rest pay no heed to these needs, quoting such numbers is rather ironic to say the least.

About 60 percent of solar radiation, mostly in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, gets through to the surface and heats the Earth. The Earth emits, in turn, infrared radiation. But the opacity of the atmosphere to infrared radiation reduces the heat loss and makes the surface warmer than it would be if the radiation could escape freely. This kind of trapping of infrared radiation by transparent glasses warms an actual greenhouse, and hence it earned the moniker greenhouse effect. //////Conservatives are less likely to accept the reality of human-caused climate science when presented with supporting scientific evidence.
