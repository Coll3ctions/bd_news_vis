It is a reality which has always been felt keenly during the period around and on Eid. As a report in this newspaper makes clear, innumerable citizens (and they are almost all in the lower income category) suffered during the festival holidays because of an acute absence of doctors and other medical personnel in the hospitals. Given that public services are always a twenty-four hour job, arrangements should have been in place to handle patients during the holidays. Is there any mechanism to ensure this?//////THE local government bodies tasked with registering the birth and issuing certificates for it are facing a big challenge ahead. That is because they have only a few months in their hand to complete the job by June 2010.//////EUROPEAN ministers warned that December's landmark UN climate talks could fail, as the EU Commission urged rich nations to stump up tens of billions of euros to help the developing world combat global warming. //////IN the Philippines, any act at undermining manpower export is considered an act of treason against the state with specific penal provisions. Moreover, their president allocates a particular day every year to be personally present at the airport to see-off and receive expatriates. Such a gesture of honor shows the importance the Philippines, a role model to other sending countries, attaches to migrant workers. No wonder, they net about $16 billion in yearly remittance with foreign currency reserve settled around $35 billion. Just compare this with our $10 billion remittance and reserve of $8 billion. It signifies the difference in importance each country attaches to this golden goose of its economy.//////THAT inimitable 20th century intellectual and sleuth Hercule Poirot listed an unforgivable sin in his moral code: overlooking the obvious. The media dust storm over that hobgoblin, austerity, stimulated surely by low TV ratings as much as by high-mindedness, has obscured the most obvious of questions.

mark both the physiography of the nation and the life of the people. Nearly 700 in number, these rivers generally flow south. The larger rivers serve as the main source of water for cultivation and as the principal arteries of commercial transportation. Rivers also provide fish, an important source of protein. Flooding of the rivers during the monsoon season causes enormous hardship and hinders development, but fresh deposits of rich silt replenish the fertile but overworked soil. The rivers also drain excess monsoon rainfall into the Bay of Bengal. Thus, the great river system is at the same time the country's principal resource and its greatest hazard.//////The world lost one of the 20th century's true heroes last Saturday with the death, at 93, of agricultural visionary Norman Borlaug - a seed scientist who forcefully closed the gap between theory and practice, Borlaug is widely and justly known as "the father of the Green Revolution."

Nobody denies that Borlaug's work saved hundreds of millions of lives.//////A few days ago DSE decided not to allow any private company to offload their shares through direct listing method with the reasons not explained. The move is dubious. Through direct listing the companies with good market image and healthy books of accounts can be benefited for their goodwill. This method also denies the wrongdoings of the gamblers in the guise of so called investors. Why should the DSE want these monsters to eat away the premium of the goodwill the companies have created through diligence and endeavour of their skilled workforce. A good financial analyst with acumen can see the prowling gamblers in the trading floors of the stock exchanges.//////The custom of giving and accepting dowry is mostly found in the rural parts of Bangladesh. Here, some families demand dowry based on the money spent for rearing up a bridegroom! //////My previous letter on the subject was a knee-jerk and totally sentimental reaction on the proliferation of the Nijhum Deer, given my lifelong concern for our forests and wildlife. Dr Reza Khan has done an admirable job (DS 12 Sept) in putting the issue in its correct perspective given the present conditions, while mine were at least 40-50 years old. Actually I was influenced by a recent documentary in the National Geographic which depicted a South African couple who reared a pair of tiger cubs on their sprawling farm, cared for them, trained them to hunt and within 2-3 years gradually released them into the wild. Five years later they were flourishing with a family. Imagine wild Bengal tigers in Africa, when this magnificent creature faces decimation in its own homeland!!! //////The difference between the two is heaven and earth. About 80% of the city dwellers do not have any idea about the provincial capital Dacca. Months ago I came back to Dhaka from Houston, Texas. It is said that Sugarland is heaven on earth. I do not think it will be out of place to mention Sugarland is what Dacca used to be 40 years ago. Dhaka has gone back many years behind Dacca. The decline began 40 years ago and is still on.//////Heavily loaded trucks plying throughout the night has become a headache for the residents of the road from Sutrapur to Postagola, one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city.//////O dear! Life has been glued to the bituminous surface of Dhaka? Not really they are dancing along the road a waltz, or at times samba or hip hop.//////Soon after taking over as commerce minister, Faruk Khan issued confusing statements about the role of TCB. He said TCB would have no role in the market and after a few days he stated that it would have a role! Probably, he intended to appease the businessmen with this statement. It is now apparent that this did not work since the price of sugar is now Tk 70 per kg! //////Possibly every local daily, English or Bangla, published on September 14, the statement of the law secretary that he was responsible for unlawful sacking of the two judges. //////The hand writing of the quack deed writers was a problem for the people in the past. The quacks don't have enough knowledge of land laws. Also, they do not know the latest rules and regulations of land registration system, but they have established their supremacy in the land registration office. //////Mr. Elahi's (DS 16th September, 2009) point - that no one but the tax payer of a foreign diplomat stationed anywhere has a right to question how the former spend the latter's money - is moot given that I never raised it. My concern is about the use of SUVs by international agencies and abuse of traffic laws and disruption of flow by diplomatic vehicles by blocking busy roads and travelling in an armed convoy as though they were very important state officials of the country. While the diplomats may not be the root cause of the traffic problem, by their apparent misbehaviour, isn't it obvious that they are not helping? //////Income Tax & Value Added Tax (VAT) of a business is assessed on the basis of sale or turnover. This is unbelievable but believe it that in Bangladesh the sale or turnover of a business is always assessed twice by two different govt. departments & the sale or turnover figure assessed by the two departments for the same business is always different! This funny thing is happening because Income Tax & VAT are assessed by income tax & customs department respectively and there is no co-ordination between the two departments. As a result, a businessman is harassed twice for the same business, which is completely unnecessary. //////Your second editorial entitled "The Baul's Passing" published on 14 September seemed to contain certain factual mistakes. You wrote "Education, a difficult proposition for him considering his state of penury, stopped when he was informed by the school authorities that pupils were expected to serve in the First World War. One looking for peace of the soul could not indulge in the horror of war. Karim never went back to school." Karim, the Baul Samrat, was born in 1916, during the First World War (1914-1918). He was two years old when the WWI ended. As such a suckling baby of his age was not expected to enrol in the school! //////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.

Everyone makes mistakes, whether in public or at home; some guilt remain while often some wrongdoings are unintentional. The story of this play is based on such errors that we make and their outcomes. It is about the lessons learnt and those yet to be acknowledged.//////LACK of finance is identified as one of the main problems for the poor farmers in investing in agriculture in Bangladesh. It was also found in a study that farmers used their own savings in cultivation along with money borrowed from others (money lenders) on interest. The interest rate is generally 10% for every month. Another source of investment is credit, which is received in terms of input from the traders. The interest is built-in into the sales price of inputs used in cultivation. For example, seeds can be purchased on credit at a higher price. Farmers pay back the amount after selling their products. //////DEMOCRATS swept to power in the US hustings of 2008 promising change, Liberals won a landslide victory after 54 years in Japan assuring change, the slogan of change helped Awami League to win in Bangladesh, and in India Congress used the "change card" effectively to route BJP while in Nepal change has demolished the 150 years old monarchy to install democracy (thankfully). //////MY friend candy so gave up her job as an accountant to focus on raising her three little boys (or four, if you count her husband). //////
