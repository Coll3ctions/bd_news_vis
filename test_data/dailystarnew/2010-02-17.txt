And that is only natural, for like any other society around the world, we expect our legislature to be the repository of our hopes and our aspirations and all our dreams about the future. We expect, as people in other nations expect of their lawmakers, that the men and women we send to the Jatiya Sangsad to speak for us will rise above self, above party, above vitriolics through prioritising the myriad issues we face in our poverty-driven society. There are some particular reasons why, especially where the present JS is concerned, our expectations are a lot bigger and higher than on previous occasions.

We do not disagree with him. In a land where for the better part of its independent existence conspiratorial politics has been the norm, it would be nave to expect that those who have so long wielded authority and who today are outside the pale of power will rest easy in their discomfort. Not after the execution of five of Bangabandhu's assassins can you expect that those who patronised them for as long as twenty one years, maybe more than that stretch of time, will be happy at this remarkable opportunity for us to return to rule of law. //////IT was in 2004 that the Orange Revolution took place in Ukraine in the form of a pro-Western and anti-Kremlin movement.

I started my career in an international organisation and then I joined the BCS health cadre. During this long 19 years, I found a number of idle service rules. The most debatable one is Senior Scale Exam. During the BNP regime, they exempted the health officials from departmental examination and foundation training for confirmation of the job up to 10th BCS, and this time, those who got the auto-confirmation are going to get a promotion without appearing in the Senior Scale Exam.

He told his beloved mother that he was tired of living abroad and this time he would stay back. //////I am trying to write something with a dampened heart. My heart is dampened but my wrath gushes forth. Every death is heart-rending but deaths caused by fellow human-shaped animals are thousand times more so. One soul has just passed away. His soul is just out of his body but it is intact. It is intact to curse us, curse all the people of this country forever. We are all responsible for this death. We are all active participants in this murder. Neither I, nor anyone else, can shrug off the responsibility of this heinous homicide.//////I am writing to you after reading a story reported in The Daily Star on 24 January 2010 about the case of a 16 year old girl who was lashed 101 times after becoming pregnant through being raped.
