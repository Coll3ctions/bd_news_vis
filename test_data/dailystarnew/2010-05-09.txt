We are happy too that police officers have been told to act professionally, that a failure to do so will result in disciplinary action against them. On the face of it, everything seems to be in order. The reality, however, is quite different. It has to do with the political culture that has developed, insidiously, in this country over a long period of time. We have a situation these days where many among the political classes, especially those who ascend to power at given periods, blur the distinction between the party and the government and, again, between the government and the state. That is a perfect instance of myopia. And in our present conditions, it has led to the menace today typified by the Chhatra League.//////THE front-page photograph of a taxicab crushed between two passenger buses that appeared in this daily on Saturday speaks a thousand words of the horrendous situation prevailing on the roads.

Innovation is the key to success of all countries and research is the stepping stone to innovation. A pro-research government would mean a lot in terms of solving existing problems and impediments and creating the environment for research and innovation. One of the major hurdles obstructing agricultural and medical research in the country is the rule of procurement of research perishables and chemicals as well as equipment. Another is the lack of multidisciplinary approaches for solving a problem. For example, molecular sciences like Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology are contributing in a big way to Medicine, Agriculture as well as Industry. It is the true partnership between these sciences that will lead to major milestones in improving Health and Agriculture for prosperity of the country.//////Stephen Hawking, the scientific authority of our generation, has advised us to avoid trying to seek out aliens from space.

It was a saga of exploitation, butchery and inhumanity shown by these adventurers and subsequent settlers.//////In Delhi city itself, they have power cuts for six hours daily. A country with such high record of development has a serious power shortage still in rural areas as well big cities like Kolkata even. However, it is going to export power to Bangladesh. Bangladesh exports rice and vegetables and huge quantity of fish to the mid eastern countries when we are having shortage of it. The seven sisters of India have power that they can export but it is more expensive for them to pass it to far away states of theirs where there is shortage than Bangladesh which is adjacent to them. And believe it or not, the reality is this that Yangon has only two hours of power daily. The situation is horrible in Pakistan too and in some provinces they do not have power for days particularly in northern part but that is mainly due to the political situation prevailing over there.//////The 16th Saarc summit was over with note of good hope as usual. Now the most critical time is coming for implementation. Let us wait as usual and see what is achieved. It is very difficult to guess the role the BNP might play to enhance the status of Saarc said to be the brainchild of the former president Ziaur Rahman when they would assume power again. //////The decision of the present govt. regarding the ACC in the cabinet meeting in presence of the prime minister has made the ACC inactive, like in the past regime before the caretaker govt. of 2007. Again it is proved that it is nothing but a constitutional body having no power to launch an anti-corruption drive. However, it is true that the role played by the ACC after coming to power in 2007 was quite controversial. The ACC had filed many cases against many politicians as well industrialists and businessmen as a part of the anti corruption drive following the set of rules to uproot corruption from the country. But it was quite impossible to solve this problem overnight because this had prevailed since the inception of Bangladesh. //////M.J. Akbar's write up, in your pages, on IPL's financial misdeeds, is the dirty 'tail' of the tale which finally emerged! Very much like the old saying: "You can fool all the people for some time, and some people for all the time, but not all the people for all the time!" It was time out for IPL and their towering 'six' of a financial deal was caught at the boundary by agile fielders of the 'tax' team!//////Three types of moving vehicles use different types of sirens for emergency use: the Police; the Fire Brigade; and the Ambulance services.

In Bangladesh, the air is rich in water vapour. Sunlight and water vapour for CSP to produce electricity are available and it may be more efficient for solar power. Solar power had the potential to provide over 1,000 times total world energy consumption in 2008, though it provided only 0.02% . The largest solar power plant in the world is the solar thermal plants producing 354 MW but recently multi-megawatt photovoltaic plants have been built. The 46 MW Moura photovoltaic power station in Portugal and the 40 MW Waldpolenz Solar Park in Germany are large photovoltaic power stations. Recently, scientists proposed much larger ones, such as the 100 MW Fort Peck Solar Farm, the 550 MW Topaz Solar Farm, and the 600 MW Rancho Cielo Solar Farm.//////I am not sure about the Islamic schools like madrasas etc, where the young learners are imparted the knowledge of their role model or not, besides memorizing the Holy Koran.

May I bring to your notice that contrary to the news that only one private university maintains online databases, there are many other private universities which subscribe numerous electronic/online journals and books and have access to latest electronic resources. //////The Indian government seems to be determined to go ahead with the mammoth national river linking project (NRLP) to link 14 Himalayan rivers in the north and 16 peninsular rivers in the south of India without consulting co-riparian nations, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. This displays total disregard for international norms and treaties by India. They also appear to be indifferent to the disastrous consequences of the project on the northern and north-eastern states of India. Experts opine that connecting the peninsular rivers to the Himalayan rivers would alter the natural drainage system of the entire region with severe adverse consequences. The proposed 40,000 km long inland waterways will also cause massive human displacement. India's well known environmentalist Dr. Vandana Shiva thinks that no serious study has been done on the river linking project. The project has the potential to cause irreparable ecological and environmental damage including loss of biodiversity and wildlife and may also trigger seismic tremors.//////We have come to learn that Biman plans to favour a group of pilots aged about 57 by keeping them on contract basis for its Boeing 777 and the obsolete DC 10 aircraft, violating its agreement with BAPA and depriving the regular pilots.//////Thailand's government warned protesters yesterday that more violence could erupt if the entrenched demonstrations that have paralysed areas of the capital for nearly two months did not end soon.//////Some 1,000 protestors staged a noisy rally outside a meeting of Britain's third-placed Liberal Democrat party yesterday, pressing them to insist on voting reform in tense power-sharing talks.//////Thousands of people rallied in southwestern Japan yesterday to protest against a government plan to move part of an unpopular US airbase to Kagoshima prefecture.//////The massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may cause cancer and other health hazards, a US-based environment watchdog has warned.//////Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has welcomed a proposal for new talks with Western powers over his country's nuclear programme, possibly in Turkey, media reported late Friday.//////Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas secured the approval yesterday of the Palestine Liberation Organisation for indirect peace talks with Israel, despite opposition from several factions.//////Ahead of Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi's visit here on Monday, 36 Tamils from Sri Lanka have been detained and questioned to know how they reached Kerala, an official said Saturday.//////Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, endorsed his relevant details in the form for the 2011 census.//////Former Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf has said that he will contest the country's next general elections even if mid-term polls are announced.//////Four Palestinians were injured and four others went missing yesterday when a smuggling tunnel on the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt collapsed, medics said.//////North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il told Chinese President Hu Jintao relations between the two nations will not be changed by the "replacement of one generation by a new one," KCNA reported yesterday.//////King Juan Carlos of Spain is undergoing surgery to remove a growth from a lung, the Royal Palace said yesterday.//////Markets reopened for business, vehicles returned to the streets and some banks allowed customers to withdraw cash in Nepal yesterday after the former communist rebels ended their debilitating general strike after six days.//////Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has warned Pakistan of unspecified "severe consequences" if it can be linked to a successful extremist attack on the US.//////The Taliban yesterday announced a new nationwide campaign of attacks in Afghanistan, as President Hamid Karzai prepared for talks with US leaders on his embattled country's future.//////At least 52 people were killed and scores injured by heavy rains lashing northern India over the past two days, which have destroyed homes, reports quoting police said yesterday.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai said yesterday that the United States and its allies still have a long way to go before their security operations are successful in his country. //////Myanmar's junta is likely to let US envoy Kurt Campbell meet detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, paving the way for him to visit the country next week, an official told AFP yesterday.//////Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit's security has been stepped up after the police got an anonymous call stating her life was in danger.

In his songs, drama, fiction and other creative work, he has always upheld the heritage of the subcontinent. Yet in painting he did not follow traditions.
