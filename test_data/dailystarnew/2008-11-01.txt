The latter's piece has the virtue of brevity, yet is interesting for its take on three of Manik's most well-known characters, Hirombo of ////// (1935), Shashi in ////// (1936) and Rajkumar of ////// (1942). It is Hasan Azizul Haq's article, however, that is the most interesting as it analyzes Manik's writing in the greater context of Bengali writing of that period, as well as assesses the specific characteristics which made, and still does, him a unique and widely read writer. In passing he also relates how an editor, confronted with an extract to be published from the novel-in-progress, probably recognized the merit of the writing and wisely advised much to the good of Bengali literature - the author to publish it as a novel. Ali Anwar's piece, written with considerable scholarship and titled //////' is a meditative piece on the poet's broodings on death, mortality and 'existential angst'. //////He is one of India's best known writers, gifted with a light, versatile pen, producing an astonishing array of writing in nearly all genres for nearly fifty years.

Especially Russia is vehemently opposing the plan. Although the US claims that the shield will be a deterrent to North Korea and Iran, there are many in the world who believe otherwise. Justification of these dissidents' opinions is very much crucial given the present global geo-political situation. Because, over the last few years, the US has initiated a new war the War on Terror throughout the world. The first victim of this war was Afghanistan and then Iraq. Now, everyone is looking for the next: who's next? Iran? Is this war to protect the US (or the world) from terrorism and maintain global peace and security or to expand the US military grip to gain strategic dominance against other rivals?//////India is gradually showing signs of military assertiveness as it is becoming an economic power. //////NATO has launched its first anti-piracy mission off Somalia after one of its warships successfully escorted a cargo ship to the port of Mogadishu, the alliance's chief said Oct. 27.//////India's autonomous Auditing Agency found glaring gaps in the country's air-defense system.//////Following Pakistani tradition, President Asif Ali Zardari made his first state visit to China from 14-17 October.

The addition of the third certainly constricts its appeal to them, limiting it to the interest and need of a select group of readers comprising students, scholars and researchers of socio-cultural anthropology, South Asian history and gender studies. Viewing it from a broader perspective, one can as well discern elements of cross-cultural and comparative studies on the functioning of the family as the mainstay of a society taken collectively where it plays the role of a society in microcosm.//////The murder of Ahsanullah Master in May 2004 followed a pattern that had been set in the mid 1970s. It was the continuation of a trend through which popular, nationalist politicians were systematically done away with, with the result that Bangladesh was left serially deprived of the men and women who could have done it much good in terms of providing purposeful political leadership. And where the matter was specifically one of Ahsanullah Master, the man was a dedicated soul, with honesty being a hallmark of his entire political career. //////It is an unusual novel. Five apparently unconnected chapters without a conventional story make the subtitle, 'A novel in five sections.' And when you start going through the story, two things happen: first, the narrator and the writer seem to be one; second, some magical writing takes you through an extraordinary journey of living in a foreign land in order to develop the mind of a 'writer.' The novel has been called a 'thinly veiled autobiography'. The veil is obviously woven by braiding two parallel stories together. The fictional story is about an Edwardian Manor House involving the writer as its tenant, its employees and other people living in its valley. The autobiographical story, on the other hand, is a reflective narration of the writer's gaining an 'artistic' vision amidst the 'Enigma of Arrival.' //////A more beautiful story of a boy growing up into a man could not have come up.The story of David Harper, a boy born with passion for love and learning, captivates the mind. This saga is capable of holding the reader spellbound and has one smiling and crying for the gripping plot-developments and the real life characters. The story, taking place in Buck County, Pennsylvania, also comes up with beautiful scenic descriptions with intriguing details. Once into the book, the reader seems to be with a wonderful friend who is whispering about divine wisdom and the secrets of life.//////
