That sounds like a decisive move and we hope it is. We are also enthused by the idea of the administration taking those who have been developing housing projects illegally through encroaching on the Buriganga, Turag and Balu rivers to task. Now, such moves are clearly reflective of public concern on everything that has been happening to our canals and rivers, a worry which has for a long time been reflected in editorial comments and even judicial moves. Obviously, the grabbing which has gone on where canals and rivers are concerned has had grave ramifications for the environment, not to say a clear disrespect for the law on the part of those responsible. Now that the district administration has resolved to recover such lost public property, we hope the enterprise succeeds. For that to happen, the authorities must take into account the recent High Court directive regarding a demarcation of rivers in a concrete manner and ensure that the recovered canals and rivers are protected by green zones around them.//////In a matter of three minutes yesterday afternoon, the rampant Kolkata Knight Riders swooped on Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan in the auction of the India Premier League held in Bangalore.//////Naeem Islam's unbeaten half-century steered Gazi Tank to a five-wicket win over Surjo Tarun while Old DOHS beat Prime Doleshwar by 37 runs in yesterday's Premier League encounters.//////Indian batsman Gautam Gambhir was snapped up for a record $2.4 million on Saturday's first day of bidding at the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction for players.////// How did it feel when you heard that you would play the 1999 World Cup?//////Jamie Siddons placed the onus on the competing batsmen ahead of the Tigers' World Cup training camp that begins today with 23 players.//////The local organising committee (LOC) of the World Cup confirmed yesterday that the tickets of Bangladesh's matches against India and England have already been sold out at all the branches of the designated bank outlets.//////Saint Joseph's High School pounded AK International School 7-0 in their Ashiyan City Dhaka Metropolis School Football tie at the Abahani Club Ground yesterday.

On Thursday the dollar steadied after surging the previous day on strong US private sector jobs data, but investors were reluctant to chase the greenback higher ahead of Friday's payrolls numbers. A string of robust US data have driven the dollar higher on expectations that the world's largest economy would recovery faster than other major economies. The ADP jobs report on Wednesday showed a record 297,000 private-sector jobs were created in December, boosting expectations for Friday's official jobs report. US factory and services sectors' data this week has also buoyed the greenback. The ADP report drove the dollar's 1.5-percent gain versus the yen on Wednesday, its biggest one-day rise in three months, although dollar-selling by Japanese exporters tempered gains. By 1011 GMT, it was down 0.2 pct on the day at 83.09 yen. The single currency got a slight boost after Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that China was willing to buy about 6 billion euros of Spanish government debt. The market gave little reaction to data showing that euro zone economic sentiment jumped in December while retail sales fell in November. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, as steady at 80.341, a sharp turnaround from last week's 78.775 trough. Even then, the dollar's gains could be limited unless the data changes expectations for the US Federal Reserve to keep its quantitative easing in place through June.//////Criminals killed a trader and

None was arrested as those were found in an abandoned condition, he added.//////Our per capita land is seriously scarce. Therefore, we must always be extra cautious, smart and innovative in planning and taking up projects that involve huge land mass. Case in point is the proposed Bangabandhu City and Airport. The project is needed and is really grand in its scale. But do we have so much of land mass to go ahead? I am not against having an airport with future needs. But I strongly feel we are simply rushing to 'launch' such programme. Local people are apprehensive about its impact on their life and economy. They do not see any good in mass displacement and local culture is likely to be disturbed. Worst of all, most of the land lost to the mega project will be arable land. Farmers will lose their livelihood and a lot of crops will be lost as a result. We can not forget how important is our food security, when every hour there are new mouths to be fed!//////This vital matter was very rightly taken up in a front page news report published in a local English daily on December 29th. It is a cause for worry, that no prompt positive action is being taken to expedite the important matter of issuing letter of intent and sign the agreement for setting up four already government approved power plants. As stated in the report, Summit Group and GE Energy &Associates have been selected by the cabinet committee for purchase, to set up three power plants for generating 1350MW of power, while a Malaysian Group is to set up one rated at 150 to 225 MW in Bhola. //////The article published in The Daily Star on December 29, 2010 entitled 'Finance minister on traffic congestion' has rightfully identified the true nature of our country.

One of the main reasons behind this victory was the immense corruption of the BNP-led 4 party alliance, of which the countrymen were informed by the media and some other watchdog organizations like TIB. When the AL-led grand alliance spoke against corruption before the election, we thought they would really do something to eradicate corruption. But of late, comments of some ministers of the government regarding TIB's annual report have raised a question in my mind whether they really want to do anything to curb corruption. Why are they (some ministers who seemingly want to be jack of all trades) so eager to talk to media about each and every issue?//////I don't think restricting cars to ply the Dhaka streets is practical without creating first class and safe public transportation in the city. The present state of public transportation is highly unsafe, unhygienic and very unappealing.//////To arrest the rising trend of rice price the government has started OMS of rice.

Unfortunately, especially after Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Muslims are stereotyped as extremists, fundamentalists, fascists, terrorists and suicide bombers.

Muslim anger is also fueled by the deaths of over a million Iraqis following the US invasion and Washington's support for Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, and the ongoing US occupation of Iraq, Afghanistan and other Muslim countries. //////The style of governance has changed for the worse (compared to the British era).

At that time, I never imagined that one day microcredit would give rise to its own breed of loan sharks.//////President Hue Jintao of China is visiting Washington this month to meet with President Obama.

It was, of course, adulatory in tone and some copies were available in bookstores in Dhaka. Taseer was a bright young man at the time and showed promise of a scholarly career in writing. Those who observed Pakistan at that point imagined that Taseer and others like him, all of whom were engaged in their many ways in the struggle against the Zia brutality, would someday transform Pakistan into a liberal state, well away from the sordid military-civilian bureaucratic complex it had become trapped in despite the loss of East Pakistan in 1971.//////MANY people think murdering their parents is a bad thing.
