the forthcoming local government polls is clearly discernible. What is very heartening in this dynamics is the predominant voice of the people at the local level that seems to have prevailed over that of the central leadership in so far as participation in the election is concerned. Their enthusiasm and interest, so manifest in the submission of nomination papers for the four city corporations and nine municipalities, is very encouraging indeed. //////Though nursing is considered the integral part of the health care system and given top priority by the authorities in the developed countries, it nonetheless gets a second-class treatment in Bangladesh. The prevailing ills in this sector have come under discussion many a time but nothing tangible has been done so far to improve the situation. Among the nagging problems that need to be addressed immediately by the relevant authorities are: lack of adequate number of nurses, poor quality training, lack of motivation, improper attitude and low salary. With these discouraging factors abounding, one can hardly expect anything better than ordinary ward boys and girls doing the work of a trained nurse, such as, changing bandages off the chest of a burn patient. //////Even Bill Gates, who built a huge business empire from nothing, Microsoft, retired on June 27.

They are smiling, hugging one another, giving pose for the next day's newspaper and doing everything that suits the occasion. The print media and the electronic media rendered highest attention to holding the moments of unfathomable joy of the glorious victors who passed out successfully the first public exam of their life. The readers and viewers came to know the secrets of the triumphant students how many hours they spent for studying, to whom they are indebted most--in every detail. The story of success of some impecunious students-- who refused to bow down to poverty because of their unquenchable thirst for knowledge--attains the fairy tale flavour.//////At the 'National Dialogue on Democratic Transition' held at Kashem Mahbub High School Auditorium recently, the Chief Adviser said his government would extend all cooperation to the Election Commission to ensure that the elections are free from the influence of black money and muscle power.

The gradual association of the major political parties in the pilot local council elections is making the EC and the government very nervous The nation has watched the extensive ' dour jhap' of the EC and the government to obtain the support and participation of the major political parties in the ensuing polls. Now they are gradually engaging in the right direction, and the EC is very nervous about it. Why? Is it because of the hard conditions given by the major political parties which might destroy their castle of cards built during the last 18 months? The government is perhaps also very nervous at the progress of the event politically.//////I refer to the DS editorial on 30-06-08 on the Dhaka college incident and the paper's expected sanity of the students. A few days earlier I wrote another letter under the caption "Accident and vandalism " which was published in the DS. In fact, vandalism on the spot of any sort of accident has become a culture in our society. If following an accident, near a garment factory, or near an educational institution or on the highway, the people nearby start rushing in like bees and vandalise other incoming vehicles, how can we live? //////Earning money and politics are, as the dictionary suggests, two different things. One suggests the money earned for livelihood, and the other the way of ruling a state or the art of governance. But in our country's perspective, they are closely related. In the developed countries, the number of people living on politics is very few. People do politics for the welfare of the country and its people. They don't depend on politics for their livelihood. It is neither their means of living, nor profession. But here many people, directly or indirectly, have adopted politics as the single means of earning. They are running business enterprises and controlling tenders and all such activities in government offices. They are working under the aegis of political leaders. The more these leaders create opportunities for their party's supporters and activists, the greater the number of party men .//////Would you disbelieve me if I don't give any reference and statistics but say that in our colleges there are not enough seats to accommodate all the SSC students who pass from the science group? Would you disbelieve me if I say that there are not enough seats in our universities to accommodate all the HSC students who passed from the science group? There are not enough jobs in our research organisations and industries to provide jobs to a large chunk of science graduates who finish their studies in universities, let alone to all? These jobs are not attractive enough to attract meritorious science graduates.//////We thank the author of "I don't care, I'm leaving facebook". He has represented an important issue with some good points. We also felt just like the way he felt about facebook. But he raised some questions about privacy and irritation. He is right, but we have our views from a different perspective. If someone is interested about us, it's not tough to collect personal information, and one is not bound to keep them on facebook. So, it's depending upon the individuals to keep their privacy. And it's true that applications, invitations and requests are irritating. But they are easy to avoid! In spite of these problems, facebook is really a great way of our social network. If I find all my old school and college friends on the same platform, why won't I like it? Really, facebook resembles the 'face' of one in the digital world. If we cannot control ourselves, can we save our times from being wasted only leaving facebook? Actually, we care to be with facebook!//////The government has decided to increase the individual level of income tax ceiling from 150,000 to 165,000 to help people, considering the present cost of living. But it looks funny and it seems the government is joking with the countless suffering masses of Bangladesh. Because this insignificant increase does not make any meaningful difference, compared to the present state of country's economy and cost of living. That means a person earning Tk.13,750 and cannot afford to maintain his family with this poor amount of money is bound to pay income tax. What a ridiculous decision! This level of increase is not at all in line with the government increase of prices in other sectors and increase of cost of living. Recently, the government has increased its selling price of CNG from Tk 2.47 to Tk 9.97 per unit, that is more than 4 times higher than the previous price. The price of essential commodities, including rice, has increased nearly 100% during the last one year. But the income of the general people did not increase more than 10%. Under such a dangerous market situation, how far is it justifiable to increase the income tax ceiling by only Tk.15,000? //////I strongly appreciate the words of the TIB Trustee Board Chairman. He pointed at the level of corruption in the NGOs in Bangladesh. It is true and can be found easily among the top ranked NGOs of Bangladesh. Some of them are making the poor community poorer in the name of development of their (beneficiaries) livelihoods by administering a high interest rate on loans/the so called micro-credit. The neo literate and illiterate people, especially the rural women, are being targeted and any inability in paying back the loans results in their assets being seized. There have been many signs of such narrow trades in the NGO sector, but it is impossible to stop or treat the top level NGOs with the same effect of anti-corruption law in Bangladesh. Because holding them under a chart of corruption would create a problem within the investment sector of Bangladesh, since NGOs have a huge presence and range in the development sector.//////I noticed the circular for appointment of "Food Inspectors'' from Khaddo Odhidoptor in the daily Ittefaq on June 6.Initially, this gave me a great pleasure because I'm a student of Applied Nutrition & Food Tech & obviously this is absolutely Food & Nutrition based service. Unexpectedly, I was surprised by what was written in the qualification category. The required qualification was that students doing graduation with honours in any subject could apply for this post!//////It is a matter of great regret that about 20% of the owners of garment industries still don't pay the minimum salary to the workers. But the workers are the biggest contributors to this sector. Why should they be victimised? It is now quite impossible for them to cope with the present situation as prices of essentials are well out of their reach. It's their legal right to get this salary, as the owners had assured them earlier. //////Every day thousands of people are receiving proper and excellent medical treatment in Dhaka.

It's really puzzling when we see that 52,500 students obtained GPA 5, with all the students of some city schools getting the highest grade.
