The sacrifices through which Imam Hussein (RA) and his followers saw their lives come to an end on the battlefields of Karbala hundreds of years ago were fundamentally proof once again that martyrdom in defence of faith is a supreme act of nobility. The grandson of the Holy Prophet of Islam (Peace Be Upon Him) has, through his valour and through his refusal to submit before the brute forces led by Yazid, imparted the important lesson that it is the moral responsibility of anyone confronted with gross and manifest injustice to engage in a battle that has as its goal the triumph of good. In Karbala, it was patently an epic struggle between good and evil. Imam Hussein (RA) and his followers, rather than give in to the sinister forces typified by Yazid and his gang of usurpers, happily went down the path of supreme sacrifice.//////IT is shocking that workers engaged in ship breaking continue to die in job related accidents.

It generated great optimism that henceforth there would no more be extra-judicial killings in the country; neither would there be subversion of justice due to anyone, irrespective of party affiliation or family. Such optimism lay in tatters soon after, when the instances of the violation of rule of law came to the notice of rights' activists. It was found that the killings took place during so-called encounters enacted by law enforcing agencies.//////IT is a fast developing situation in Pakistan. The country clearly appears convulsed by a political crisis, which may drastically change the present power structure in a nation that is struggling for a stable government. Democracy could hardly flourish in Pakistan because of a myriad of problems and, consequently, a representative government could seldom spread its wings. //////First-class cricketers have threatened to boycott the upcoming National Cricket League (NCL) if Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) does not increase their match fees as well as reinstate the previous format of the country's lone first-class competition, during a press conference at a city hotel yesterday.//////Brothers Union returned to winning ways in the Bangladesh League with a lone-goal victory over Farashganj SC at Birshreshtha Shaheed Sepoy Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////Australia's bowlers vindicated Ricky Ponting's bold first innings declaration with a disciplined and aggressive display on the second day of first Test against Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.//////Unfit pitch conditions at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium forced the fifth and final one-day international between India and Sri Lanka to be abandoned on Sunday.//////Ranjan Ram and Disha Islam became champions of the Victory Day Tennis Tournament that concluded at the National Tennis Complex in Ramna yesterday.

It has been observed that most of the shopkeepers give "less quantity' for each purchase of products.

She also gave some to her husband, who was with her . . ." //////Our brotherly and friendly neighbouring country India recently announced that they had decided to set up five nuclear power plants( a huge scheme) simultaneously.

But the result is far from a manifestation of its claim to be a democratic party. At the end of fiery speeches by loyal leaders who were trying to outdo one another in showing their allegiance to the chairperson, they ended up surrendering all powers of electing office bearers of different levels to Begum Zia, thereby making the party an autocratic one. What can people expect from such a party! //////I think this will be a positive move towards population control.
