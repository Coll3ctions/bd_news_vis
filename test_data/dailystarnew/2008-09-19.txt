And yet both the sides at the meeting held in Dhaka have described the outcome as fruitful, which is just as well. When one considers the fact that these talks took place after an inordinately long gap of twenty-eight years, one will surely describe the event as encouraging, to an extent. It must be noted that such issues as maritime boundaries are of crucial significance in relations between states. Indeed, they have international significance given that they are linked inextricably with such legalities as the Law of the Sea. The question therefore arises as to why Bangladesh and India, being such close neighbours, had to wait nearly three decades before getting down to discussing the issue.//////THE Jahangirnagar University authorities have evoked strident protests from environmentalists and students alike following their decision to fell a few hundred old trees on the campus. The strange move is being ostensibly taken to keep off the poachers who have been spiriting away some of the trees for good money. Presumably, they want to rid the campus of the inviting trees. Rather than staving thieves off by effective security vigil, the administration seems to have taken a convenient route to appear in a salesman's role. The timber business will surely add to the university coffers; but at what cost?//////IF we look at our history since 1971, people have either got the government they didn't want or wanted the government they didn't get. Right away we can discount the military regimes, which were the governments people didn't want. At other times, they elected government with expectations, which weren't met. //////DEAR HSC graduates: Congratulations.

Some prefer short messages from a handy device to paper-card greetings. //////In a post-budget write-up on this page, I mentioned that the FY09 Budget was generally pro-business but biased in favor of production of import-substitutes over exports. Now, I would like to argue that the tariff structure it put in place did much to prop up producer profits with precious little for consumers to be excited about. This could be a case of benign omission rather than willful design. Let us not forget that consumers are the entire population of Bangladesh -- 150 million strong. Producers of manufactured goods in particular -- the main beneficiaries of the latest tariff adjustments -- would not make up 1 percent of the population. Let us acknowledge the fact that they are much better organised and have far greater lobbying power than all the consumers of Bangladesh. //////Dhaka stocks wrapped up the week almost flat yesterday, with the majority of securities closing up.//////Citibank, NA will provide their banking service to the investors of Adamjee Export Processing Zone.//////Shoma Zahid has been promoted to the post of executive director of Etcetera Bangladesh Limited. //////The dollar fell further in Asian trade Thursday on fresh fears that the worsening global credit crisis would claim more victims on Wall Street, dealers said.//////Crude oil prices traded in a narrow range on Thursday in Asia after rebounding several dollars on the US government's bailout of insurance giant American International Group (AIG), dealers said.//////China has made "considerable progress" on the road to winning the coveted market economy status, the European Commission has concluded in an internal report obtained by AFP on Thursday.//////British bank Lloyds TSB announced on Thursday it was taking over distressed rival Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in a 12.2-billion-pound (15.4 billion euro, 21.8 billion dollar) deal.//////Japan's Toshiba Corp. will likely post an operating loss in the first half and significantly downgrade full-year forecasts as its chip business deteriorates, a report said Thursday.//////Japan's Hitachi Ltd. said Thursday it would join Matsushita Electronics Industrial Co.

As far as the newspaper reports and personal experiences are concerned, the incidents of women repression in our country range from eve-teasing to rape and killing. //////Cricket has been a passion with me for over 70 years now. For the last 37, I have been patiently waiting for the human qualities inherent in this glorious game to surface on a consistent pattern amongst the Bangladesh cricket fraternity. These include grit, tenacity, physical and mental toughness, strength, stamina, natural talent, doggedness, sportsmanship and a host of other human values, that cricket can inculcate into those who regard it as a religion!//////What do we want to achieve through the general election? Better or bitter democracy? We saw that in the early days of the CTG due to the anti -corruption movement most people were optimistic that Bangladesh might be writing a new history. A new horizon was going to be introduced before Bangladesh. Most of the culprits were sent to jail. Most of the corrupt organisations such as Biman, Titas, Rajuk, and the DCC were targeted. //////Barrister Rafiqul Haque articulated perfectly what every sensible person has in mind. He urged the two belligerent leaders of our political arena to come to senses (he should have said that in Bangla). He urged Khaleda Zia and Hasina Wazed to sit together, if needed, at his place, and come to terms for the sake of the country, for the people, for themselves and for their beloved party (read group of cadres). We wholeheartedly support Barrister Rafiq's clarion call. //////Most of our people earn a pittance for their daylong labour to feed themselves and their family members with simple rice and lentil.//////Thousand of kilograms of alkyl phenol ethoxylates (APEO), 100% non-biodegradable, are on regular sale in our chemical market round the country.

There is another characteristic which is acknowledged by all the inhabitants of the land, that is the ghostly appearance of Price Hike of necessary commodities. Though price hike is the common phenomenon of the land, it seems to be intolerable in the month of Ramadan. Especially, the poor people are the victims of such kind of price hike in the name of Ramadan. We, the service holders, have the salary with bonus, but the poor people earn the money not enough for meeting their basic needs. We have to see a lot of faces living under poverty line. //////I am very much encouraged to go through the letter written with reference to my earlier letter on the above subject by learned Professor Ahmed S. Islam. (Ref: his letter, DS, Sept. 10, 2008). I would like to extend my sincere thanks to him for re-opening communication on the above subject. He has quite correctly evaluated the present campus situation while comparing it with the previous conditions.//////The idea of a compact township is brand new to most people of the country and as a result we are unaware of this plan, but the good news is that it has far reaching positive impact on both our land and well-planned growth in crop production to mitigate the growing crisis of food. The compact township generally involves building up cities within the villages of Bangladesh in which people would receive some modern facilities viz. schools, colleges, healthcare for their children. Indeed, the villagers shall live within a particular periphery and accordingly they do not have to waste their cultivable land. Apart from this, the stakeholders of compact township will have electricity supply in a planned way and this apparently may reduce shortage of power in the land as opposed to ill-planned connection of electricity for many different scattered areas in Bangladesh . Although this is a proposed idea invented by a BUET professor and afterwards unanimously supported by all quarters including the powers that be, the project needs to be emphasized on a priority basis keeping the future of the country in view where we are doomed to losing lots of pieces of land annually. But before implementation of this project, workshops, seminars, symposiums should be organised to help accelerate the process. //////The Holy Koran and Hadith, the order of Allah and the words of the Prophet (pbuh), inspire us to love all living beings. So terrorism in the name of religion must be condemned. //////Everyday our newspapers (Bangla and English) condemn the military-backed interim government for suspending democracy in our country. This is all very noble and professional. But I wonder why our newspapers never demand, in clear and unconditional terms (without using ifs and buts), of the AL and the BNP to get rid of their student and youth wings and to abandon politics of hartal. //////There should be certain restrictions on walking on the railway slippers.

It does not matter how many times McCain had spoken to her before the announcement (no more than twice according some reports), the choice will quieten the tongue-wagging critics of McCain's somewhat liberal positions during his long Senate career.
