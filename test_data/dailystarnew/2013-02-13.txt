Infrastructure, scientific method of production, smooth energy supply, knowledge dissemination, etc., need to be improved so that villagers become more confident and prudent in their economic decisions. According to Lewis' theory of economic development, industrialization and subsequent development are not possible until agriculture sector is commercialised. We need to ensure a strong, resilient and productive economy. Though we have good achievements in some sectors such as health, sanitation, etc., we still have a long way to go. Government agencies as well as NGOs have to be result-oriented. Proper planning, implementation, evaluation of the development projects, capacity building, etc., should be given due importance. //////The Google Maps' Street View project is definitely worthwhile for Dhaka where simple commuting is a nightmare.

Presently, several restoration and conservation programmes are going on in the sanctuary initiated by Bangladesh Forest Department and local, national and international development partners.
