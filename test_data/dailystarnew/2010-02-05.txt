Only a few days ago we had commented on the growing tendency of students towards violence and asked the authorities to do everything that needed to be done to roll back this slide to disorder. Unfortunately, the slide has continued, as demonstrated by the violence at DU and at institutions like Dhaka College, where the simple process of admission has become hostage at the hands of student politics. It is our considered opinion that unless drastic and foolproof steps are taken to restore a normal academic atmosphere on the campuses, things may spiral out of control and leave citizens helpless in the face of it all.//////THE planning minister's frank admission that graft gobbles up 40 to 50 per cent of the public funds allocated against any procurement contract only confirms the public perception on the issue. Since public procurement involves about 70 per cent of the expenditures under the Annual Development Programme (ADP), the amount of money involved in it is also huge. Naturally, unless the rules of procurement are strict and foolproof, one should not be too surprised if a significant sum of the money leaks through into corrupt hands.//////WHAT is the significance of the recent decision by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court to uphold the judgement of the High Court, that the 5th amendment to the constitution was illegal and therefore null and void? //////FORMER British Prime Minister Tony Blair appeared before a British inquiry panel last Friday to defend his decision to go to war in Iraq. What an unrepentant Blair blared in his six hours of testimony was nothing we didn't hear already. Saddam was a menace, and it was necessary to deal with him after 9/11. We heard that one before. Then Blair offered a little iddy biddy speck of dust concession. Mistakes were made both before and after the invasion of Iraq, he said. We know that for sure. //////Bangladesh won their fifth gold on the seventh day of the 11th South Asian Games yesterday when golfers Jamal Hossain Mollah, Dulal Hossain and Sakhawat Hossain Sohel put behind a tragedy to clinch the team event gold at the Kurmitola Golf Course.//////Bangladesh will be looking to put their SAFF (South Asian Football Federation) Championship nightmare behind when the hosts take on India in the first semifinal of the 11th South Asian Games at the Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////On the back of a thrashing defeat in the lone Twenty20 match, the Tigers start their one-day campaign against New Zealand at McLean Park in Napier today.//////Bangladesh almost fired blank on the third day of the 11th South Asian Games shooting competition as India dominated the proceedings by winning all four gold medals at the National Shooting Range in Gulshan yesterday.//////Bangladesh's hopes of playing the final of handball in the 11th South Asian Games were shattered as they lost their semifinal match against India at the Handball Stadium on Thursday.//////Bangladesh had to be content with silver in women's kabaddi of the 11th South Asian Games when they conceded a 34-20 defeat to India in the final at the Outer Stadium Kabaddi Court yesterday.//////It could have been moment of extreme happiness for Kazi Mohiuddin Khokon had he lived to witness the great success of his son.

Also, the ice in Himalayan and Alps Mountain range and high mountains in North America and Canada have melted faster than normal. Similarly, there has been considerable melting of ice in the Artic and Antarctic regions. Sea passages in the Artic and Antarctic oceans are now open for navigation, because of this accelerated melting of ice. Cargo sea vessels from the North German port of Hamburg are now safely sailing through the North West Passage, to Canada and north US ports, which earlier remained ice bound at this time of the year! This apparent anomaly of the weather may be explained by basic principles of physics.//////Many campaigns have been launched to establish the rights of women, but most of the campaigns remain unsuccessful due to our lack of willingness to establish their rights in the true sense. //////I believe that the government could employ beggars and have them clean up the city. They could collect as many plastic bags and as much trash as possible and turn them in for food, cash or both, depending upon how much rubbish they turn in. This will also keep them busy and do something useful rather than being a menace to motorists on the roads and endangering traffic. There are many beggars, especially women who are not physically disabled, and it's about time they all started doing something useful instead of begging!//////I was quite shocked to hear a news report . This was given in a Channel i newspaper review programme by Mr MR Chaoudhury. The reaction of a senior journalist was quite legitimate and necessary. The news report is that a BWDB project from the "Aila" affected area has been moved from there to Bhairab. The news is missing a lot of details, yet I think the reaction of the journalist was quite appropriate. //////Indians need police clearance for Saudi visas. At present the Indians, who are applying for passport have to get a police clearance certificate in order to get it. The validity of most of the passports is 10 years and during this period a person may commit a crime. It is a good decision to insist upon the certificate for Employment Visa. This will end the suspicions and will stop the person with criminal records from coming to Saudi Arabia. However, on the negative side the police department will have to work harder and the normal 4-5 week clearance period will be further delayed. //////As a son of a railway employee, I have been witnessing the encroachment of railway land since my childhood. A vast area of railway all over Chittagong is now under the clutches of the greedy occupants. The range of occupants varies from poor slum dwellers and refugees to powerful bigwigs and government bodies. In my childhood it was a common sight for us to see houses and other establishments being bulldozed and overthrown in an attempt to recover railway land and re-encroachment of the land soon afterwards. Again, there were, and still are, certain establishments which belonged to the so-called big guns which had always been exempted. The railway is now almost crippled due the massive corruption on the part of its employees to high officials. //////Opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia rejected the success of prime minister's India visit, calling the joint communiqu signed between the two neighbours as the document of sale-out of Bangladesh to India. She smelt the failure even before the visit started on the ground and warned the Hasina government not to sign any deal with this neighbour. However, while the signing ceremony was over and the joint communiqu was made public her party sharply reacted, accusing this govt. of signing a sell-out document and threatened to go for an agitation programme against this government taking the public with her. //////Once one of the companions of our greatest and dearest Rasul Hazrat Muhammad (Pbuh) said to the Rasul, ''Ya Rasulallah! Teach me such an act by which I will be able to gain love of both Allah and humans.'' Our dearest Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) advised him, ''If you can give up your greed for things belonging to others, people will love you. And, if you can give up your earthly hopes, Allah will love you.''//////I remembered the time when our small, quaint area was being urbanized. Lots of cutting down of trees and dust cloud may be the approved definition for urbanization but to me it is something different. It made the area arid and the harmony with the nature is lost. Once there were many charming songs of parrots and magpie robins. Now I can hardly see birds, except for crows dominating with their harsh noise.//////The last caretaker government had done one good thing it abolished the unjust privilege of the lawmakers of importing duty free cars. I am greatly distressed to see the vile practice being revived again. Our perception is that nobody in our country is ever poorer after entering politics. In most cases the aspirants to the Jatiyo Sangsad spend several millions just to get party nomination. //////The Progoti Industries is an industrial enterprise that belongs to Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation (BSEC). It assembles motor vehicles. A Bangla daily newspaper from Dhaka reported recently that it had been suffering from acute working capital shortage. It borrowed inadequate working capital form commercial banks with high interest. //////Bangladesh has been experimenting with different forms of government since Independence without any remarkable achievement. None of the systems has been able to deliver what this country requires. To achieve any tangible success Bangladesh needs to switch over to a failure-proof time tested system. The system that is in vogue in the United States has made America the number one country in the world. This system of governance ensures accountability and responsible leadership.//////Like any other thing, Bangladeshi traditional work-culture doesn't adopt the western practice of the 'corporate culture' without terrible deformation. While in the west, this working pattern maintains clarity, equality and system, in Bangladesh it fuels up the manipulation of the surplus labour force. Over the last decade, we have seen a change in the overall working condition of Bangladesh. This change, in its turn, is moulding the socio-cultural fabric of our society. Both my parents were service-holders; however, when we were younger, we found both of them returning home before four o'clock. Consequently, the family did not face the disorientation of loneliness and boredom. But in our present time, most of the corporate offices, banks and even the education institutions have very long working-hours, the minimum of which is perhaps no less then eight -hours. Now the point is, some of the banks and offices even make the workers work till late-nights. And the academics return home with the overwhelming workload in the form of preparing questions, checking the scripts. They are not spared. When these people return home, after a day long of exhaustion (adding the never ending traffic-jam), they are, no doubt, not in a mood to spend time with the children and other family members. And without creating enough child-care provision for the small and school-going children, we demand married women to work and maintain a family life. All these exploitation of labour should be brought under control.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////India has proposed foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan, a senior government source said yesterday, signalling a major breakthrough in relations frozen since the 2008 attacks in Mumbai.//////Pakistani militant leaders vowed yesterday to press holy war to "liberate" the divided Himalayan state of Kashmir from Indian control and called for moral support from Pakistan.//////Pakistan's security forces said yesterday an air and ground offensive had killed 12 militants in the northern extremity of the lawless tribal belt on the Afghan border.//////Sri Lanka's president called yesterday for minority ethnic Tamils to work with the government to settle their differences but said there would be no self-rule for them, as the country celebrated its first Independence Day since the end of a 25-year civil war.//////British lawmakers were ordered yesterday to repay more than one million pounds of expenses linked to their second homes, after an investigation into a scandal, which rocked parliament.//////India's twin obsessions of cricket and Bollywood are at the heart of a bitter row that has broken out between the country's top film star and a radical right-wing party in the movie capital Mumbai.//////A US-educated Pakistani woman who caught the attention of human rights groups after she disappeared for five years was found guilty Wednesday of trying to kill American servicemen in Afghanistan.//////US President Barack Obama on Wednesday certified that India has placed safeguards on its nuclear facilities, taking another step toward full implementation of a landmark cooperation deal.//////Thirty-two Taliban and three soldiers have been killed in an Afghan-Nato operation in Helmand province ahead of a major anti-Taliban push, the provincial government said yesterday.//////President Barack Obama on Wednesday certified that North Korea would remain off the US list of terrorist states, despite some calls from Congress for the Stalinist state to be put back on.//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have asked his cabinet colleagues to disclose details of their assets and liabilities.//////A pill that allows people to live beyond 100 and eliminates Alzheimer's, diabetes and heart disease is being developed by scientists.//////Hamas is ready for dialogue with the international community, including the United States and European Union, the leader of the Palestinian Islamist movement Ismail Haniya told AFP.//////One of the major attractions of the Ekushey Book Fair are the latest books by leading and popular writers of the country, among them this year are eight works by noted novelist Emdadul Haque Milon. //////As part of its initiative to promote rural art forms, the Department of Theatre and Film, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) is holding Putul Nach Utshab (Puppet Dance Festival) 2010.//////When I received the news of Sayeed Ahmed's demise, memories of him overwhelmed me on a gloomy, foggy Madrid day.

In this interview, he spoke with //////.//////THIRTEEN years ago, the death of Azizur Rahman Mallick drew the curtain over a scholar's life. He was one of those men whose singular devotion to the country, which devotion came encapsulated in his efforts for better education for the young, has always been the pivot around which his life and with it its achievements have been measured. You think of Chittagong University and in the same breath you dwell on the place of Azizur Rahman Mallick in its history. Back in the later 1960s, as the university took shape, Abdul Monem Khan, governor of what was then Pakistan's eastern province, made it known that Mallick was not an individual he could appreciate. But then, Monem Khan saw little that was of significance in Bengali culture. It was one of those times when an upholding of the so-called Pakistan ideology was all that mattered to Monem Khan and the likes of him. And yet, for all his difficulty in coming to terms with Mallick's scholarly persona, the governor knew there was no one who could steer Chittagong University to the future better than the man behind its creation.//////MY son was taking a turn when a car from behind hit his car. The driver still continued to drive through the maze of cars, rickshaws, auto-rickshaws and pedestrians. In that maze it was not too difficult for my son to turn around and follow the car that hit him. Soon he was able to stop the car and get the driver to inspect the damage incurred due to this "accident". To my son's amazement, the driver in the other car was a young teenager, who was learning to drive from his incompetent driver, during the city's peak rush hour traffic.
