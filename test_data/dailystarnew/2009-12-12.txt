Reports have it that between five and six thousand Bangladeshi workers are held in confinement in different desert locations, where Bangladesh-origin brokers in collusion with their Libyan accomplices are holding these hapless job seekers to ransom. //////The recently slapped government ban on raw jute export has caused the once famed 'Golden Fibre' to come to the fore. The background story speaks for itself. During the July-September quarter of this fiscal, export of raw jute registered a rise of 28 per cent over what it was in the corresponding previous fiscal. The volume of raw jute produced this year is also estimated to be as high as 5.5 million bales. Matching the rise in exports, the price of raw jute, too, has shot up in the local market. Some traders are also allegedly stocking up on raw jute raising its price artificially in the market. As a consequence, jute mills, which manufacture various jute-based commodities like gunny bags, carpet backing and the like are facing crisis in the supply of their raw material. //////We all know that there is a close association between the availability of reliable, uninterrupted power supply in industry and commerce and in the attaining of socio-economic potential and decent living standards. In this era of globalisation, there are few issues that better demonstrate the confluence of politics and business than energy. From fuelling the economies of the rich countries to driving economic development in poor ones, it has an effect on almost everything that we do. Consequently, ensuring the safe supply and distribution of energy has to be an important part of strategic state policy.//////During World War II, when Great Britain was losing on every front, Winston Churchill, then prime minister, wrote to Lord Chancellor, the Chief Justice, to ensure that the judiciary delivered justice. Surprised, Lord Chancellor frantically asked Churchill why he had expressed such a fear when his attention was focused on how to stop the advancing Nazis. Churchill replied immediately to observe that as long as people were sure to get justice, they would fight for the country even in the midst of reverses.//////It was all set up for a Bangladesh victory.

They can only play if their franchises choose to cut another foreign player from the squad, but for any other player hoping to line up a spot, the process appears more straightforward.//////Widespread fears over the future of Test cricket have been partly assuaged by the news that the BCCI has asked South Africa to play two Tests in India during their tour early next year, dropping two one-day internationals from the schedule to make space for the five-day matches.//////Don't be fooled by the score. It was a flat track in Napier but Iain O'Brien was on a mission to make his last Test memorable and Pakistan's top order, as ever, was in a self-destructive mood. Imran Farhat lifted Pakistan from the depths of 59 for 5 and resuscitated his career with a fighting century but New Zealand will be more than pleased with their efforts, especially after a dogged batting display from the openers, on the first day of the final Test. //////Emergency executive committee meetings, a 'decisive' democratic decision making process, an animated press conference and a re-integration.

I remember I had an opportunity to meet him at his 202 Rash Biharee Avenue residence in Kolkata four decades back on a cruel April morning in 1972 along with my friend Serajuddin Ahmed, a short story writer with whom Buddhadev had intimate regular correspondence.

Enormous health hazards ranging from large number of deaths through natural disasters to emergence of vector-borne diseases, water and food insecurity, vulnerable shelter and human settlements, population migration etc. are already evident. If timely action, appropriate public health policy to combat climate change is not taken, more human lives will be destroyed by frequent catastrophic events and health will be endangered severely.//////Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the common causes for which women visit physicians. Women tend to get urinary tract infections more often than men because bacteria can reach the bladder more easily in women. The urethra is shorter in women than in men. So bacteria have a shorter distance to travel. But with little precaution and simple measures, women can prevent UTI effectively.//////Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine developed by German physician and chemist, Dr Christian Fredric Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). It is based on the principle Law of Similar". It states that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people.

One of the problems is in Afghanistan where he is finding it difficult to finish the unfinished war of his predecessor. Another major setback is the economy. A combination of greed of leaders of the financial sector, lack of government regulation and the hundreds of billions of dollars spent in Iraq/Afghanistan wars during the Bush era (total cost of the wars is now getting close to US 1 trillion) has pushed the economy into the worst recession for decades.//////GENERALS ruled Pakistan for half the time since its independence in 1947.

Civilians have ruled the country only for 27 years out of 62. //////THE mariners always feared the Bay of Bengal for its turbulence. However, the advancement of science and technology made the turbulent water the backyard of many powerful navies. The key to control of the waves is innovation. With the technological emergence of China, the Bay of Bengal is slowly gaining a different momentum. It still is a long shot for China to contest the international maritime order. However, if China emerges to its potential, the vitally important Indian Ocean will feel its presence. The maritime security of the narrow Malaccan strait between Malaysia and Sumatra of Indonesia will be the chokepoint of China's maneuver towards the Indian Ocean. The Bay of Bengal will provide the bridgehead of its westerly thrust. //////Bone marrow transplants, already used to treat some children with sickle cell disease, also may cure some adults with this deadly genetic defect that causes red blood cells to contort, U.S. scientists said recently.//////THE word Oshtorombha is in fact zero. It is Papri Rahman's third collection of stories and her fifth book. Papri Rahman carries the banner of a writer, an editor and a critic, quite comfortably. She doesn't write about the issues related to women which we commonly see in other contemporary writers, as she claims. Whenever she finds a story that is out of the ordinary, she tries to colour it in the canvass of story telling. This makes her somewhat different from other female writers that we come across.//////THE ingredients of Anita Rau Badami's ////// are: an interesting theme (the relationship between mothers and daughters); an engrossing story (told, in turns, by a mother and her daughter), and recognizable characters with familiar dilemmas portrayed with insight and poignancy.//////Chitrita Banerji makes us happy and makes us remember all the culinary traditions we are heir to in this gem of a book. Indeed, it is at the very beginning of Bengali Cooking that you get to remember that certain cultural aspect of your being. As a host, you will likely implore the one visiting you thus: Do please grace my poor hovel with your presence and share our simple meal of dal and rice. Sounds familiar? You bet it does, for who has not heard of Bengali hospitality? It is as spontaneous as is the manner in which a Bengali loves to eat with his family.//////Craig Murray lives these days in quite pitiable conditions in London with his Uzbek girlfriend Nadira. In these past few years he has been a candidate for a parliamentary seat and then rector of a university. It was in Blackburn that he took on Jack Straw, the man he considers his nemesis, at the 2005 elections. He lost, but then he actually did not expect to win. It was his way of getting back at the man who he believes linked up with the mandarins in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Straw was then foreign secretary) to deprive him of his job as British ambassador to Uzbekistan.//////
