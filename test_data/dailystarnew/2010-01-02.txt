Social and educational research says "no." Learning styles and preferences vary greatly among students. It is then obvious that some students face difficulty achieving success at school. Among them are those whom we categorise as students with special educational needs. They have learning difficulties or disabilities which make it harder for them to learn or access education than most other students of the same age. A student with special needs may need extra or different help at school and home because of physical difficulties, problems with thinking and understanding, emotional and behavioural issues, or a combination of these. Due to a lack of awareness and sincerity, we fail to attend to their needs. However, we should properly accommodate students with special needs in regular classrooms and give them an equal learning opportunity both at school and home. //////Visiting Chittagong Mohammedan held Brothers Union to a goalless draw in their Bangladesh League encounter at Birshreshtha Shaheed Sepoy Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday. //////A 16-member India team, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, will arrive in the city at noon today while a 15-member Sri Lanka team, led by Kumar Sangakkara, will arrive in the evening to participate in the tri-nation ODI series also involving hosts Bangladesh that begins on Monday. //////Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has said he is likely to play the second Test against Australia in Sydney after recovering from the finger injury that ruled him out of the Boxing Day Test which Pakistan lost by 170 runs.//////India's cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni yesterday said Bangladesh are a good side and can beat any team on their day.//////Five years have passed since Shane Watson and Mohammad Asif made their Test debuts at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Clad in black, with a guitar and at times a harmonica, she contradicts all stereotypes. Her buzz cut might intimidate some but the disarming smile radiates with sincerity. For seven years, she desperately tried to release her debut album -- a compilation of songs that chronicled her growth as an individual and an artiste. When the album, titled "Shayan-er Gaan", was finally released on May 6, 2008, people listened and those who listened closely were in awe.//////For lots of people 2009 had a special meaning, especially the digits 2 and 9, the 21st century influence, the energy, the life. All these could only mean one thing-the fun and happening drama of the year 1920 by Hridi Huq that was aired on NTV on Mondays and Thursdays. This was a story about the lives of Asib, Tonmoy, Sagor, Ayon, Promiti, Sraboni, Pinky and many more.//////It's a final goodbye to 2009.

The question of proportionality in the use of force by those in authority has always been a vexing issue. Cynics, however, say that in finding out the justification or otherwise of the use of force, the bias has been against people and in favour of the governments.//////THE Copenhagen accord left key questions unanswered because it contained no specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. The pact called on developed nations to provide $30 billion to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change from 2010 to 2012. The text further says, by 2020 rich nations should "set a goal of $100 billion a year" for poor nations, especially the most vulnerable ones. With no specific binding treaty, the deal pledges to keep atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide low enough to keep average global temperatures less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels -- a threshold beyond which many scientists say dangerous consequences could result.//////HOW is an investor, living outside Dhaka, Chittagong, or abroad, supposed to get information about a listed company to make a wise investment decision? You might say that, to get information about a firm, an investor living in Noakhali or abroad may visit the respective firm's website. Unfortunately, most of the listed firms do not even have a website. Very few listed firms, mostly banks, have websites with insufficient information. On the DSE or SEC website, there are hardly any audited annual financial reports of the listed firms. Therefore, to invest in the stock market in Bangladesh, one has to contact the respective firm's register office, or DSE, CSE or SEC, which is costly, and sometimes, even impossible, given Bangladesh's perspective. Then, how do you make your investment decisions? Is it that you invest based on what you hear on the media or from your friends who are also exposed to the same situation like you are? To solve the above-mentioned problem, i.e., lack of relevant information, and also to make the market more efficient and transparent, the SEC must need to have an online database or archive like Edgar, i.e., Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system.//////Climate change caused by global warming is a hard and bitter reality now. World leaders and activists have risen to the occasion lately; intercontinental level discussions after discussions have been held over the recent years to agree on ways and means to mitigate effect of and adapt to this unwelcome change. But any adequately effective and agreed measure is yet to be on card. The latest Copenhagen conference has also unfortunately experienced more discord than consensus. Meanwhile the scourge is assuming further gravity for the vulnerable.//////At the United Nations climate change conference last moth , an index was prepared for judging the risks of climate change countries. According to the index, Bangladesh will be most severely affected by climate change .Myanmar, Honduras, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Haiti, are in subsequent next positions. //////Since its introduction back in 1845, concrete has become the most important item among construction materials accounting for 20% to 40% of total construction cost of a project. Be it for a residential building or for structures like bridges, flyovers, road pavements that are needed for the development of any country, concrete is an essential item that needs careful attention, more so for a country like Bangladesh.//////Kazi Nazrul Islam addressed the undying sense of self respect of the common man that persists, even as a hardly perceptible undercurrent, in the most trying of circumstances. He recognised that the weakness of the elitist centre meant a corresponding strength of the subaltern periphery, since through a series of strange binaries, the ebb and flow of the two mutually locked segments of our population shows each other's strengths and weaknesses.//////Love is an inimitable feeling that illuminates the soul. We all have a basic need to be loved. When we are children we are content with our parents' love and familial bonds. As we mature and form different relationships that deepen with time, we feel an innate need to love and be loved in return. //////It was the second time the white car passed us by. That was way back sometime in mid March 1985. My fourteen year old sister and I were in our father's car which had suddenly decided to halt right in the middle of Dhanmondi road 3. No amount of pressing the accelerator or pulling the choke would make it change its mind. I had just got my British driving licence and had come to Dhaka for a month's holiday. To be honest, I found it highly amusing when people used to stare at this pretty young girl (being myself!) navigating a car through the streets of Dhaka. Believe me, this was not a common sight twenty four years ago. But on that breezy evening the car was letting me down. This wasn't supposed to happen to a young and confident noveau-driver.! My cockiness began to somewhat deflate. The white car passed us for the third time. In the dark purple twilight I saw a tall, well built young man in a white shirt come out and walk towards us. Oh God! I thought. I hadn't bargained for another problem. Why hadn't I listened to Abba and taken the driver?//////Let me swallow the shredded anti-particles//////Up in the void//////With particles whizzing past my bodily form.//////Now, somewhat erect on the gaseous clay//////With fractionation working in me//////I whiz past time itself leaving//////Frozen moments that whiz past future.//////In resonance of truth and absurdity//////I call out askance in human voice,//////'Who is there?'//////In resonance it is ethereal 'I' eternally existent,//////An ever-repeating dimension of only//////Fractionation, relativity of shine and shadow,//////Disfiguration of only earth and water!//////People make new resolutions on the commencement of a New Year to lead a better life, to remain heal and hearty throughout the year and after on. Some people pledge to shed extra pounds, give up their bad habits like quitting smoking, alcohol, excessive eating. Some people make healthy plans like dieting, exercise and regular check up to boost up their fitness. Whatever may be the plan, making resolutions for health certainly help people to stay healthier than people without any plan of resolutions. Here are some tips that can help making perfect resolutions for you and keep you in track of road to good health.//////Although cervical cancer is the leading cancer in women of Bangladesh, it is still a less spoken issue. The ironical thing about cervical cancer is that many women cannot access the free service to screen cervical cancer simply because of not knowing about the service. Many women detected at end stage of cervical cancer when apparently physicians have nothing to do. Unlike many cancers, we have vaccine and chap cancer test called VIA (Visual Inspection using Acetic Acid) to prevent and detect the disease at early stage. Still it remains one of the top ranked killers. There is an urgent need to promote these services throughout Bangladesh.//////Bouts of low blood sugar can lead to unsafe driving among people with diabetes, new research shows.//////Are you concerned about how much time your child spends watching TV or playing video games? Although some screen time can be educational, it is easy to go overboard.//////With the New Year, come New Years resolutions. Here are three choices for all of us://////Air pollution, which tends to inflame the airways in people with asthma, might also reduce the effectiveness of the rescue inhalers they count on for quick relief of their asthma symptoms, study findings hint.//////When a dipstick test suggests there's blood in the urine, the next step should be to examine a sample of the urine under a microscope to make sure the dipstick result is accurate, according to medical guidelines  but often the patient is sent directly to see a specialist, or for further testing.//////THE most notorious Islamic militants are ordinarily grouped under two heads: Taliban and Al-Qaeda network. However, there is another group emerging - Salafism- that advocates restoring a Muslim empire across the Middle East and Spain. Salafis have sought inroads in Morocco, Algeria, Lebanon and Jordan.//////India and Japan will upgrade their defence and strategic ties through a Defence Action Plan (DAP) that will be presented to the prime ministers of both countries when Yukio Hatoyama meets his Indian counterpart, Manmohan Singh, on December 30, said a senior Indian Foreign Ministry official. The Japanese prime minister is visiting India from December 27-30.//////Russia must develop new offensive weapons systems to counter US missile defences and prevent Americans from feeling they can "do whatever they want," Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on December 29.//////The occasion of a new book by Chinua Achebe, Africa's most celebrated writer and author of Things Fall Apart, the great African novel, cannot be ignored. It's been twenty years since his previously published book and more than that since his last novel. Much has happened to Achebe and Nigeria during those years, much of it not good. But even prior to those twenty years there was the civil war in Nigeria (1967-1970), after the country's Igbos succeeded and formed their own country called Biafra. It took years for the scars of those events to heal (if they ever did). Achebe and many other Igbos were left in a state of emotional collapse and, if you talk to Igbos today in southeastern Nigeria, they'll tell you that a similar situation could occur again.//////In 1945, the president of the Jamiat-ul-Ulema condemned Mohammad Ali Jinnah through issuing a fatwa, calling him the great heathen, or Kafir-e-Azam. It was a pun on the honorific Quaid-e-Azam with which India's Muslims had honoured Jinnah. In the days immediately following the partition of India in 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru was landed a resounding slap by a Hindu refugee from Pakistan at a camp in Haridwar. The man, unimpressed by the prime minister's efforts to assuage the troubled emotions of the men and women in the camp, screamed, 'Give my mother back to me! Bring my sisters to me!' At the railway station in Ambala, Zakir Hussain, a future president of India, miraculously escaped death at the hands of a Hindu mob. The brother of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, a prominent Congress politician, was stabbed to death. The daughter of Ghulam Mohammad, a future governor general of Pakistan, was abducted. Gandhi sat out the celebrations of independence, for all around him Hindus and Muslims were hacking away at one another in unimaginable fratricide. All across the Indian subcontinent, in the weeks and months before and following the vivisection of the subcontinent, Hindus and Muslims were on the rampage, looking for men to murder, women to abduct and rape and property to loot.//////It is these days quite fashionable to consider oneself politically correct. Look around you. You don't have Red Indians any more, only Native Americans. Though you might consider Barack Obama as America's first black president, you must be extra careful in avoiding using the old, denigrating 'Negro' while describing him or any of his kind. It is African-Americans that you have today. On a lighter level, do you realise that there are no housewives any more today? There are only homemakers, whatever that means. It tends to remind you of a rather pernicious term, home-wreckers, one that you associate with men and women who have nothing better to do than making a mess of other people's lives by falling in love, or lust, with other people's spouses. And then there is the way you describe a child whose intelligence is obviously of a poor quality. But, no, you cannot suggest by any means that he is unintelligent. He is merely one who has an attention deficit disorder.//////Madhubala, aged thirty six, died in February 1969. She had finally succumbed to the pains associated with the lifelong hole in her heart. And then there were all the other pains she went through life in the course of a career that was to etch forever her name on Indian cinema. All these decades after her death, Madhubala remains an icon. Proof of that is to be found in the excitement with which today's generation has responded to the new, all colour version of the Dilip Kumar-Madhubala starrer Mughal-e-Azam. It was the movie that raised the pair to prodigious heights of popularity. There are those who suggest that it was also a point when their real life romance was on the wane. Remember the moment when Dilip caresses Madhubala's cheek with a feather, causing visible sensual thrills in her?//////
