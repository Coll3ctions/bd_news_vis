When the conditions at breeding sites become unfavorable due to low temperatures, migratory birds fly to regions where conditions are better. The variation in migration behaviour is extremely large and contributes to fascinating diversity of birds in the world. Some birds migrate only a short way, while others can cover vast distances to wintering areas and travel between the northern and southern hemispheres. Some species move on broad fronts while others follow very narrow routes. Sudden and irregular movements of large numbers of birds can occur in several northern species in response to food shortages. //////The number of guest birds coming every year to Jahangirnagar University (JU) lakes since the eighties has been falling for the last few years in such a way that last year there was no bird fair held as part of the campus's recent trend. //////Glenn Horowitz Bookseller has just published ////// Meena Alexander's latest book of poems.

He was one writer who did not believe in skirting around the issues or putting his expressions into symbolisms or arcane formulations. That much was evident in his short stories. You need to recall ////// (Open) or ////// (Odour) or ////// (Cold Meat) to comprehend the social picture Manto was determined to sketch, especially against the background of the calamity that was 1947. Partition, for Manto as well as for millions of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs in the subcontinent, was a monstrosity. Could it have been prevented? You do not come by easy answers to this loaded question. There is that certain feeling in you that had Chittaranjan Das or Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose been alive in 1947, history would be different, indeed that India would stay in one piece. Well, the fact is that Das and Bose were not there; and those who were proved incapable of rolling back the coming deluge, indeed caused it to happen. Nehru messed up things through his own interpretation of the Cabinet Mission Plan in July 1946. And Jinnah, who Tariq Ali thinks, with good reason, was a second-rate politician, simply did not have any clue about what he would do with Pakistan once it came to pass.//////Few Bangladeshi writers writing in English focus on women-centric characters. So when Dr. Razia Sultana Khan steps up to fill the breach with her wonderful new book, ////// one can't help being excited.

Lying on the bed, the patient in need might harbour the excruciating pain hoping to get an organ donation from a dying person or someone living with poverty (poor enough to sell own organ).

In order to tackle the challenges, appropriate strategy for national healthcare financing to move towards universal health coverage is crucial.//////What you eat and drink can have a big impact on your ability to fall or stay asleep.

Less noted is the anomaly of an Asia increasingly integrated with the Chinese economy and militarily more reliant on the US.//////Recently, I watched a movie titled The Day After (1983). The film depicts a fictional war between Nato forces and the no more existent Warshaw Pact Alliance, that rapidly escalates into a full-scale war between the United States and the then Soviet Union. I saw how an ICBM was being launched with nuclear warhead and then detonated in the air or on the surface of the target area. This movie makes me assume what India has actually achieved on their historic day of testing the latest edition of ICBM, Agni-5. With this remarkable achievement India can feel proud as a member of the elite club of ICBM owners. Should we put your hands together for India? What an irony, a country has been spending over five hundred million dollars for developing ICBM for the last three decades where as almost half a billion countrymen there starve. Last year India spent $46 billion on weapons purchase while only $11.5 billion and $6 billion on education and health respectively. //////Halderpur is a small village in Hobiganj. It is located under No. 7 Boroiuri union of Baniachong police station. In 1971, it was the site of an aggressive Pakistani air attack that claimed the lives of many innocent lives. This is their story. //////A good number of years ago I was introduced to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ////// through David Magarshack's translation, accompanied by a learned introduction. After having gone through the novel, I could not agree more with the publisher, Penguin Classic's back cover's observation that, The reader of David Magarshack's fluent translation can appreciate both a magnificent gallery of characters and the piercing insight which makes Dostoyevsky the most terrifying of all writers. Magarshack translated directly from the Russian original, and he was no less facile in the other works that he translated. Now I have come across a book, //////, which has been translated from a translation of the original. Something of the original understandably gets lost in a translation; so one can only speculate on what, if anything, has been lost through the tertiary presentation. Thankfully, though, ////// is just a travelogue, a fascinating one at that, but with no pretension of having the universal significance of //////. Consequently, there is less chance of much getting lost in translation even if tertiary, and especially if the translation has been ably done by a qualified (with four other published translated works) translator like Kaiser Haq.//////The oldest written works in the world all come in some poetic form. However, we all know that poetry as an art had been adopted by primitive people before they became literate, because it was convenient for them to express their thoughts in verses which could be memorized and carried to other people. In the absence of any written forms, they could easily store those verses in their memory. Hence the use of verses to transmit their experience attained widespread popularity even in those primitive days. //////A mother is desperately looking for her only son through every lead she can get for days after he was seized by the Pakistani military for interrogation about the whereabouts of freedom fighters of the independence war. Finally she meets her son behind bars at the prison cell. The son has been so brutally tortured that he can barely stand or talk. He tells his mother that the military will release him if he reveals the names of the others who are in control of guerrilla groups. The devastated but brave and indomitable mother tells him, Keep strong son, don't tell anyone's name. This is a mother as strong as the now sovereign country of ours. She would not bend before the fear of losing a precious possession for the greater good, for upholding the rights of citizens, for the liberty of Bangladesh. //////
