If anybody expected even a few innovations in budgeting this year, they must have been rather disappointed. For Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday presented a budget that dwells mostly on past initiatives, and wants to carry on the unfinished agenda. //////The government has proposed raising allocation in the education sector by 13.5 percent in the budget for the next fiscal year. //////The national budget proposed for the upcoming financial year, which totals Tk 132,170 crore, relies heavily on bank borrowing and revenue earnings to cover the costs.//////Identifying power as the top priority sector, Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday reiterated the government's plans to resolve the load shedding scenario within the next two years by implementing dozens of power generation and transmission projects.//////The government is going to introduce Agriculture Insurance system to assist small and medium farmers in case of their crop failure due to natural disasters.//////The government has proposed a VAT exemption for maize, travel agencies, manpower exporters and plastic and rubber sandals. //////With tobacco, the government has for the first time imposed tariff on any export item.//////Economists think the proposed budget for fiscal year 2010-11 set ambitious growth and investment targets. On other fronts they said there is nothing new, rather an extension of the outgoing budget.//////The national budget for 2010-11 seeks to retain thrust on the social safety net although allocation has reduced by 0.4-percentage point to 14.8 percent of the total outlay.//////BNP General Secretary Khandaker Delwar Hossain termed the proposed budget for the 2010-11 fiscal highly ambitious and shrouded with ambiguity.//////Aiming to retrieve river system, check pollution and protect biodiversity the government has set green targets to improve the country's overall environment. //////The budget for the coming fiscal year proposes zero duty on energy-saving lights and accessories. //////The traffic jam was terrible. Abidur Rahim thought the budget speech would be over by the time he reached home.//////Introduction of a web-based tax calculator, tax card, spot assessment of small taxpayers and e-linkage between TIN management and National ID project's data base are the main features of income tax related proposals in yesterday's budget speech.//////The government yesterday proposed continuation of zero-tariff on the imports of various essential commodities to keep prices within the reach of the majority of people. //////Admitting that hardly any notable development was made in the country's rail or waterways over the past year, the finance minister yesterday insisted on a well-balanced improvement of the communication sector under an integrated policy.//////The government has proposed a Tk 1,512 crore increase in defence expenditure to finance some major purchases needed to modernise the armed forces. //////The government yesterday proposed to allow money whitening in infrastructure fund with payment of 10 percent flat tax by investment to the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund (BIFF). //////Buyers might have to pay more for cars from 1001cc to 1500cc as import duty on cars in that range has been upped from 30 to 45 percent in the proposed budget. //////The proposed large-sized budget for the next fiscal, with 20 percent growth in the overall outlay and 35 percent in development spending, immediately raises a question regarding the government's implementation capability. What factors have dictated such a large increase in the projected budgetary spending? Boosting public spending may be thought to be one way of helping the economy recover from its current slowdown. Besides, the allocations for politically-mandated projects as well as for the safety-net programmes for the poor may also have contributed to the bloating of the ADP. Revenue expenditure is also projected to rise significantly to meet the costs of increased salaries, agricultural and fuel subsidies, and debt servicing. On the revenue side, the Finance Minister may have gone for optimistic projections encouraged by the fact that the revenue target in the current fiscal has been achieved in spite of stagnation in import trade. //////* Dist level budget//////* Tax card for highest taxpayers//////Although the disaster management experts called specific allocations for risk reduction programmes, the proposed national budget proposes much of its allocations in this regard for the post-disaster management.//////The government proposed to inject Tk 3,000 crore fresh fund into Public Private Partnership projects in the next fiscal year, ease the project approval process and set up a separate office that would deal with PPPs.//////South Africa brimmed with pride and anticipation Thursday on the eve of the first World Cup on African soil as the nation's icon Nelson Mandela said the tournament would bridge racial divides.//////The High Court yesterday stayed for three months the government order closing Bangla daily Amar Desh. //////The government has proposed to expand welfare programmes for freedom fighters by increasing budgetary allocation and the number of beneficiaries, expressing its intent to protect them from vulnerability.//////China will contribute to projects related to greater connectivity, and is waiting for a concrete proposal from Bangladesh for building a deep-sea port in Chittagong.//////She came to Dhaka for a few days.

Firstly, the budget has singled out power and energy as the thrust sector and has accordingly increased allocation for it. However, to expedite the pace of power generation, the present stress on the establishment of rental power plants implies that the government's subsidy on it will have to be increased to keep power within the purchasing capacity of the consumers. The finance minister, however, justified this step in the greater interest of the economy. At the same time, the policy to diversify the source of power through reducing dependency on gas and switching to power plants based on coal, furnace oil and even nuclear energy promises good dividends in the future in terms of enhancing generation capacity as well as broadening the base for energy security provided the government spells out its policies on coal, nuclear and renewable sources of energy in clearer terms. //////The 19th World Cup gets underway today in South Africa, and it is safe to say that pretty much everything else will take a back seat to the tournament for the next month.
