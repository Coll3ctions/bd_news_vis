The dollar and the yen gained broadly as the euro and perceived higher risk currencies succumbed to profit-taking ahead of policy decisions by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. But the dollar and yen were expected to remain under longer-term pressure after the Fed's pledge on low US rates. Traders were wary of extending the rally in riskier assets triggered after the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its commitment to low borrowing costs for an "extended period", driving the safe-haven dollar lower. The Bank of England will announce its decision with the market braced for a possible further increase in asset purchases, while a European Central Bank decision and news conference will follow. Beyond that, closely-watched US non-farm payrolls data is due on Friday and Group of 20 finance ministers meet on Friday and Saturday. Low interest rates should ensure the dollar remains a funding currency in carry trades -- transactions in which investors borrow in low-yielding currencies to buy higher-yielding assets. Analysts were divided on whether the BoE would expand its quantitative easing policy by 25 billion pounds, 50 billion pounds or call a halt to it, while keeping key interest rates unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent. The ECB decision was seen more predictable, with the central bank expected to keep rates at a record low 1.0 percent, though market players would keep a close eye on the news conference for any clues on possible exit strategies. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a basket of currencies, was up 0.2 percent at 75.811, pulling away from Wednesday's one-week low of 75.60. It hit a 14-month low of 74.94 in late October and has been in a downtrend since March.//////Speakers at a BBC dialogue yesterday said Bangladesh should go back to the fundamental principles of the

After examining the records and witnesses, Judge Mohammed Bazlur Rahman of Senior Judicial Magistrate court handed down the verdict.//////Criminals killed a man and took away his motorbike near Kamdia bazaar in Gobindaganj upazila on Tuesday.

He is a degree holder in Marine Studies from UK, and is showing his outmost keenness to tackle the affects of climate change and save his country from permanent inundation.//////Bangladesh is a country of huge tourism potential. We have a district called Bandarban, which is a paradise of natural beauty. It attracts both the domestic and foreign tourists. It is a place that we can be proud of. Bandarban is a district situated in South-Eastern Bangladesh, and a part of the Chittagong Division and Chittagong Hill Tracts. Bandarban is also recognized as Arvumi or the Bohmong Circle (of the rest three hill districts Rangamati is the Chakma Circle and Khagrachari is the Mong Circle). Bandarban town is the home town of the Bohmong Chief (currently King, or Raja, Aung Shwe Prue Chowdhury) who is the head of the Marma community. It is the administrative headquarters of Bandarban district, which is one of the most exotic tourist attractions in Bangladesh. //////Many letters and suggestions have been put forward regarding facilitating and easing the prevailing unbearable chaotic traffic jam situation in Dhaka city and also in other district towns. Every day we find that a lone traffic policeman is managing road traffic at important and chaotic road points. Many of the drivers are impatient, ill-mannered, impolite and easily given to quarrels. We noticed that it is not humanly possible for a single person to facilitate movement of motorized, non-motorized vehicles. They are overworked and over-stressed. In short, it has become an absolute necessity and imperative to deploy more traffic policemen at all the points for better and efficient management of road traffic.//////Mr. Masum Ahmed's letter on Effective Solution published in your daily on 2nd Nov.09 makes much sense. The introduction of shuttle trains can significantly reduce traffic in Dhaka at the minimum possible time and cost. //////I feel I should wage another war against all those who are taking away our right to personal dignity and freedom. How can we tolerate a policeman in independent Bangladesh torturing an innocent reporter (Mr. Masum of New Age) in public in a way that will even put to shame the most barbarous people on earth. //////There has now been a big credibility gap between what the govt. says and what actually is happening all over the country. When an engineer was gunned down the other day in the city the home minister termed it as a stray (bichinno) event but when Barrister Tapash miraculously survived a bomb attack only a couple of days later in front of his own office at Motijheel, none believed it to be so as the latter is a sitting MP and nephew of the PM herself. What is notable is that the incident took place only a few hours after the departure of the PM on an official visit abroad. Besides, everybody knows Mr. Tapash has been playing a very vital role in all important cases including those of the BDR mutiny, war criminals and the Bangabandhu murder case. Whatever the nature of the incidents, they all indicate that our law and order situation is far from normal and the failure of the home ministry is quite obvious. //////Bangladesh is a small and poor country. There are thousands of problems here. But it is a matter of regret that we do not find out the main problem in Bangladesh. Actually, population boom is the main problem that the country is facing. We will not be able to change our country if we do not check our population growth. //////Education is said to be the backbone of a nation. But it is a matter of great regret that even after 38 years of liberation no specific and effective education commission has yet been formed. As a result, the learners are being deprived of proper education and they will lag behind in any competition in the age of globalisation. So the govt. should take necessary steps to form such an education commission which will be acceptable to all and will continue for 50 years at least. Having no such commission, changes are coming in the syllabus over and over again which are really harmful for the students. In light of it, I can't but mention a point here that education policy makers have included 40 marks in the syllabus for grammar for the learners of class 9 and 10 and there are 9 items of grammar for 40 marks and any 8 items carrying 5 marks each are set up in the question papers. Transformation of sentences is one of them. Here the thing to be noticed is that for 5 marks the students have to study at least 4 items of grammar. They are- sentences (according to meaning), sentences (according to structure), voice change, degree of comparison, etc. But in another 7 items this is not done. Now it can be said that this type of questions is quite unreasonable. In this case my suggestion is that it would be better to increase the number of grammatical items to 12 items (existing 9 items + i. sentences-both kinds, ii. voice change, iii. degree of comparison) instead of 9 and the students will answer the same items out of 12. And if it is done, the students will be benefited. Above all, a specific education commission is a must to develop the nation. //////We can't accept this injustice. (2001, 2003 SSC, HSC issue)//////It's a daily routine that thousands of passengers drop at Kakoli centre from northern part of greater Gazipur & Dhaka city. Among them most are office going and they gather at Kakoli point to go to Gulshan 2 and Banani Bazar. But it's a matter of regret that the number of vehicles is insufficient for thousands of passengers, especially in the morning. //////With reference to a few learned readers' comments about Awami League leaders, particularly the prime minister's not issuing an official condolence message on the sad demise of Mr. Saifur Rahman. One gentleman felt hurt and expressed his feelings in the letter column of your daily published on 21 October.//////Recently some surgeon(s) at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital stitched up a patient after surgery with a scalpel blade in the patient's abdomen (DS October 22). A small schoolgirl lost her life in the same hospital due the negligence of the doctor(s) on duty (TV news October 22). Almost every day many such incidents of criminal negligence, indifference, malpractice and incompetence by the doctors in Bangladesh are taking place in government and non-government hospitals. For obvious reasons it is not possible for the media to report all these unfortunate incidents. Since the liberation of Bangladesh we have not heard of any single case wherein any recalcitrant medical practitioner has been taken to task either by the government (ministry of health) or by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC), the two guardians of our national healthcare system. In some cases, after the incidents were reported in the media, inquiry committees were constituted. Reports and recommendations submitted by these committees were never made public, nor did we ever hear that any actions were taken against any wrongdoing doctor. Some cases were taken to the court of law by those aggrieved parties who could afford such litigation, but with no result. Because the relevant laws in our country do not protect the rights of the patients. Whenever the health ministry or the BMDC is asked about such an incident the bosses who run these offices always come out with the pet reply that they have not received any such complaint in writing from the aggrieved patient or his/her next of kin. The other very common reply to such a query is that the existing laws in this regard are not adequate to take a recalcitrant doctor to task. //////I am sure we all are very much aware about anime films. It is a popular item for today's young people.
