In the last four decades agriculture sector contributed a lot in the development of the country. We now read many success stories in the newspapers about the achievements in this sector. Recently a book entitled 'Agro Journalism' was published which could help the journalists present quality news and articles on agriculture. Undoubtedly, this book will help professional journalists improve the quality of their news. The advancement of agriculture is a continuous process. So we would like to have a glimpse of the latest innovations, progress and success in this sector as well as stories on what difficulties our farmers and scientists are facing working in this sector in this daily. The Daily Star is an esteemed newspaper. So we would request The Daily Star authorities to bring out a weekly page on agriculture. Hope the authorities would consider this proposal.//////Most of the roads in Gulshan and Banani are in a very bad condition. These roads used to be quite good. Recently the roads were dug to install huge sewerage pipes in place of small and old ones. When the work was over, they did not cover the drains properly with the soil. This resulted in uneven and bumpy roads. Again the debris piled up on both sides of the roads (and sometimes on the sidewalks) had narrowed down the roads and footpaths. The idea of replacing the small and old pipes with the big ones to improve the drainage system is very well thought. But it is a shame that while improving one area, the workers destroy the other surrounding areas. The authorities also carpeted the roads without levelling those. So the roads are still uneven and bumpy. It is obvious that there was no coordination in the whole work.//////I am flabbergasted at the comment of P.K Dutta, MD of Sonali Bank that Sonali Bank is not preparing any case against Hall-Mark group. Why did the MD of Sonali Bank try to shift his liabilities to the Anti Corruption Commission? What an excuse to allow plundering of people's money! Why is he afraid of starting criminal proceedings against Hall-Mark? While strongly condemning the unforgivable act of Hall-Mark group, we urge the finance minister to pressurize Sonali Bank to file a case against Hall-Mark.//////An article was published in DS' Forum magazine's October issue highlighting the inherent gender inequity in the 1961's Muslim Family Laws Ordinance. Granted that at the time of their inception, those laws marked progress and, similarly the advent of Islam in the seventh century marked an advancement of women's rights in that era. In the 21st century, the constitution, decency, or commonsense requires nothing less than that --individuals be treated equally before the law regardless of gender and religion.//////Your staff correspondent's interesting, though at the same time worrying, last page report published on 8th. October was an eye-opener.

I asked him why he was engaged in this hard work at this age instead of going to school. He replied, My father has been suffering from old age complications for the last six months. My mother is a housewife. I am the eldest among three brothers. So I left school and started working to feed my family." //////Nowadays devastating fire incidents have been occurring at various slums in Dhaka. I think these are not merely accidents rather these are done by some influential land -grabbers to occupy the land on which the poor live. Recently a devastating fire burnt 600 houses into ashes and left nothing for the unfortunate dwellers at Begunbari in Tejgaon industrial area. Now they are living under the open sky without food, water, and medicine. Even no organisation or the government has come forward to see their condition or give them assistance. I urge the government to take proper measures to compensate the slum dwellers and punish the criminals responsible for the fire accident.//////Twin blasts at a military base near Damascus by suicide bombers, one driving a bomb-laden ambulance, killed dozens of people while the fate of prisoners held there is unknown, a watchdog said yesterday.//////The India's ruling Congress party on Monday stood firm behind Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra saying any attack on him is an attack on the party itself.//////Accusing India's Congress-led UPA government of pursuing "anti-people" decisions, key regional politician Mayawati yesterday said her Bahujan Samaj Party will decide today on whether to continue its outside support to the government. //////BBC News has uncovered evidence that weapons intended for the Saudi military have been diverted to Syrian rebels.//////Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech Monday was filled with tough talk and slams of President Barack Obama's leadership but little of the clarity Romney has vowed to bring to the Oval Office, experts say.//////Taliban gunmen in Pakistan shot and seriously wounded a 14-year-old schoolgirl who rose to fame for speaking out against the militants, authorities yesterday said.//////Mitt Romney got a poll boost from his strong debate performance against President Barack Obama but it is too early to know how significant or lasting the bounce for the Republican challenger will be.//////Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi on Monday pardoned all those arrested during last year's popular uprising that ousted the country's former leader Hosni Mubarak.//////One in eight people worldwide still suffers from chronic hunger, the UN's food agency said yesterday, describing the figure as "unacceptable" and warning that the fight against hunger was slowing down.//////Nine people who put up bail for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, including two members of the British aristocracy and a Nobel Prize winner, were ordered to pay 93,000 pounds ($150,000) on Monday after Assange took refuge in Ecuador's embassy.//////The Philippine Supreme Court yesterday suspended a controversial cybercrime law, amid huge online protests over fears it would impose severe curbs on Internet freedoms.//////He is reputed across the globe for his valiant explorer style photography -- featuring the most exotic places.

Noted portrait photographer Nasir Ali Mamun inaugurated the exhibition on October 4. Rabin Ahsan, director of Srabon Poster Gallery, delivered the welcomed speech at the inaugural session. //////It is broken hearts you see in Ramu. Something of the spirit has gone out of the men and women who have all their lives practised the principles enunciated by Lord Buddha. When you recall the mayhem let loose on Buddhist monasteries nearly two weeks ago, when you observe the ferocity with which fanatical Muslim mobs destroyed the images of Buddha and set fire to Buddhist religious texts, you tend to ask yourself: is this the country we so assiduously created through a bitterly fought war in 1971? When you hear the leading Buddhist religious figure inform you and the entire country that he had not imagined, back in the months when he gave sanctuary in his temple to Muslims, Hindus and Christians during the war even as the Pakistan occupation army pursued them, that forty years down the line those same people or their descendants would put Buddhist homes, temples and religious texts to the torch, you feel that wrench in the heart. And you are ashamed, for these mobs which for hours caused the fire and danced around it in savage delight, have shamed us before an entire world.//////Given that the ultimate aim of every Indian politician is to be re-elected, their opinion about the Manmohan Singh government's policy of permitting foreign direct investment (FDI) is contingent upon how the policy affects their vote share.//////Bangladesh is a secular, multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual state, and it has an impressive record of communal harmony admired by Asian and Western countries.

Before saying anything about mental health let us define health. According to World Health Organization (WHO), health is the complete state of physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely absence of disease or infirmity. So, health has three components -- physical, mental and social. We do exercises to improve our physical health, but the other components of health are neglected, underestimated and undermined. //////The nation is going to observe the 18th death anniversary of a noted genius, world reputed artist S.M. Sultan. I had the opportunity to meet and take interviews of many luminaries of Bangladesh, and S.M. Sultan was one of them. //////
