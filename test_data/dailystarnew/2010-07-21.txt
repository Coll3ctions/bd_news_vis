Coming on the heels of an earlier HC directive on the issue, this warning should be an eye-opener for the authorities. It should alert it to the clear violation of the law and human rights that the law enforcers themselves have been indulging in of late. By taking up the matter in right earnest, the judiciary has given the nation to understand that not all is lost, that indeed it is possible for us to have the rule of law form the centerpiece of collective life in the future. In other words, there is reason to hope that decency and morality along with the law will eventually be the cornerstone of life in Bangladesh.//////DESPITE our comments to the contrary that the proposed amendment to Telecommunication Act, 2001 which appeared draconian to us should while being regulatory needn't be sweepingly stringent, the law as passed in parliament on Monday, has belied our expectations.

In general this will be constructed over the existing main roads having columns on the middle of roads, so paying compensation for acquiring new land will be minimum. //////River bank erosion has increased with the rise of water level in major rivers. The erosion wiped out villages, habitation, properties, cultivable land and threatened towns. In the mean time, there is severe erosion in Kurigram, Lalmonirhat and Brahmaputra. The erosion causes untold miseries to the affected people. This is happening year after year. But unfortunately there is no provision to rehabilitate them.

There was a piece where the writer discussed the prison sentences and questioned whether providing facilities there would encourage people to go there and what would deter the criminals from committing crimes. In his famous book, "The Great Train Robbery", Late Michael Crichton also discussed these in some details. I think it was Bryce Ciurtenay who had written about England and how the English rulers tried to get rid of the criminals by deporting them.//////This refers to the news report regarding a section of government employees who had allegedly leaked question papers. They used an innovative method to supply question papers to the candidates they had an agreement with. Intelligence warning on such leakage plot led to police action. While the Intelligence Bureau should be commended for sounding an alarm just five days before the question leakage from the Bangladesh Government Press in Rangpur, it is remarkable that the police were able to take cognisance of the warning and act on it. In view of the fact that the leakage occurred long time earlier, the information from the IB should have been given proper importance and adequate precautions taken. //////The drive against 20 years old vehicles running on the city's most busy routes is welcome.

It seems that there is nobody to oversee things when it comes to the DCC and its redundant Mayor. //////A lot of English medium schools are available in Dhaka city like video shops but who are the teachers over there and what's their qualification? //////The prime minister and her cabinet colleagues do often speak about development of the railways along with new railway lines including raising single tracks to double tracks.

This negative politics can do little good to society. //////Prof. Bais's appreciation for the introduction of teaching evaluation at JNU (published in Daily Star 18 July) is well placed. However, if I were him, I would brace myself for a few surprises and probably start thinking of ways to deal with them in advance; hence the reason for writing here. //////No doubt, cell phone is a boon to our modern-day living. It helps us to keep in touch with nearest and dearest ones plus in maintaining important communications. But unfortunately the cell phone users often ignore safety codes. Recently, I witnessed in a Malaysia Airlines flight that in spite of repeated requests over microphone, quite a number of passengers continued using their cell phones. Many air-passengers are reluctant to appreciate the risk of operating cell phones particularly during take-off and landing because modern aircrafts are being digitally controlled. The cell phone signals may cause serious interference to aircraft's digital communication network and cause malfunctioning with errors. //////This is about your Star Business Report of 15th. July on the Round Table organised by the 'Energy & Power' magazine on its seventh anniversary. The main topic of discussion, was based on the government's recently published five year master plan on additional sources of power generation between the years 2010 to 2015. The key note paper however, presented a total generation in five years; of 9426 MW of power, from traditional energy sources which are natural gas, liquid fuel (diesel &furnace oil) and coal only. Three important major issues on this matter, which are critical for the power sector in Bangladesh connotation, were unfortunately not covered in the keynote paper presented.

He is known commonly as DL Roy.//////A coming-of-age story, Udaan is an impressive debut feature by Vikramaditya Motwane that covers familiar first-film ground with emotional conviction and freshness. A kind of Indian cousin to Truffaut's 400 Blows, Udaan follows the fortunes of Rohan (the fresh-faced Rajat Barmecha), an aspiring writer whose horizons shrink when he's kicked out of prep school. He is sent home to Jamshedpur, an industrial town in northeast India, to live with a father he hasn't seen in years and a 6-year-old half brother, Arjun, he didn't know he had.//////Nithari village, in the western part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, borders Delhi. Like most other villages, Nithari may have been consigned to anonymity had it not been for the discovery of as many as 17 sets of skulls and bones of women and children in a drain in December 2006. A local businessman, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic help Surinder Kohli were arrested on suspicion of murder and subsequently booked. However, while Kohli has been served death sentences, Pandher was let off the hook but might be resentenced if found guilty in the remaining five cases that are sub judice.//////Popular talent hunt for young women, 'Lux-Channel i Super Star' kicks off this year through registration.

And that is the beauty of democracy. In the early 1950s, Harry Truman did a similar thing when he dismissed Douglas MacArthur and ordered him to return to Washington. In the Far East, a disbelieving MacArthur told his soldiers: "I shall return." He then went home to a hero's welcome. But he never made it back to his men.//////FORMER Indian union minister and Congress MP Mani Shankar Aiyar came for a four-day visit to Dhaka. He was accompanied by a 21-member delegation of industrial leaders from the northeast.

Ongoing reform initiatives of Bangladesh police are, therefore, very much in the public eye.//////THE Chinese economy has been growing at 10% annually since the beginning of economic reform in the late 1970s.
