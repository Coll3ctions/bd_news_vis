In fact, it should have been 2. We regret the error. //////THE elections to the four city corporations and nine municipalities should give the country reasons for optimism. The manner in which the elections were conducted leave us with little doubt about the fairness and transparency of the entire process. A general atmosphere of peace prevailed during the voting; and with no sign of any interference or manipulation or intimidation noticed anywhere, there is reason to believe that a restoration of democracy could finally be turning out to be an attainable goal. The turnout of voters, especially where women's participation is concerned, has been significant. //////TWO images about the latest tremor in Mymensingh and Dhaka have jolted us into a sort of apprehension of what could have happened if the intensity of the earthquake were higher on the Richter scale. First, as it is, damages were inflicted at Dhuraura and Haluaghat in Mymensingh, Durgapur in Netrakona and Nalitabari in Sherpur. Secondly, panicked students of Dhaka University jumped out of their dormitories, many of them hurting themselves and landing in hospitals.//////IT is time we got serious about elections. With the rest of the world going about life, going through it in the way everyone should, it is surely not right that we should be falling behind. In these long months since the end of the BNP-Jamaat government in this country, elections have thrown out governments and brought in new administrations around the world. //////INDO-Bangladesh relations are so pervasive and multi-dimensional that they exist independent of governments and policies. The arrival of Rahul Gandhi in Bangladesh on August 1, for a five-day visit to get first-hand knowledge of the activities of Brac in various sectors, and micro-finance projects of Grameen Bank, is a testiomony to this fact.//////NEWLY elected President Ramboron Jadav of Nepal invited the Maoist CPNM to demonstrate its majority in the Constituent Assembly (CA) within a week and, thereby, form the next government. Election to the CA was held in April, so why the delay in forming a new government?

Reports say that hundreds of Bangladeshi workers were tortured and sent back home, within this week, with no pay while they were demanding an increase in payment. We have also seen the video footage of how the Kuwaiti police were torturing these workers who went to this foreign land to make a few dollars to support their family back home. Some sources say that these workers are getting about $30 a month. Wow! Only one dollar per day for 8 to 10 hours of hard work. It is hard to believe what this oil producing nation of the Middle East is doing to the people from the poor nations. As the citizens of the world, we condemn both the physical abuse and the unfortunate low payment to these workers, and we demand an increase in their salary.//////Adulteration of food has taken a serious turn. The unscrupulous elements are taking advantage of the absence of any provision for strict punishment and administrative supervision for implementation of the same to discourage and deter them from such heinous and dreadful activities. Pouring of various types of chemicals for preservation and ripening of various kinds of foods, edible oil, fish, vegetables, fruits etc. is the order of the day with very little resistance from the administration. Use of DDT on dry fish which is a poison is very common these days. The consumers are totally helpless before these traders or businessmen in the absence of any support from the country's legal system and the administration. Some casual drives are made occasionally by the administration in some places here and there and imposition of nominal fines or three months' simple imprisonment hardly made any lasting impact on the dishonest traders and their heinous activities are going on unabated. Food adulteration is a criminal offence of highest magnitude and, therefore, would warrant maximum punishment for the offenders such as capital punishment. Capital punishment for adulteration of food is normal all over the world. But why the law is so lenient to the offenders in our country for such a grave offence which amounts to slow poisoning of the entire population is anybody's guess. //////Internet has become the life-blood to modern civilization. But in Bangladesh this great opportunity has not reached all the students due to the shortage of computers. It is true that nowadays a lot of institutions based on Internet have emerged but the number is still not enough.//////More than 7 lakh students have passed the SSC exams this year. And now it seems that it is a fault of theirs! They are now suffering, because they are not getting the opportunity of admission to a good college or a college at all. Thousands of students have achieved very good results. And generally these meritorious students want to get admitted to a good and renowned college. But the reality is that the colleges cannot accommodate the students. This problem is getting serious year by year. The situation makes the students frustrated. The problem must be addressed as a matter of top priority. The government should take the initiative to increase the number of quality educational institutions. //////My vision got glued into many pairs of little hands sticking out, holding the steel rods of a heavily ribbed closed front gate of an English medium school at Uttara the other day while I was passing by to meet an urgent piece of business. The time was during the tiffin break. I could only mange to see some dark figures of those caged children holding the gate, it seemed as if they were trying to breathe some fresh air. //////The letters column is the most interesting and instructive column for the curious and serious newspaper readers. It covers almost all subjects imaginable; from the ridiculous to the sublime! It's an interesting melting pot of ideas covering every imaginable theme, and written by people of various hues; serious, curious and even quixotic and sometimes witty.//////In reply to my letter dt.21/07/08 Prof. SAM has once again written on the above issue (Ref: DS, his letter, dt.30/07/08).//////Recently, the caretaker government endorsed an Ordinance named Real Estate Management Ordinance-2008. No doubt it is a good effort to remove the forgeries in real estate market of Bangladesh. //////Most of the contestants in the city and municipality polls have questionable credentials. They were orchestrating to comeback and take away the country to the position before the changeover. The voters have no alternative but to vote for the corrupt candidates because there are very few candidates with a clean image. The ray of hope is fading away//////After a long time of its inception, if we try to justify the existence of Saarc, we have to think for a while to get the right answer. This regional organisation is always busy arranging formal meetings among the leaders. But the ultimate achievement is a big zero. //////The revised ordinance has made it possible to compose and commission the long awaited Truth Commission (TC).

Well, we are trying our best but the government needs to change a number of existing policies that discourage NRBs to come and invest in various sectors. //////ACCA (The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) is the oldest (more than 100 years old) professional accounting body in the world. Its acceptance is world-wide and still it is growing. Some people call it 'British CA' as this degree-holders can conduct audit work in England like CAs (Chartered Accountants). Knowing its goodwill and reputation, Bangladeshi students are becoming interested in enrolling in this course. More than 10 local tuition providers are imparting this course in our country so that students can participate in it staying in his/her country.//////It has come to my notice that some teachers of English medium schools in Dhanmondi and other areas are not at all qualified. Recently, I went to admit my daughters at a renowned school in Dhanmondi and to my surprise I was baffled after meeting with the teachers. The attitudes of the teachers clearly indicated that they were merely housewives who have joined schools to pass their time. //////A few recommendations to our government for our growth and prosperity. //////Nowadays, price hike is a common phenomenon. The market prices of commodities have gone beyond the purchasing power of common people. As a result, a kind of inflation is emerging in our economic system. //////We are anxiously observing the incidents of extra-judicial killing by the law-enforcing agencies. This savage and barbaric act of killing in the name of crossfire was introduced by the last four-party government, but such things exist nowhere in the modern world except Bangladesh. The criminal also has the right of self-defence and has to suffer a punishment if convicted or proved to be guilty by a legal court of justice. But, interestingly, Razakars are safe in our country.//////Radovan Karadzic is now facing trial for committing war crimes including genocide against Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians during the Bosnian War (19921995). But Bush's murders are sophisticated with the pre-approval of the United Nations! During the tenure of senior Bush 500,000 Iraqi children died due to the unjust sanctions.

In a recent conversation, the artiste shared her fond memories of Shantiniketan with //////. //////The basic thing to understand about Rabindranath Tagore, says Lala Rukh Selim, of the Department of Sculpture, DU, is that he was active in almost every field of culture. "He contributed to almost every field of culture, specially the development of modern literature, music, fine arts, etc. of Bengal. Regarding his contributions to fine arts of Bengal, he has contributed uniquely; He was present during one of the crucial stages of Bengal art, when the people of Bengal realised anew that India had a unique cultural past and the artists of Bengal wanted to go back to the past and bring it to the present context, with transformations which gave rise to the Bengal School. When Abanindranath Tagore and others established the Bengal School of Art, Rabindranath was active at that time."//////On the 67th death anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore different satellite channels will telecast special programmes today. //////BANGLADESH came into existence because of the folly of the pro-establishment politicians and the misjudgment of the ruling military junta, who were in power between 1958 and 1971. During this period, the people of Pakistan were ignored by the military regimes. Naturally enough, there was no participatory democracy. The Basic Democracy of Gen. Ayub was a mockery of democracy. Nothing better could be expected of the military rulers of the then Pakistan. //////IT was a get-together of my school friends. The host, a retired engineer, like the rest of us is in his autumn age. More precisely, we are in our sixties. One of the guests, a self-employed friend of ours, asked our host the engineer what he did with his time. Our host replied that he had earned the retirement and he did not intend to make mincemeat out of it. Besides, with so many television channels, it is no longer a task. //////AS the debate on Iran rages in the United States, the hawks need to examine the 2003 Iraq War and its aftermath, pondering the wisdom of George Santayana: "Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it." Defeating President Saddam Hussein's army was the easy part; what followed proved catastrophic for both the United States and Iraq. //////SOME critics have accused this column of being anti-Western. Not true! When I describe Western civilisation as "a loathsome, suppurating planet-sized disease blighting the planet" I mean it as a compliment. //////Devotees slowly begin to gather for the weekly prayer.
