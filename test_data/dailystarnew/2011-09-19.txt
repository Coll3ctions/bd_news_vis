Islam is always being blamed for these attacks, but does Islam really support terrorism? The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Kindness is a mark of faith, and whoever is not kind has no faith." He (pbuh) also said, "A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim. So he should neither oppress him nor hand him over to an oppressor. And whoever fulfills the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs." After reading at least these two hadiths, we can be sure that Islam does not support terrorism.

I would urge all the Muslims to stand united and defend this peaceful religion, Islam.//////We can rest assured that depressing news will be awaiting us every day.

It is surprising that the authorities responsible for repairing the roads wait to see that the roads are damaged severely during the rainy season, so that the repair cost and the sufferings of the commuters reach the peak.

He wrote, "It is not a divine and infallible edict and criticizing it should not mean that we have to question that person's loyalty, allegiance or patriotism. The constitution itself guarantees the right to free speech. The irony is that the constitution also guarantees certain fundamental human rights and expressly prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Yet on a daily basis, in the name of remand, citizens routinely face police brutality in the form of threats, intimidation and torture. However, I have a doubt whether our politicians will pay any attention to this letter. AL government is now using constitution to torture people and kill democracy again. Corruption is NOT permitted in the constitution but both AL and BNP made this nation champion in corruption several times. Alas! These two parties talk for the constitution more than others. Influencing the judiciary is absolutely against the fundamental principles of the constitution. //////At least 20 protesters were killed in the Yemeni capital Sanaa yesterday, when security forces opened fire on one of the biggest demonstrations against President Ali Abdullah Saleh in recent months, a Reuters witness said.//////A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake rocked northeastern India yesterday, killing as many as eight people, including five who died in tremors that rocked neighbouring Nepal.//////Powerful explosions and machinegun fire shook the besieged Libyan desert town of Bani Walid yesterday as Gaddafi loyalists shelled lines held by interim government attackers.//////After decades of military rule Aung San Suu Kyi says there are finally signs of political change in Myanmar, but its long-suffering people are still far from real freedom.//////Opponents of President Bashar al-Assad met in Damascus yesterday, calling for the continuation of popular protests to overthrow the "tyrannical" regime in power in Syria.//////President Barack Obama today will call for a higher minimum tax rate on millionaires to ensure they pay the same rate on their earnings as middle-income taxpayers, a White House official said.//////Four months after leading her party Trinamool Congress to power, Paschimbanga Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has started electioneering for the September 25 by-polls. //////Israel's prime minister predicted yesterday that the Palestinians' quest for UN membership would fail because it bypasses negotiations with the Jewish state, and said he was working close with Washington to ensure the statehood bid withers in the Security Council.//////Fighting broke out in a northern district of the Yemeni capital Sanaa yesterday, the latest breach of an uneasy ceasefire between tribesmen opposed to President Ali Abdullah Saleh and troops loyal to him.//////Hundreds of Chinese have mounted violent protests against a solar panel factory in eastern China over three days, accusing it of cancer-causing pollution, state media reported yesterday//////Sudan and South Sudan signed a border security agreement yesterday and said they would set up 10 crossing points, the first time the two neighbours have signed a deal over the tense boundary since the south declared independence in July.//////At least 15 people have been killed in an attack on the Ivory Coast's armed forces in the country's southwest, according to state television.//////There is evidence linking the Pakistani government with the Taliban-allied Haqqani network of militants, the US ambassador in Islamabad said, blaming the group for last week's siege in Kabul.//////At least three people including a Korean national were killed and about 25 injured near the Sri Lankan capital when a passenger train crashed into the back of another train, police said.//////An unmanned United States drone aircraft crashed in Pakistan's lawless northwestern tribal district yesterday after suffering a technical fault, local security officials said.//////A Cairo court sentenced former tourism minister Zuheir Garana yesterday to three years in prison for illegally issuing operating licences to tourism companies, the state news agency MENA reported.//////A pro-Russia party has won the most votes in Latvia's snap general election but without an absolute majority.//////Martin McGuinness, a former commander of the IRA and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, was officially confirmed yesterday as his Sinn Fein party's candidate for next month's Irish presidential election.//////Me in My Inner Soul, the first solo watercolour exhibition of Gopal Chandra Saha, began on September 13 at Zainul Gallery, Faculty of Fine Arts (FFA), University of Dhaka. //////Seasoned Bangladeshi actor Bobita has been selected as the Goodwill Ambassador for Distressed Children and Infants International (DCI).

It was that unless the government did some good work, the opposition may be voted into office in the next election, and in that case they (that is, leaders of incumbent government) might have to end up in jail.//////She appeared for just that split second that television reserves for images it cannot fully comprehend.
