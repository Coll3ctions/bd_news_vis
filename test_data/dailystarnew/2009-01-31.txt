We need to recognize that we're not grappling with a single economic crisis. We face three separate crises, which are interwoven but which are also distinct and different. The solution to any one of them won't automatically resuscitate the larger economy if the others remain untreated and unchanged.//////Them game wardens frown, really frown, if you put feed on the wooter to git the birds, Cody informed me conversationally. We were outside West Ocean City, driving through reed-covered wetlands towards St Michael's river. Like all Eastern Shore natives he said 'wooter' instead of 'water'. So did Jeanne, his sister. It was a December morning, bitterly cold, yet the windows on the Ford pickup were down. The wind whipped at my face, blistering it. I tried not to show the pain - I didn't want Cody to change his mind at the last minute about taking a city boy hunting.//////This beginning-of-the-new-year issue of////// is justly an invigorating one, a sentiment that is echoed by Ashrifa K Nova of Tejgaon, Dhaka, writing in her letter to the editor that readers expecting to encounter something new in the pages of ////// are seldom disappointed.

The novel's action centers around the Naxalite movement in the year 1977, and Ghanashyam was awarded the 2001 Ramananda Chattapadhya Memorial Award for it. //////Surely you've noticed how, as soon as you get out of the city, the sight of trees and greenery lifts up the spirits, even to the point of elation. The reason for this, I'm certain, has to do with evolutionary psychology. Our mind is essentially the same as that of our earliest ancestors on the African savanna, where foliage meant food to pluck or trap or hunt. Plants and trees and grassland, so to speak, meant both nature and nurture.//////We all have 2 kidneys. Main job of kidneys is to clean our blood. Our kidneys process about 200 liters of blood every day and excrete metabolic waste products through urine. In addition, kidneys also help us control our fluid, salt and acid-base balance, control blood pressure, strengthen bone and maintain hemoglobin level. //////Everybody knows that second-hand smoke is bad but a very few people are aware of third-hand smoke, a relatively new hazard identified recently.

The purpose of the well planned, barbaric but fruitless Israeli onslaught was to extirpate Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, from Gaza. Below is a brief analysis of the political maneuvering during the conflict, the brunt of which was borne by the battered civilian Palestinians, and its aftereffect which is perceived to be more threatening than the war itself. //////INDIA is Bangladesh's closest neighbour. India shares its longest border (2,840 km) with Bangladesh. Although the border is demarcated, there are a few unresolved issues such as enclaves and adverse possessed lands - legacy from the colonial past. The issue of water sharing of common rivers, especially of the Ganges and the barrage built across it in Farakka, West Bengal had been the greatest irritant. Some issues remain unresolved mainly due to bureaucratic dillydallying and political backsliding. More recently, the maritime boundary issues have come up. The position of the two countries on this issue is not too divergent and given the political will, the issue could be resolved to the satisfaction of both the parties. Arms and drugs smuggling, human trafficking, movement of criminals and extremist elements across the border are of common concern to both the countries. Thankfully, these issues are receiving due attention of both the governments.//////THE good side of the political changeover is that an elected government has taken over from the overstaying caretakers; the bad side of it however is that the opposition has been virtually wiped out. As a result, along with the nation, Awami league was also stunned by the result and refused to celebrate. Democracy's indispensable institution -- the opposition - the check or brake, is missing. The emerging democratic order has virtually wiped out the 'government in waiting'. The Grand Alliance is a vote-catching billboard, every inch of it depends on the acumen of the ruling Awami League leadership and how they are going to steer through without an effective opposition. Without the culture of collective leadership, the very fundamental of parliamentary democracy, everything depends on Sheik Hasina. She is the all-powerful Prime Minister, president of the Awami League, leader of the alliance and the leader of the House. Overwhelming concentration of power in one hand usually produces arrogant leadership and goes against the spirit of parliamentary democracy.//////Nurul Islam was not content to be on the stands while the history of Bangladesh was being forged bit by significant bit. He was a participant. And that participation dates back to the early 1960s when, as part of a team of young Bengali economists in Pakistan, he played his due role in the development of what would later become known as the 'two economies' or two distinct systems theory as advocated for East and West Pakistan. Sure, the powers that were (and their symbol was General Ayub Khan) could not be receptive to the idea. Implicit in the idea of two economic systems for the two wings of Pakistan, or so reasoned Ayub and the entrenched class of West Pakistani rulers, was the eventual secession of the Bengali east from the more prosperous west. But that did not preclude President Ayub from summoning Islam and his friends to a meeting, to ascertain the nature of their observations. The young Bengalis put the argument before the military ruler as best they could. Ayub listened, after which no more was heard from him.//////Lara holds the story of the writer's daughter.
