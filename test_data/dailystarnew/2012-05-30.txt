Later, they were handed over to Benapole port police.//////Every morning while going to school I see children of my age collecting garbage from the big garbage cans. While my morning starts with a healthy breakfast, their morning starts with collecting garbage. This crude reality makes me very sad when I imagine their lives in poverty. People are totally indifferent to child labour although the government has enacted certain laws regarding child labour. I also found out that the child labours are paid a meagre amount of money for their work only because they are children! What are the authorities doing? In The Daily Star and many other dailies I read how the DoE fines factories for pollution and grabbing and how BSTI penalizes eateries for unhygienic food etc but I have never heard or read that any balloon factory or brick factory has been penalized for letting children work there. //////I went to Dowarabazar upazila of Sunamganj for doing a field work from ICDDR,B in January 2012.

I was searching for houses where there were children under five years for a short interview with the mother of the children. //////Nishat Majumder and Wasfia Nazreen have proved that in spite of living in an oppressive society like Bangladesh, they have the courage and potential to fulfil their dreams. Indeed, they have set a great example for all the women of Bangladesh. I appreciate their parents for being open-minded and supportive of them throughout their journey. It is disappointing but true that in most of the families girls are taught to be coy and demure and to keep their eyes down. But now we have two women whose eyes were at the highest point of the world and eventually they succeeded in reaching there. //////Electricity for free! How does it sound? Of course weird, but that's how it is. Here in Houston, Texas, Txu Energy is offering free electricity to the consumers all night long in a bid to win more customers. Well, everything is a matter of supply and demand. Texas is perhaps producing more electricity than its requirement; as a result it is offering free electricity to the customers at night.//////My sincere thanks to the DS for doing the follow up story titled A sacrifice and a family in trouble.

The fate of an affected family changes forever after the accident occurs.//////The recent criticism by the government high ups against Prof. Yunus's Nobel achievement reminds me of the Hindi serials. The stories are mainly based on quarrel among family members. Actually, this is the true reflection of our people's mentality. If we look back to our history, we will see that the people always created obstacle in the way of our great achievements. The British knew it very well that if they could break our unity, they could easily establish their rule in this subcontinent. Creating dispute centring personal interests was a technique of the British to divide our nation. The British left our country many years ago. But still we can not come out of this mentality. There are some achievements that the country will remember forever. Prof. Yunus' winning the Nobel peace prize is one of those. We the Bangladeshis should not say anything against him because we are on the same side. We should remember that one can not hide obe's failures by criticising others.//////In the highest-level contact between India and Aung San Suu Kyi, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday held talks with Myanmar's democracy icon in Yangon, just hours before she left for Thailand in her first foreign visit in 24 years.//////Peace envoy Kofi Annan expressed "grave concern" to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad yesterday and Western nations threw out its envoys to protest against a massacre of 108 civilians, many of them children, in the town of Houla.//////Egypt's cabinet was scheduled to meet yesterday after a presidential election turned violent when protesters torched the offices of a runoff candidate from the regime of ousted president Hosni Mubarak.//////A Russian computer firm has discovered a new computer virus with unprecedented destructive potential which could be used as a "cyberweapon" by the West and Israel against foes such as Iran.//////US President Barack Obama has personally overseen a top-secret process for determining which al-Qaeda suspects should be placed on a "kill list," the New York Times reported yesterday.//////Sudanese troops withdrew from the contested region of Abyei on the border with South Sudan yesterday, as demanded by the United Nations, state-linked media reported.//////UN leader Ban Ki-moon raised fears about Nepal's stability after the country's divided parties failed to meet a Sunday deadline to write a new constitution.//////Nato yesterday said that al-Qaeda's second in command in Afghanistan had been killed in an air strike near the Pakistani border.//////We have read about the 'Occupy protests' taking place across the world.

The world's seventh-most populous country needs a government devoted not to a perennial political vendetta, but to tackling poverty, climate change and terrorism."//////There have been many drivers of change in the remarkable transformation of Bangladesh from a famine-stricken country always on the edge to a country now aspiring to become a middle income country. We, however, have not been so kind in celebrating all of our drivers of change. The contribution of Quamrul Islam Siddique, the visionary founder of LGED, in ushering in the first connectivity revolution via all-weather rural roads is one of the lesser-told stories of Bangladesh's transformation. //////Greece had been living beyond its means, by borrowing, even before it joined the Eurozone in 2002. It gave fake statistics to the European Union about its economy, hiding the huge loans it had taken. By 2009, it was revealed that Greece was about to default on repaying its debtors. The debt has bloated and now stands at 355 billion, which is 165% of its GDP (2011). //////Since 1991, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have been coming to power alternately. Just before the 1991 elections, Sheikh Hasina predicted that the BNP would get only 10 seats, but she herself experienced a humiliating defeat with only a little more than half the seats her rival achieved. The failure of the BNP brought the AL to power in 1996. Still people's perception about the two political parties did not swing too far during those elections, and so the gap in the number of parliamentary seats the two main parties got was not so big. But after having twice seen the two major parties alternately, people began to become more and more disappointed and the signs of this were reflected in election results. The national parliamentary election results in 2001 and 2008 gave landslide victory once to the BNP and then to the Awami League.//////
