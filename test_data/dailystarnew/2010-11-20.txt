For its banking system has lost confidence of the depositors and the government has already bankrolled to the tune of $60 billion to bail them out. As it happened in the USA in 2008 when the US government had to come to the rescue of the bankrupt financial institutions and big businesses, so it is now the turn of the Irish government to save its financial institutions with the taxpayers' money. But the government already facing a huge budgetary deficit is not in a position to shoulder the burden alone. Which is why it is now in need of external assistance to get over the crisis. //////Despite the ban, capturing and killing of animals belonging to the endangered species is going on unabated.

It is considered that the South Asian nations would play a vital economic role in the world in future. This has resulted in taking interest in the Pacific Ocean and Bay of Bengal by big powers. Future role of Bangladesh in this regard depends on power relation of powerful countries of south and south-east Asia .//////Traffic jam in Dhaka Metropolitan City is spiraling day-by-day defying all efforts of keeping this menace under control. Learned experts on this subject have so far suggested various measures, but results are not encouraging. Some have blamed railway level crossings for interruption to free flow of road traffic during passage of trains, and have suggested shifting of Dhaka Railway Station from Kamalapur to Tongi or Gazipur. Such a proposal needs to be examined in details and then come to a conclusion whether railway is at all to blame or deserves appreciation for its contribution towards reduction of traffic jam in Dhaka city.//////It is a privilege to have been able to follow Bangladesh since its birth in 1971. I had actually seen how the Pakistani authorities had tried to starve Bengalis to death after the cyclone of November 1970, and in 1971, in the refugee camps in India I assisted the struggle for the refugees to survive in appalling conditions where malnutrition and death was widespread. I saw in early 1972 to what extent the infrastructure and the economy of the country had been shattered. Later on, in 1974, during the famine conditions of Rowmari, Kurigram, I witnessed, on one occasion, about 6,000 local people waiting all day for the 400 chapatis being made every day at a particular gruel kitchen.//////The flag, which shows a variation of the Parthenon, the ancient Greek temple located in Athens, is readily recognised as the symbol of Unesco. It contributes to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, the rule of law and human rights, along with fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the UN Charter. To quote Irina Bokova, the first woman Director-General of Unesco: "Unesco was born from a simple idea. Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed. . . The new context demands that the conditions necessary for mutual understanding and peace-building be rethought. We must build a lasting universal human community, drawing on the fundamental values of humanity, and first and foremost on the resources of the mind. These are the stakes of this new humanism, where Unesco has a leading role to play." (Address in Milan, Italy on October 7.) //////Bangladesh possesses enormous area of wetlands. Rivers and streams, freshwater lakes and marshes (haors, baors, beels), water storage reservoirs, fish ponds, flooded cultivated fields and estuarine systems with extensive mangrove swamps are varieties of wetland in Bangladesh. However, the haors, baors, beels and jheels are of fluvial origin and are commonly identified as freshwater wetlands. These wetlands occupy four landscape units -- floodplains, freshwater marshes, lakes and swamp forests which have a wide range of ecological, socio-cultural, economic and commercial importance and values in Bangladesh. //////Let's first discuss the characteristics of a sustainable city. Policy development and decision making in sustainable cities takes into consideration the complex interactions among a number of different related fields and tries to make an across-the-board progress by minimizing harmful effects, including the degradation and exploitation of the natural environment. The following provides a list of some of these important issues://////Do you recall the famous hit song Do They Know it's Christmas? by Band Aid a British and Irish charity supergroup, founded in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. The record was released for the Christmas market that year. It was sung to raise funds for the impoverished of Ethiopia who were dying in the thousands due to famine while the rest of the world turned a blind eye upon their plight. It became the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK. The song struck a poignant chord in the hearts and minds of the affluent and aid and aid workers poured in to rescue their fellow man. You should listen to the song and ponder upon the lyrics.//////For many of us the term COPD seems to be novel, but the disease has been in operation for long and killing increased number of people by and by. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes lung diseases that make breathing difficult by limiting the airflow in and out of the lung. World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that COPD kills one person in every 10 seconds globally and predicts that it will become the third leading cause of death by 2030 unless urgent action is taken to reduce underlying risk factors.//////Sexually abused children are at increased risk of developing schizophrenia later in life, Australian researchers have found.//////Did you know your nails can reveal clues to your overall health? A touch of white here, a rosy tinge there, or some rippling or bumps may be a sign of disease in the body. Problems in the liver, lungs, and heart can show up in your nails. Keep reading to learn what secrets your nails might reveal.//////Hospital Information System (HIS) is vital for decision making and plays a crucial role in healthcare revolution. With computerisation of the medical records and documentation, clinicians and other healthcare professionals can access the information without delay or errors and make a better decision on time. But most of the Bangladeshi hospitals lack the appropriate system. However, implementing this system does not require much money; whereas, it can improve patient care, ensure patient safety and efficiency.//////All life depends on nitrogen sources for survival. Humans get their nitrogen from amino acids, which are the building blocks for proteins. Plants can synthesise all the amino acids needed for its survival, but human cannot do so. Human make certain amino acids but others come from the foods they eat.//////The agreement for a unity government comprising of major Iraqi parties came after months of uncertainty and tension. The US has for months urged Iraq's quarreling factions to create a government that includes all major ethnic and sectarian groups. Iran has also played an important role in the formation of the new government, which remains in the hands of Maliki, an ally of Iran.//////North Korea's nuclear weapons development programme has remained a worry for the world. Global efforts to rein in Pyongyang have yielded little results and the 'rogue' state continues to defy the world. What moreover worries the rest of the world is North Korea's support for Syria, Myanmar, Iran and Pakistan in their nuclear weapons development programmes. The only country, China, which can probably halt Pyongyang's nuclear programme and its support to other countries, continues to remain a suspect in its sincerity to do so. //////Jerusalem: The United States is to significantly increase the amount of military equipment held in Israel as part of a move to upgrade security ties between the two allies, press reports said Thursday.//////Tehran: Iran has conducted defence drills at its sensitive nuclear facilities, a senior commander told media on Sunday, adding that fresh aerial war games will be launched across the country next week.//////Oratory has since the beginning of civilised existence kept people in thrall. Shakespeare provided a clue to the riveting nature of speeches in his plays. You think here of Brutus and Mark Antony in Julius Caesar, of the many ways in which they played with words to convince the audience of the justness of the causes they held dear. But that was literature. In life lived from day to day, through the vagaries of politics, oratory has often been raised to the level of art. In Bangladesh's case, the speeches of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were ammunition, over the years, in the defence of liberty. Gandhi was not a rousing speaker, but the calm religiosity he brought into his words drove the point home. And then there was Syed Badrudduja, whose command of Bengali, Urdu and English was demonstrated to huge effect in his speeches, particularly in pre-partition India.//////Writers are supposed to be lonely people, living in a world of their own. Indeed, even in a crowded place the writer will seem to have little touch with all that is going around him. He will be in another world, a world of his own. People all around seem to be irrelevant to the imaginative world in which the writer is absorbed. His world is inhabited by imagination. The imaginative characters are at times worldly people but on others they are wild and totally out of this world. Demons and monsters, kings and queens, witches and wizards --- all crowd the imaginative world of the writer. In the real world the writer may be a lonely soul but in this world of imagination he is the king all his creations. He is surrounded by crowds, screaming, laughing or whispering in thousands of voices. //////
