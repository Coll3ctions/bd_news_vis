As a matter of fact, economists themselves are still immersed in expressing each of the indicators of development in measurable terms. That is when our understanding of what is going around in our life's conditions is enriched. //////SRI Lanka's leader has come down hard on demands for a probe into war crimes allegedly committed towards the end of the conflict between the government and the LTTE. President Mahinda Rajapakse does not think that the Sri Lankan army committed any crimes or excesses, but he does believe that the criminality the United Nations wants to be inquired into came from the defeated Tigers. It is a position that will not sit well with the global community. Nor does it help that the president has described such demands as a demonstration of sympathy towards terrorism. The record does not show that the international community and global bodies have at any time been supportive of terrorism anywhere and have on the contrary been vocal against any individuals or organizations engaging in violent means of changing politics anywhere.//////Cameroon became the first team to be knocked out of the World Cup after a 2-1 defeat to Denmark on Saturday, a result which also ensured Group E leaders Holland became the first country to reach the last 16.//////Half-time and things are looking bleak for the United States as they trail Slovenia 2-0 in their vital World Cup match.//////Five-time World Cup winners Brazil are looking for a much-improved World Cup performance against the Ivory Coast on Sunday having failed to impress in their opening win over North Korea.//////Ghana edged clear at the top of World Cup Group D after an exciting 1-1 draw with ten-man Australia at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday.//////Having lifted the Champions League, the Serie A title and the Italian Cup with Inter Milan, Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar now wants the World Cup and the crowning respect of his peers.//////Kaka is still crucial to Brazil's hopes of a sixth World Cup crown, according to teammate Robinho.//////FIFA has shifted its usual amnesty for yellow cards from the end of the first round until after the quarterfinals instead.//////Nobody in Argentina's World Cup camp, not even Lionel Messi, takes a better free-kick than Diego Maradona.//////Paraguay head into their clash with Slovakia in Bloemfontein on Sunday knowing a win would take them to the brink of qualification for the second round.//////The Italians proclaim defeat is unthinkable but the New Zealand All Whites are planning to give the defending champions a run for their money at the World Cup on Sunday.//////British newspapers were scathing Saturday about England's lacklustre performance in the 0-0 World Cup draw with Algeria, with striker Wayne Rooney's form causing particular concern.//////Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has hinted star striker Didier Drogba could start against Brazil in their Group G clash on Sunday.//////Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers reach personal landmarks as South Africa continued to plunder easy runs against West Indies in the second Test here on Saturday.//////Highflying German confidence took an unexpected tumble, England's haphazard showing got worse, while the never-say-die Americans proved their mettle once again on a day when referees caught more of the attention than football or its quality.//////If there is a trend to be taken early on in the World Cup it is that the Europeans are struggling and the South Americans are thriving.//////Harbhajan Singh smashed the penultimate ball from Mohammad Aamer for a six as India knocked Pakistan out of the Asia Cup with a three-wicket win on Saturday.//////Two middle-order collapses in Dambulla have handed Bangladesh an all-too-common early exit from a big tournament.

Israeli Defence Force (IDF) came on board the boats and killed at least 10 people who were bringing foods, medicines, and other essentials for the people of Gaza who are in dire need of those. //////This pertinent news, reported in all dailies on June 01, is an important achievement of the government. The significant fact is that education up to class eight will be free and compulsory! The idea of common public examinations at class five, eight, ten and twelve is also rational.//////May I echo Sikander Ahmed's request for the need of a newly-designed rickshaw to be on the streets? Like millions, I love the rickshaw - not only for its convenience and cheapness but the encouragement of a means of earning a living in a way that does not pollute the environment and responds to so many needs. Being able to see the sky overhead - oh, everything about it! //////The other day in late afternoon, a friend of mine asked me whether I was free or not. As my answer was affirmative he requested me to join him in going to Elephant Road to collect spectacles for his son studying abroad in Japan. After arriving at the designated optician, we found that the spectacles were not ready yet to be delivered. So we had to wait for a while for the delivery. //////Ilyas Kanchan, a famous cine artiste, lost his wife in a tragic road accident. Since then he started a campaign for 'Safer road'. My friend Ekram Ahmed, a senior bureaucrat, lost his teenage son under the wheels of a speeding truck. Ekram is now a 'Safer road' activist. Comparing to the number of motorised vehicles, death toll in Bangladesh roads is the highest in the world. But this epidemic has little impact in our society. Sporadic clashes occur when any student or a garment employee is killed in such accidents but most of such deaths go unnoticed. In some incidents, cases are filed with police stations. But we have not heard of any punishment in any such cases. It appears that we have become used to such deaths. A few years back highway police was established but we don't find any improvement of the situation.//////The recent incident of Begunnbari has shocked us all. It again proved that we are living in the unsafe concrete jungle. Rajuk is the top decision-making body which permits any owner to construct buildings in the DCC area. People are now claiming that this organisation doesn't carry out their responsibilities correctly.//////Your newspaper reported the Prime Minister being one of the first recipients of Machine Readable Passport (MRP) along with fourteen other citizens of the country. Ten of them are quite prominent citizens. The five unmentioned must be the labourers and students. The PM, her cabinet colleagues, the army chief, and the FBCCI president all receive special treatment at the airports. Nobody dare harass them in any airport - it's the poor labourers who suffer for lack of proper papers. Wouldn't it have sent a better signal if fifteen labourers and students were the first to receive the new passports? One can't help but notice that the implementation of this project has come not only late, but it's so late that the deadline for a new technology -- the e-passport or biometric passport -- is knocking on the door. According to ICAO regulations, the government will have to start issuing biometric passports from the year 2014. //////Begunbari and Nimtoli tragedy - both of the disasters were man-made. Unplanned urbanisation is the root cause of the disasters. What's the lesson that we get from the facts? Definitely decentralisation of Dhaka alongside industrial decentralisation.//////It is lamentable that most of the government offices of Bangladesh are extremely bureaucratic and inefficient. Most of the government organisations lack the smooth systems needed to serve the general people effectively. Public services in these government offices invariably involve redundant paperwork and unnecessary hassles, which often make people unwilling to ask for their services. Moreover, government employees in most of these organisations are corrupt, rude, uncooperative and extremely inefficient. Instead of helping troubled people, these government employees generally push them into deeper troubles and take advantage of people's helplessness. There's no effective monitoring mechanism, and administrative responsibilities are often handled with utter negligence. General people are frequently harassed by the employees and illegal agents who are good at making money out of people's predicaments. Most of these government offices epitomise the endless mismanagement and exploitations that our public administration is known for. //////On 29-05-2010 I attended a seminar at CIRDAP auditorium arranged under the auspices of PDI Policies and Development Ideas. The keynote paper was read by Engr. TAM Nurul Basher. He described the political history of the subcontinent dating back thousand of years and the partition of India into two countries in 1947 and three countries in 1971. It is true that these partitions brought undue miseries to its citizens. //////After the BTRC (Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission) had booted out many of the VOIP equipments terming these illegal and cancelling licenses of some telecom operators, it was heartening to note that Engr. Hasanul Haque Inu, Chairman of Parliamentary Committee, came out boldly stating that the govt. would adopt an open door policy in telecom sector and some 3,000 operators will be given licenses to operate VoIP. This was a relief to people who understand and operate telecom business.//////Road accidents, building collapse, fire disaster, etc, are becoming regular incidents. Most of the incidents are happening for lack of our consciousness. Apart from this, our government could not take any fair steps regarding these incidents. Whom will we blame? How long would we remain silent? //////The government cancelled the declaration of Amar Desh, a Bangla daily, on 1 June--stating that it has no authorised publisher.//////Poverty is the greatest problem facing humanity. Poverty has been defined as being "a punishment for a crime you didn't commit." Millions of children around the world are being punished every day - and their only "crime" was being born into poverty. While most children cry to buy toys or their favourite junk food, disadvantaged children beg to live. Their only concern is surviving each day as it comes. //////Flouting the international opinion and all norms of humanity, Israeli soldiers killed 9 unarmed innocent peace activists in the international maritime territory while they were on the way to Gaza with humanitarian aid on 31 May 2010. This audacity and boastful aggression has been denounced worldwide. But the saddest part of it is that the USA has failed to understand and evaluate the world sentiment. It has once again failed to denounce the fiend Israeli despot and interposed in taking a lenient resolution in the security council of the UN.//////The recent reports published in some national Bangla dailies regarding encroachments of land at various points of the Cox's Bazar sea beach are very disturbing. Experience tells us that once such process starts it goes on unabated and some government functionaries responsible for protecting public assets also join hands with the unscrupulous grabbers and create different excuses to support them. The euphemisms for such activities may be joint ventures for development, public-private enterprise and the like. I hope the media and concerned citizens will come forward and voice their opposition to snapping up of land by wealthy rapacious land grabbers in collusion with dishonest public servants and force the government to take appropriate steps to protect the longest sea beach of the world, one of our national treasures. //////Nowadays, "Branding Bangladesh" seems to be buzzing quite a lot- seminars, round-tables, and other events.

Clad in his signature dhoti and kurta, the great composer's creative and modern outlook to music changed the contours of sub-continental Indian music. A musical genius, he continues to mesmerise us with his haunting voice, with a rendition of folk- like Bengali songs as well as Hindi film songs. //////Federation of Film Societies of Bangladesh (FFSB) in association with Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) arranged a condolence programme on the recently deceased filmmaker Badal Rahman at the Seminar Hall, BSA, on June 18. Rahman's colleagues and fellow film activists as well as eminent personalities from other sectors reminisced on the life and work of the first ever children's filmmaker of the country.//////WE are familiar with the adage that courtesy costs nothing but buys everything. We now have to come to terms with a new saying which should be read as: Audacity buys nothing but costs everything. //////DEMOCRATIC polity in India was again exposed when details of the Bhopal gas tragedy came out. There was a nexus between the judiciary, the executive and the bureaucracy. All the three joined hands to let chairman Warren Anderson of Union Carbide, the company which owned the gas plant, escape from India. They also scaled down the compensation that the company had offered and delayed the court judgment by 26 years.//////JUNE 20 has always been a special day in my life on account of it, being my parents' marriage anniversary. The day is even more significant this year because it is their thirty-fifth such occasion. Way to go Zakers -- you have produced two wonderful children of whom I am sure you're mighty proud (I know I almost am!). //////DEAR Father: Today is father's day and it would have been nice if I had actually known you. Today is the day we celebrate your existence, love and support, of which I am yet to experience. I wish I could have painted a picture of us holding hands at school today. But how to paint a picture of a person I have never seen? Today is father's day, a joyous day, but there are only tears and anger flooding through my mind.//////YOU cannot begin to speak of the Chittagong mayoral election without taking note of the contributions of those who have made its outcome possible. Much as a joint secretary general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party would like to under-emphasise the role of the Election Commission in the conduct of the election, the unalterable truth is that Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and his team have convinced the nation that, on their watch, the people of Bangladesh can be privy to free and fair elections. They did it in December 2008. And they have done it again, in Chittagong. These are men we need if democracy is really to dig deeper roots in this country.//////
