She has told a group of human rights ambassadors from some European nations that her government is strictly opposed to such action and that if anyone is found engaging in extra-judicial killing, he or she will face the law. Coming against a background of questionable 'crossfire' killings, about which we made our views known only a few days ago, we think the prime minister's comments couldn't have come a day later. We therefore take hope from her expression of sentiment on the issue. Her realization that the unnatural deaths which have lately occurred have not been going down well either in Bangladesh or abroad (which again is quite natural) leads us into thinking that we can now look forward to a reversal of the situation.//////None other than the chairman of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Ghulam Rahman has voiced his concern over possible further dilution of the ACC's authority and mandate as an anti-graft watchdog body.

The BDR jawans seized 275 kilograms of powdered milk and a bagful of polythene from an Indian boat while being smuggled in on October 8.

It is situated close to Narayanganj. The renowned Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta visited it in the 14th century. It is the eastern terminus of the Grand Trunk Road, which was built by Sher Shah Suri in the 16th century, and which extends approximately 2500 kilometres across northern India and Pakistan to Peshawar in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province.//////This is to let you know that on September 29, 2009, I had flown to Thailand for a 15-day trip with a group of friends from Dhaka. On arrival, however, at the Thai airport, Shubarnabhumi, some immigration officers were asking to check our dollars in hand. Instantly, we showed them the dollars available along with our passports. Since we were in a group our group leader carried all the dollars. I could have shown them at least 200 dollars and some Thai Bahts as well. However, without any reason or explanation, the officers took my friend AKM Hassan and me into custody. The officers forced us to take pictures like convicts and also forced us to sign a paper, which was written in the Thai language. We were also held up for about four hours, before being deported. We were literally treated like criminals.//////In the media we hear about the controversial performance of the caretaker government. It is very interesting to watch that the period from January 11 2007 to the election in December 2008 is always mentioned and all blames are put on General Moeen and his army intelligence. But can we forget the period from late October 2006 to the so-called 1/11? Do we remember how president Iajuddin Ahmed misused the provision and the position of the head of the then caretaker government ? Have we forgotten that some invisible power was running the show from behind the screen ? Definitely, the General and his intelligence chief were not behind the screen, public perception and media reports pointed out fingers elsewhere. This is the truth of the matter. If we fail to recall all these events together with the alleged charges being discussed in the media, these will just be forgotten.//////A photo appearing on the last page of your daily on Friday, October 9, shows a child on a motorbike with his head protected from rain with a polythene bag. Your reporter probably found it interesting, but you should immediately publish the photo again with the warning that it can be fatal, many children in the Western countries were killed through suffocation by polythene bags when they tried to use such bags to mimic the headgears of astronauts. Due to this reason you can see holes punched in polythene bags covering readymade garments with warnings to keep these away from children. One can of course cut out the front of a bag to keep the face open to air if one badly needs to protect a child from rain.//////Recently, Mr. Moeen U Ahmed, the former chief of army, in an interview with a Bangladeshi media in the USA claimed that he was the only general who never tried to grab power. He, a few days ago, bragged again in another news media that if he wanted to be the president of the republic, there was none who could stop him. It seemed to me that perhaps his rant is the outburst of pang for his controversial role in the immediate past regime.//////In order to alleviate the sufferings of people from the frequent power outages, the clock was advanced by one hour two months ago. The concerned minister said that the clock would be put back in October. Nevertheless, the DTS system remains unchanged up till today. On the other hand, power failure still remains a regular feature of day-to-day life all over the country. Hundreds of thousands of agitated people staged an angry demonstration against the frequent power disruption in the upazilas of Birganj, Thakurgaon, Gaibandha, Gobinganj, Netrokona and Mohonganj in Dinajpur district a couple of days ago. The locals alleged that for the last one month, they got electricity for only 2 to 3 hours in every 24 hours. This indicates that the situation of electricity remains the same as it was before. People in the Chittagong Hill Tracts also continued to go through the same situation. School children, parents and teachers have to undergo an ordeal every day as the children could not get up early in the morning. Besides, students could not get enough time to prepare for exams in the morning as they need to rush to the school. In this situation children are the worst victims here.//////Remember the immortal lines of Shakespeare? My horse, my horse, the kingdom for my horse! The BNP's stand for some extra seats in parliament and Khaleda Zia's residence seems similar. There really is no issue. She was allowed to stay on in her husband's temporary residence after he was killed in a military putsch. She is no more in that state of pecuniary state. Therefore it is not expected that she stays on in that house and carry on with her political activities. I remember having written in these columns of your e daily before the last elections that a level playing field should start at home. I said that one leader lived in Dhanmondi under public scrutiny for 24 hours. Any one could monitor her movement or those of the ones who came to her residence, the other was ensconced in her citadel where it was impossible to know what was happening after a certain hour of the night. How can she be allowed to stay on in a temporary home forever and carry on with her political activities from there? She should come to the people who have elected her twice and install herself in a house within people's gaze. Let her move to the other house in Gulshan given to her by the government or wherever she wants to be. But she must not be allowed to stay on in the cantonment. As for the seats in the front row in parliament, they were allotted those commensurate with their total number of lawmakers. So what are they grumbling about?//////The land of Bangladesh is very fertile and so the farmers should be in better condition but that is not happening.

His top commanders and congressional Republicans are pushing for more troops, while the key Democrats in Congress are questioning whether a further commitment of blood and fund, especially at this time of grave economic recession, is prudent or justified. In a recent television interview, his opponent in last year's presidential election, Senator John McCain, maintained that Obama could not give up on Afghanistan and that withdrawal of US and Nato troops at this crucial stage would only lead to destabilisation of the entire region.//////
