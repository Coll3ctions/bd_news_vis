Its readiness to take part in the general elections if they are held on December 28 is a move we at this newspaper are heartened by. We had stated in our editorial yesterday that room was still there for all parties to the issue to arrive at a solution to the crisis. Such a solution now appears to be at hand. The BNP's decision, announced by party chairperson Khaleda Zia on Thursday evening, lifts much of the sense of apprehension that has been there of late. The nation can now surely breathe easier. Even though the decision by the party to go for elections is a belated one and indeed should have come earlier, we feel that the ground has now been smoothened for the polls to be held and for all political parties to make the elections a meaningful exercise aimed at a restoration of government by popular consent. It is in the interest of the country that the elections should now be held in a free, transparent and credible atmosphere.//////IT is a success story that makes us believe once again in the inner potential of the people of this country who can do wonders against all odds if given a little help. And our morale gets a bigger boost when our womenfolk living in the fringes dare to come out of the shadows to set examples worth emulating. In fact, this is the success story of three women who have changed their fate by properly utilising some micro-credit they had borrowed from credit lending organisations. Through sheer determination, hard work and sincerity Sabina Begum of Gazipur, Baby Chakma of Rangamati, Salma Akter of Pabna have become small scale entrepreneurs today, running their business on a full time basis. It in no mean feat that today each one of them earns net profit of around Tk.30,000 per month.//////OVER the last three years I have used my column more than once to highlight the absence of an efficient and affordable power supply in our country.

Yet, once in a while, some deaths become a matter of more than personal grief to the bereaved family.

Mohammad Al Faysal, a final year student of Civil Engg. at BUET, and three others, succumbed to their burn injuries at different hospitals. //////After ringing the doorbell, my wife and I stood quietly beside the door, each thinking the same thoughts--Let's see how this house owner turns out, what his wife is like and, above all, what this house looks like from inside.//////Opening this volume of Hasan Manzar's Urdu short stories in translation triggered in me that old reflex of turning away from anything labeled 'Urdu writing.' The words 'Urdu literature', or 'Urdu poetry' or 'Urdu fiction' instantly evokes school textbooks, where its best poets and writers, as in every language, lie embalmed. To be picked at, prodded, and learnt by rote, and very seldom to be enjoyed. For successive years from Class Six onwards, as sunshine outside classroom windows called out for a jail-break, as beyond Iftekhar Dyer's filmi hairdo we would see the hockey field and beside it the church, up whose steps for Sunday evening Mass dirndled native Christian girls ran the gauntlet of preening male ducktails, it was with furious incomprehension that we turned back to the ////// and //////, to the arabesque laments of Mir and Dard. Ghalib was the sole exception, not his ghazals (which are difficult in Urdu, gleaming with such high Persian polish that it takes years of knowing the ghazal form inside out to see what Ghalib had achieved), but his letters, which I encountered in Class Ten, where lived and chattered an older version of the Karachi around me: burly Punjabis in charpoys, hot loo nights, the white chadars of //////, pigeon flights, mosques, the Bohra mothers of our friends knitting in embroidered swings slung from bedroom ceilings, the old courtesies of ////// and ////// trailing their ragged hems. But oh, the others! Even now, even after reading Manto and Chugtai and others, many others--modern Urdu literature is a vastly different beast than what was in my old schoolbook texts--I have to force down that first reflex of turning away, to then turn back with an adult gaze. So I opened Manzar's book thinking for a second, Jesus! no, not creaky men with fez-es trapped in ////// of bulbul-in-moonlight tropes...//////1.//////I used to go drinking at the sweepers colony many moons back. At that time I had nothing to speak of. With me would be my carefree, vagabond and thieving friends. Once in a while I would even go by myself.

The latest catastrophe to have hit its political system, the phenomenon called 1/11 and its unsavoury aftermath, has the armed forces shoring up an insipid, at times comical, civilian faade. The fact of military/disguised military rule has been a reality for Bangladesh. As has been a functioning media during those years. And, to say the least, relations between the two have been as sensitive as they have been complex.//////The book under review ////// is in fact a compilation of papers presented at a workshop organized recently by Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) in collaboration with the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS), Honolulu, Hawaii.

The selfless devotion of the beautiful nurse calmed the seething hostilities of the soldiers. ////// is woven around the war torn soldiers. The devoted Sister Langtry and their life in the army hospital is a moving saga of conflict between love and duty.

The book is a quick mix of fictional formulae with a blend of history, the partition period, political doctrine, capitalism-communism, amoral life reflected in death and disaster on personal account against the looming shape of sexuality.//////
