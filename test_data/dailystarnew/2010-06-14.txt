The worry now is whether the traffic authorities have in these recent weeks at all taken any steps to roll back casualties on the road, through making sure that driving is safe and that when accidents do occur those responsible for the accidents are swiftly dealt with by the law. //////It seems rather extraordinary that the revised budget will be passed without having gone through a scrutiny of the public accounts committee (PAC) of the House. This is in contravention with the parliamentary rules of procedures. This practice of expenditure of public money in excess of original allocations, without the obligatory scrutiny by PAC to look into the justification of additional expenditures by ministries and divisions, before being passed as revised budget, has been going on since the rules of procedures were enacted in 1973. //////An Asamoah Gyan penalty six minutes from time gave Ghana a crucial 1-0 World Cup victory over 10-man Serbia in Group D at the Loftus Versfeld stadium here on Sunday.//////For Bangladeshis the World Cup arrived only on Saturday as Lionel Messi invoked memories of Diego Maradona, who was not far away, and left millions wishing for more.

The arrestees had been involved in drug peddling for many years, he added. All the arrestees hailed from the two villages. //////It is a wise initiative of our prime minister that her government will preserve forests countrywide for the next generation. We know that vegetation plays the most important role for the ecological balance in a country. According to the experts, at least 25 percent vegetation of the total area of a country is essential for equilibrium of nature. The FAO published their report on '' the state of the world's forests 2009 '' on 3rd March, 2010. According to this report, Bangladesh has 6.7 percent forests having 871 thousand hectares of forests. On the other hand, according to the ministry of environment and forests of Bangladesh government, Bangladesh has 17.04 percent forests of the total land. From this statistics it is clear that the govt has to play an important role to save the forests countrywide. Because, every now and then we find news in the electronic and print media that the unscrupulous traders are cutting down trees on a large scale. The authorities concerned should come forward to stop these activities. The grabbers of the forests should be brought to justice. Not only the govt but also many socio-cultural organisations should come forward to increase awareness amongst the citizens across the country. Tree plantation programmes should be encouraged by the govt.//////The Daily Star ran an editorial under the above headline on 2 June, 2010. Israel as a state was not born naturally.

I didn't know him. So I was a bit surprised to have the invitation. I called the embassy. They informed me Dr. Cristina Nygrene, associate professor of Stockholm University, Sweden was going to visit Bangladesh for a short period. She won't be able to meet all the friends in Dhaka within this short period, and that's why she requested the Ambassador to invite them to tea at his place so that she could meet them all at a time. As I was Cristina's Bengali teacher in 2001, I had been invited too. That explained everything. That's the amount of respect they show to the teachers in first world. Why not us? The other day I was going through a piece of article that says the difference between the first world and third world is not money or anything, it's just attitude! They had the positive attitude, they believed in themselves, worked hard and they are there. Working with the foreign embassies in Dhaka for the last one decade as part time teacher, I have had the same experience. Teachers are highly respected by them. But unfortunately here the picture is different. There is a widespread saying here, the person who gets no good job ends up teaching. Of course, there are exceptions. But to some extent it's true. //////Some housing and real estate development companies are really giving bad name to this business.

Probably one year ago, we lost another brilliant student of Dhaka University named Happy, who wanted to be a magistrate. //////Once I went to the 'Kotwali Police Station' of Chittagong for filing a GD (general diary), which was needed to raise a new SIM against my stolen one. A person asked me whether I had the GD copy written. As he charged me Tk 20 for that, I replied to him in the negative. Later, I wrote the GD in American style. When I submitted that to the officer-in-charge of the thana, he asked me why the GD was written in that way. I replied to him that the GD was written in American style. The officer in turn said, ''This is Bangladesh, not America.'' I remained silent. The next moment he asked me to give him Tk 100 for the GD. I said to him I had Tk 50 only in my pocket. He even demanded that money. I had to give him the money for the general diary. //////To my wonder, I have been observing our political figures propagating objectionable things against our national heroes, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ziaur Rahman and others. I don't know why it is not being stopped by imposing any prohibition by law. Every now and then dragging our national heroes to every issue, accusing them in public can't be a sane thing to do, as they are our pride. They are not merely anyone's father or husband. So raising questions about their contribution amounts to being sceptical about our independence. //////It has been widely reported in the national print media that the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has upheld the quota system for retaining 75% positions of Deputy Secretary for the members of the BCS administrative cadre; in the self same judgment, the quota system for promotion to the posts of Joint and Additional Secretaries has been declared illegal. That is to say, from now onwards, in case of promotion to the posts of Joint and Additional Secretaries, eligible members of all cadres need to be considered equally. Now the question is, in the absence of any quota, what will be the criteria for making a pool of eligible candidates from among the members of different cadres in the first place?. //////I was pleased to hear of the attempt to get a reasonable contract between employers and domestic servants.

The fans have given a free rein to their creative faculty in placing these flags. And these flags come in different sizes and shapes. Judging by the colour of the flags, the people of this country--at least those who have access to television-- seem to be divided in two groups--one supporting Argentina and the other Brazil.//////Surprised to see the act of Bangladesh govt.

And, as usual, the post-budget reflections on this annual exercise are also on. The array of abstract figures that embellish a budget may reveal a lot of information to the enlightened ones and the experts; but those hardly carry much meaning to the majority of the population who are not experts. On the other hand, they usually look at the event of budget announcement with a bit of apprehension, if only because after each budget the prices of essentials invariably climb a notch or two higher up the price ladder. And the traders in these items, too, never miss the slightest opportunity to make the most of the fiscal measures to push the prices up. //////The recent arrest of the JMB chief by law enforcement units after apparently painstakingly sustained efforts, and developments thereafter, once again points to the depth of the deadly phenomenon of the so-called religious terrorism and perhaps also the supreme necessity of maintaining constant vigil. //////
