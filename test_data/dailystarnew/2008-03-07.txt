Thereupon the Election Commission (EC) has given to understand that they are yet to determine the timing of the upazila elections. As far as we understand, according to a latest decision of the government, the rules of the local polls are to be formulated by the EC. By the same token, why mustn't they decide on the local election schedules? //////THE good bit about this year's US presidential politics is that Hillary Clinton has managed to hang on despite the Barack Obama steamroller. The not so good comes in the knowledge that the race for the Democratic nomination remains tight and unpredictable. Senator Obama still has a slight lead in delegate count, but the revival that Senator Clinton has just gone through with her victories in the Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island primaries is a feat her supporters will now try to build on. Neither candidate is yet anywhere near the 2,025 delegate mark needed to clinch the nomination, which thought is already making Democrats across the country nervous. They recall that it was a divided convention in Chicago forty years ago in 1968 that led to a Republican presidential triumph. A similar episode could well take John McCain to the White House.//////THIS writer saw the euphoria and challenge of change that characterised the Kennedy administration of the early 1960s. The Obama wave reminds one of late President John F. Kennedy, who electrified many Americans to imagine what they could do for their country. Barack Obama's main thrust is on change, change that will hopefully break some stereotypes and lift the nation out of defeatism and negativism.//////PAKISTANIS must collectively heave a sigh of relief that election 2008 is not being hotly contested as fraudulent and manipulated, yet it was only free and fair in the universal sense that rigging by official sanction did not take place. Fraud was quite transparent at the polling station level. Voters discovered they had already "voted," votes cast exceeded the number of voters in some polling stations. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) failed to protect the sanctity of the polling booths, gun-toting followers ensuring mass stamping of ballots and stuffing of boxes in favour of their patron. Things were worse in female booths. With no "directed" rigging, the local aberrations crudely cancelled themselves out. Instead of patting themselves on the back, the Election Commission of Pakistan would do the country (and themselves) a favour by correcting the many loopholes that allow such electoral fraud to take place. //////AS Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman rose to speak before the million people gathered at the Race Course in Dhaka, indeed before the seventy five million people of Bangladesh on March 7, 1971, the moment turned electric with excitement.

persons who have the knowledge and experience to do so. As there is no parliament, the budget should be placed well in advance for public debate so that it does not become a burden for the common people. This being a general statement, the budget should also reflect the vision of the nation. Our vision is to become a middle-income nation within, say, 10 years. This time is neither too short nor unrealistic. If we all strive to achieve it, may be this is possible even in a shorter period of time. It is not possible to perform this gigantic task by one man or one group of people. One man is, however, very important-- the progress of Malaysia without Mahathir could not be conceived but he was supported by a diehard team and the nation as a whole.//////I recently read in newspapers that the Election Commission is showing flexibility on many reforms it has proposed. Since then I have been feeling a little disturbed because all the proposals are very important if the country has to be saved from the syndicate of evils. I think it is my social responsibility to bring to your attention the true picture on at least one issue - politics in foreign lands. //////This is in regard to the above news item which was published in The Daily Star of March 2, 2008. This is the story of a young, innocent and unfortunate housewife named Nila from Baro Bashoria village of Sirajganj who became the latest victim of acid thrown on her by her husband. Nila as we gathered from the news had been pursuing performing art from her school days and was keen to realise her dreams even after her marriage. However, she never had the slightest idea that the guy she married was mentally deranged and was planning to put a full- stop to her dreams by defacing her for good.//////Currently, we are watching the dramatic primary elections of the US. Two features of this election, I think, are very relevant for our country. One is the opportunity of the electorate to select the best candidate from their favourite party and the other is the issue-based campaign by the candidates.//////I am tormented these days by the following questions://////Why, when the vast majority of Bangladeshi people cannot afford to go to Singapore for medical treatment, are we sending out the politicians? It should be a national policy that the public servants have to get treatment in the system that they have produced. This is sending a clear message, the healthcare system of Bangladesh is not good enough for our politicians but good enough for the common people of Bangladesh. I think it would be a fine lesson for them to experience the pitfalls of local healthcare and hospitals, they would probably be traumatised at what goes on, even if they were given special treatment and seen right away and spoken to politely. It should also be a policy that the children of the politicians be sent to government schools, that way they will have to invest some money into the healthcare and education systems for their own sake, if not for the people they represent.//////Dhaka gets the dubious distinction of being the second dirtiest city in the world according to the Forbes magazine. //////I would like to draw your kind attention to the danger that school boys are facing every day. In school areas some individuals are very much involved in criminal activities. They are known as 'boro bhai'. Innocent schoolboys fear these elements. They disturb the students in many ways and even snatch away mobile phones from them.//////I might sound outrageous or totally disappointed with the anticipated final episode of our over played political drama! We have heard for the last 14 months of "one-eleven" and " election shall be held by December 2008". The CEC has gone one step further and said that  Dead or alive, we will hold election on time. The election might be held on time, but which election, general election or local govt.? The argument put forward to hold local govt. election in April or May is not tenable, but seen as forced on the nation. The nation immediately needs a legislative body for accountability of the government including the constitutional institutions where signs of arbitrary decision and action seemed to take precedence over law.//////It has been observed that some of our detained leaders are sick and need immediate treatment.//////Thriteen-year-old Naim who found the statue of Lord Buddha should be rewarded for his honesty, both by our government and private organisations. Particularly, the DCC mayor should initiate some sort of official recognition for such a humble gesture of honesty, so that others in society would feel encouraged to do the same.//////A few months ago, I was talking to a traffic inspector (TI) about our transport system. I told him, If the drivers have original licenses which would be taken through practical exams in writing, road test as well as viva, then they can have original licenses and then the transport related problems will be reduced. In reply the TI told me, You are talking about license? City transport buses don't even have any proper papers (route permit, blue book, fitness, registration card, tax token, insurance). Then I was introduced to a DB inspector. I told him that the police sergeants always misbehave and try to take bribe from or file cases against the cab drivers. He replied, The cab drivers can make a samity, collect money every day and can give it to the police department so that the traffic police do not harass the cab drivers anymore. So, this is it. The cab drivers always charge high and they never want to go short distances. They even misbehave with the commuters.//////This is further to your very relevant article on Star City front page on February 20. The write-up is very important for protecting public health, and the officials concerned should be aware of the implications of ignoring it. If the government plans to have stringent laws on proper waste management in health care facilities, then the step is fairly simple. This is to make the installation and operation of approved incinerator compulsory for all hospitals and clinics; both public and private. This can be incorporated by an ordinance to be issued by the CTG. The step will be most welcome.//////In my opinion, we should not quote anywhere even in our students' debates the unwarranted remarks once made by Henry Kissinger about Bangladesh. Definitely, Bangladesh has her basket to deal with her problems and prospects.//////The month of March has come - the month of independence.//////Dhaka traffic is probably the most common subject of discussion in any gathering in Dhaka. Everybody has a solution. Talks of billion-dollar projects are in the air. But before we start building more roads, subway systems, LRTs and other such physical infrastructure, we should first ready our minds to imbibe the culture of respecting others' right of way. In more mature societies this is guaranteed. But in this country we don't even have the slightest idea of what this means, let alone respecting it. //////I would appeal to Ashraful, the captain of our national cricket team, to voluntarily resign from his position, after his dismal performance against the South African cricket team.
