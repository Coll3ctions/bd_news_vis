A group, which calls itself "the Four Brothers and a Sister" flags down vehicles on the road, pretending that they are traffic officers checking out safety measures. It includes four men and one woman, which is how it got its name. But in reality they collect bribe from the drivers and don't mind negotiating within the earshot of passengers. //////The country seems to have been transfixed into immobility on the rail-tracks by the on-rushing lights of an express freight train in the form of the February 18 elections. President Pervez Musharraf and his supporters are standing on one side of the tracks while the opposition political parties are on the other.

It is mentioned that two hills were razed and trees were axed. The news described the fact in such a fashion that the work was a heinous crime. It was also stated that the hills were erased for making 70 new housing plots. I have been observing with concern for the last couple of years that newspapers and electronic media have been mentioning the razing of hills as detrimental to the environment. But no one has so far explained scientifically the pros and cons of cutting hills and developing plain lands in Bangladesh, at least I have not seen such rational explanation. //////I have read the above editorial with interest as business is my specialization. //////Uttara Ganobhaban, known as the Dighapatia Rajbari and situated in Natore District, is an important source of tourist attraction.//////The recent controversy which occurred surrounding the second Test between India and Australia (played at SCG), was indeed very unfortunate.

We are lucky enough that for their great sacrifice we are speaking in our mother language. But the question is, should we abuse it? In our society, speaking efficiently is considered as a special quality. On the other hand, 'talkative' persons are measured negatively. Unfortunately, under the influence of the 'media' some 'responsible bosses' are being considered as talkative people by us. This is not good at all for the nation. //////This is in response to Fuad Mallick's letter titled NRBs. He states " ....Off you go to some other country and serve that society for years and then come back here, hold a high profile conference and tell us to be Bangladeshis!

This unexpected step has weakened Olmert at a time when he needs broad support to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians by the end of the year. The ruling coalition still has the majority in the House. "Negotiations on the basis of land for peace is a fatal mistake," Avigdor Lieberman, head of the faction, told a news conference. However, Ruhama Avraham, a member of Olmert's Kadima Party, said the government would overcome this. Olmert had tried to persuade Lieberman to stay in the government in a meeting with him on Tuesday. But Yisrael Beiteinu decided in a meeting to leave, Lieberman said.

For the last three decades, we have been endeavouring to develop tourism, but the expectations have not always been met. The good news is that many high officials concerned with national development have recently come to understand the importance of tourism. //////Over and over again we are plunged into confusion by words. Words are used in contexts not only to provide information and truth but, probably most of the time, to stir up images and emotions also. //////Agriculture is traditionally associated with the purposeful production of food and fibre commodities in rural areas. Agriculture in the 21st century, however, is actually much broader than this -- it also includes such diverse items as environmental horticulture, planning the use of green space, control of insect and rodent pests, wildlife management, and even food production by city dwellers. Urban agriculture is a broad term to describe agricultural activities and livelihoods in an urban setting. It means more than maintaining farms or gardens in an urban environment. It also includes livestock raising, water management and organic waste management. After all, it includes small- and large-scale activities in horticulture, livestock, fodder and milk production, aquaculture, and forestry -- where several activities may be carried out within one enterprise. //////The environment includes both biotic and abiotic factors and they depend on each other for their existence. So they are equally co-existence components and distortion of one affects the other. What is happening in the world from the environmental point of view is really horrible and dreadful to think Environmental are hazards causing much problems to mankind as well as the flora and fauna of the whole world. So time has come to think over the matter and to face it successfully. First it is necessary to know what are the factors responsible for these devastating actions. Natural disasters are recurring incidents and almost every year causing serious damage to both mankind and its resources. The recent SIDR and two times flood in the same year are the best examples. Both the man made and natural factors are responsible for these natural disasters. //////Keeping Greenhouse Gas Online up to date can be hard work at the best of times. In March of 2004, the publishers Macmillan approached me with the idea of writing a book about how climate change is going to affect you and me, and how we affect it. It was to be called Climate Change Begins at Home: Life on the two-way street of global warming. I jumped at the chance. Most weekends since then have seen me tapping away at this keyboard, doing yet another wordcount and losing more hair from my already draughty head this note is by Dave Reay who has created an uproar round the world writing an unconventional and peculiar book -- Climate Change Begins at Home: life on the two-way street of global warming. The salient characteristic of this book is its simple and powerful metaphors with the funny jokes which sound a little ironic.//////
