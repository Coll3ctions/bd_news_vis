This observance comes after days spent in recalling the spirit of the Islamic faith and practising it in daily life. Indeed, the month of Ramadan is a constant reminder that religion, and with that a deep sense of religiosity, is what underlines the pursuit of life. Faith is that fundamental guiding principle which lifts individuals from the banalities of the temporal world to one that is spiritual in nature. For what is religion after all if it does not act as a spur to a strengthening of one's moral base? The prayers and the fasting that Muslims have observed in Bangladesh and across the world are simply a reassertion of that moral base. It is with such an awareness of what we as mortal beings must do to uphold faith now proceed to a celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr.//////This is a least trodden area in our scheme of things: rewarding good work in any tangible form rather than confining ourselves to at best wordy compliments. We would run down schools and teachers, sometimes in a sweeping manner, losing sight of some of their performances despite all the constraints they are having to work under.//////It was reminiscent of the climactic scene from the movie "A Few Good Men." No sooner had the interim government floated the idea of setting up a truth commission, then there rose a chorus of disapproval: "You want the truth?" roared the chattering and political classes, doing their best Jack Nicholson impersonation. "You can't handle the truth!"//////Those who have seen the movie Ten Command-ments will remember that breathtaking scene when Charlton Heston playing Moses parted the waves and led the Israelites across the Red sea. The entire sequence consisted of three major events. First the sea parted, and then the God's people journeyed through the parted sea followed by the enemy army. Finally, the sea closed over the pursuing enemy and drowned them. //////The political scene in India is heating up. The general election is still one and a half years away. Yet every party, small or big, is preparing itself for the eventuality because the Manmohan Singh government is tottering in the crossfire between the Congress and the Left.//////Mitchell Johnson destroyed India with a maiden five-wicket haul as Australia raced to a nine-wicket win in the fifth one-day international here on Thursday.//////Pakistan put up a spirited display as they fought to save the second Test against South Africa on the fourth day Thursday.//////Pakistan banned paceman Shoaib Akhtar on Thursday for 13 international matches and fined him 3.4 million rupees (56,000 dollars) for hitting a teammate with a bat and other offences.//////Chief of Army Staff and chairman of National Sports Council (NSC) General Moeen U Ahmed has directed the NSC to take the strictest measures against responsible persons and organisations for the press box roof collapse.//////Despite the Indian batting crumbling like a house of cards against Australia in the fifth one-dayer, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Thursday not only refused to blame the batsmen for the defeat but also described them as the best line-up at his disposal.//////Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal was named in the under-19 side that will visit Pakistan on a 20-day tour next month.//////The bowlers' review committee of Bangladesh Cricket Academy (BCB) have cleared one bowler but deemed the action of six others as illegal.//////The national under-16 team are looking forward to win at least two matches in this month's AFC Youth (Under-16) Football Championship qualifiers.//////Pakistan vice-captain Salman Butt was Thursday fined 50 percent of his match fee for criticising umpiring during the ongoing second Test against South Africa, the ICC said.//////Aussie spin king Shane Warne is smashed for six by South Africa cricket captain Hansie Cronje as the crowd roars its approval at a rising star who would later shame the nation and the game.//////The Mitchell Johnson ball that dismissed Mahendra Singh Dhoni was an ideal delivery to a left-hander -- it pitched on an awkward length, moved away off the seam and drew the batsman into a stroke. Unfortunately Dhoni is a right-hander. It didn't matter; Dhoni tried to fend the ball to the leg side and feathered it to Adam Gilchrist. Johnson's third wicket had come with one of his least dangerous balls of the innings.

Excellence in sports gives a special status and esteem to the country having the best kind of sport arsenal to its credit. But what generally happens is that sport events and skills are exploited for the nation's other purposes and used as bargain chips to advance the economic, nuclear, military hardware or other special interests . The sport mafias operating in these fields broker the deals between the countries, or even the countries directly clinch the deals themselves. Thus a winning team or an individual loses to another as per the "instructions' obtained from "above". As a result, sports become highly volatile and totally "unpredictable.//////I would actually like to portray the alarming state of English language in Bangladesh. Most of the people do find the English language pretty difficult to handle, despite having advanced educational degrees. The performance of those people in all aspects of the language ( i.e. listening, reading, writing, and speaking) is depressing. The inability to learn and use the English language has greatly affected us and we are left behind! //////The Dhaka Stock Exchange General Index on Tuesday reached 2802.61 marks for the first time in the 51-year history of DSE, which was 2762.37 points on Monday. Yesterday was the closing day of DSE as trading at DSE will start on October 16 next. Many market analysts and capital market experts say that DSE general index is showing upward trend due to onrush of people in the secondary market. Fine it is if the onrush can be continued through increasing the supply of quality shares in the market. While inaugurating the DSE training academy and 2-day training programme for the members of the Economic Reporters' Forum recently, the Finance Adviser expressed the intention of the government to off-load shares of some state-owned companies including BTTB, Jamuna Bridge, Padma and Jamuna Oil Company and portion of shares of DESCO. Yes, if the government does so then it will surely help the country gain more, as a strong and vibrant capital market is the barometer of the economy. But, above all, one thing should be kept in mind that without judging the fundamentals of the company investors should not invest.//////The failure of the Caretaker Government (CTG) of President Iajuddin Ahmed to create a level playing field for conducting a free and fair general election made a change necessary to save the country from political confrontation and economic devastation. In that crucial situation the military-backed second CTG came to power promulgating Emergency in the country. The primary aim of the second caretaker government was to hold a free and fair election. To this end, its prime responsibility was to put the country on the right track establishing good governance in every sector. Immediately, it carried out necessary changes in the administration to clean it from politicisation and then brought reforms in public institutions like the Election Commission, Anti-Corruption Commission, etc. It also expedited the process of making magistracy independent from the executive body. Necessary changes in the procedures of appointment to the constitutional posts are being made to protect them from political influence. No doubt, all these steps are pre-requisite for good governance and holding a free and fair election. //////Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia resisted the formation of the Anti- Corruption Commission as long as she could. Bangladesh already inherited an Act entitled Prevention of Corruption Act 1947. A department of the government called the Bureau of Anti-Corruption was entrusted with the responsibility for fighting corruption.//////The proposal of forming a National Government for 10 years sounds like a new realisation of a few leaders. Obviously, the country cannot continue with the existing multi-party system headed by a few professionals doing politics. //////Various types of city mass transport systems for Dhaka was described by the staff correspondent (Oct. 8) of a local English daily. These types are by any means a high-tech system. Maybe, it could be so for a technically undeveloped country like Bangladesh.

Naturally, it is being modified and upgraded periodically; which is done to all plants and equipment in any technically developed country.//////Most people, living in Dhaka, have seen the statues of heron standing in front of the Biman office in Motijeel.

Whereas Eid-ul-Azha, commemorating the glorious sacrifices of the Prophets Ibrahim and Ismail (peace be upon them), goes back to the days of yore in the eighteenth century before Christ. Eid-ul-Fitr originated in the 7th century A.D. In fact, Eid-ul-Fitr is the newest major festival amongst the celestial religions. //////Hazrat Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi (b 1207), hailed as "the greatest mystic poet of the world" by the German poet philosopher Wolfgang Von Goethe for his Mathnawi and Divan-e-Kabir, was surprisingly depreciative of writing poetry. He made a remark in his Discourses (//////) that he spouts verses for entertaining his friends, "as if someone was to put his hand into tripe to wash it because his guests want to eat tripe. Hence it has become necessary for me to recite poems since others have wished for this."//////Since the earliest days of civilisation, the rich and the powerful have exploited the poor and assumed absolute ownership of their wealth. In all the major civilisations, a minority rich governed the economy while the masses toiled in poverty and deprivation. The slaves and the freeborn poor tilled the land, herded the cattle, rowed the boats that carried goodies for the rich and built the mansions and monuments that gave eternity to those in power. //////One the evening the Phoenix factory building fell in a heap at its Tejgaon premises, it was 25th February 2006, a private television channel hastily scooped me to the place of occurrence for an on-site comment. While rescuers searched frantically for survivors and demolishing equipment brought down what remained of the buckled building behind me, standing on a pile of rubble I looked at the flickering red light of the video camera and remarked (a) that there could possibly be several more such buildings awaiting a similar fate in that very vicinity and beyond, (b) that all building owners factory, office, school, hospital, residence, hostel, entertainment should immediately inspect their respective buildings to determine any possible risk due to ageing, structural indiscipline, misuse and lack of maintenance, (c) that efforts should be undertaken to rectify any error that could be hazardous to life and property. Amidst the eerie din I remember having to shout no one heard my voice.//////(7) Great care must be taken when a person is located, either dead or alive, to ensure that additional collapse doesn't occur in the area of their entrapment. Rescuers should use their hands and small tools to remove the remaining debris surrounding a person. The victim's condition may dictate the speed with which rescue efforts progress. Consideration should be given to early application of Military Anti-Shock Trousers for viable persons that have "crushing" injuries. Preparation and the beginning of application of them should take place as soon as the entrapment permits. Several instances of complete hemodynamic (blood related) collapse and death have been noted upon release from confinement. Intravenous solutions can also be administered by qualified EMS (emergency medical service) personnel as extrication continues. Caution should be urged in the use of morphine or other painkillers.//////
