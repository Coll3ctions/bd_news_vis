Nevertheless, at some point it tends to tilt toward one end or the other, awakening one to the reality all around. Time changes, circumstances change, attitudes, beliefs, all change. In other words, a new and rather different atmosphere is created, one that demands if not adjustment but at least a recognition of those changes. To some it is a social upheaval, to others it in a normal phase of transition that takes place in any society. Perception varies from person to person. So do our fascination, preferences, acceptance and rejection of the same. Under the circumstances, two determinants that run across our whole life play their roles oftentimes to our liking, oftentimes to our disapproval. These we can reasonably label as losses and gains in our life. An enormous number of them can very easily be put down on a list, evoking a number of reactions like surprise, laughter, anger, sorrow, wistfulness, etc., in the process raising innumerable questions.//////Physical therapists (known as physiotherapists in Bangladesh) are experts in developing and maintaining peoples ability to move and function throughout their lives.

Top of their list was to secure NAM's endorsement of their right to peaceful nuclear energy. Next was to get NAM to condemn foreign armed interference in Syria, a strategic ally of Iran since the Islamic revolution of 1979. The summit's final communiqu supported Iran's stance on the nuclear issue.

Sakhawat Hussain that I am reviewing. Like the other two, it deals primarily with Indian history, concentrating a good deal on the Mughal period. Unlike them, however, it is not as carefully written, and is marred by a number of anomalies and confusing information. Also different is that the author devotes at least as much attention on the Indian Election Commission and the 2009 Indian elections (in the conduct of which he was an observer), the Rajputs, the Sufi saints, and the Delhi Sultanate as to the Mughals, in this case primarily on Humayun, Akbar, Shahjahan and Aurangzeb. Notwithstanding the shortcomings, Hussain, a self-avowed avid history buff, has composed an absorbing account that moves seamlessly along a string of different topics. As with the other books, he has the sporadic profound observations and comments, which cogently reflect the state of politics and society in Bangladesh.//////William B. Milam served as America's top diplomat in Bangladesh and Pakistan at points of critical and crucial significance for the two countries. You can call that a most opportune happening or a mere coincidence. But the fact that the United States government thought it proper to have Milam serve in countries which once were linked through politics, indeed were a single state, is a rarity. And rare too is something else: Milam witnessed the fall of General Ershad in late 1990 and the beginning of a move back toward democracy; and then, in October 1999, as US ambassador to Islamabad and away in California, he heard about the coup that brough General Pervez Musharraf to power in Pakistan. And over the years since then, Milam has clearly made it his preoccupation to study politics in the two countries, which again would be regarded as analyses of the similarities that have characterized their political landscapes. Milam's subtitle, Flirting With Failure in South Asia, is a pointer to the questions he has before him.//////A captivating book from the very first page, ////// not only has an enticing title, but also a very appealing sub-title, "The True Story of An Unlikely Friendship".
