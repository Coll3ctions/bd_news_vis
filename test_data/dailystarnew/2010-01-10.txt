The latest that we have on this front is the disconcerting news from Libya that 46 Bangladeshi workers there have been going without wages for the past six months. And how life can turn into a nightmare for men with no wages abroad can only be imagined. The harrowing experience of these men has been compounded by the fact that they have now been deprived of the food and water, scanty though they have been, so long provided to them by the firm which employed them. At this point, it is starvation that these workers face.

It was once the main source of drinking water for Dhaka's residents, and an hour downstream from the capital city the river is still crystal clear.
