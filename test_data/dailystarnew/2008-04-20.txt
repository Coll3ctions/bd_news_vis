The move is certainly an indication of the dramatic way politics has been transformed in a kingdom about to turn itself into a republic. There is no question that the emergence of the Maoists as a pre-eminent force in Nepalese politics was as sudden as it was unforeseen. That only places a heavy burden of responsibility on them as they prepare to take charge of the country's next government. For the Maoists, at this point, it becomes necessary to acknowledge the confidence reposed in them by the electorate and move on to build a durable democratic structure in the country.//////We are alarmed at the rate century old trees have been going down on the pristine campus of Dhaka University. After standing tall for decades they are being cut down to make room for some brick and mortar structures. In the past, powerful yet unscrupulous factions within the student parties sold off valuable trees from the campus. It was a shameful act that went unchallenged. //////ELECTIONS are held to enhance the welfare of the people. In developed countries it is taken for granted that the party that wins majority of votes from an electorate that has given thought to the words spoken by the candidates and the party manifestos forms the government. //////Is inflation some kind of a sudden plague, which hits without warning, spreads contagious havoc for a while and then disappears as mysteriously as it came? Finance ministers would love such an explanation, wouldn't they? Government propagandists could command a high premium from their masters if they managed to sell such a myth. Unhappily for governments, and fortunately for mere mortals, the voter is not gullible.//////RECENT successful white Democratic presidential candidates, who were perceived to be pro-black, had sent coded messages to blue-collar white voters assuring them that whatever they may have said on the campaign trail, they were actually one of them. Candidate Jimmy Carter did so by saying in 1976 that there should be some racial purity in the residential neighbourhoods. Meaning: blacks and whites should not necessarily be neighbours. And Bill Clinton invented the Sister Souljah moment in 1992.//////Mehrab Hossain led from the front with a well-composed 89 as GP-BCB National Cricket Academy (NCA) thrashed South Africa Academy by 119 runs to confirm their final berth in the tri-nation one-day series at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium yesterday. //////As expected Abahani and Usha Krira Chakra moved to the semifinal of the Brac Bank Club Cup hockey tournament as the two powerhouses registered their third successive wins at the Maulana Bhasani National Stadium yesterday.//////Titas Club beat Sonali Bank 3-0 in the Premier Division Volleyball League at the Volleyball Stadium yesterday.//////Cricket Coaching School and Gazi Tank earned promotion to next season's Premier League after they beat the latter by seven wickets in the Super League of First Division Cricket League at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium yesterday.//////The 3rd Asian Wushu Championship will begin at the Mirpur Shaheed Suhrawardy Indoor Stadium on April 23.//////A pair of Australians, in what was more Pura Cup action than Indian Premier League (IPL), treated a buzzing Mohali crowd to a run-filled Saturday clash as the bandwagon moved north. Unfortunately for Kings XI Punjab, James Hopes's 32-ball 71 couldn't overhaul a massive target of 241, while the Chennai Super Kings had their Western Australia specialist Michael Hussey to thanks for a massive total. His scintillating unbeaten 114, another superb exhibition for this juiced-up format, left Punjab a mountain to climb and with Yuvraj Singh dethroned early they could only muster 207 for 4.//////The opening ceremony was a spectacular affair, but what followed was even more breathtaking, as Brendon McCullum destroyed the home team in the inaugural match of the IPL. In what was a brutal one-man assault on the Bangalore Royal Challengers, McCullum blasted an unbeaten 158 from a mere 73 deliveries, the highest score in a Twenty20 match, to propel Kolkata Knight Riders to an imposing 222 for 3. The punch-drunk Bangalore team was in no condition to fight back after that battering, and collapsed limply to 82 to lose by an embarrassing margin of 140 runs, the fourth-largest defeat in this sort of match.//////Less than a month after announcing a final list of players for the DLF Indian Premier League (IPL) that kicked off on Friday at Bangalore, the organisers of the Twenty20 tournament seem to have forgotten it by allowing some franchise teams to include additional players.//////Pakistan on Friday dropped experienced batsman Mohammad Yousuf for their first ever home Twenty20 international, against Bangladesh.//////If you needed any proof that few of the spectators saw the Indian Premier League (IPL) as anything more than glitzy entertainment, it arrived after the seventh over of the Royal Challengers' comically inept innings. While Sourav Ganguly warmed up for a bowl, with the scoreboard showing a dismal 33 for 4, the boom box started playing a popular Kannada tune. The crowd roared with approval. Could you think of one serious sport where a home crowd of 55,000 would be cheering with their team being cut to pieces as though with a sushi knife? Neither could we.//////Arsenal restored some pride by beating Reading on Saturday, though the result will not bother Manchester United who can close in on the English Premier League title with victory at Blackburn.//////Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez has reiterated his desire to concentrate on footballing matters rather than boardroom battles to ensure a successful run-in to the season. //////English Premier League side Manchester City are planning big-name close-season signings to ensure Champions League soccer within the next two years, executive director Taweesuk Jack Srisumrid said.//////Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, having seen his season dramatically unravel, is already making plans for the next campaign but insisted he is not in the market for Spanish hitman David Villa. //////Gareth Barry could be taking part in his final Birmingham derby for Aston Villa on Sunday after admitting that he could be ready to leave the club he has served for ten years for pastures new this summer.//////Roger Federer battled changing weather, which went from sun to rain and back, before beating Portugal's Frederico Gil 6-4, 6-1 to reach the Estoril Open semifinals on Friday.//////Avram Grant endured the demands of television schedulers over the rearrangement of Chelsea's Premier League fixture at Everton only through gritted teeth but, privately at least, the Stamford Bridge manager may now appreciate previously unforeseen benefits in the fixture switch. Injuries threaten to decimate his options ahead of next week's Champions League semifinal first-leg tie against Liverpool so, in the circumstances, any extra days to recuperate are gratefully received.//////AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini, who is mulling whether to retire at the end of the season, has suffered an injury to his left thigh.//////England defender Rio Ferdinand hopes to spend the rest of his playing career with Manchester United.//////Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan believes England striker Michael Owen will sign a new deal to remain at St James' Park.//////The future of South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira will be decided on Monday, the national football association said.//////Serena Williams continued her domination of Maria Sharapova with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 win in the quarterfinals of the 1.3 million dollar WTA Family Circle Cup on Friday.//////James Anderson has known some dramatic peaks and troughs during his five-year England career, and his recent tour of New Zealand provided a perfect microcosm. He was recalled for the second Test in Wellington and starred with five first-innings wickets en route to a series-turning victory, but one match later in Napier his form had fallen away, and he was dispatched for more than six an over by Stephen Fleming in the first innings and Matthew Bell in the second.//////One of the few less-publicised aspects of the Indian Premier League (IPL) concerns the orange helmet kept at each of the eight franchise venues. After each round of matches this strange accessory -- the IPL's answer to the Tour de France's yellow jersey -- is handed to the competition's leading run-scorer. After tonight's piece de resistance at the Chinnaswamy, it will take something bordering on the miraculous to deprive Brendon McCullum of his dubious honour.//////Following the spectacular start to the Indian Premier League (IPL), its organisers have chalked out plans for an inaugural Champions League featuring top domestic Twenty20 sides from several countries.//////Jesse Ryder should have been happy at securing a New Zealand Cricket contract on Monday but instead the prospect of potentially missing the ODI tour of England was weighing him down. Ryder was one of the 20 men to be offered national deals for 2008-09 and although he said he was "stoked" to get the news, his ongoing hand injury remained a concern.//////England are set to be offered 100 million dollars (50 million pounds) to play five Twenty20 matches against a West Indies all-star side, according to reports here on Saturday.//////A three-wicket win over Prabhat Sangha ensured Sewta Uday Sena (SUS) enter the finals of the Col Malek First Division Cricket League at the local stadium here yesterday.//////Former foes, including Ricky Ponting and Sourav Ganguly, have become Indian Premier League (IPL) teammates and publicly patched up their differences.

Food grain prices and international shortage have now created a fundamental challenge for the country, both in humanitarian terms and in terms of the socio-political ramifications.//////While waiting for some guests at the Sonargaon Hotel lobby, my Human Resources colleague Saidul was greeted by a hotel official. Saidul then introduced Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmed who handed me his card Director People Innovation & Education. Noticing my inquiring appearance, Rakib volunteered, Yes, that's an unusual way of looking at HR. And you are not the first one to react! It certainly was an odd title, and of course my management instinct got the better of me and I asked him if we could meet so he could explain what was this all about.//////Mission Far-east, a Bangladesh single country trade fair will be held in Singapore on June 13-15 while in Malaysia on June 19-22 targeting to tape huge market of different Bangladeshi products and services.//////The five-day training course, organised by IFC, a member of the World Bank, for Bangladesh's agribusiness and food processing sectors ended in Dhaka recently, says a press release.//////Commodity prices struck new record highs this week, led by oil which surged above 116 dollars for the first time, as investors favoured raw materials, including metals, over a tumbling US dollar.//////Global tourism leaders gather Sunday in Dubai to plot future strategy for an industry which, despite a slight downward revision of annual growth estimates, is easily bucking present economic trends.//////The board of directors of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL) recommended 25 percent stock dividend, meaning one bonus share against 4 existing shares, for its shareholders for 2007 at a meeting in Dhaka on Thursday.//////Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited has declared bonus share @ 3.94719 shares for existing one share of Tk 100 each for its shareholders for the year 2007.//////The Asian Development Bank said Saturday it will provide a 113 million-dollar loan to develop two wind power facilities in India to improve the country's use of cleaner energy sources.//////US banking giant Citigroup reported Friday a 5.1 billion dollars net loss during the first quarter and said it would cut an additional 9,000 jobs as it struggles with bad bets on subprime mortgages.//////Even at 115 dollars a barrel, oil is priced too low, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in comments published on Saturday adding that the commodity "should find its real value".//////Malaysia's government said Saturday it would spend four billion ringgit (1.3 billion dollars) to increase food production and tackle price hikes as the country faces spiralling global oil and food costs.//////Local inter-bank FX market was mostly tight throughout the week;

As reported, the ministry will organise a meeting this month to review the draft national agriculture policy prepared by the 'Technical Working Group'. Policy guidelines will cover various agricultural issues including seed, fertiliser, irrigation and agriculture in the draught, flood, salinity prone areas.//////It is wrong to suggest that Dhaka- Kolkata train service has been resumed after 43 years with effect from Pahela Baishakh 1415. Resumption relates to an issue which was in operation in the past and then restarted. In the case of Dhaka -Kolkata there has never been a direct rail link between the two cities. So the question of resumption of train services does not arise. One should term the event as introduction for the first time of direct rail link between Dhaka and Kolkata which has been possible with the construction of Jamuna Bridge. It may be mentioned here that prior to this, 43 years ago, trains used to run from Dhaka to Jagannathganj and then the passengers had to cross the river Jamuna by ferry. //////Welcome Bangla Year 1415. Pahela Baishakh is a great festival for us. It is nice to see thousands of people on the streets wearing saree and panjabi. That gives me a feeling of great happiness. It is true that we are not happy in our daily life because of price hike, load-shedding, water shortage and so on. But we want to forget all our sorrows on joyous occasions. //////Footpath is a mysterious issue in our country! When political governments were in power we saw the media being vocal for freeing the footpaths from the illegal occupants. When this CTG started the drive against these occupants we saw the media appreciating it except the issue of evicting hawkers. But now everything is back to square one!//////I read in the newspaper that the prices of hilsa fish rose by 50-100% before Pahela Baishakh. Why?//////The incidents of last 10th and 11th April are obviously worrying. In the name of opposing the women's development policy, the bigots used the national mosque as the shield! Some so called pro(?) Islamic groups attacked the police using the mosque! It has also been learnt that the bigots used sticks and other weapons kept inside the mosque. //////The other night I along with my friend, who was suffering from severe pain in his backbone, went to consult a doctor. My friend had the pain all of a sudden and it was so acute that he could not even sit in the waiting room. As we did not make any appointment earlier, I repeatedly requested the man in charge of the chamber to give us an urgent appointment but in vain. Then I requested him to give me permission to talk to the doctor and unfortunately I again failed. He said that he would be rebuked for allowing me to talk to the doctor. He further said that nobody would be allowed to see the doctor without prior appointment. In the meantime the condition of my friend was deteriorating. So we went to a private hospital and took the emergency treatment from a doctor. //////Chief of the Judicial Commission Justice Habibur Rahman placed the report on the violent incidents on and around Dhaka University campus in August last year to chief Adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on November 15 last year. It was officially published on 23 March, with 28-point recommendations that include a ban on teacher and student politics by amending the Dhaka University Order 1973 and repealing the Political Parties Regulations 1976, if necessary.//////Before the Liberation War of '71, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman gave people the hope of liberating them from the Pakistani tyrants. The people of this country fought hard to get rid of the killers. We got liberated, and the moment we started to see glimmers of hopes, our father of the nation was brutally and mercilessly killed by some ruthless and ignorant enemies of this nation. Since that time all hopes just simply faded away.//////I wonder why trains will run only once every week between Dhaka and Kolkata. Can people travelling for business stay a whole week before returning? But what is even more perplexing is that both trains from Dhaka and Kolkata travel out the same day and return back on the same day. This is another amazing schedule, certainly not designed to serve the customers. Presumably, the border stations will be manned for only two days in a week and closed for the reminder of the days.//////Bangladesh suffers from a wide range of environmental problems, arising from drought, flood and other natural hazards because of its geographical location. Frequency of hazards is on the increase day by day. The quality of soil has deteriorated due to excessive use of agrochemicals, unplanned land use, undesirable encroachment on forest areas for agriculture and settlements and indiscriminate disposal of hazardous industrial wastes. Unplanned land use and intrusion of saline water are causing degradation of soil in the coastal areas.//////We all want women to be empowered and also think that Bangladeshi women enjoy more respect and honour compared to the women the world over. We also admit that we have a lot more to do. Islam has empowered women in the best possible way (though the so called intellectuals without having adequate knowledge say that Islam has suppressed women) and changing the Sharia will not only be a great blow to the feelings of the common people of our country but will also be a major setback to the scheme of empowering women.//////I heard from reliable elders that during the 1943 Bengal famine, Dhaka Nawab families (Ahsan Manzil-based 2nd family and Armanitola-based 3rd family) had changed their eating habits: whole-grain chapati (servants' food) was included and 'faan' (rice-starch/'maar') was not spared. This is one of the reasons why people had confidence in them and they were the leaders of their times.//////This letter is in response to Gen. Moeen's interesting article in your Bangla New Year issue of April 14th. //////I applaud the recent move by the government to recognise the right of women in the delicate issue of inheritance. For the last 16 years, our country was ruled by female heads of state, yet none of the past administrations recognised the plight of women in inheritance. Due to lack of any initiative and rules regarding the issue, many of our mothers, sisters and aunts have suffered sheer injustice and inequality. I have witnessed this form of injustice against my mom.//////I am referring to Sharier's cartoon published in The Daily Star on Apr. 2 in which it was pointedly shown the mindset of the powers that be! On a weighing scale, some prominent leaders of the Awami League and the BNP were put on either side of the scale. //////The Ministry Of Health & Family Welfare of Bangladesh claims that the country has a doctor patient ratio of 1:3169, considering all the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the BM & DC. However, there is a gross error in the report on working physicians (Govt. & Private) available for care & treatment of ailing patients. Because, many of the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the BM & DC have already expired (dead) & many of the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the BM & DC have left Bangladesh, working abroad (many of whom will not return as they have accepted citizenship of foreign countries), & many of the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the BM & DC are no longer involved in medicare & treatment, that is, they are either involved in business or some other profession, or retired, i.e., they are quite old and infirm for involvement in care & treatment of the people of Bangladesh. When all these factors are rightly considered, the number of working & living physicians (govt. & private) available for care & treatment of ailing patients would be probably less than 13,000. Thus there seems to be a gross error in the report on working physicians available for medicare. This error needs to be corrected. As the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is run by bureaucrats, who de facto possess no responsibility, they will take no steps to correct the statistical errors of health, the BM & DC, the DGHS, the BMA should take the pioneering role in correcting all discrepancies in health statistics. The BM & DC should first enlist the registered doctors who are living & working in Bangladesh. The BM & DC should enlist the registered doctors who have already expired. They should also enlist the registered doctors who are no longer involved in the profession. Moreover, a good number of registered doctors are involved in health administration, who are in no way directly involved in caring & treating patients. They should also be enlisted. The DGHS & the BMA can't avoid their responsibility in correcting the errors in health statistics.//////I have read the article of Dr. Siddiqur Rahman of Dhaka University, in the Prthom Alo . His analysis is very nice. Education is the backbone of a nation. Some corrupt people and businessmen are trying to destroy it. I think this system should be revised and it may be started gradually from class six onward, not directly for the students of class nine(that is on SSC exams). //////Nepal's Maoists said yesterday they would lead the next government as they staged a victory rally with poll results showing them on track to emerge as the country's biggest party.//////Prime Minister's Adviser on Interior Rehman Malik has informed NWFP Governor Owais Ghani that the federal government has decided to deal sternly with militants in tribal areas.//////Iraqi forces took control yesterday of a district of the southern city of Basra which has seen intense firefights between troops and Shia militiamen, the interior ministry said.//////Pakistan's new government is finalising a constitutional amendment bill to ensure the balance of power between the President and the Prime Minister, Law Minister Farooq Naek said yesterday.//////The deputy director general of the UN's atomic watchdog will fly to Tehran next week for new talks on sensitive areas of Iran's disputed nuclear programme, a spokeswoman said Friday.//////Three Palestinians were killed and 12 Israeli soldiers wounded on Saturday when Hamas militants, including suicide bombers, stormed a Gaza border crossing with explosives-laden vehicles.//////President Bush and South Korea's new President Lee Myung-bak were having fried chicken and potato salad for lunch Saturday, but beef was on the dinner menu when they began two days of talks at the Camp David presidential retreat. //////Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan appeared in a video aired Saturday by an Arab satellite channel, saying he was kidnapped by Taliban militants more than two months ago. //////The Afghan army detained 68 Pakistani men soon after they entered the country over suspected ties with Taliban-linked rebels, the defence ministry said yesterday.//////Pakistan successfully test fired a long-range ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead on Saturday, the military said. //////Former US president Jimmy Carter and Khaled Meshaal, exiled chief of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, held more talks in Syria yesterday focused on a possible truce between Israel and Gaza militants and the release of an Israeli soldier, Hamas said.//////After touring the four states which fell to the opposition last month, Umno top guns are hearing a recurrent theme from the grassroots: It is time for a leadership change. //////A new bird flu vaccine being developed by US researchers could provide broader protection, last longer and be easier to mass produce than existing vaccines.//////Theatre troupe Natyachakra has been offering scholarships to the theatre students of Department of Drama and Dramatics, Jahangirnagar University (JU) and Department of Theatre and Music, University of Dhaka (DU), to promote academic performances.

This year's Conference carries special significance because it is being held at a time when the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations, under auspices of the WTO, is passing through a critical juncture and it is poised in a decisive balance. UNCTAD is (more truly ought to be) all about the development of developing countries. //////THE banks, insurance, and non-banking financial institutions (NBFI) have, since the last few years or so, been very active in capital market operations. These institutions have been the key players of price settlement, demand and supply interaction of share prices, and many other factors. Their operation in the capital market is secondary, these institutions will all claim. However, the huge volume of operation in capital market has made all of them more inclined to that than to their own licensed domains. //////THE increase in rice prices began in January, lagging nearly two years behind the surge in prices of wheat, corn and other agricultural commodities.
