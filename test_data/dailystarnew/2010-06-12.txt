And compared to the revised budget for the outgoing fiscal (2009-10), it is only 35 per cent higher. From considerations of novelty, there is, however, not much to write home about except that it is a continuation of the earlier budget in terms of the emphasis given on human resources development, agriculture, power and energy and rural development. However, with extra thrust on infrastructures like power and energy on which the proposed allocation has been increased by 61.5 per cent, the new budget promises to facilitate investment better than before.//////FOR a long time we have been fed on an impression that structurally our district, upazila and rural health complexes have been among the best in the region and we never tired of showcasing it to visiting dignitaries. It's time however we stop resting on the laurel unless we have made them into thriving, vibrant health complexes with all the OPD and in-patient facilities constantly under the watch of qualified doctors and nurses. //////Uruguay youngster Nicolas Lodeiro became the first player to be sent off at the 2010 World Cup as his side played out a 0-0 draw against a lacklustre France in Group

This figure for a developing nation is commendable, if not impressive. The World Bank claims that growth acceleration since 1990 has been accompanied by faster progress on poverty reduction in Bangladesh.

Engr. Abdul Wadud's letter dated May 24) for a fresh technical feasibility study for the proposed Russian reactor for Rooppur before the government signs a billion dollar deal.

However, in his reckless consumption spree for the sake of development and prosperity, humans have used different species in such a way that many of those have already become extinct and some others are under threat of extinction.//////WHATEVER the religious scriptures depict, man as a species of living beings constitutes a negligible part of the earth's biota. Yet, having overwhelming intelligence and capacity to mould nature, he has done much harm to the environment that nurtures all of them with motherly affection. In essence, we -- the humans -- have been a destructive species that has caused irreparable damage to mother nature just for rapid production of our utilities and to lead an easier and rather lavish life. //////As I was driving to work, I heard on the radio that Che, the legendary revolutionary, was visiting my hometown this coming Friday. My first reaction was to dismiss the announcement as a prank. By the time I reached the expressway, I was convinced that it was a case of bad radio reception since I was driving though some dead zones of which there are plenty in the suburbs where I live. However, after I reached my office, curiosity overwhelmed my better judgment, and I checked on the Internet and found that Che was indeed coming to my town.//////It is not every day that one sees a funeral procession of a police officer who died in the line of duty. I witnessed such a one, one of the most serious and spectacular processions that I have ever seen, a few days ago. In a civilized society, it is the police officers who safeguard law and order and keep things flowing. It is also the police that prevent crime. Without them society will be in chaos. A police officer, a nurse, a sweatshop factory worker, a city sanitary worker, a fireman, a postal worker, a farmer who grows things for us; they are the backbone of any society. They are the everyday heroes who we do not give a moment's thought. Some of them earn less than a dollar a day.//////When the sky turns crimson in the west even as the day ends, I remember my father. It has been more than fourteen years since I last had any conversation with him. There will be years, a myriad of them, when he and I will not have occasion to speak to each other again. He has been dead all these years and sleeps in the shadow of pastoral trees through which the winds blow and the rains pour.//////THERE was another twist in the tail related to the sinking of Cheonan. Japan's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned, primarily over his failure to keep his election promise to the people of Okinawa to shift the US base out of the island. The sinking of Cheonan allegedly by North Korean torpedo created heightened security concerns among the majority of the people of Japan. They have seen the indispensability of strengthening the security links with USA instead of weakening it, as Hatoyama was perceived to be doing.//////THERE is no doubt Israel grossly underestimated the worldwide condemnation to its naval operation against the flotilla of six ships trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. //////Gunmen in Pakistan opened fire on trucks carrying supplies to NATO troops in Afghanistan, torching more than a dozen vehicles and killing seven people near Islamabad, police said Wednesday. //////Israel's army announced late Monday the creation of a team of high-ranking officials charged with examining and learning from the deadly May 31 operation against a Gaza-bound aid flotilla.//////Chitra Divakaruni's first volume of short stories, ////// was so good that when my eyes alighted upon another such collection, ////// in a bookshop, I had to buy it just then.//////God has always been elusive. Or the search for Him has been. Then too there are all the instances where looking for God, putatively finding Him and then claiming Him for a particular religious community has spawned issues over which vast global regions have become involved. Witness the aftermath of 11 September 2001 in the United States. Suddenly, because of the destruction in New York, Western interest in Islam as also its fears of it have become a considerable many degrees more pronounced. Karen Armstrong, happily for us, is not guided by these immediate considerations. For a basic reason, which is that she has for a very long time been writing on religion and has particularly remained busty expostulating the diverse aspects of the Islamic faith. Reasoned analyses have been part of her assessments of the place of faith in life.//////
