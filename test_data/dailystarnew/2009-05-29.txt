It's just too obvious. But it's all the more difficult to prove as all the river-gobblers have ownership papers, thanks to our corrupt land administration and lax monitoring by river regulatory body. Powerful, rich and ruthless, these river-gobblers find no difficulty in maneuvering legal system and managing law enforcement. They have become seemingly invincible. //////Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd (BTCL) in two separate statements contradicted with two reports published in The Daily Star on May 22 and May 24 with headlines "Internet Backbone: Hasty BTCL deal raises questions" and "Defaulting Huawei forgiven: New BTCL authorities waive penalty, questions arise".//////BNP yesterday asked the government to send a technical expert team instead of an all-party parliamentary group to visit the Tipaimukh project to assess its effect on Bangladesh.//////Deputy Speaker Shawkat Ali yesterday said there is no need to have special parliamentary privileges and immunities for lawmakers since these privileges provide them with opportunities to get involved in corruption.//////The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers will be observed across the world today.//////Indigenous people in Bangladesh suffered due to government policies while Bangla-speaking settlers continued to capture their land with the behind-the-scene support of the government, reads Amnesty International's (AI) annual report. //////The global financial crisis is leading cash-strapped governments around the world to crack down on people protesting against rising poverty and unemployment, Amnesty International said yesterday.//////Sri Lanka celebrated a major diplomatic victory yesterday after managing to torpedo Western demands for a probe into alleged war crimes committed during the offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels.//////Israel said yesterday it will press ahead with housing construction in West Bank settlements despite a surprisingly blunt US demand that it stop all the building.//////Bangladesh for the first time has been elected chairman of the 98th International Labour Conference (ILC).//////The High Court (HC) yesterday granted anticipatory bail for six months to Jamaat-e Islami leader Maulana Abul Kalam Mohammad Yusuf and eight others in a war crime related case.//////THE inquiry committee set up by the government to probe the tragic happenings at BDR headquarters in February this year has finally submitted a 309-page report to the authorities. The seven-page summary of the report handed out to journalists unfortunately does not present a clear picture of the entire nature of the carnage perpetrated on February 25 and 26. What is surprising is that the committee itself acknowledges its inability to identify the powerful forces behind the elements who perpetrated the tragedy at Pilkhana. Although there is some fingerpointing in the report, the overall position is that the report is rather inconclusive. However, we thank the government for sharing the report, howsoever partially, with the public. No other government has done so before, especially on such a sensitive matter.//////WE welcome Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's announcement, after a meeting with the Indian High Commissioner, that an all-party parliamentary committee will be formed to make a visit to the Tipaimukh dam site, to gather first hand information about the design and technical details of the project and report back to the parliament their findings with comments and suggestions. It is following such a fact-finding visit, that the government will determine its policy. This, if followed correctly, will set a good example of how the legislative and executive branches of the state should work together.//////I'LL admit that I was less than enthused to learn that an integral part of a recent conference that I was attending in Jordan was a field trip to learn something about the activities of one of the country's most prominent NGOs.//////NO fall is more precipitous than the fall of a man in his own eyes. Former South Korean president Roh Moo-Hyun took that fall when he hurled himself from a hill that ended his life. He was under investigation for corruption at the time of his death, and didn't wish to wait for a verdict on him. In one final fall, Roh put an end to the misery of falling everyday into the perilous gorges of moral compunctions. He may have jumped from a height, but the fall was entirely worked out inside his mind.//////FISH, said Mao Zedong, do not swim in pure water.

I condemn people who throw rubbish out of their cars and houses. The government always talks about modernisation and urbanisation but no one ever talks about keeping the city clean. Whenever I visit other cities like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok, Hong Kong and so on, I always feel how incapable we are of keeping our own cities clean. This picture was taken at a "posh" area in Banani where rubbish is dumped all over the street so carelessly that it is no longer possible to drive on it.//////It is heartening to see the birthday of the National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam being celebrated with due fervour throughout Bangladesh and many places abroad.

But after 38 years, it is found that there is a huge trade deficit between the two countries. We see our negotiation skills, especially diplomatic exercises, are almost zero.

It is not India, it is our limitations or failures. //////It is evident that the shortage of leaders in various national enterprises is acute and this has failed to draw the attention of the authorities concerned and the people at large. I do not understand why the people voted them to be in the government and the opposition, after so many failures on their part. I think that we must come out of emotional politics and send a clear message to these leaders, either to change their current political belief and strategy or leave the stage.//////Every day we get up and have to face many problems-- sound pollution is one of them. It always creates problems for students. Especially, it is created by the hawkers and it is going on from dawn to dust. //////Mr Kishore Mahbubani, a senior Singapore Diplomat now is Dean of "The Lee Kuwan Yeu School of Public Policy" in the National University of Singapore has published a book "The New Asian Hemisphere: The irresistible shift of global power to the East."

These are://////The local political analysts hardly brief the citizens about the DNA effect in politics (as noticed between parents and children). Dynasty rules have both positive and negative effects--Bangladeshis are familiar with it. //////Almost 7-8 million Bangladeshi people are working outside of Bangladesh around the world. We call them migrant workers. Because we don't have many job opportunities inside the country, we are bound to find work elsewhere. In fact, we send home an equivalent of nearly $10-12 billion US dollars every year. This money is basically running the country's economy. Most of the overseas workers are not skilled, a lot of them go to the Middle East or the Far East. They invest their money to pay for work permit, tickets and agent fees. Many of them sell their land and all properties and borrow money from their friends and relatives. That's why they take many risky jobs such as construction etc. Many countries in the Middle East don't have any or very poor labour laws or health and safety guidelines. Accidental deaths happen everyday because the workers don't have any protection. After the accident, there is no post-mortem, no compensation. The common excuse used is that they suffered a heart attack. The return of the dead body to home causes their loved ones to face many hassles. Our leaders and politicians have no time to think about these people. I urge the government of Bangladesh to show a little respect and gratitude to their families. The government should financially help those helpless families. Remember these people have sacrificed their lives for their families and the country. They are true fighters. //////During the BNP-led alliance government, some leaders from the Jamaat-e-Islami were in the cabinet where a woman, Begum Khaleda Zia, was the head of the government. The Jamaat -e-Islami is not true to its words. It does not believe in a woman becoming the head of the state, yet , that is what it accepted during the alliance rule.//////Normally, we blame others for any failure. If we ask the primary teachers, Why do your students not do well in the exams? They answer that the students' parents are illiterate, poor and they do not take care of their children. //////The AL-led government, before the 9th parliamentary elections, declared a 'Charter for Change of Days' that would bring about a qualitative change in politics and national life and time and again pledged to translate the country into a 'Digital Bangladesh'. Reasonably, the people of all quarters of society with the hope of promised change in the political landscape and national affairs entrusted them with an unpredictably overwhelming mandate. //////People invest in the shares to support growth of the capital market and also to gain financially from it. Shares in our country are bought or sold through trading houses. People use cash or loan from the banks to buy shares. When people use cash, sometimes it happens that shares are bought with the understanding that they would make the payment at a later date and they normally follow it as agreed. Clients sometimes for reasons beyond their control fail to meet the deadline. In such cases the trading house should remind the clients before they dispose their shares without the knowledge of the clients to offset the dues. I believe in this case, the trading house should give the client(s) a fresh deadline before deciding unilaterally to sell the clients' shares. If the clients fail to meet the new deadline, the trading house could then arrange selling shares to offset the dues. Here the trading house should require to consult the client(s) to decide on the type of shares they could sell to offset clients' dues, instead of making unilateral decisions. //////A front-page report of 24 May under the headline Seven lawmakers declined to fly economy class drew my attention. I was shocked. The report stated that the parliament secretariat had to spend $7,00 to upgrade seven lawmakers' air tickets to business class after they declined to fly economy class! What a shame! It was 'an all-expenses-paid trip' for the Bangladesh delegation by the German parliament. What is the importance of such trips? Just to gain insights into their (German) proceedings!//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.
