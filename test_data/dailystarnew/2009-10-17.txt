The heightening concern over moribund rivers that this paper brought to the centre of national discourse only a few months back, the government at the highest level responding to it and judicial activism demanding action -- all seem in place to bolster the massive campaign for river reclamation beginning with Dhaka and taken forward all over the country.//////DEATHS of workers during ship-breaking are gradually on the rise. According to newspaper reports, in the last two days, four workers died at the ship-breaking yard of Sitakunda in Chittagong. Added to three other earlier casualties under similar circumstances, the death figure comes to seven within the span of only a week at three different ship-breaking yards of Sitakunda. In all the cases, the ill-fated labourers either inhaled poisonous gas or they were crushed under heavy metal plates.//////THE honourable shipping minister is not the first democratically elected person to speak on the virtues of summary killing, extra-judicial deaths or the deaths in the so-called crossfire. Not very long ago, our minister in charge of foreign affairs very poignantly indicated the difficulties of suddenly coming out of the clutches of crossfire killings. She was saying so after returning from an international forum in Geneva where she assured the audience about Bangladesh's firm resolve to put an effective stop to the extra-judicial killings.//////THE Irish 'Yes' to the Lisbon Treaty has been good news for Europe. The fact that two-thirds of the Irish electorate voted in favour -- and with a higher turnout than when the 'No' camp prevailed in June 2008 (58% versus 53%) -- is being seen as an important step towards the treaty's entry into force. A second Irish 'No' might have killed it off and conveyed to both European citizens and the wider world the image of a union that cannot get its act together and deliver on what it agrees upon. Ireland's "resounding yes" to Lisbon can now be viewed as a much-needed turning point after almost a decade of failed institutional reforms. It will assist in the creation of conditions for a much better union.//////THE present government came to power with the slogan 'Din Badaler Pala' -- as if a qualitative change in the lives of Bangladeshi men and women will follow. But the government's performance during the last nine months, sadly, has been disappointing.

The South African side, who progressed this far after a thrilling win over Sussex, showed excellent control in sealing a five-wicket win in Hyderabad, one that pushed the other county team to the brink of elimination. Morne van Wyk and Ryan Bailey played crucial roles with the bat after CJ de Villiers starred with the ball in the afternoon and the team picked up two points from this win.//////Kenya clawed their way back into contention in their five-match series against Zimbabwe, winning the third match of the rubber by 20 runs in Harare on Thursday. Batting first, they posted a competitive 266 for 9 in their fifty overs after winning their first toss of the series, and maintained their grip on the contest despite a 142-run stand for Zimbabwe's fourth wicket between Brendan Taylor and Stuart Matsikenyeri.//////Victoria might have changed venues going into the second phase of the Champions League, but the conditions on offer for them on Thursday night in the match against Royal Challengers Bangalore were uncannily similar to what they faced in Delhi. It was their medium-pacers, particularly Andrew McDonald, who set up their comprehensive victory after Royal Challengers Bangalore had threatened to continue the trend of high scores at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. Rob Quiney then ensured they remained dominant, combating the tricky surface with a determined innings to seal victory for Victoria, boosting their semifinal chances and delivering a serious setback to Bangalore's.//////Marcus Trescothick has had to fly home from Somerset's Champions League campaign in India after a recurrence of his stress-related illness.

As themes, he prefers seasonal changes, calm landscapes, women, ancient houses, ponds, lakes, rainbow, green paddy fields in autumn, rainy days, flowers, seashores and cloudy skies. He portrays landscapes in their essential harmony. The viewers can easily relate to his themes and his compositions seem familiar. Salim's 9th solo art exhibition, titled Nature is a Beauty, is now on at Alliance Francaise de Dhaka in Dhanmondi. //////A ten-day exhibition, titled "Onno Kash," featuring works of photographer ASM Bulbul is now on at Drik Gallery in Dhanmondi.

It must be stressed that gender inequality in accessing resources and opportunities negates the concept of human development and the spirit of democracy. The empowerment that would have given the vast majority of women the freedom of choice for self-development is, as yet, appallingly missing.//////NEW Delhi should realize that the road to Beijing goes through Islamabad. This is what a Pakistan foreign minister told me many years ago. There is some truth to this, even today. Likewise, Islamabad should know by now that its route to Kabul lies through New Delhi. This doesn't suggest that India is helping Afghanistan in its armed struggle against the Taliban and their supporters in Pakistan. //////Pre-school and primary education should be based on a mixture of learning and fun. Learning of the alphabets and numbers by heart has to be implemented but can be made fun by devising games around them. In addition, concept of cleanliness, truthfulness, pride in being Bangladeshi should also be introduced. For example, making children play games based on the alphabet and on numbers: games based on the practical use of numbers, such as buying things from stores, cooking small vs. large amounts; getting the price right for commodities their families might sell, e.g. price of 1 kg of rice; or numbers describing their height, relating height to good eating practices; using alphabets to spell, give identity to a face; alphabet? words ?describing emotions, etc.//////IT was not a poet but an American scientist, Mark Harmon, who nicknamed his field of study morticulture, to suggest the importance of managing the dead trees in the forest to maintain biodiversity. Deadwood plays a vital role for the functioning of forest ecosystems. Deadwood is an indicator that captures many elements of naturalness and is becoming a general reference for natural forests. Deadwood has become an important indicator to determine 'hemeroby' (the degree of naturalness) of forest ecosystems. It can be found as standing and downed dead trees. Standing deadwood is termed as snag and lying, as log.//////NAGOYA the city of Toyota, with a population of approximately 2.2 million generated 1.251 kg/person/day of waste (40% organic waste) in 1998, exceeding the average in Japan (1.1 kg). At that time, the entire city generated 1.02 million tonnes of waste, of which 0.28 million tonnes were land filled. It may be mentioned that most of the waste is incinerated in Japan.//////NORMAN Ernest Borlaug, the father of Green Revolution and a humanitarian scientist for the hungry people is no longer with us. At the age of ninety five he passed away on the 12th September last at his own residence in Dallas. His indefatigable and integrated research developed a new agricultural system that met up the food demand of the increased population and saved many people from hunger. For his outstanding contribution in the development of new high yielding wheat varieties and supporting agricultural management system he was honoured in 1970 with Nobel Peace Prize. He turned the then existing conventional agriculture into a mechanized modern system with the use of high yielding crop varieties and high inputs i.e. fertilizers, irrigation, fungicides, pesticides etc. This change was termed as Green Revolution by William Gaud, the Director of USAID and Dr Borlaug was regarded as the father of this Green Revolution.//////I happen to be one of those individuals who, having found themselves in the dilemma that on a prosaic basis we call a search for a livelihood, went through university dreaming of life as a pedagogue, indeed as an academic in the hallowed corridors of a public university. It was not to be, for reasons we often choose to push away or under the rug because they are too uncomfortable to remember. And then I drifted off into journalism, but not before I had burnt a few bridges to what I had once thought would be my future; or before the immanent will, to borrow that meaningful turn of phrase from Thomas Hardy, let it be known that my future was not in my hands. It was a truth I was not aware of when I proudly lifted my head (and it was a full head of hair in those days, back in 1965) before a bowing Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan (all men gifted with the majesty of height must nevertheless defer to those condemned to be short and therefore more compact in form if not in substance) and told him that I would like to be President of Pakistan. He was impressed and asked my teachers to take good care of me. For the next week or so, I was Pakistan's future president. I wallowed in the limelight.//////It is a sweltering hot night in a sleepy remote village called Madhupur. Although a full hour has not yet passed since dusk fell, it seems quite like midnight. It is typical of a village, particularly one like Madhupur. A terribly backward village where days and nights are not determined by the clock but by the behaviour of the poultry. Nights begin with their entry into the pen and the day that follows is heralded by their cock-a-doodle-doo. The villagers get themselves into this poultry routine of life. They finish their meal at twilight and go to bed after shutting the hen-house door. The next morning they wake at cock crow. But this night is different. It is too hot to sleep. There is no breeze. The leaves on the trees are still. Men and women are outside their cottages for fresh air. Some are sleeping out on mats laid on small platforms under the trees. //////Herta Mueller's triumph has surprised a lot of people. But that ought not to be the case, for there have been situations when others not very well known in the world of literature have come by the Nobel Prize for Literature. And not just literature. A whole lot of controversy has raged around some of the awards given out in the peace category. So it is not merely literature that has come in for controversy.//////Writers teaching in some of the world's top Creative Writing programs will talk about how they mentor students and important aspects of craft at 'Writing Across Cultures' in Hong Kong, 9-11 March 2010.//////October which is observed as Breast Cancer Awareness Month reminds our pledge to boost awareness about breast cancer. Every year, the deadly cancer affects thousands of women in Bangladesh. Many of the deaths from this cancer could be prevented through adopting useful measures like self examination of breast, regular and periodic screening, early diagnosis and treatment.//////One of the important health hazards in Bangladesh is blindness. It puts an additional burden to its socioeconomic condition. Eye problems are more miserable in urban slums and non-slum populations belonging to the lower socio-economic class as demonstrated by various studies.//////A good night's sleep may be more important than we think. In addition to allowing us to feel rested, energetic and clear-thinking, studies have shown that there are connections between sleep and heart health. There also has been research demonstrating that sleep may affect body weight.//////Quaker, a product of PepsiCo in association with Apollo Group of Hospitals has launched a unique initiative in India to help increase awareness on the risk and prevention of heart diseases through diet, health and exercise. The call to action entitled Mission to make India heart healthy are set to spread awareness about the need to be vigilant about lifestyle moderation, eating habits and prevention through screening.//////Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) occurs when the intestines squeeze too hard  or not hard enough  as food passes through. Symptoms may include diarrhoea or constipation, bloating, and a feeling that you still need to pass a stool, despite having recently passed one.//////Cosmetics may seem relatively harmless, but preservatives and fragrances added to these products are a frequent cause of skin problems. Scratching the eye when applying mascara also is a common problem.//////BANGLADESH and Myanmar are on a collision course with tension in the border that has been heightened by amassing of troops in their respective sides of the border. Foreign Minister Dipu Moni, when asked by journalists about the construction of pillars for barbed wire fence along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border at Naikkhangchhari in Bandarban, said that the action is in accordance with international law. The Foreign Minister, however, told journalists that she was not aware that the Myanmar military had gathered 10,000 Rohingas in the border on their side with the intention of pushing them into Bangladesh. The Foreign Minister also did not comment on the amassing of troops near the border. She was trying to diffuse the tension diplomatically, which is understandable.//////THE newspapers in Bangladesh are once again abuzz with the stories of Islamic militants being arrested from around the country. Only recently, their hideouts, training centres and arms cache have been found deep in the jungles of Chittagong Hill Tracts. Their recruitment, training and motivation programmes, as revealed by captured militants, even if those are partially true, are simply amazing.//////THE second Afghan Presidential elections which concluded on 20 August 2009 were marked by a low voter turnout of approximately 40 per cent, allegations of widespread fraud and 400 incidents of violence- making it the most violent day in Afghanistan since 2001. Hamid Karzai's failure to build upon the previous electoral verdict, which gave to him support of 55 per cent of the electorate- based on a high voter turnout of 70 per cent, and the resultant corruption and lack of governance created a sense of despondency amongst an already war weary electorate, many of whom chose to stay away. This coupled with the threat of the use of violence by the Taliban, kept away a large number of women voters. Although these elections have been held under extremely trying circumstances and thus their conduct was not expected to be perfect however, the widespread allegations of corruption and fraud has only served to make matters much worse. The UN backed Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) is investigating 726 serious allegations of major vote fraud and over 2000 complaints of fraud and intimidation. These developments have ruffled feathers in the west and undermined Kazai's moral standing both in the international community and back home.//////How many books make a significant difference in matters that concern everyone who lives on earth? You can probably count the titles on one hand. Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, husband and wife, have certainly written such a book. Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide is the most important book that I have read since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, published in 1962. I am not alone in saying that this is the most significant book that I have ever reviewed.//////IF I am asked, What is or what should be your philosophy of life? I'll simply reply, This universe is the expression of unadulterated and unfathomable love. That 'love' is the single reason of the expression of me too. So, my only philosophy is to realise that love and spread it as much as possible. My appearance on this earth is also for this. ... The height of a man can be measured with the power and sphere of his love.' Nuhul, the protagonist of the debut novel Nuhuler Monchitro by Sheikh. Almamun expresses his ideologies this way. Yes, no doubt, it sounds really very philosophical, which the novel abounds in wholeheartedly.//////RIGHT to information has been playing a vital role in reshaping the state machinery and ensuring greater participation of people in different countries across the globe.//////Out of a brothel, perfumed desirably and trailing a mysterious bloodline, an 'overly pretty' traveler reaches the magnificent court of Mughal emperor Akbar. Despite his foolish choice to wear a coat of coloured leather lozenges in the heat of Fatehpur Sikri, the traveler wittily introduces himself as 'Mogor dell'Amore', the Mughal of Love. As Akbar falls prey to his silvered tongue, the yellow-haired traveler starts to relate a story of love which can 'make his fortune or else cost him his life.'//////
