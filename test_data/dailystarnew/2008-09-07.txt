And what they have to report certainly does not make anyone happy. They have informed us that they have noticed significant differences in the prices of the same goods in retail shops at different city markets. As an instance, prices in Shyambazar vary widely from those in Karwan Bazar. The FBCCI leaders, who had earlier taken it upon themselves to help keep prices under control, are now clearly exasperated at the unbridled way in which retailers have been selling goods to already suffering consumers. They have noted that they have no network wide enough to keep markets countrywide under surveillance and therefore little influence over retailers.//////DESPICABLE is the word that can partially define the practice of catching poisonous fish from waste treatment plant lagoons and selling them in the markets for human consumption. And we are appalled to learn that this heinous practice has been going on for years together in the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA) lagoons in and around Pagla, Narayanganj, though officially there is a 10-year old ban on fishing in lagoon waters. According to experts, poisonous components in lagoon fish can stay in human body for 8 to10 years, causing kidney and lever diseases including cancer. Therefore, authorities should have been doubly concerned at the health risks of the citizens. A back-page news item in this daily on Saturday spoke alleged involvement of a section of employees of WASA, local fishermen and on-duty ansars in the scam defying office orders. //////AN interesting aspect of rural livelihood system is mobility.

Most of the intellectuals, politicians and others asked for a free and fair election with participation of all the parties, they even demanded release of all criminals (innocent in their view). It is an irony that those criminals are being freed. If the participation of criminals in the general election is essential for democracy-- we simply do not need that democracy and election. The BGMA remained silent when the businessman was killed by the goons (or so called "chhatra"). We will soon see lots of new sycophants of Tarique for nomination in the coming general election. Again they will claim they are people's representatives and hence they are the best. We must not allow general election as a process for empowering the politicians to engage in corruption. //////'The settlement was a "complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on Libya by Italy during the colonial era", the Italian prime minister said. "In this historic document, Italy apologises for its killing, destruction and repression against Libyans during the colonial rule," Col Gaddafi said. This is part of the news posted by BBC. Can the Pakistanis read? If they can they would have understood what it means to be civilised. The news goes on--"It is my duty, as a head of the government, to express to you in the name of the Italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused to you," said Berlusconi" If Pakistani leaders were enlightened like Italian PM Berlusconi, then they would have, too, acknowledged morally and physically, the atrocities meted out on us-Bengalees-- in 1971.Some of their intellectuals have stood in front of their press club with a 'We are sorry' banner. Is that enough to heal the wounds and scars ? I lost my elder brother in 1971.Each and every member of my family went through a painful psychological trauma from that death. Is that banner good enough for me and others like me? I will always curse Pakistanis from the depth of my heart. Pakistanis still have to learn what is meant by 'dignity, humanity and respect' .//////This is the latest topic making the rounds of drawing room gossip! The caretaker government, once so determined on the minus two formula, has now belatedly discovered the "managed two" formula, we are now awaiting the experimental proof of this new formula; the earlier experiment having failed!

For the benefit of the 150 million people of Bangladesh, decentralisation has become essential. //////I tend to agree with the analysis of the current political situation made by Mr. Husain Imam (DS August 28, 2008). He has correctly catalogued the successes and failures of the present caretaker government (CTG) of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed. Mr. Imam is very right when he says, The bandits, we say godfathers, who were put in jail (more appropriately in quarantine camp) or kept on the run on charges of wanton corruption, violence, loot, extortion and abuse of state power, now seem to be flexing their muscles to stage a comeback with garlands around their necks and making V-sign with their fingers, thanks to the handling, or should we say mishandling, of the cases. //////At least 17 people were killed and around 80 injured Saturday when a suicide attacker rammed his bomb-laden vehicle into a security checkpost in the northwestern city of Peshawar.//////Pakistan's new president Asif Ali Zardari was once so tainted by corruption allegations that he acquired the nickname "Mr Ten percent" among his countrymen and beyond.//////Some villagers began trying to return to their flooded homes in eastern India yesterday as waters slowly receded, but officials warned the move was risky with a month of heavy rains still expected.//////Thousands of angry people took to the streets in Indian Kashmir to denounce the killing Saturday of a protester by government troops who fired rubber bullets and tear gas shells at Muslim demonstrators chanting anti-India slogans, an official said. //////India's government hailed as "historic" a decision yesterday by nuclear supplier nations to end the country's nuclear pariah status and adopt a US initiative to allow atomic trade with New Delhi.//////The Indian military on Friday took its long-running battle for higher wages to the prime minister, warning poor perks were hurting morale in one of the world's biggest armies.//////At least 20 people were killed and 23 injured yesterday when dozens of homes in a northern Cairo shantytown were crushed by a massive rockslide, Egyptian officials said.//////A suicide bomber killed a state prosecutor and five other people in Afghanistan yesterday, and nearly a dozen people died in other insurgency-linked violence, authorities said.//////The United States is rearming Georgia under the guise of humanitarian assistance, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev charged on Saturday, following the arrival in Georgia of US warships laden with aid.//////Thailand's embattled Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej holed up at his heavily-guarded home on Saturday as protesters vowed to continue defying emergency rule and hold marches demanding he step down.//////Both US presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, want the European Union to play a bigger role in world crises, the French presidency of the bloc said on Friday.//////Top US defence officials have recommended US President George W.
