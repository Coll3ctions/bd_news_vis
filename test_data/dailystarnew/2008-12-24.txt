That raises the very pertinent question of how the individuals owning these fake numbers came to acquire them. One cannot in any way deny the fact that 35 per cent is an inordinately high number, especially in a matter as serious as TINs. Which again leads to a new question: how did the mechanism involved in the preparation and provision of TINs come by such a grave flaw? The answer to that question, as also other questions relating to TINs, must come from the NBR itself. It must explain its own failings in this regard. Obviously, there have been lapses along the line which have spawned the proliferation of TINs. Why those lapses have been there and what is being done to plug the holes is a question that now calls for a credible answer.//////IT is good to note that the government has reduced the prices of fuel further, the second time in the last two months. Howsoever slender the decrease maybe, it has come at a time when the next cropping season is round the corner. We hope that the farmers would be benifitted from the reduced cost of a very important input of cultivation.//////POLITICS appears to be turning towards the hypocritical, while we thought it was the art of the possible.

She does not explain, but everyone knows where she is pointing. //////ULTIMATELY, it wasn't superior firepower, sophisticated interception methods or commando training that helped arrest one of the Mumbai attackers.

The whole episode left the impression on the child's brain--that the election is a time of festivity, something akin to a fair .//////The caretaker government started off their proceedings by entering into the political arena quite ambitiously but consequently failed to live up to their expectations. The more they dug, the more dirt spilled out of the heart of this country. All kinds of obnoxious and filthy corruption was viciously interrelated and no doubt they were unable to curb it. And now the courts are rocking with innumerable bails that have been granted to the people convicted of outlandish crimes. After all these incidents, a question arises in the mind of a common citizen like me, that if our politicians are so innocent and if our leaders are so perfect, then why have we been branded as the most corrupt country in the world probably two or three consecutive times? We human beings are mortal and not intricate robots and therefore mistakes and misapprehensions are bound to occur in our actions, thoughts and decisions. And it is our obligation to realize our mistakes and rectify ourselves accordingly. Certainly, we cannot complain about lack of virtuous and graceful personalities in our country. But they are dispersed throughout the corners of this vast and endless sea of murky water and it has become so difficult to track them down. This upcoming election will be providing our politicians with a unique and distinctive opportunity to learn from the misdeeds that they have been held guilty of. It will also test their grace, smartness, capability and whether they are honest enough to correct themselves.//////According to some UK tabloids the Baghdad shoe thrower had no chance of hitting President Bush. Apparently, all relatively young US presidents are experts at dodging missiles, (mostly) thrown by their wives. One story going round is that soon after Bill Clinton took office he dodged a table lamp thrown at him by Hillary.//////I would like to draw the attention of the leaders and policy makers of the present AL to the "Election Manifesto of Bangladesh Awami League 2008". In its very second para it has been mentioned that "- - - - - the architect of our independence, the greatest Bengali of all times, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the founder of our party". Regarding foundation of AL we have come to know from the Banglapedia (Bangla version, page 110-112 of the 1st part) that the party (then it was "East Pakistan Awami Muslim League") was born on 23rd June, 1949 in Dhaka. The leaders on the first committee were President: Moulana Abdul Hamid khan Bhasani, Vice-president: Ataur Rahman Khan, Shakhawat Hossain and Ali Ahmed Khan, General Secretary: Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (at that time he was in jail), Kh. Mostaque Ahmed and A.K. Rafiqul Hossain, Treasurer: Yar Mohammad Khan.//////Thanks to Amir Khan for making 'Tare Zameen Par'. It's a movie which has the power to make every parent feel that their child is very special. It makes you feel that Ishaan (darsheel) the young actor, could be your son, daughter, friend or He could be you. //////The dropping of extortion cases against influential bigwigs apparently brings out the harsh political reality of our country. In Bangladesh 'what's ethical' and 'what's acceptable' largely depend upon the prevailing political situation. Today what we regard as 'a dire crime' might turn into 'a mere misunderstanding' tomorrow. As a result, prudent people seldom fail to heed the call of time. As the political scenario is gradually changing, the businessmen who were once courageous enough to file significant extortion cases against Sheikh Hasina and Tareq Zia can obviously imagine the consequences they would face if these 'powerful people' retaliate after being triumphant in the upcoming election. It won't be reasonable to criticize these businessmen because there really seems to be no other option left for them. It appears that our political destiny will always be controlled by a handful of people. And as long as these people can take advantage of the right situation they will always get away with their crimes. Businessmen, who are now dropping cases filed against top politicians, are actually clever enough to sense that the 'blind masses' of Bangladesh won't ultimately stand by their side and the public will eventually vote for the same corrupt culprits, despite being aware of their evident misconducts. These businessmen at least felt the need to alter things when they 'mistakenly' envisaged a new horizon of change. //////Each country has its own citizenship laws based on its own policy. People may have dual nationality by automatic operation of different laws rather than by choice. For example, a child born in a foreign country to US citizen parents may be both a U.S. citizen and a citizen of the country of birth. //////Ethically, I do not endorse the way the Iraqi journalist Muntadar al-Zeidi expressed his disgust against the US President George W. Bush because by this action Zeidi being a journalist has shown gross disregard to journalistic ethics. Under the conventional rule, it is unlawful even to point a finger at the car carrying a foreign dignitary. After all, Mr. Bush is the president of a country which has been bestowed with abundant knowledge, resources, and power. Of course, it is true that President George W. Bush being the head of a country which is considered the lone superpower has abused his capacity by invading Iraq on a false pretext that Iraq had harboured weapons of mass destruction. But in reality, Bush's hypothesis could not be proved as no such weapon was found. But the war commissioned by President Bush had claimed lives of hundreds of thousands innocent Iraqi people plus 4,209 US soldiers. The United States spent nearly $567 billion since the war in Iraq began in 2003.//////The whole country has gone mad about the forthcoming election. But I still don't understand why and how they decided that we have to choose between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. Why do we have to choose between the two ladies who have been consistently failing, lying and harassing us over the last 15 years? Are we to believe that out of 144 million people in our country, there is no more qualified and more capable person to be trusted with our lives and the future of our children?//////I am most interested in the motivation, history and present practices of religious people who get involved in politics, especially those who get involved in ways that alarm the fellow-citizens of their democracy! Maybe my experience in the UK might throw some light on this issue and encourage those of all religious persuasions in Bangladesh who are sincere about bringing into their national life the goodness, honesty and desire to help the needy that the theory and practice of any good religion should teach us. It cannot be a bad thing for keenly religious people to want to participate in the political processes but it is how they do it that brings either good or bad consequences. //////A military-led group declared a coup in the West African nation of Guinea yesterday, announcing it had dissolved the government and constitution hours after the death of the country's longtime dictator.//////The highest-ranking US military officer on Monday encouraged Pakistan to forge "more productive ties" with India as the probe into the Mumbai attacks continues, the US embassy said here.//////A tense calm reigned over the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip yesterday as the Palestinian Islamist group said it might be willing to agree to a new truce with Israel.//////Thousands of Tamils fleeing heavy fighting in the north of Sri Lanka are trapped by the government and being denied basic provisions, Human Rights Watch said yesterday.//////Pakistan on Monday put its air force on alert and increased aerial surveillance of key cities a day after India said its options to avenge the Mumbai terror attacks include war. //////US officials said Monday that they want answers from Russia on whether it is selling advanced surface-to-air missiles to Iran, a move the US insists could threaten American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. //////Indian police said yesterday they had foiled a major suicide strike in Indian-controlled Kashmir with the arrest of three Islamist militants, including a Pakistani soldier.//////Fugitive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar yesterday refuted reports of any talks between the Afghan government and the militants on ways to put an end to the seven-year insurgency.//////Two giant pandas made their long-anticipated, groundbreaking trip from China to Taiwan yesterday, in the latest sign of fast thawing ties between the two former bitter rivals.//////Five Muslim immigrants face the potential of life in prison after being convicted of scheming to massacre US soldiers at Fort Dix.//////YOU know that when the merchandising of dreams and hopes, and fears, is in full swing the election is knocking on the door.

As I film the crowd, I can see scattered Bengali faces. Later I ask one organiser if speaking Bangla is a way to appeal to Bengali voters. "Yes," he replies, "But don't forget, not all Paharis speak Chakma." Chakma, Marma and Tripura are the biggest presence at these meetings, but the official records show eleven different ethnic Jumma groups in Chittagong Hill Tracts.//////ELECTIONS 2008, the defining moment of the nation, is very much at our doorstep. Yes, finally the time has come for us to take a deep breath and make a solid vow so that we can make the most of the occasion. Had it been held two years back, its significance would not have been the same as the imminent one because of many factors, including qualitative change of our politics.
