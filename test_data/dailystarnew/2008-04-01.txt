India's Railways minister Lalu Prasad Yadav has turned the tide and unleashed streams of debates across the vast country. His opponents are trying to play it down while his supporters are trying to hype it up with all their might. So, what has he done? //////AMERICA, today, is obviously divided at home and bitterly resented abroad -- a position the global military hegemony can ill-afford to be in. Worse, it confronts a worldwide terrorist movement with an apocalyptic streak, and finds itself in difficult counter-insurgency battles in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even a convincingly re-elected President Bush could hardly allay the anxiety and recrimination among the policy elites and a sizeable chunk of general public; neither could he offer the kind of course corrections that the US allies were hoping for. //////FOR anyone wondering why Barack Obama's demeanour looks so presidential, the answer is simple: through his mother Obama is related to six US presidents! Hillary Clinton, who is of French-Canadian descent, is related to three famous female singers. There is also evidence to support the case for Obama and Clinton making good running mates: they are related to Hollywood heartthrobs, actor Brad Pitt and actress Angelina Jolie respectively, who are mates in real life. Pitt and Obama are ninth cousins, as are Hillary and Jolie.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club go into the final game of the first leg of the Premier Cricket League today with an aim to finish atop.

Rice price increase is what has affected them the most, since it has posed a high threat to the food security of the people, particularly the poor. Wheat has long served as the substitute of rice for the people in Bangladesh but in the background of recent price rise of both rice and wheat at the same time, one might be tempted to look for other substitutes for rice, especially for the poor people whose real income is under serious pressure due to the price hike. //////Global food prices registered an unprecedented 40 per cent increase during 2007. This is fraught with the potential danger of causing large-scale discontent if the situation gets out of hand. Hence, it is urgent for all countries facing this situation to take energetic steps with the objective of reigning in the price-hike of food and other essentials. In 2007, rice price in Bangladesh rose by 42.6 per cent on average whilst wheat price posted a rise of 55.4 per cent.

At present the poverty rate in Bangladesh is 40%. If we all do not store up our riches here on the earth, where moths and rust destroy and robbers break in to steal, then the figure will be changed gradually. The absolute poor are those who cannot even have the minimum nutritional requirement of 2112 kcal for survival. They are the victims of malnutrition & suffer from various diseases. That means an average of 40 people in 100 go hungry everyday. So pathetic!! The needy children have to struggle to manage a little bit of something to eat. //////The golden fibre by Abed Choudhury in Point Counterpoint page of your March 23 edition drew my attention. Like him I do believe that there are new opportunities for jute goods, especially, in recent months, when we are watching the new green movement by the west. There is a need for reusable and recyclable grocery bags, shopping bags that are environment friendly and biodegradable. However, I disagree with Mr. Abed on the argument that the costly genome sequencing of jute is the answer. I believe the answer lies somewhere between the initiative taken by dynamic entrepreneurs and branding, marketing of such products. I will give you one example of my personal experience to put this into context.//////An English daily has reported that toll taking still continues openly at the city bus terminals.

He was a great religious leader, educationalist, writer and a great politician.//////I was reading a piece "Boeing! Boeing" in The Daily Star on 16 Mar 08 which was written by Mr. M. Firoze--a steel industry consultant. I was surprised. Who told him that the Bangladesh government is spending $1.265 billion of taxpayers' money on buying eight luxury aircraft? This is not true. Biman itself will bear the costs taking loan from international financing organisations like EXIM Bank --a US banking institution. And a small portion of the total amount will be paid from Biman's own funds. This was in reports published in various newspapers. Even Mr Mahbub Jamil, the chairman of Biman's board of directors, said in a news conference after signing the agreement with Boeing in Dhaka that Biman would not take anything from the government to buy the aircraft.//////Though most tycoons , particularly the so-called industrialists, must be termed as defaulters, there is no denying the fact that no ruling power can punish them, no legislation can put them into prison. Paradoxically, Manaranjan, an octogenarian of Rangpur district who could not pay his tiny amount of loan, was mercilessly dragged by the police not long ago and this became lead news at home and abroad. Interestingly enough, such elderly persons are, indeed, an easy prey to any ruling class. The persistent problem of loan default got its inception in the 1980s, during the regime of president HM Ershad. //////March 15 was the day on which 'The Daily Star' organised its 9th award presentation ceremony for the students of O and A levels, who had achieved excellent and extraordinary results in their respective examinations.
