In precise terms, now that the accord, however flawed, is there, it is time to move from generalisations to specifics. This is especially true of Bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Indeed, with projections of as much as one-fifth of the country being lost to the ravages wrought by carbon emissions, there is certainly no time to lose. The options are limited or are not there at all. In other words, adaptability is not an option but a necessity for us as also for other vulnerable nations.//////SET against failed track records of the National Curriculum and Text Book Board(NCTB), or for that matter of the Education Ministry in reaching text books to schools ahead of academic session, what the education minister has pulled off is a truly remarkable feat.

He made many appearances in the media as commentator on environmental issues. He is author of High Tide & was also selected as a National geographic emerging explorer in 2006. Mark Lynas tried to let the people know the information he could collect which is truly unique, a degree by degree guide to our future on a hotter planet. After reading this book it made me curious & terrified too. Sunday Times commented: Our future on a hotter planet-six degrees, I tell you now, is terrifying. Lynas says six degrees change in day night temperature will do no harm to the earth. But six degrees of global average change is an entirely different prospect. Six degrees as he said was beginning to feel like a survival manual, full of indications about which parts of the globe might need to be abandoned & which would be most likely to remain habitable. It also came to light that global warming is making the hydrological cycle more intense causing heavier storm & more intense hurricanes to brew up out at sea. He said about the misery suffered in New Orleans three years ago. He felt-like an insight into what the twenty first century may have in store for many of us in thousands of locations across the world as climate change accelerates. It further said that thermal inertia of the oceans would take centuries for temperature to stabilize which amply indicated that we have already reached the point of no return. He also said six degrees might be depressing, the impacts are terrifying but they are still avoidable.//////In view of the pledge of the prime minister to upgrade Dhaka to a modern, beautiful and hassle-free city, ensuring smooth communications both on roads and waterways in and around the capital, I would like to reproduce below a few suggestions I made earlier on the issue of tackling the unplanned growth of the Dhaka city: //////Recently, the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh(TCB) has released the information about price rates during the tenures of past three governments. In 2006, coarse rice was sold at Tk 17 per kg, which became Tk 27 on 5 January. //////A recent poll conducted by The Daily Star has illustrated that womens rights are still a contentious issue in our country. The results of the poll reminded me of the criticism that the last caretaker government had to contend with after it passed the National Womens Development Policy. I realize I may be treading on very thin ice by bringing up this topic because of its obvious implications but, nonetheless, I would like to say that equality isnt something that people have to strive for in this age. It should be something accorded to all of us regardless of our sex, income level, or religion. //////Yes, one of your writers from UK has rightly and timely quoted the above proverb (DS 28 Dec.) to 'stop name game'. I have had in mind to write at length on the subject but then thought the way the courtiers of the present government are active in collecting and suggesting names, I can not win the race! //////The BNPs stand against Indias proposal of sending security personnel to guard their high commission is quite intriguing. Its also self-contradictory, because they never question the presence of US marine corps at the US Embassy. If they allow the marines why create a fuss about the Indians? //////My understanding is, a true Muktijoddha can never compromise with the Rajakars & Al Badr members who were involved with the gruesome killings and rapes of 1971. Came to know from a local daily that Poet Al Mahmud received an award from a reception of Jamaat-e-Islami that was arranged to honour (!) the freedom fighters. I personally feel disgusted that Mr. Al Mahmud had the discernment to participate in a programme like this which was arranged by a political party which does not believe in the very existence of Bangladesh!//////Pakistani President Mr. Asif Ali Zardari has vowed to fight legal battle in the court against a recent Supreme Court ruling. We highly appreciate his spirit and believe that it will be a good end for public view. //////Thousands of people cross the Airport Road everyday from DOHS Mohakhali to Banani & Mohakhali Bazar & vice versa risking their lives.

It is dangerous for health and a curse for society. There are thousands of addicted people in Bangladesh and most of them are young. The young Bangladeshis are addicted to drug because of agony, anxiety, depression, bad company etc. Moreover, young people belonging to the upper class of society take alcohol and other drugs to maintain their status in the friend circles. Day by day, they are becoming more addicted to drugs in order to keep on their friend circle. As a result, whenever the young are being addicted by drug, they can not come back from it, so that they have to face different kinds of problems in life. Verily, drug is so easy to get in our country because its network is widespread. //////One of my colleagues while engaged in writing a text suddenly asked me, whats the difference between the words Toward and Towards?

Rahman (The Daily Star: Internet Edition, December 15, 2009). It starts with his dilemma in joining the golden jubilee and ends with his disillusionment, in his view, in the elite schools apparent failure of fulfilling the expectations of the nation. This is in stark contrast with a piece by another FCC alumnus F. Ahmed, presumably his 6th intake mate, entitled Faujdarhat Cadet College: Half a Century of Excellence (The Daily Star: Internet Edition, April 28, 2008) that glorified its visionary founder and the legendary founding principal as well as the accomplishments of many ex-cadets, among other things.//////Let us strike at the root of the trouble. And the only best way out for resolving our protracted problems is to declare the presently 22 divisions of the country (Pakistan) as provinces and each one has to be declared entitled for equal resources, irrespective of population, topography and area.

A 500-bed hospital is being constructed at Mugda in Dhaka city by the government. No doubt it will increase health service facilities of the city. Shortage of medical collages in the country is one of the reasons behind scarcity of qualified medical practitioners. Thousands of science students at higher secondary level are interested to get medical education. Indeed, expansion of general higher education increases unemployed educated population, which is at present a mere wastage of national wealth. //////I refer to the letter by O H Kabir above ( 27Dec09). Firstly vowels are required to make a syllable which can be pronounced and it has nothing to do with grammar or meaning of a word. Besides the five explicit vowels of a, e, i, o, and u: y is recognised as a half vowel for the purposes of creating a syllable for pronunciation. Hence we can pronounce words like fly, dry etc of one syllable and slyly which is of two syllables or syzygy, a word of three syllables etc,. However use of y to enable creation of a syllable or syllables is much more restricted than the standard vowels, and syllabic words of this form are well known and are limited in number. //////The ACC must feel like fighting a monster in its effort to curb corruption.
