That is only natural, given that a number of those who have submitted nomination papers are individuals with a questionable past. And that is what the EC, reconstituted following the imposition of a state of emergency last year, was supposed to avoid. Its job, one it went into with gusto, was to clear the Augean stables of the accumulated mess of years and so make it possible for democracy to take new roots. That was the ideal before it. It still is. The difficulty is that despite all the scrutiny it has so far engaged in regarding candidates for the upcoming polls, it does not seem to have been able to prevent a good number of old faces, with unsavoury reputations to boot, from entering the electoral fray.//////ONCE again there has been another horrific accident on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, the country's main inter-city thoroughfare.

We, the people, have been getting into ever deeper tunnels of gloom where managing a decent living for our spouses, children and siblings is concerned.

I have no actual figure of how much the Dhaka city is in square kilometres, but I can say it's about time that the people and the government think about expanding the city vertically.//////Dhaka University's main contributions are its role in the Language Movement and the Liberation War. Independent Bangladesh has turned 38. Now time has come to assess what DU had achieved under a sovereign state. Its research portfolio and indigenous and global applications of the research have to be quantified to evaluate the university's performance in an independent country. In this matter everyone will not give good marks to the university.//////The water levels of different rivers are increasing due to heavy rain and the rush of water from upstream.

In June 2008, 333 crimes were committed against women, among them 73 were rape cases and 9 acid throwing. //////After a long time the common people of Bangladesh were optimistic that they would recover from the days of Khaleda and Hasina. In the initial days of the CTG, they did a lot of revolutionary work like the drive against corruption. But the price hike has actually neutralised all that has been done in public interest. //////It is reported in the front-page news of 2nd July DS that the Awami League (AL) will include among others, demand for withdrawal of all, what they called false, cases filed against their party chief Sheikh Hasina. Previously, the party was demanding her release and sending abroad for her specialized treatment of serious ear and eye ailments.//////Further to my letter a few months back about manners and mobile phones, there was another incident to which I was witness that shows how ill mannered people can be when it comes to their precious mobile phones. In a seminar, a professor from abroad was giving a talk to Bangladeshis about the problems of Bangladesh. At the end a gentleman from the audience asked him a question through a microphone when the musical tone of his mobile phone started ringing. He continued asking the question with the music in the background now amplified by the microphone, so we had music with the narrative! When he finished the question and the professor started addressing him with his answer, the phone rang again. Without any hesitation the man answered the call while the professor went on speaking. //////Currently, admission into the college is made on the basis of grades obtained in the SSC examinations. On the other hand, in case of the same grade, relatively higher age is considered as criterion for admission instead of merit. This year the number of successful students with golden GPA-5 is very high compared to the previous years. The figure is about 10,000. Whereas, the number of seats in the renowned colleges of the capital is relatively much less. Moreover 10% seats in the capital colleges will remain reserved for the rural students. Thus it appears that many meritorious students having Golden GPA-5' may not get chance of studying in their preferred renowned colleges, simply due to their relatively lower age. //////A very interesting and informative front-page news on the subject was published on July 3 in a local English daily. //////It is learned that Dhaka University is planning to set up a new campus in the vicinity of the city to accommodate more students. While the government has to provide huge subsidy to Dhaka University at the cost of the poor tax payers, setting up of a new campus is felt to be most ill conceived. Students studying in Dhaka University are mostly the children of the richer section of society. That means poor people are subsidizing the education of the children of rich people! It is not also possible to raise tuition fees of Dhaka University or, for that matter, of other public universities to a reasonable level as it may lead to an uproar among the vested interest groups. People do not mind paying high tuition fees to private universities. //////AL chief Sheikh Hasina has been freed from executive-jail on executive orders and she is now in the USA for treatment. The common people really do not know why she was detained and under what arrangement she has been released. The whole process is shrouded in mystery. On the other hand, the detained BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia is also probably going to be released very soon, apparently under a similar arrangement, along with her two sons who were arrested on specific corruption charges. The government is claiming that everything is being done as per the law and for greater interest of the country and the people.//////It is with great concern that I note that someone has ordered putting up barbed wires to fence in the road divider along Gulshan Avenue. //////A letter of mine on water logging was published in The Daily Star almost one month ago. In that letter I requested the authorities concerned to take effective measures so that we do not have to suffer in the rainy season. But the authorities seem to wake up very late!//////Who will say that Bangladesh is a civilised country? People are going to be paupers or may die due to the unprecedented price hike, whilst our advisers don't see anything. Their activities seem to beef up friendship with those who are hoarding different commodities illegally. General people know everything as to how the businessman are hoarding commodities. But what measures has the present caretaker government taken to stop such activities? //////Children love to paint. It is an exercise that helps their mental growth. You just have a look at a kid's painting .What strikes you is colour-- green, yellow or red run riot through the whole piece. The point is that a child is liberal as far as putting colour on paper is concerned. A child, in other words, paints a dream-like image. There is something special about children's painting : it manifests imagination in the raw.//////Students who came out successful in the SSC examination this year with flying colours are in fear of being denied admission to the colleges of their choice.//////It now appears from a UNB-Dhaka report carried by a daily on 02nd day of July 2008, Bangladesh has not yet been able to decide on matters pertaining to recognition of Kosovo. Despite persistent diplomatic efforts by US Ambassador James Moriarty and others, it also appears the move towards recognising Kosovo by Bangladesh is restricted by factors associated with perceived national interest - according to the foreign affairs adviser.//////Why do we not change the English spelling of our towns the way they are pronounced in the vernacular? For instance why do we still write 'Comilla' for 'Cumilla' ?

An imaginary world has been created through the conversation between Ibsen with his wife Susan as well as the characters of his plays to feature Henrik Ibsen's biography, philosophy and approach to art. Subsequently, the play features what the great Norwegian playwright Ibsen, who has dealt with issues such as freedom, gender inequality and others, might have written if he were alive today. //////WHILE people perceive that there has been a reduction in corruption severity, the 2007 survey by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) claiming that there has been no decline in pervasive corruption has been disquieting to many. The watchdog is "disappointed" that it does not see any significant improvement in the corruption situation. TIB also claims that corruption severity under the caretaker government (CTG) remains unabated. I intend to address the disparity between the common perception and survey results. //////THE inflationary pressure on the economies of the South Asian region is mounting with the spiraling oil prices and volatile oil markets.
