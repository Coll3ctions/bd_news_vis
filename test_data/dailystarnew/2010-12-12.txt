For all the fanfare associated with a celebration of the day, through seminars, symposia and the like, the fact remains that in today's Bangladesh, there is a blight which casts its shadows over the rights that citizens are morally and constitutionally entitled to enjoy. Justice Mohammad Habibur Rahman puts it in perspective for us when he notes that the executive branch of government possesses neither the skills nor the power to protect human rights. That is a severe indictment of the authorities. Add to that the fact that there is hardly any meaningful exhortation from the powers that be about the need to guarantee human rights through taking swift action against those who have continued to demonstrate a cavalier attitude to them through a systematic violation of them.//////Bangladesh has a great potential and opportunity to make its mark in the world by projecting her culture through heritage shows overseas like India and Sri Lanka have been doing. This was stated at a news conference held by Bangladesh Arts Council (BAC) ahead of a heritage show last Thursday. Bangladeshi culture has a unique history of 2500 years. We have a rich heritage, full of diversity and some distinct characteristics which need to be presented in a coherent and attractive manner to the outside world. //////As strong as Jamie Siddons's bullish mood was the Zimbabwe camp's assertion on ending the five-match one-day series with a win.

Her mother Khodeza Khatun informed local Union Parishad (UP) Chairman Fazlul Haque Mondol of the matter on December 9. This has infuriated the stalker. Babu again teased Sonia yesterday morning while she was going to her school. He also threatened to kidnap and marry her at a convenient time. On return home, Sonia narrated the story to her mother who informed the matter to the police. Police rushed to the spot and arrested the stalker. Upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) and executive magistrate of the mobile court Hamidul Haque punished the stalker. //////Two schoolgirls drowned in the Padma in Lalpur upazila of the district on Friday. They are Rini, 8, daughter of Nantu Mia of Palidoha village and Prity, 7, daughter of Panna Mia, also of the same village, police said.

When they reached the Judge's Court area at around 5:00 pm, police obstructed the ISA men and picked up four of them from the spot.//////Most papers reported on 2nd December of the High Court reminding the government of its duty to preserve the Liberation War sites! It is a shame for the nation, the governments and now the Awami League, that two years on, they have done nothing towards preserving our historical sites related to our liberation struggle. Despite the writ petition in 2009, we are still ignoring our own history. One wonders why it needed a writ petition to the Hon. High Court by a few patriotic citizens, to point out to the powers that are, of this vital national duty. Was it not the duty of our politicos to do this, since they talk the most about our liberation struggle and the creation of Bangladesh? They were and are unfortunately too busy otherwise!//////Almost all the countries of the world have two capitals i.e. administrative and commercial. The administrative capital of our neighbouring giant is New Delhi and the commercial capital is Mumbai. Then again, Islamabad is the administrative and Karachi is the commercial capital of Pakistan.//////I am disturbed by the contrast between the frequent assurances that the racial and religious minorities in Bangladesh are treated honourably and tolerantly and the numerous examples of quite different behaviour that I have come across personally in my years here or read about in your columns - and, so far, have been silent about. These included several murders which got minimal publicity and, usually, no follow-up. On November 30th, you reported two situations, one in Aluari village, Dinajpur and another in Shyamnagar, Satkhira. Mention of the damaging of 'a church' in one of them indicates the village was Christian and in the other one, the community concerned included Hindus. //////Has Begum Khaleda Zia committed any crime by living long 28 years at the cantonment house? She did not request Dhaka Cantonment Board to allot her that house. The fact is our past government/Dhaka Cantonment Board gave her the house to compensate her after the assassination of her husband President Ziaur Rahman. Begum Khaleda Zia is totally innocent. We are surprised and shocked, and we fail to understand why Begum Khaleda Zia was evicted from her house after 28 years? Why now this hue and cry about cantonment house? //////Although BNP joined one or two parliament sessions, it is a matter of regret that this opposition party could not play a significant role in making the parliament effective. Besides, politics of hartal that caused huge loss to our economy has added fuel into the flame. BNP's decision of not joining the parliament has made the people frustrated. MPs of BNP can even resign any time from the parliament; they have warned the government about it. Undoubtedly, this decision is leading the whole country again to the politics of clash. //////What is going on in our country? We are criticising Dr. Yunus in a way which is so shameful for the nation. Dr. Yunus achieved the Nobel Prize for his role in eradicating poverty. He introduced microcredit to the world. It is a widely accepted theory and acknowledged by the world famous economists. He established his theory through his works. But we did not stand behind him, rather we criticised his getting the Nobel Prize. I felt so bad when I saw a procession coming out of Dhaka University shouting slogans against Dr. Yunus. Our PM also commented on the incident and demanded proper investigation into the matter which was unfortunate. //////One cannot get the actual stories behind the news by reading Bangladeshi dailies, especially the Bangla dailies. For example, most Bangla dailies carried the news of shifting Khaleda Zia's household belongings under big headlines. This is not a big news for the nation. The story behind this news is very simple. Begum Zia has lost her legal battle and she is vacating the cantonment house. Of course, she deserves some notice from the media, but not this big coverage. //////While I was in Bangladesh a few weeks ago, I went to my village where I grew up. In our village, there were almost 50 60 Hindu families in 1971 and now there are only seven families left. More shocking is that these remaining families are now the poorest of all. Most of them once had agricultural land, were relatively affluent, but now landless. //////Ragging is a nasty manifestation of popular culture. But what will be accomplished by assigning new police functions to school or college administrations? A look at child rearing in Bangladesh will reveal the roots of ragging. Girls appear to have lesser scope or opportunity for anti-social behaviour. But in the case of boys, a great deal is overlooked by parents. Even in school, a parent is offended by reports of anti-social behaviour by his son. Perhaps training children for adulthood has to start much earlier. It is difficult to overlook the fact that ragging is cultural in its origins.//////Custodial deaths and extra judicial killings have made our law enforcing agencies controversial. Last year as many as 90 people died in custody. Very recently 17-year-old Sagor died in police custody. His family alleged that he died due to torture by the cops. Astonishingly, we are observing such deaths one after another. Besides, the police show their disgust to file cases in these connections. Thus, these deaths go uninvestigated. //////The American diplomacy sustained a serious jolt following disclosure of a huge volume of classified government documents by the Wikileaks. This disclosure has put the entire world into a chaotic and confusing situation.//////The daily Prothom Alo has published a report on the Health Bulltin-2010 of Health Directorate on 27th November 2010. Cardiovascular diseases have been identified as the number one cause of patients' death in the country in the report. And the people aged between 25 to 49 years die mainly of these diseases. The age group shown in the report who are vulnerable to cardiac diseases is the most productive and income generating group in the family. Generally, the doctors say that hypertension, stress, anxiety, food habit etc. are the main causes of cardiovascular diseases. //////We have seen an example of objective and responsible reporting from The Daily Star on December 3. A foreign media circulated a story of fund transfer from Grameen Bank to a sister organisation Grameen Kalyan. Using this as a source the media at home made a news story on December 2 that created undue sensation in society. The news story created disturbance in the minds of the readers. Some of them, who take pride in the performance of Grameen Bank and its winning of the Nobel Peace Prize, were shocked at the allegations. //////A group of Somali pirates reportedly hijacked a Bangladesh-flagged ship in the Arabian Sea off the coast of India recently. The fate of 26 abductees remained unknown. The government and the naval force couldn't do anything to rescue the ship. Some days have passed, and now the debate has turned into who hijacked the ship. This is really frustrating. The government should do something very quickly to recover the ship from the hijackers.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday sought a clean start in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks by urging both sides to tackle "without delay" the core issues of their decades-old conflict.//////Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao faces a tough task when he arrives in India next week to allay New Delhi's fears over China's rise as a global power, and to smooth tensions in an often-fractious relationship.//////UN-led climate negotiations in Mexico yesterday approved a deal after two weeks of talks and a final two days of virtually non-stop diplomacy.//////Key points in the latest secret US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks://////The United States has expressed regret over India's ambassador Meera Shankar being pulled out of an airport security line and frisked by a security agent.//////Pakistani newspapers have admitted they were hoaxed after publishing reports based on fake Wikileaks cables containing anti-Indian propaganda.//////A lawyer for Julian Assange, the founder of the WikiLeaks website, said on Friday she expects US prosecutors will indict her client soon for espionage.//////A former Indian minister at the heart of a telecom scandal promised Saturday to "cooperate fully" with authorities investigating what could be the country's biggest corruption case.//////Fifteen Afghan civilians died when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan and seven road construction company employees were killed in an air strike in an eastern province, authorities said yesterday.//////General David Petraeus, the top US military commander in Afghanistan, has been named the "most fascinating person of 2010", beating the cast of MTV reality show "The Jersey Shore" and teen singer Justin Bieber.//////India's environment minister late Friday likened Mexican Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinosa to a "goddess" as she won rave reviews for brokering a deal on climate change.//////Bolivia late Friday criticized a draft UN agreement on climate change as too weak and accused other nations of trying to isolate the leftist-led nation at a crunch conference in Mexico.//////Police have rejected suggestions that a communication breakdown led to the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall being caught up in student protests.//////To mark Universal Human Rights Day 2010 as well as to generate awareness against violation of basic human rights, Manusher Jonno Foundation in association with UKaid and Royal Norwegian Embassy in Bangladesh organised an award giving ceremony and a music festival on December 10 at the Mall Chattar on Dhaka University campus.//////All roads led to Army Stadium as the decked out stage was all set to welcome the 'King of Bollywood' Shahrukh Khan on December 10.

The merchant ship was carrying nickel and was sailing from Indonesia to Greece after refueling at Singapore. According to reports, a group of pirates attacked the bulk carrier off the Indian port of Cochin on the afternoon of December 5, and it was last seen by satellites to be heading towards the Somali coast. Twenty-six Bangladeshi are on board, of which twenty-five are crew members and one lady, who is the spouse of the chief engineer.//////The first-ever South Asia regional conference on early childhood development (ECD) ended in Dhaka on December 9. The three day meeting at the Bangabandhu International Centre was attended by four hundred people, including over a hundred academics, researchers and practitioners from all the South Asian countries and renowned experts from USA, UK, Canada, Australia and elsewhere. The Bangladesh ECD Network (BEN) and the Asia-Pacific Regional Network on Early Childhood (ARNEC) jointly hosted the South Asian Conference.//////Several economists have been arguing for sustainable economic development which takes care of the natural resources and can ensure intergenerational equity since the 1960s, though it was not until the 1970s that an international environmental policy was thought of at the policy level. //////The last two years of the Awami League government have been a mixed bag of hopes and dashed expectations. It is true that no one takes the aposhheen netri seriously when she heaps ludicrous allegations like economic stagnation and "selling" of the country to a "foreign power" upon the incumbent government. But when she talks about the rent seeking of the student and the youth wings of the Awami League, inability of the government to control the price of essentials, the stagnation in the ministries, she will certainly come across some consenting nods. That too, from people who have not been known to be admirers of the BNP. //////Airline traffic rises as business travellers return to the skies," a news report said. It's true. Despite all our pleadings on behalf of the environment, thousands of business people are once more being assigned to take long journeys for short meetings.//////
