Hapless Shikha, as the report goes, was no stranger to tortures like regular beating at her husband's hands, but she suffered all through silently. This last act of outrage might also have gone unnoticed had she not landed up in the burn unit of DMCH.//////THE authorities launched a fresh drive against old vehi-cles on city streets yesterday. When the decision was made to go after vehicles that were between twenty and twenty-five years old, we welcomed the move, albeit with the suggestion that it be implemented in such a way that left commuters' movement undisturbed. We reiterate the same point today, for the particular reason that the drive against old vehicles must not in any way create any dislo-cation for the thousands of city dwellers who happen to use such transport on a daily basis while commuting back and from work.//////Captain William Porterfield led from the front with a century as Ireland outplayed Bangladesh by seven wickets in the first one-dayer of the two-match series at Stormont in Belfast yesterday.//////Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin has assured that Taka 1-crore Super Cup will be held regularly as long as he is at the helm.//////Nadimul Islam of Savar Sena Shooting Club picked up two gold medals in the opening day of the 3rd National Air Gun Championship at the National Shooting Complex in Gulshan yesterday.//////Bangladesh will host the Group B matches of the AFC U-19 Women's Cham-pionship qualifiers over September 20-24 at the Bangabandhu National Stadium.//////Three records each from Jewel Ahmed and Nazma Khatun of Bangladesh Ansar headed the opening day of the BRB Cables 26th National Age-Group Swimming Championship to set eight national records at the National Swimming Complex in Mirpur yesterday.//////The bumper round draw of The Daily Star-Rangs Toshiba World Cup quiz will be held at the National Press Club auditorium today.//////Diego Maradona will be offered a new four-year contract to stay on as Argentina coach, the Argentinian Football Association has announced.//////Bangladesh Navy destroyed Matuail Milon Smriti Sangsad with a victory margin of 80-17 in the Pubali Bank Premier League Kabaddi at the Kabaddi Stadium yesterday.//////Four years ago, Jose Mourinho was in charge at Chelsea, Tony Blair was British Prime Minister, Esteban Cambiasso had hair, Leo Messi was an unused substitute and Carlos Tevez was playing his club football in Brazil.//////The Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, has said Wayne Rooney will soon shake off the frustration of his World Cup performance, adding that Rooney would be disappointed to have missed an opportunity to impress on the world stage.//////Spain's World Cup winning winger David Silva completed his move to Premier League club Manchester City from Valencia on Wednesday.//////Stuttgart have denied a report in Marca that midfielder Sami Khedira has agreed a 10 million euro transfer to Real Madrid.//////Striker Mario Balotelli does not have a price and right-back Maicon is also not on the market, Inter Milan sporting director Marco Branca said on Wednesday.//////Emile Heskey has announced his retirement from international football after winning 62 caps and scoring seven goals for England.//////Bayern Munich striker Thomas Mueller has indicated he would be happy to remain at the club for the rest of his career.//////Werder Bremen general manager Klaus Allofs has hinted the club may consider selling Mesut Oezil this summer if they cannot convince the playmaker to sign a new contract.//////Valencia have agreed to sign striker Aritz Aduriz from Real Mallorca subject to a medical, the Spanish club said on their website (www.valenciacf. com).//////Pakistan faced a record-breaking pursuit of 440 to win the first Test against Australia at Lord's here on Thursday.//////Pakistan legend Imran Khan became the fourth Pakistani to be inducted formally into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame at Lord's on Wednesday.//////FM Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar emerged unbeaten champion in the Mercantile Bank 36th National Championship after drawing against Debaraj Chatterjee in the final round at the Bangladesh Chess Federation hall-room yesterday.//////Titans Mohammedan got off to a flying start in the Super League of the Green Delta Insurance Premier Division Hockey League with a massive 8-1 win over Ajax Sporting Club at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////Split-innings games offering bowlers more incentives and the possibility of a batsman getting two lives are some of the options being considered by Cricket Australia as it plans a comprehensive makeover to revive the one-day format.

of protest or sorrow. According to this definition, hartal is a property of India and we have inherited the same. But in the next new edition the authors of Oxford Dictionary would probably correct this definition by replacing the word India by Bangladesh as we are playing the leading role in observing hartal as well as incorporating new strategy / actions such as killing people, damaging and torching vehicles and factories to make the hartal successful. //////Rotten, unhygienic, and expired food products, etc cause widespread health problem in Bangladesh. It is a habitual offence that needs to be addressed by public awareness and education. Simply, taking these kinds of date-expired or rotten foods in our stomach will definitely make us sick though not gravely. But consuming formalin mixed fish and mobile mixed oil cooked foods will slowly lead us to death. Stories often appear in newspapers of dried fish being preserved with officially banned DDT powder or other insecticides. Fish is no longer a favourite option for many city dwellers on their everyday menu, as the sale of formalin-laced fish has become a rampant practice in the city's kitchen markets, endangering public health. It is not just fish that is treated with harmful chemicals; urea fertilizer is being used to make puffed rice, an essential item that goes with almost all iftar items to make it whiter and more attractive. These unscrupulous traders invariably claim that the products they sell are fresh and not treated with chemicals for business purposes. Even milk sellers use drops of formalin to keep their pots of milk fresh. If anyone asks the vendors how they keep the fish, fruits and vegetables fresh, some of them may give a simple yet hazardous answer, medicine. Medicine here means formalin and calcium carbide. Carbides are used to ripen fruits. Scientists and doctors have warned that sustained consumption of food laced with toxic chemicals has debilitating effect on the human body and could even lead to multiple failures of such vital organs as liver and kidney. But who cares? //////An article on the subject, written by an American, was published on 4 July in the pages of a local English daily. The writer, possibly quite rightly criticizes Pentagon's estimated value of the Afghan minerals at US$ one trillion! He is sceptical on how the estimates could be drawn without proper mineral survey and mapping, and based on random finds here and there; in the midst of an ongoing war! Logically it seems to be an irrational, amateurish and totally speculative to be classified as having commercial exploitation potential for mining.//////Many a cause may be there behind road accidents but it is recognised that most of the accidents are happening as a result of the recklessness of the drivers who sometimes ignore the rules and discipline of driving.//////Our Traffic Police Farce: My last letter (DS 4 July) on Dhaka's traffic had concluded with the challenge that only when the controlling authorities found the will and resolve (now totally absent) to book everyone found guilty of breaking the traffic laws, would there be improvement. I am very happy to eat my words. It seems that there is at least one amongst our traffic cops with enough guts to file a complaint against an MP, stuck in a jam, for assaulting him in public!!!//////Nowadays we observe that incidence of question leakage is occurring frequently, especially in the selection test of a few public sector jobs and in the admission test of some public universities. These are mainly due to evil deeds of some govt, or university employees. There is a huge lack of morality, transparency, accountability and patriotism among them. //////I am not a professional HR activist but a firm believer of human rights. The other day we saw the new chairman of the HRC speaking to the press about his conviction and commitment to HR issues in Bangladesh. I regret to mention that I was not quite convinced of his idea of having their own investigative staff well trained in HR violation investigation. The reason, the police dept has eroded their public perception in conducting enquiry. This might encourage others to have their own cell for enquiry. The chairman might rethink or look for practical alternatives to mitigate HR violations, and keep aside the theoretical and academic aspects of the HR issues. The feasible alternative is to have a separate cell in the police dept and train them with the specific need of the HRC i.e. need based job oriented training and retraining.//////It is very dangerous news for us.//////We have recently watched a very free, fair, transparent and acceptable election in the Chittagong City Corporation. The opposition candidate M Manzur Alam got elected in the election. After his victory the Prime Minister of the state hailed him and hoped that he would do good for the port city people. And leaders of the govt also welcomed him. There were no complaints regarding rigging of polls from any quarters. This really augurs well for the growth of democracy in Bangladesh. As common people, we wish that both the government and the opposition will do healthy politics and shun the path of violence for the betterment of the country and its people.//////I applied for a plot in Uttara in last year's lottery as an Expatriate. I did not win any plot and submitted my application for refund on January 26, 2010. My receipt number is 558 & the expected refund date was March 29. So far I have not received my refund. I called Rajuk Probashi Kallayan Cell without any success. I sent an email to Rajuk chairman, but no response. I am running out of ideas on how to get my refund back. I would appreciate if the Rajuk authorities can step in. //////During the whole 2010 FIFA World Cup, the residents of Mohammadpur area went through a dismal time due to the on going load shedding. Most of the crucial matches were half watched, much to the dismay of the local people. I just think, World Cups come once every four year and bearing that in mind, couldn't the government ensure full power supply during the crucial matches? Bangladesh is football crazy and we crave for watching such big events but our enthusiasm is all drained by some people.//////I love hijab and having studied Torah, Bible and the Holy Quran, I can say that modesty has been enjoined in all the Divine Revelations. Appearance is an important aspect of our communication with others and it does make sense that God has defined modesty or the appearance that we should have. God defined it so that we are not divided over the issue of what to wear or what to consider as modest. I agree that hijab minimizes the risk of sexual harassment. However, what bothers me is the notion that not wearing the hijab is the main cause behind eve-teasing. I don't remember the specific details, but not so long ago, a female burkha-clad student was harassed at a public university. Was she at fault too, given that she was modestly dressed? If God has commanded women to dress modestly, He has also commanded men to lower their gaze. Hijab is not just about dressing modestly, but also about behaving modestly and it goes for both men and women. Everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:28). Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. ( Holy Quran 24:30). It does not matter whether the girl is covered or not, the men have to lower the gaze. In the above verses, it does not say that a man has to lower the gaze only if the women wear hijab. In fact, logically, a man should lower his gaze even more if the girl is not modestly dressed. Just like women wear hijab irrespective of how the men view them; men have to lower the gaze irrespective of how the women are dressed. //////After the conquering of Mt Everest by a Bangladeshi, comes another good news from our entrepreneurs -- the first jamdanee saree made from super-fine jute threads (exhibited recently in Dhaka).//////The High Court and the Supreme Court are the highest judicial bodies in every country. They are the protectors of the country's constitution and laws that are made by parliament.//////The honourable President of Bangladesh while receiving the annual audit report from the Auditor and Comptroller General advised the team to make all out efforts so that the money realised as tax from the common men is not misused in any way. He realised the facts that the development works funded by the government are not always ended without blame. There is a widespread accusation that the tenders of government works are not fairly done and there are syndicates everywhere. It is a fact that in spite of government's sincere efforts, the pace of development work is very slow and even the money earmarked for many projects is returned at the end of the financial year. The departments concern are not aware of the quality of the works or they even do not properly supervise the work. The lion's share of the project money goes to the pocket of the dishonest contractors and the officers and engineers of the supervising department. Everybody knows that the development works are funded by the money from the government exchequer which is fattened by the tax money realised from the general mass as VAT and income tax. People of Bangladesh whether rich or poor have to pay VAT while purchasing any commodity like edible oil, sugar, gas, cosmetics, clothes and availing services like gas, electricity, WASA etc. VAT is a sort of indirect tax and every consumer is bound to pay it and income tax is levied on a class of people having income above certain limits. So, everyone feels the pain while paying it as extra amount. //////I read with interest the article,  How to get rid of load shedding? written by Eng. Abdul Matin in your daily of April 7, 2010. The hot topic of the day has been presented in a very clear and simple language. The study of the background, analysis of the whole situation and the ultimate conclusion on the problem are, to say the least, unbiased and pragmatic. He addressed the problem with an insight into the multifarious aspects of the power supply and demand position of the country. He suggested immediate, medium term and long-term solutions. They appear to be quite feasible and as such deserve serious consideration. It has been concluded, The blame game will no longer console the power and energy starving people. I congratulate Engg. Matin for his brilliant ideas.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports. //////Log on to thedailystar.net to leave your comments.//////A Libyan aid ship originally bound for the Gaza Strip has been diverted to a port in Egypt after the Israeli navy warned the vessel against trying to break an Israeli blockade on the Palestinian coastal territory.//////An Iranian scientist who said he was kidnapped by the US has arrived home in Tehran, vowing to reveal more details of his claimed abduction while on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia last year.//////The Iranian nuclear scientist, who returned to Iran early yesterday after claiming he had been abducted by the US, received more than $5 million from the CIA for providing intelligence, The Washington Post reported.//////The US military is to hand over control of its last remaining detention centre in Iraq, as it increases the pace of its withdrawal from the country.//////North Korea's healthcare system is in such a state of crisis that doctors are frequently forced to perform surgery without anaesthetics, tying down patients to operating tables to prevent them moving, a report by Amnesty International has said.//////The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan met here yesterday for the first time after the Mumbai terror attack, with their talks getting extended at midday amid signs that they were on way to putting ties back on track.//////India and the US focused on expanding counter-terror cooperation and discussed UN reforms yesterday, as US National Security Adviser James Jones wrapped up his two-day trip aimed at firming up deliverables for President Barack Obama's visit in November.//////A suspected suicide bombing yesterday ripped through a busy street outside a bus stand in Pakistan's north-western district of Swat, killing four people and injuring at least 44, police said.//////The Indian rupee has achieved parity with major currencies such as the dollar, euro, pound sterling and yen in one respect: it now has its own symbol.//////After frittering away 24 months, Nepal's major parties yesterday said they would start working on the new constitution from tomorrow.//////Famed for his portrayal of the iconic role Debdas, Bulbul Ahmed would've turned 70 in another three months.
