However, it is from their pull on other objects outside them that black holes' presence can be known. While black holes themselves are invisible, their surroundings are dominated by powerful magnetic and gravitational forces. Those forces produce extremely bright radiations.

New observations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope provide strong evidence that the slender, bulgeless galaxies can, like their chubbier counterparts, harbour supermassive black holes at their cores. Previously, astronomers thought that a galaxy without a bulge could not have a supermassive black hole. In this illustration, jets shooting away from the black holes are depicted as thin streams. The findings are reshaping theories of galaxy formation, suggesting that a galaxy's "waistline" does not determine whether it will be home to a big black hole. //////
