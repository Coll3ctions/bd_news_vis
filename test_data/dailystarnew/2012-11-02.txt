If preventive measures are not taken right now, it may become a national disease very soon. We have an Anti-Corruption Commission to contain corruption. But can they claim that they have achieved any remarkable success in reducing corruption? When any corruption is exposed in the media or elsewhere, only then they come in the scene and probe the matter. Most of the time the findings of the ACC seem vague and do not match with the public perception but echoes the government's claim. ACC's duty is to go after corruption, expose corruption and ensure that the corrupt get proper punishment.

They are indicted for money laundering and collecting money unlawfully from the public. Exemplary punishment should be given to them if they are found guilty. But my question is what did the governments do for the last twelve years since Destiny's establishment? Apart from Destiny, there are several other multi-level marketing companies like Unipay2u, Speak Asia, etc. Why didn't the government take action against those companies at the beginning of their establishment? The government has taken steps when they were reported to have swindled millions of taka out of public pocket making them paupers. They used some of the government high-ups' names in collecting money, to tempt people into investing money. It is time the government took necessary steps so that the helpless investors can at least get their money back. I urge the government to find a permanent solution to the problem.//////I fully endorse Anika Nawal Ahmed's letter published in your esteemed newspaper on October 31 on the above subject. The Buddhists also set fire to two mosques in Western Myanmar. Why don't the Buddhists in Bangladesh protest the killings of Rakhine Muslims and burning of mosques in Myanmar? I am sure if the Buddhists of Bangladesh protest against the killings of Muslims in Myanmar, and the Muslims in Bangladesh protest' against the attacks on Buddhists, the problem will be solved very fast. God bless us all.//////You know, and after the S&L crisis, for instance, we went in and there were massive criminal investigations. We put 1,000 people in jail. There were no such investigations this time around. So this was just making everybody well again and restoring everybody to the status quo, which I think was a major mistake because it produced precisely the result we're talking about now. It allowed everybody to think that the previous status quo was okay.//////Dust is one of the main reasons of many diseases. It is everywhere in Bangladesh, especially in cities.
