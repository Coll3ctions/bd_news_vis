The constitution may have been tampered with in many ways and has, through years of arbitrary government, been rendered emasculated at places. But one truth it has upheld is the esteem in which Bengali women are held, and will be held in the times to be. That being so, you go on to the next question.//////THE opening of the passenger train service between Dhaka and Kolkata, on Bengali New Year's day, has ended the 43-year hiatus in Dhaka-Kolkata rail link.

It has been going on for decades and there is no sign of relief in reality other than some vague statements from our leaders, especially political leaders and sometimes from the bureaucrats in order to please their bosses. But I do not see any real action or policy in place that can solve the problem even in the next 10 years. As a professional engineer working in the power sector, I feel for the people in Bangladesh and am worried about the financial impact the crisis is causing (going to be worse in the coming years). It is like a vicious circle, we have to spend more because we do not have enough which drives us to an even poorer level to spend even more. The industries and housing sectors are using expensive generators and we are wasting millions of hard-earned dollars on these equipment and the fuel because we do not have a reliable power system. The production cost of garment sector is higher because they have to use generators and expensive fuel. A reliable power system would lower the production cost of all products and make Bangladesh more attractive to the buyers.//////A controversy has arisen about granting equal rights to women.

Ultimately, the Taliban will have to resort to armed opposition and conflict with the government if they are to stay true to their purpose." //////Bangladesh Bank announced recently that it wants to appoint two depositors as directors in each private bank to 'protect the depositors' interest'.

The memories of pre One-Eleven are so horrifying that we never want to look back.

The social and economic activities almost came to near standstill. //////Horse carts have been part of Dhaka for ages. It was once a major means of transport. Nowadays you'll only see them on the DU campus on special occasions and in Gulistan every other day.

Well that's not really what I want to talk about.a question for all of you.Are we blind?? //////Thanks to Dr Moshiur Rahman, former secretary to the government of Bangladesh for his very thought provoking analysis of the current political issues discussed in GP T-MATRA on Thursday (California time).

Meanwhile our CTG and their backers go around hunting for corrupt suspects and politicos, very few of whom, by the way, have been convicted till date. However, catching muggers and robbers seem to be beyond their capability!//////Are you worried about getting forgetful due to old age? Nothing to worry about! A research team from the University of Reading and the Peninsula Medical School, UK have some good news for you!//////The recent incident at ZIA in which a British Bangladeshi gentleman, Barrister Rizwan Hussain, was brutally beaten up by airport officials for entering a restricted area of the check-in zone of the airport is utterly deplorable and terribly shocking. It is indeed a shameful incident that will scar the nation's reputation, an event that is not just a reflection of ZIA service standards, but also an insult to the citizens of the country. It is my hope that the government makes it a priority to bring the five culprits, who have resorted to such brutal violence against a fellow countryman, to justice as soon as possible. I hope they will be punished accordingly. //////Recently, I read an article on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the first thought that came to mind was the man we saw and heard in the penultimate days of East Pakistan and the man who lead the war of independence. There wasn't the information to match the person we knew. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the man who created a nation and proved to the world that one of the most powerful and disciplined military forces couldn't subjugate and suppress the unarmed and impoverished Bengali nation. He was the man who stirred the nation out of its slumber, galvanized it and inspired it to turn every home into a fortress, armed with mostly bamboos and antiquated weapons to rise up and free the country from the clutches of subjugation. He was the man who won a landslide victory in the 1970 elections. People reposed in him the huge responsibility of giving them a direction and showing the way to the bliss of freedom. He was given the power to spearhead the revolution. All these I witnessed in my teens in the turbulent years of the late 60s till the early years of the seventies.
