I was rather shocked to learn that a Hilsha fish weighing about a kg or so sells at a price for Tk.1,000.00 - 1,500.00. If this is true, then is it possible for any Bangladeshi to have a Hilsha fish in months while the per capita income is less than Tk. 1,000.00? He further told a rickshaw ride from Kalabagan to Farmgate would cost a person Tk. 25.00 - Tk.30.00 which used to be Tk.12.00 - Tk.15.00 only a year ago, while I was in town. Well, how do the people afford to manage their lives, with the given per capita income and without having access to Aladdin's magic lamp?//////Lal shak (red, leafy vegetable) is a very common, fast growing and cheap vegetable of Bangladesh. People eat lal shak due to its attractive colour and taste. Researchers reported that lal shak is one of the major sources of anthocyanins, which are directly involved in protecting use against cancer, diabetes, aging and oxidative damage. Anthocyanins are water-soluble chemicals which are mostly available in berries (blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, etc.). Recently researchers found that 100g lal shak contains 250-667 mg anthocyanins whereas 100g berries contain 25-648 mg anthocyanins. However, berries are expensive and also not available in our country. Therefore, lal shak can be our source of anthocyanins. So it might be suggested that we should eat lal shak regularly to get good health and longer life.//////When artefacts of historical importance belonging to our country are shown to the general public, one can expect that the explanation of those items would be correct, in context, and error-free. Sadly, this small expectation of mine was struck down ruthlessly when I visited Sonargaon outside Dhaka city. Almost all the items on exhibition had their tagged fact written in English, but whoever wrote it, in my opinion, did not study English properly i.e. 'slaughtering' became 'slaughting' among many of the mistakes I saw. The artefacts are laid down in a narrow corridor through the complex, which does not permit anyone stopping to view and appreciate them fully. There are no security cameras inside the complex; despite several signs that forbade people from taking pictures, I saw everyone taking picture left and right. It's like our national heritage is a joke. The best part is, it's a joke only to us, not the foreigners. The joke is further extended if one visits Panam City, the first settlement in this area. The buildings, historically significant, look like the authorities are waiting for them to break down so that some new real estate company can claim the land. Deplorable, to say the least. //////I would like to relate a personal experience I recently had with Bangkok Airlines, Asia's so-called Boutique Airline. I checked in at Bangkok to take a flight back to Dhaka on August 25. I was greeted with the usual polite smile and impeccable service which has become the hallmark of Thai hospitality and checked in two pieces of luggage. The flight was dot on time. The service on board was efficient and polite. All was going so well. I landed in Dhaka at 2am, got through the immigration in no time and went to the carousal to collect my luggage. After about half the luggage had arrived, the carousal stopped. The passengers were surprised, dismayed and annoyed till a ground staff of the airline informed that rest of the LUGGAGES HAVE BEEN OFF LOADED! About 80 pieces of luggage failed to make it to the flight even though these were accepted at the airline counter. The reason? WEIGHT RESTRICTION! The news was greeted by a stunned silence, shock and dismay especially from those coming for a short visit, holyday or work.//////It appears that some of our Awami League and the opposition BNP leaders are suffering from superiority complex.

The writers are Sikandar Ahmed from Kenya, Sue Packham from Australia, Saleh Mohammed Ayub from USA and Fazlur Chowdhury from UK.

They expressed their views on many issues -- about the harassment of Prof. Yunus, about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's interview with world famous journalist Stephen Sackur of BBC, her attending the opening and closing ceremonies of Olympics at the expense of the people of Bangladesh, etc. Fazlur Chowdhury from UK thanked Communications Minister Obaidul Quader for apologising to the people for their sufferings. We also thank him and expect that he will be able to rescue the sector which was on the brink of ruin by the negligence of the former Communications Minister Abul Hossain. //////This critical project has been totally marred by the nasty smell of bribery and corruption, the worst illness in epidemic form in our politics and administration. We are solely responsible for this shameful and disgusting situation, both at micro and macro levels. Our politicos and their 'Chamchas' have shamed the country and sullied its reputation, and this millstone will be around our neck forever, if we do not change and mould our national character.//////Contrary to popular myth the media is a commercial enterprise. Information published by them is only a product. The veracity, or otherwise of the information is only incidental. The clients of the media are their advertisers and thus their loyalty is primarily towards them.

The world economy has been under severe stress following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The fall of the mighty investment bank was a big blow to the global financial system leading to arguably the worst economic crisis since the great depression of 1930s. It is widely believed that the greed of the Wall Street bankers and over expansion of financial sector with inadequate regulation led to the global financial turned economic crisis. //////Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, has been let off with light punishment.
