The prime ministerial decision, to review the list prepared by a competent committee we would like to make it clear, is not only hasty but also gives out some very bad signals about the future of education in the country.

Given that the MPO was in the period of some earlier governments stigmatized by political considerations coming into it, Minister Nahid's judicious move to streamline the entire process was a refreshing sign of positive change in the field of education. The criteria on which the MPO list is based are unambiguously clear: student numbers, the number of students appearing at public examinations every year, the pass rate and the dates of government approval of the schools in question.//////From media exposes to mobile court raids to slapping of fines to grim expert warnings, we have had it all!

Bangladesh is a highly patriarchal society and gender discrimination is evident across all levels. Women are dependent on men throughout their lives, from their fathers through to husbands, brothers or sons. The perceived lesser value and limited roles of girls and women are embedded in the socio-economic system. //////Being a third world country, Bangladesh is burdened with many problems like over-population, poverty, pollution, poor education and health facilities etc. The present govt. has adopted many strategies and policies to overcome this situation doing their level best with the co-ordination of many NGOs across the country. But the recent activities of many NGOs are not much satisfactory to boost the socio-economic and infrastructural development as they are busy collecting funds from donor countries. But they have inadequate capacity to implement the programmes. However, it is true that NGOs play the most important role to empower women to make them self-reliant launching many projects like micro-credit programmes and they have already attained many success in the rural areas of the country. But the problem is that there are many NGOs which have no registration at all but they are still running their network countrywide.
