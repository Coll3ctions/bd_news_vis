Rahman's write-up on the issue, published in the pages of your 'Star Business' on June 19th is an eye-opener. However, in the report, he has missed out on an important matter that needed clarification!//////We know why UN is urging Bangladesh to shelter the fleeing Rohingyas from the trouble-torn Rakhine state of Myanmar. It is a clear case of ethnic cleansing. Though experts have shown that Rohingyas are the descendants of indigenous people, the Myanmar government do not count them as citizens and there is a deep-rooted hatred for the Muslims among the Buddhist population there. It seems that there has been a coordinated effort to clear the Rakhine state by the Bay of Bengal of Muslims to make room for the Buddhist people. We have seen how the Tablig people travelling to Rangoon on a bus were hacked to death in front of the law enforcing forces. We are dumb with grief at the Rohingyas who face the gun and arson in their own land and tumultuous sea and deportation by Bangladesh. At this juncture, the Muslims as well as the peace loving people of the world must come forward to put pressure on the Burmese government to investigate the human rights abuses there and stop all kinds of atrocities against the Muslim communities there.//////Thalassaemia is a very significant genetic blood disorder in Bangladesh.//////Like chronic diseases, the power, gas and water crisis has gripped the city and there seems to be no end to it. With every passing day the situation is worsening instead of being eased. The supply of power, gas and water is co-related. In fact, it is difficult to resolve one problem separately because water supply is disrupted due to power shortage and power crisis is caused by gas shortage. In this city of 15 million people, most people are hit hard by gas, power and water crises. At present, the gas supply is irregular in vast areas of the city. People are forced to buy kerosene and stoves at high prices. Frequent load shedding is a regular phenomenon in the capital. The government is speaking of various projects to resolve the crisis, but implementation of those will need a few years while the crisis is already acute and requires immediate solution. So, the government should work out some plans for immediate execution, for resolving the nagging gas, power and water crisis.//////The only main road of Kadamtala to Rajarbag is very narrow, about 16 feet to 20 feet wide. As the area is densely populated, traffic jam is a common phenomenon here, from morning to evening. This road is now in a very bad condition. If it was taken care of at the right time, only re-carpeting could make the road usable but the then Dhaka City Corporation neglected the problem and did not re-carpet the road. Now the condition of the road is so bad that it is very difficult for any kind of transport to ply there. The inhabitants of Kadamtala and Rajarbag have been suffering immensely every day. Frequent rains have increased the sufferings of the passers-by. The Dhaka South City Corporation authorities should take special and urgent measures to repair the Kadamtala-Rajarbag main road to ease the agony of the people.//////The health of our forest is not in good shape. The greenery is missing from our nature day by day. During a journey by train from Dhaka to Sylhet, I saw the government forest lands almost vacant and without trees whereas the villages were green and full of trees. Villagers on their own will make their villages green and forests healthy. The forest authorities can distribute saplings to the villagers for plantation during rainy season. Forests cool the air and help bring rains. Forests make our earth fit for living. //////Inside the lobby at the American Embassy in Dhaka, there is a general feeling //////The letter of Iftekhar Sayeed titled "'Miracles' we are tired of" published in The Daily Star on June 18, 2012 was very witty.

There is hardly any military regime in history and in any part of the globe that can even remotely be described as legal or de jure. So there we are.//////A high-point of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's recent visit to Myanmar was undoubtedly the decision to strengthen rail, road and waterways connectivity between the two countries.
