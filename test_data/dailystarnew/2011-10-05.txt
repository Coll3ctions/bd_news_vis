Although a five-storied mosque will be built in the space, this is hardly any justification for demolishing a historical mosque.

We, the students of JnU, have been demonstrating for a long time in a civilized manner. But nobody paid any attention. And now we are running out of time as our university turns six (6) on October 20. So, what would the desperate students have done? As a matter of fact, we were protesting in a civilized way till the police and the BCL started to beat up the students. Of course, vandalising cars is really a shameful act and every student of JnU feels sorry for this. But was it all our fault? You asked in your editorial what had been the fault of the stranded commuters and of those whose vehicles had been senselessly vandalised? Then, we ask you - what was our fault? What will we do if this university goes private? If the government doesn't have enough funds, then why did thePM promise to establish at least one public university in every district? The government can spend around Tk. 2000 crore just to change the name of an airport, but can't spend one-tenth of the amount for JnU?//////I am writing this letter, after reading Md. A. Alim's letter of 26th September in your columns on hydraulic horn. Hydraulic horns are banned by law in our country. But I doubt if there is any implementation of the law. I had a bitter experience while I was returning to Dhaka from Chuadanga with my wife and two-year-old son after celebrating Eid with my family members. //////Being an inhabitant of Mirpur area, I start for my office from Pallabi at quarter past seven in the morning and it takes almost an hour to reach Shewrapara. The unbearable gridlock, caused by various reasons, is turning out to be a threat to my job. At Pallabi, Mirpur 10, Kazipara and Shewrapara the commuters queue up in large numbers to get on the bus every morning. Though I am not an expert, yet I have found out some problems where we can work on. The unskilled traffic police is one of the causes behind this jam. They find it difficult to control the movement of the vehicles at every point. And some of the drivers block the roads unnecessarily. Most of the bus services in Mirpur area offer sitting service. They do not take any more passengers when the bus is full in the morning. As a result, the queues of the commuters seem endless. I think we do not need any sitting service bus at all. All the buses should take passengers standing, with a revised bus fair. Stern government action is called for in this respect. Do we really need sitting service buses?//////Some teachers resort to corporal punishment in schools. They do it to maintain discipline in the classroom. But physical punishment has a negative impact on the mind of the pupils. It leaves a lasting impression on the students' and influences their future conduct. So, it can have a short-term result but it has long term negative effects. That is why, corporal punishment is banned in many countries.//////The latest discovery of natural gas reserve in Rashidpur in the country's north-eastern region by BAPEX (Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Ltd.), a subsidiary of Petrobangla, is good news. However, we need investments for extraction and utilization of this gas. 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas can solve our energy crisis to a great extent.//////I am a r recent graduate in BBA from Shahjalal University of Science & Technology. Our final semester exams ended in February this year. Then I joined a commercial bank as an intern for three months starting from March to June. After completing internship, nearly three months have passed. Our MBA class has started from last September. //////Two campaigns in China - the Three-anti Campaign (1951) and Five-anti Campaign (1952) - were reform movements originally issued by Mao Zedong in an effort to rid Chinese cities of corruption. The process was effective. Some 20,000 cadres and 6,000 trained workers began spying on the business affairs of fellow citizens. The media encouraged compliance with the government policies. Up to 15,000 trained propagandists were working in Shanghai by late 1951. By February 1952, parades of anti-capitalist activists went door to door to visit business leaders. It created immense psychological pressure. And corruption went down. Of course, it had some negative impacts, but every story has two sides to it. //////That day while I was returning home from my university, I noticed that some young boys were smilingly watching some obscene Bangla cinema posters. Our censor board probably consists of some immoral persons who do not find any unpleasant scenes in the films which are produced in FDC.//////I consider Sheikh Hasina's presentation of world peace roadmap at the UN of little significance, given her failure in bringing peace in her own country . In fact, I do not read in detail any statement made by the ministers, because I know what would they say about a particular incident. While commenting on hartal, they will definitely say that life was completely normal and people rejected the 'unjust hartal' called by the opposition. //////If you are travelling from Dhaka to another district, you must know how long it is going to take to reach the destination. But you can never reach there in time. Why? We mostly think that the jam on the roads is to blame. But besides that, we should also take a good look at the roads. Most of them are broken or damaged, with holes filled with puddles or mud. Here in Uttara, some organisations dug a road to set up some pipes a few months ago. They set up the pipes, filled the holes with mud, and left the rest of the road broken. My school is only 510 minutes away from my home. As I go by car, it must take no more than five minutes on an average. Now, it takes 1015 minutes because of the road condition. It's time the authorities took some action.//////A public university should be run by the government. The students of Jagannath University have been demonstrating against the University Act 27(4) since its establishment in 2005. But the government has failed to give any solution to the problem. The students' opinion is that if a university is run by the students' fees, then it cannot be called a public university. So, their demands are simple - to nullify the University Act and to have government funding for the university.//////They say they are inspired by revolutions in the Middle East, but protests over economic grievances in Spain and elsewhere in Europe are a closer comparison as anti-corporate demonstrations spread across the United States.//////Afghanistan and India, two nations united in their suspicion of Pakistan, are set to forge closer ties yesterday as Hamid Karzai visits New Delhi during a highly unstable time in South Asia.//////Mortar fire killed two Yemenis and wounded six in Sanaa yesterday in what appeared to be more fighting in the capital between soldiers loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh and troops siding with anti-government protesters.//////Maoist rebels in India's have begun a month-long ceasefire, the rebels said in a statement.//////Bullet-ridden cars carrying terrified, ill and hungry civilians crawled out of Muammar Gaddafi's home town yesterday as anti-Gaddafi fighters said they were planning a final attack.//////UN refugee agency chief Antonio Guterres called Monday on states not to succumb to rising xenophobic pressure and turn refugees away, saying that multiculturalism is not only good, but inevitable.//////Thailand's worst monsoon floods in decades have killed 224 people and affected three quarters of the country, including part of the ancient city of Ayutthaya, officials said yesterday.//////The United States said Monday it expects to meet with its Quartet partners by the weekend in a bid to bring the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.//////Gunmen attacked a bus carrying Shia Muslims in Pakistan's insurgency-torn southwest yesterday, killing 13 people in the second major sectarian attack to hit the area in two weeks, police said.//////Russian lawmakers prepared to give early backing yesterday to a bill allowing judges to order the chemical castration of convicted child molesters.//////Apple Inc unveiled a new iPhone on Tuesday that is faster and more powerful but stops short of a more radical upgrade. //////US President Barack Obama said Monday he was "absolutely" the underdog as he embarks on a tough reelection fight in 2012 but promised he was steeling for a fight over "values and vision" with Republicans.//////The United Nations warned on Monday that the international community had failed to respond to the latest flooding crisis in Pakistan, leaving three million people in urgent need of food handouts.//////US student Amanda Knox was acquitted of murder and sexual assault by an Italian court on Monday after breaking down in court and pleading for mercy in a dramatic end to her four-year legal battle.//////Here are brief profiles of some of the people believed to be contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize to be announced on Friday in Oslo.//////At least 13 workers were killed after an explosion in a coal mine in southwestern China yesterday, state media said, in the latest mining accident to hit the country.//////Puja days are here again.

Mahmood has focused on architecture, arts, cultural-social festivals, and everyday life in the city.//////When an election turns out to be a foretaste of disaster, you know something is terribly wrong with society. It is a bizarre condition where elections, which ought to be harbingers of positive change, predict things dreadful and end up causing political crises at best and unmitigated mayhem at worst. That is the inference you draw when you reflect on the projected mayoral elections in Narayanganj at the end of this month. //////The Congress is suffering from the hammer blows of ambition on the anvil of power. The BJP has a splitting headache in expectation of power. The first is serious. The second is silly. //////Many call it a miracle, Germany's peaceful revolution in 1989 and reunification of East and West Germany less than a year later, which was celebrated on October 3rd by German Ambassador Holger Michael in Dhaka as the "Day of German Unity."//////Today is World Teachers' Day.
