Outsider, because he was conspicuous not by his presence in the literary movements of the 1960s that acted as the intellectual wellspring for the new crop of poets, novelists, short story writers and playwrights of the post-independence genre. //////There was a seer in Tajuddin Ahmed. His was the voice and the resolve which eventually carried us through the War of Liberation in 1971. Had it not been for him -- and remember that Bangabandhu had been taken prisoner by the Pakistan army -- the question of liberty for the seventy five million people of Bangladesh would easily have run into a wall. Or into a quagmire. In the minutes before the Pakistanis cracked down on unsuspecting, unarmed Bengalis on March 25, 1971, Tajuddin Ahmed tried persuading Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to leave the city. That, thought Tajuddin, would make it easier for Bengalis to go into a war of national liberation. Bangabandhu had his own and very credible reasons, of course, not to leave the scene despite the attendant risks. The elected leader of a majority party in parliament does not run. Bangabandhu chose to stay and confront the world on his terms. For his part, Tajuddin chose his own path. He would give shape to a government, the very first in Bengali history, and win a war against a formidable military machine.//////
