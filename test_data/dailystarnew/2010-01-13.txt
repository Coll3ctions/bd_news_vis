The possibility that Jihadi sympathisers in the lower ranks of the Pakistani intelligence complex may have offered their services to the Taliban cannot be ruled out, the think tank said.//////In a toughening of stance towards Pakistan, Defence Minister AK Antony yesterday charged the neighbouring country with backing infiltrators and their plans to cause disruption in Jammu and Kashmir.//////ON balance, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's official visit to India can be characterised as an exercise in productive bilateralism. A crucial point here is that the visit, the first for a Bangladesh leader in a long number of years, has provided the heads of government of Bangladesh and India with the opportunity to engage in summitry to review the ties between the two countries. There is hardly any question that these ties have in recent years often been marked by acrimony generated by a number of issues affecting especially Bangladesh. Issues such as trade, transit, water-sharing and suspicions on the harbouring of criminal and even terrorist elements in each other's territory have created quite a few barriers in the way of cooperation between the two nations.//////DESPITE the elected government's seriousness early in the day to push ADP implementation from the very beginning of the financial year which has been traditionally marked by a long-drawn-out warm-up phase, not much of a momentum has been generated this time in terms of utilisation of development allocations. Unfortunately the first six months have seen only 28 percent utilisation of the total ADP allocation. Resultantly, the government is faced with an impossible task of spending remainder 72 percent of the allocated resources. //////THREE years ago this month, to the relief of the people of Bangladesh, the caretaker cabal led by Iajuddin Ahmed was pushed from office through a proclamation of emergency. What then transpired was simple historical necessity brought about through the rise of a new administration that quickly went into the business of setting things back in order. //////IT is a good news that during the recent meeting (January 8 and 9) in Dhaka, the delegations from Bangladesh and Myanmar were able to agree on the method of delimitation of sea boundary. //////JUTE was the largest foreign exchange earner for Pakistan during 1947-71.

The answer will be: 'Win the toss and win the match'. It has been the case so far in the tournament where the team winning the toss and opting to chase under lights took full advantage of the dew factor to chase down any target.//////The success of Bangladesh boxers has been few and far between in the South Asian Games. They have won only two gold medals in the regional sporting extravaganza and that too on home soil. And this might be a good reason for Bangladesh Amateur Boxing Federation to dream of winning gold when the 11th edition of SA Games begins here on January 29.//////The young Tigers kept up their good form in New Zealand before the start of the International Cricket Council U-19 World Cup as they beat Australia by 20 runs in their second and last warm up match at the Elmwood Park in Christchurch yesterday.//////The Idea Cup tri-nation was a tournament for Mahmudullah Riyad to provide a glimpse of how reliable he could be as a batsman for the team. He looked average with his ordinary spin as well as in the late order batting since he made his one-day international debut against Sri Lanka in Colombo in July 2007 and his few sporadic innings could hardly catch the eyes of the fans or the cricket pundits. But with the performances in the tri-nation tournament the stylish cricketer gave an impression that he has improved a lot to cement his place in the team; if it is not as an all-rounder then definitely as a batsman.//////Master India batsman Sachin Tendulkar arrives here today to join the team for the two-match Test series against Bangladesh.//////Carlos Tevez scored a hattrick as Manchester City moved up into fourth place in the English Premier League table with a 4-1 win over Blackburn Rovers at Eastlands here on Monday.//////Brazilian international striker Kaka, who joined Real Madrid from AC Milan in June, said on Tuesday he enjoys playing in Spain more than in Italy because the football played here is "technically richer".//////The form book was shredded on day two at the Africa Cup of Nations as Algeria crashed to minnows Malawi and favourites Ivory Coast stuttered against Burkina Faso.//////Only Cristiano Ronaldo's world record transfer prevented Manchester United making an annual loss of more than 30 million pounds, figures released by the English Premier League champions showed on Monday.//////Angola knew for years that staging Africa's premier football tournament in the restive enclave of Cabinda posed a security risk, South Africa's World Cup organising chief said Tuesday.//////Atletico Madrid, looking to recover from a dismal first half of the season, have signed 19-year-old striker Eduardo Salvio from Argentine side Lanus for 8million euros, Spanish media said Tuesday.//////Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho looks set to face a penalty for insulting a journalist after the Football League referred his case to the sporting justice disciplinary committee.//////Real Madrid's Argentine international striker Gonzalo Higuain has suffered a tear in his left calf muscle and will be sidelined for three weeks, the club said on Tuesday.//////Japanese international midfielder Junichi Inamoto looks set to join his eighth club since 2001 with a move to J-League side Kawasaki Frontale from French First Division outfit Rennes.//////Argentina forward Ezequiel Lavezzi will be out for at least a month after suffering a thigh injury against Sampdoria on Sunday, his club Napoli said on Monday.//////After days of confusion, Intikhab Alam has put an emphatic end to speculation surrounding Pakistan's wicketkeeping spot, saying that there is "no doubt" Sarfraz Ahmed will play as the wicketkeeper in Kamran Akmal's place in the third Test in Hobart starting on Thursday.//////Serbian coach Zoran Djordjevic has advised the players to feel free to let him and his coaching staff to know the problems they will face during the South Asian football event camp at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan in Savar. //////Away from the limelight, Mitchell Johnson has quietly worked his way back from the horrors of the Ashes last year into something resembling his best form. He is no longer Australia's opening bowler, but a new role at first-change has brought considerable success.//////Former Australian captain and leading commentator Ian Chappell has said India don't have the resources to retain their No. 1 spot in the ICC Test rankings for a long enough period to emulate Australia and the great West Indies teams of the past.//////One of the key challenges that England will have to confront as they aim to secure a series victory against South Africa won't actually come from the home side, but rather the geographical location of the Wanderers. The stadium is 6,000 feet above sea level which creates a unique atmosphere -- or lack of it -- for the players.//////Narial Govt. High School trounced Poura Secondary High School by 121 runs in the Standard Chartered Young Tigers U-16 National Cricket Tournament at the Nur Mohammad stadium yesterday.

Fatal accidents are very common there. Though the owners of the yards earn huge amount of money through this industry, they are indifferent in ensuring security for the workers. Despite the recent tragedy, yard workers are compelled to work without gloves, safety costumes, etc. Moreover, these ship-breaking yards are a great source of environment pollution. By this time Faujdarhat and Bhatiary, nearby areas of Sitakunda, have become worst affected by pollution. In those areas 21 species of fish have become extinct and some 11 species are on the verge of extinction. //////It has now become apparent that some newspapers work as silent supporters of some political vision and modulate the readers' minds in the direction of the political philosophy of a chosen political party. As a television viewer, one is subjected to the same experience as that of the print media. The media may have a liking for some political philosophy but the problem arises when it becomes blind. The role of print and electronic media is found to serve the purpose of different political parties. They make programmes focusing on the party interest, whereas the media should have guarded the interest of the people without any compromise. The media by their unbiased, pro-people role, through their news, editorials and programmes, can make people aware of their legitimate rights. //////In old times watching films was the main source of entertainment for the general people. In those days they used to go to watch movies with whole family to celebrate any event. But with the passage of time the scene had changed and the educated people stopped going to the cinema. Because most of the films were full of obscenity.//////I am really proud that Fazle Hasan Abed is to be knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. This is a worthy achievement. He is not only the founder of Brac but also one of the most influential personalities of our country. He has shown the world his quality only through his work. //////It is a matter of great regret that primary education is in bad shape in our country. In the developed countries the authorities give more emphasis on primary education because it is the foundation of student life. We have learned recently that the present government is going to reshape primary education by setting up more schools, recruiting more teachers, providing tiffin facilities at a cheap cost, giving 100 taka to every student per month, distributing learning materials, etc. And a decision was taken to start pre-primary education within two years. Basically, a student cannot cope with the curriculum of class I at an early age of 4 or 5. An orientation is needed at that age. And not every student comes from an educated family. //////Law Minister Shafique Ahmed's statement that the Awami League regime will ban religion-based political parties is unfortunate. I think such a move will create further acrimony and disunity among the people of Bangladesh. Subsequent political crisis and clashes may claim lives. Instead of addressing such touchy and unnecessary issues, the government should work hard with the help of the people of Bangladesh to advance our economy and our national standing in the international arena. Whenever we step out of our land, our national pride meets disillusionment, as we become aware that our country lags far behind other nations in terms of good educational and political culture and prosperity. Perhaps, our standing in international politics is one of the lowest in the world. The political parties that have been in power are largely to blame for this. Banning religion-based parties will not give us bread and butter. Let us address the pressing issues of poverty, illiteracy, corruption, campus violence and other social and political ills, which have been crippling the nation ever since its birth. //////Some days ago we watched in a TV report that some dishonest traders have been supplying adulterated medicines to several pharmaceuticals. We have come to know that there exist not only quack doctors but also fake pharmaceuticals. The present situation seems to be like all thieves are cousins.//////Climatologists predict that in the middle of the next century, the temperature of this earth may rise by as much as 4 degree Celsius. This could catastrophically reduce food production, destroy or severely damage wildlife, raise sea level and thereby flood coastal areas and farmlands. //////The government has claimed that they have been able to distribute textbooks to all primary and secondary school students in the country. But the reality is different.//////This refers to a news item published on the 28 December 09 in The Daily Star about China unveiling world's fastest train link a train travelling at an average speed of 350 km per hour. Well, that's China. They have the resources and the willingness to serve the people. What about us, the people of Bangladesh? Would it be too much to expect High Speed Train (HST) service from Bangladesh Railway between Dhaka and Chittagong? Let's try to dream of travelling from Dhaka to Chittagong in about three hours or so. Well, that would not be high speed train, but that of medium speed. By definition, HST in China, Japan, some of the Asian countries and in Europe have a speed of 250 to 300 km per hour or so. In France, it is called Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) having a speed of 280 km/hr. However, test runs have achieved 400 to 500 km/hr around the world. ////// The nation is now experiencing shortage of gas, water and electricity in different parts of the country. These problems have become very acute. According to experts, natural gas is depleting at an alarming rate, which requires the government to take the necessary initiative for the future fuel provision. Amid these acute crises, we all are expressing apprehensions. We are frequently asking and putting blame on the government for these ordeals. But is it only the government failing to cope with these problems? In fact, the government alone cannot bring any positive change unless there is cooperation and collaboration of its citizens.//////I have doubts about an authentic and accurate final report on BDR mutiny being published. //////A surprising BSS report was published in a local English daily on 3 January. It reported a government high-up's statement that Tk.107 crore loaned to Jatiyo Matshajibi Sambaya Samity by the previous government cannot be traced! This is the most surprising news of this New Year! One really wonders how could such a thing happen? However, apart from this bomb-shell statement, nothing else was mentioned about the matter. This too is surprising; given the investigative trend of our newsmen. //////Winter can be very inclement. So, our well-off society, please come out from the dreamy world and carry out your duties! If you don't give them money or shelter, then at least give them a single warm clothe which you don't wear now and which is left to you uselessly. //////I believe, our leaders and eminent personalities have totally forgotten the environment under which the one-eleven take over took place and it was a welcome happening that brought a sigh of relief to the people of this country as a whole. Had there been no one-eleven, the masters of election engineering would have staged an election on 22/11 and the pre-fixed election results would have been declared. There could have been street fights if not a civil war between the pro-and-anti election supporters. There would have been loss of lot of lives and properties. The engineered winners would not have lived more than 1 or 2 months and the country would have been in deep chaos and confusion. //////The chairman of Anti Corruption Commission Ghulam Rahman has said that to mitigate corruption in our country the politicians and their followers have to prove themselves to be honest in their activities, otherwise it is not possible. //////Through your columns, I wish to offer my heartiest and profoundest congratulations to Fazle Hasan Abed of Brac on the announcement that he will be conferred knighthood (Knight Commander) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his most noble services to the poor, deprived and disadvantaged of Bangladesh and elsewhere.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in her recent remarks at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen, Denmark has very critically appreciated the consequences of climate change on Bangladesh. She said: //////I am utterly disappointed by the BNP politicians. They got elected by the people and it is their sacred duty to attend parliamentary sessions to highlight the problems of the people of their elected areas. But instead, they are finding excuses not to attend JS sessions. People are unhappy with the attitude of these BNP members of parliament. Now they have come up with a 10-point demand in order to return to parliament. This is absurd and ridiculous. //////I refer to Mr. Palash's letter on BNP's policy published on 4 January in your daily and regret to observe that many knowledgeable citizens in Bangladesh are yet to get out of the AL-BNP syndrome which is harming our beloved country greatly. Our daily life revolves around questioning and counter-questioning every thought that is aired and anything and everything has to do for or against these two parties even when dealing with external issues. //////The Afghanistan war against Taliban militants should be fought in the country itself and not spill over into Pakistan, the Pakistani foreign minister said yesterday.//////Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapakse unveiled a USD 4 billion-reconstruction package for the war-ravaged North to pursue Tamil voters ahead of the election in which the minority community could play a decisive role.//////The United States has demanded that Pakistan must stop harassing American diplomats in the country.//////Nepal has asked the United Nations to extend its mission in the country, a government official said yesterday, following international criticism of delays to the peace process.//////Gunmen in Sri Lanka yesterday opened fire on a bus carrying supporters of the main opposition presidential candidate, killing one political activist, police said.//////After decimating the Taliban in two areas of Pakistan's restive northwest, the military now seems to be planning a third front against the militants in the area.//////The Obama Administration has said that North Korea should give up its ambition of becoming a nuclear power before returning to the denuclearisation talks.//////A nuclear physics professor at Tehran University was killed Tuesday by a bomb-rigged motorcycle parked outside his home in Iran's capital, state media reported.//////China announced that its military intercepted a missile in mid-flight Monday in a test of new technology that comes amid heightened tensions over Taiwan and increased willingness by the Asian giant to show off its advanced military capabilities.//////Premier Silvio Berlusconi returned to a busy political schedule Monday after a month long recovery from an attack that broke his nose and two teeth.//////Iraqi security forces locked down parts of Baghdad yesterday and were searching neighborhoods for possible car bombs, military officials said, in what appeared to be a wide-ranging operation across the city.//////Former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin has signed to be a contributor on the Fox News Channel, her lawyer has said.//////Your profile on Facebook may become a cause of worry when looking for a job, as employers are increasingly checking on networking sites to know more about the people they intend to recruit, a new study claims.//////Britain's government said yesterday it will ban an Islamist group whose proposed protest march through a town known for honouring British soldiers killed in Afghanistan drew national outrage.//////Miep Gies, the woman who hid the Dutch youngster Anne Frank's diary from the Nazis to become one of the world's most-read books, has died after a brief illness at the age of 100.//////A man is facing charges in what police think is the first murder sparked by a row on Twitter.//////Two 8-year-old boys in a young lifeguards training program rescued a man who was struggling in the ocean off Australia's east coast.//////A Russian soldier in east Siberia's Irkutsk region threatened to blow up a grocery store as he had no money to pay for an alcoholic beverage, police said.//////Those who are well acquainted with Bengali music of the 1950s are familiar with his voice.

They're beautifully done, freeze-framing all the preceding mayhem into elegant graphic stills to recall Sidney Paget's original magazine illustrations. Then up pops the page for the movie's literary source -- credited to the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. How late can you get? Watching this pumped-up Victorian buddy movie, Doyle might have wondered what mad century he'd stepped into. //////Gobindakati Binapani Library and Kalpurush Natya Sangstha jointly organised a three-day Poush Mela at the library premises of village Gobindakati in Kaliganj upazila.//////BANGLADESH Bank (BB) has adopted advanced ICT to be digitised in all spheres of its functions including monetary policy, banking supervision and internal management.

What a year that was. What was your most memorable moment? //////
