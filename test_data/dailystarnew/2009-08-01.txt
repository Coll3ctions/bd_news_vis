Though some political observers are wont to term the change as something predictable, one cannot also deny the fact that the party rank and file had long been pressing for a change in its leadership. Their longing for a change in the leadership got more passionate in the wake of the party's massive victory in the last parliamentary elections. For the success is attributed by many to the slogan for a 'change.' So, the entry of some six new faces, many of whom are relatively younger, certainly marks a significant and welcome change in the party. //////We are deeply touched by the reported and photographically depicted ordeal of physical and mental torture having been suffered by a woman in Ramu upazila and her eventual escape from the tyrannical stranglehold of her husband.

One of the more popular of Bengali novelists, he hit it big from the very start when he started serializing a novel in Desh magazine in the 1950s, and has continued to write through the '60s down to the present day. While he has been dismissed by critics as a writer practiced at producing potboilers, that may be a little bit of a facile generalization. Sankar is of a generation of Bengali writers who began writing at a time when the 19th century European realist novel had a great hold on their imagination, and one can see the marks of that both in the sweep and careful characterization in their works. Not for that age the dessicated intellectualism that is our lot today - they liked Zola and Dickens. A novelist like Sankar (which is how the ordinary Bengali reader referred to him) took pride in the telling of a tale, following the dictates of plotting, characters and suspense, and in being responsive to readers' demands. Perhaps it tells something about his qualities in the above departments that two of his novels, Seemabaddha and Jana Aranya, were turned into movies by no less than Satyajit Ray, as 'Company Limited' and 'The Middleman' respectively. No doubt it was his sharp observation and intimate knowledge of Calcutta life at all levels that drew the legendary film director's attention. It was a knowledge gained first-hand by Sankar, who when he first came to Calcutta from Bongaon village (near the present Indo-Bangladesh border) before the Second World War, worked variously as a street hawker, a typewriter cleaner, a part-time school teacher and a clerk in a jute and gunny broking firm to earn a living - jobs that provided the material for the beginning pages of Chowringhee.//////Don't go like horse and carriage//////I know, I've on one and in the other//////Women at forty wake at dawn,//////rising in the morning's dark//////to pray, and bathe, and plait their hair//////before beginning the day's work.//////When worlds first road traffic death was recorded in 1896, everybody concerned at that time reported to have said, This must never happen again.

The acronym was first coined and prominently used by Goldman Sachs in 2001. Goldman Sachs argued that, since they are developing rapidly, by 2050 the combined economies of the BRICs could eclipse the combined economies of the current richest countries of the world. The four countries, combined, currently account for more than a quarter of the world's land area and more than 40% of the world's population. //////ON 16 July at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, during the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit, the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani met for the second time after the Mumbai terrorist attacks.

As a leading development economist, Gerald Meier puts it, the idea of development was developed 'by colonial economics out of political expediency'. These words fairly sum up the contents of Pakistan: Haunting Shadows of Human Security, a profound study of an enigmatic country, thoughtfully and logically edited by Jennifer Bennett. The book is an output of a three-year regional collaborative project on Human Security in South Asia, conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIIS).
