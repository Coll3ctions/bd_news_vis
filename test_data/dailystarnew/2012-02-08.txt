Yet, the government is doing it in style. Clearly, it is not aimed to strengthen bureaucracy, rather it will weaken it. This could in effect leave the administration and policymaking more politicised, more partisan. //////When in mid-July 2011 six students from different city schools and colleges were brutally lynched by an angry mob at Aminbazar with the police acting as mere bystanders, we were outraged, to say the least. What happened thereafter was equally horrendous. Instead of arresting the masterminds behind the violence, the police filed a robbery case against the students who were later proved to have no connection whatsoever with any criminal act. Now that an investigation has been initiated into another case accusing unknown villagers, we are rendered speechless to see that the probe has barely made any progress even after extensive media attention coupled with a High Court directive.//////The traditional duel of the Dhaka Premier League turned out to be a drab affair yesterday when Abahani sauntered past Mohammedan Sporting Club by five wickets at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium. Old DOHS meanwhile signed off their first leg campaign with their ninth win, beating Prime Doleshwar by 21 runs at the BKSP.//////The International Cricket Council's decision to reconsider the role of the vice-president -- a position current Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president AHM Mustafa Kamal was set to take up from 2012 -- dampened Bangladeshis' fond hopes of seeing one of their own lead the global sporting body from 2014.

The unrest that has gripped Syria since March 2011 has claimed more than 5400 lives. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has urged the Security Council to overcome differences over Syria and take action to stop a crackdown on dissent. And the latest draft of the resolution strongly condemns violence and human rights abuses by the Syrian government.

I am amazed that Mr Imam still has the myopic conception of blaming rickshaws for Dhaka's horrific jams. Has he never been stuck in jams on the so-called VIP roads which have been rickshaw-free for years? Has he never read the opinion of urban experts who blame the soon to-be-extinct empty/half-empty 500,000+ fossil fuel-run Gas Guzzling Monstrosities (GGMs) running on narrow, pot-holed roads with a capacity for 200,000 GGMs at best, for the jams and air/noise pollution?//////Like other years, Ekushey book fair is being held on the premises of Bangla Academy. This book fair is a great occasion when the readers can browse through the titles of their favourite writers. Surely, this fair promotes the habit of reading---a practice which is feared to be on the wane, especially among the younger generation. It is said that the very existence of book is being threatened by the electronic devices like computer and television.//////The recent articles posted in The Daily Star in relation to the torture of a Bangladeshi citizen by the BSF men in the Murshiabad district of West Bengal have stirred a widespread feeling of helplessness and powerlessness. Despite withstanding so much torture and brutality by the BSF men for so many years, it is extremely saddening to see that we are still not vocal enough to take action for ending the BSF killings and tortures. It is incredible to think that at this day and age, with information at our fingertips 24 hours a day, we are still unable to bring an end to such inhuman activities. I urge Human Rights Watch (HRW) to go ahead in its initiative to prosecute BSF (The Daily Star, front page, Feb 1, 2012) and let BSF know that they may fool some of the people for some time, but not all of the people all of the time. //////The news titled "AL to take to streets on BNP rally day" published in The Daily Star on February 4, 2012 has upset us deeply.//////It's really a matter of great regret and pain that some unscrupulous people have involved themselves in a heinous trade of selling human bones.

It has been stated that bone traders in the area had dug a number of graves and stole the dead bodies from there.

Thankfully, the media has been reporting these incidents faithfully.

Investigative journalism is required in this case which may address the following issues://////Recent articles and reports published on Bill Gates in all national dailies will hopefully help the effort to reduce, if not remove, the burden of poverty from the world. It is a noble and profound thought coming from one of the world's richest persons! Here is a man, seriously and sincerely trying to lighten some of the misery of the poor that most of us just shrug off and tend to ignore. We all hope and pray that he may live long, and do whatever he can to lighten the load of human misery, help those who have nothing, not even the assurance of the next meal. //////The comments made by the Bangladesh minister on the inhuman torture of our citizens by the BSF took the nation by surprise. While the video clip shook the Indian media by storm, our minister tried to downplay the gravity of the issue by terming it as an 'ordinary' incident at the border. If the incident was an 'ordinary' one, why the Indian authorities deplored the same and suspended the culprits, will the minister please explain? Even an influential daily Hindu asked for unconditional apology from the Indian government. //////The other day, on my way to the public library, I saw some children who were selling books to passers-by. I stopped there to buy a book written by Dale Carnegie. One of them said, Bhaiya, did you publish our photo in the newspaper? My photo was published many times in several newspapers.

More to the point, you cannot cast aside the truth that the bamboo has played a vital role at various points in our history. That it has a power of its own, either to intimidate or set the mind thinking was demonstrated a couple of weeks ago when a young lawmaker in Rangpur, hundreds of his followers in tow and with sleek, green bamboos in hand, descended on the local medical college for purposes that were as nefarious as they were reprehensible. The bamboo came in handy, even when those under attack fought back and gave the lawmaker and his hangers-on a taste of that self-same bamboo.//////There is one exit poll which no Indian election commissioner can ban. It is called word-of-mouth. This word does not come out of the mouth of politicians on the stump, or journalists on the fly. It emerges from those with feet firmly planted on the ground, voters, who have protected their treasured franchise with jealous secrecy till the day of decision, but now that it has been made are happy to discuss it at their familiar community focal points, the teashop, or perhaps over a warm fire on a cold evening that breathes some life into the night.//////Japan recognised Bangladesh on February10th, 1972 and this year will mark the 40th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

But this land belonged to the revenue department and people were fined for trespass. The issue hit national headlines. The stink made the local administration uncomfortable. They then came up with a brilliant game planthey allotted the land to a group of equally poor people. In this way the poor ended up fighting the poor. The local government got away with the deliberate murder of a water body.//////The US Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta, has disclosed that Dr, Shakil Afridi who ran an anti-polio campaign in Abbottabad succeeded in obtaining DNA samples that led to the discovery of Osama bin Laden and his subsequent death at the hands of US Special Forces during the May 2 raid last year.//////
