Angry protesters held peaceful rallies through all parts of India demanding tougher punishment to the rapists. Admittedly, whether it is in India or Bangladesh, there is little deterrent for rapists. Because of social stigma, few females come forward to report the crime. Those who do, have to wait years for their cases to be heard. According to Indian National Crimes Record Bureau, Delhi has the highest number of rapes in the country, with 572 cases reported last year. Sensible citizens throughout India say that the gruesome case that propelled the issue into the national spotlight shows how little the perpetrators fear punishment. The government of India is considering a fast-track court process to expedite rape cases and give stringent punishment for sexual violence.//////Green marketing is a recent phenomenon in the developed world.

It is an annually renewable resource with a high biomass production per unit of land area; and jute products being biodegradable are simply environment-friendly. Moreover, the leaves and crop waste, left out in the fields, are transformed into organic materials, thereby reducing the need for supplementary chemical fertilizers for subsequent crops. While the synthetic substitutes are being considered as the root of many problems, the natural fiber products are proven to be absolutely harmless.//////(The article is a tribute to the poet on the 215th anniversary of his birth)//////I may not be entitled to wish for a certain place for burial after my death nor wish for a peaceful death. I believe all that is in the hands of the Almighty. How I die or am buried depends on what fate has in store for me. As a living being I know that I cannot evade death. And hence in life, with all the other hopes and wishes also comes a wish for a grave in which I hope I get a burial. Death is the macabre truth in life and all of us dread the day and yet all of us at one time or the other give a thought to the aftermath. Will there be a burial? Maybe the dead body will be in the sea with the fish having a feast? Perhaps a plane crash will leave the body charred beyond recognition? We ponder about the likely or unlikely events that may follow our passing. //////I really love compliments. I love the positive energy and the love and the very biased nature of all my friends.//////On that winter noon//////We were in no hurry to wash or eat;//////Sinking your body in a crimson sofa//////You were reading Schopenhauer. //////Back pain can have many causes, such as a pulled back muscle, disc problems, arthritis, or sacroiliac joint dysfunction, ligament sprain or strain. This misalignment causes increased wear and tear on the joints, muscles, and ligaments  even the discs.//////Asthma is a disease for centuries and a widespread illness.

It's a simplistic question, since every year sees many things happen and for each of us a different one might be important. But it is still worth considering what single issue could cause the world to change course. In my view, the most important place to watch in 2013 is Europe.//////Governance in the United States is at a standoff. The crisis over the federal budget has led many people around the world to wonder if Americans haven't lost their minds. Ultimately, as Winston Churchill infamously observed, they may be counted on to do the right thing after exhausting all other options. But this hardly is sound policy with every new vote in Congress. Maybe the latest crisis is symptomatic of a deeper and even more serious problem.//////Mention the name Suhrawardy at any mixed gathering in Bangladesh, and the chances are that almost all will identify him with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, bar-at-law and politician, who was Chief Minister of Bengal during the British //////and later Prime Minister of Pakistan, and the founder (along with Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani) of the Awami League. The chances are even higher that a miniscule few at best would have heard of his elder brother, Hasan Shahid Suhrawardy, who was a poet, bon vivant, man-about-town, art critic, theatre producer, professor, civil servant, and diplomat (having been Pakistan's ambassador to Spain during which tenure his younger brother was the country's prime minister for a period of just over a year). Scion of an illustrious family of South Asia which traces its descent directly from both Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique and Hazrat Ali, the elder Suhrawardy seems to have led a far more colourful life than his younger sibling. And the younger sibling had led quite a colourful life in his own right!//////Expect a book of poetry, dealing with some issues which make us think about why human civilization repeatedly fails to be humane. Binoy Barman, a poet surely different from his other contemporaries, searches for the causes of this failure throughout his latest poetry collection, namely, //////. What makes Binoy different is his belief that he thinks poetry is a quintessential tool which, without an iota of doubt, can bring forth our most expected social changes. He never agrees with those who invariably seek beauty in poetry. While going through the poems of this collection, I passionately felt the experimentation Binoy went through in writing the poems. Readers, if you follow the style of Binoy, it will be clear that his conscious state of mind has accelerated him into writing those poems rather than the sub-conscious. A few months ago, I attended a seminar organized by The Daily Star in honour of Ross Southerland, a contemporary English poet, who as a keynote speaker at that seminar said the conscious state of mind helps him much more than the subconscious state while composing poetry. I think this saying is also applicable to the verses of Binoy Barman. //////The Department of English and Humanities (DEH) of ULAB organized a publication ceremony of Jhulbarandai Megh (The Cloud in the Balcony), a book of poems by Professor Dr. Mohit Ul Alam, Head of DEH, on 13 December 2012. It is the poet's fourth collection of poetry. //////Titas is a small, little known river flowing by the district of Brahmanbaria in Bangladesh. Titas Ekti Nadir Naam (A River Named Titas) is the name of the epic novel composed by Advaita Mallabarmana, depicting the lives of the Malo fishing community living by this river. It evokes the title of a famous Bangladeshi film made by Ritwik Ghatak, one of the greatest personalities in Bengali cinema. Ritwik with his twin sister Prateeti Devi was born in Dhaka in 1925 (parental home in Pabna), grew up in Rajshahi and left East Bengal in 1947. This part of Bengal always filled his heart and pulled him incessantly towards its greenery, rivers, sands, songs and people. This, together with the persuasion of the young cinema-producer Habibur Rahman Khan, brought him to Bangladesh after the country's liberation. The objective was to make a movie based on Advaita's epic novel. Ritwik came to Dhaka in 1972 and during the editing of the movie fell ill owing to tuberculosis in 1973. The editing was then completed by Bashir Ahmed. Now the film is considered one of the world's classics. In 2012 it is the 40th anniversary of the making of this great film. //////
