And yet what happened in the Dhaka University area on Monday turned out to be something worse. An argument at a tea stall between students and the stall owner over change for a hundred taka note took an unexpected turn when policemen tried to calm everyone who happened to be getting agitated. And so what followed was predictable. Students of the university tried to resist the police, who in turn went into action to discipline the young men. What happened to the tea stall owner is not known. That is natural, for all too often the causes of a bad situation often get lost when bigger elements are thrown into the chaos.//////Everyone is talking about the moment Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia met the other day, about the way they greeted each other and smiled at each other. Knowing the way things go in Bangladesh, you can be sure that it is a subject over which a lot of people will spend a lot of time talking. The process is already under way, and not even the adviser for home affairs could resist the temptation of telling us what actually transpired at the armed forces day reception. It was he who let us in on the revelation that the Awami League chief had sometimes cooked her own food while in incarceration and had sent some of it to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson. We have not been told, though, if Begum Zia had done some cooking on her own and whether she had reciprocated Sheikh Hasina's gesture. //////A flicker of hope appeared amid the lingering gloom of uncertainty over the ensuing national election when its latest rescheduling, with the shifting of vote-casting day to December 29, and the BNP welcoming the move conditionally.

grandeur.//////The nation is again in the grip of the two leaders, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. What they did during their stay in power in the past is known to all and what they will be able to do in future is also not beyond imagination. They have become leaders not by their leadership qualities but by virtue of luck and the failure of other politicians in both major political parties to come out of the shadows of the two ladies. I was in Saudi Arabia for a long time and had to listen to the joke from Saudis that there was no man in Bangladesh having moustache! This is the fate of this nation.//////Street children are a worldwide phenomenon. That they are in the streets for many different reasons should not discourage attempts to look at their problems as a global responsibility. If you are an adult and you live on this planet, be aware now that many of our children are going to sleep hungry tonight, in the streets, with no adult protection or care. Millions of children are living in the streets, and the number is rising.//////I refer to the PCP article by Professor Nazrul Islam entitled "Vital Reforms Ignored" on 21 Nov. His recommendations to reduce the tenure of an elected government from 5 to 4, to induce tolerance by the losers for the winner, is indeed a pragmatic idea and a newly elected parliament must take this on board for consideration. Four years has been the tenure of the elected US President from the inception of its constitution about 2 centuries ago and it has proved its worth over this time for the unity of such a disparate nation, and for the development of a tolerant democracy.//////Edible oil price in local market has gone up again. //////The BNP's backing down indicates that they would not boycott elections at all, even if they were held on the 18th as scheduled. Delaying the polls by 10 days really does not benefit the BNP. The rescheduling of the dates for nominations gives them a little additional time to prepare, but as far as the polls are concerned, 10 days will make absolutely no difference to their preparation or chances. The only logical reason that I can see for this demand is that delaying by a week to 10 days puts the elections during Christmas time. Many foreign observers will cancel their trips. I'm sure you are aware that there are still a fair number of BNP sympathizers within the administration, especially the EC, etc.//////Change, change, and change. Change is everywhere and change is part of life. If we accept good changes, we will grow, if we reject them we will be lost. America shows that you can change yourself to new choices, new relations, new ideas, and finally to a new life. The question is how many of us are ready to embrace this shift in our paradigm. //////Declaration of Pahela Agrahayan as the 'National Agriculture Day' by the government has sparked pulsation to the community life of our farming people. Farmers throughout the country have celebrated the Day with great enthusiasm and jubilation. The government deserves appreciation for declaring the National Agriculture Day by recognizing the men behind the plough who are actually the prime driving force of our economy.//////I would like to pinpoint the present situation of our job market and the attitude of the employers of multinational companies. There is scarcity of job opportunities and the job seekers have to face the question-- "experienced or inexperienced?". My point is, nobody could be experienced while seeking his/her first job! //////Rat killing drive is launched in our country under the patronage of the agriculture department of the government. The drive should be launched on a regular basis and the whole nation must be included in this task for the greater interest of the country.//////None of the criminal cases against Michael Jackson could be proved beyond reasonable doubt. None of the civil suits could be proved with balance of probability. He is a clean man as per the definition of law. He even moved to the Middle East. But the witch hunting continues which is paradoxical to the human norms and laws of lands. He is innocent as not proven guilty. Now he has been confirmed to have converted to Islam like many other celebrities in the West against all propaganda and media campaigns against the faith. The Sun is one of the best selling tabloids in the UK where the story has grabbed the headlines of its 22 November issue with a shocking ridicule against Islam which put Jackson in a Burkha, as if Islam and Burkha were synonymous terms. Absolute example of disgusting taste in any form of civilised journalism. //////The government and NGOs are working for improving the quality of secondary education across the country. Particularly BRAC and TQI (Teaching Quality Improvement Project) are providing training to head teachers and teachers. Obviously, there are other projects and NGOs also working for the betterment of English teaching-learning situation in secondary schools. //////Bangladesh is fighting against poverty since 1971. Till now a significant chunk of the population is poor. Ensuring two meals a day is a major challenge for this country. The government is trying to ensure education for all to fight against poverty. But only a small section of our people is getting higher education facilities. It is a matter of regret that those seeking higher education are also not being educated according to the needs of the age. //////Our resources are limited. We waste our resources indiscriminately. If it goes on, one day there will be no resources for our general use.//////In the last few days, most national dailies have published photographs or reports about owners depositing their licensed arms in police stations. That is good news, as far as it goes, for reducing the possibility of violence during the election period. However, the real and important thing is seizing the unauthorised arms, bombs and explosives; as well as eliminating the many workshops where these are being manufactured. This is a critical need to ensure not only a peaceful election, but also a peaceful country, which we badly need.//////It is interesting to see the Truth Commission, which shoulders the mammoth task of exorcising some accused with such alacrity, has got the dose of legal medicine, that is, the very legality of it formation is now in question. //////The reclusive leader of Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers is to deliver his annual policy address this week from a besieged jungle hideout that could soon be totally overrun by government troops.//////India and Pakistan began crucial talks in Islamabad yesterday on combating terrorism, drug trafficking and liberalising the visa regime under the composite dialogue process, as authorities freed 101 Indian prisoners, most of them fishermen in a goodwill gesture.//////Britain introduced a new law yesterday bolstering rules against forced marriages, after Foreign Secretary David Miliband highlighted a case in Pakistan ahead of a visit there.//////Israel reacted on Tuesday to militant rocket fire by again sealing off the Gaza Strip, where officials said the territory's sole power plant was forced to shut down because of the crippling blockade.//////al-Qaeda is becoming a great uniting factor between the political and military leadership of Pakistan.

Controlling the medium and technique with skilled mastery, he projects an aesthetic and stylistic uniqueness. Monir's paintings speak to the viewer in an intimate voice about childhood -- most often the favourite chapter of human life, immersed in bliss, woes and boundless endeavours. The result is a display of art centring on nature, human relationships and the meaning of life.//////Renowned Darbesh (sage) Siraj Shah was born in 1750 at an area that is currently under Shailkupa upazila. His outstanding philanthropy and philosophies attained recognition throughout this region. In fact even mystic bard Lalon Shah called him "guru." Unfortunately Siraj Shah's 'mazaar' (shrine) has not been demarcated. There is no auditorium, library or a club within the precincts of the final resting place of this sage. //////Kua," a digital film produced Jol Foring-er Dol was premiered recently at the Sylhet Shilpakala Academy, says a press release. //////Urbashi Abritti Parishad, Sylhet held a programme on the occasion of its 16th anniversary last Friday evening at the Saifur Rahman auditorium in the city.

Urbashi President Mokaddes Babul chaired the event.//////Golam Rabbanai Biplab's internationally film "Swapnodanay" (On the Wings of Dreams) will be screened at the Kuala Lumpur International Film Festival, Malaysia on November 27, says a press release. //////The Outback epic "Australia" is director Baz Luhrmann's first film since he dazzled audiences with "Moulin Rouge!" seven years ago, and critics are wondering if the $130 million drama can live up to its hype.//////In the feature "All things old and wonderful" published on November 19, 2008 issue of Arts & Entertainment, it was inadvertently written that Dhaka's first urban re-development project can be traced back to the early 1900s... It should have read "The first urban re-development plans for Dhaka were conceptualised in the 1860s." //////IT appears that we are now on the highway to a participatory and credible election in just over one month. This optimism stems from the fact that BNP led 4-party alliance has finally whittled down its initial 7-point demand to two points as pre-condition for participation in election on December 29. The two points are lifting of emergency from the last day of withdrawing nomination and scrapping of Section 91 (E) of the amended RPO.//////BUSINESS leaders have asked the political parties to include in their election manifestoes a commitment to ban ////// and similar other programs -- if need be, by enacting a law in the next parliament. They have also decided to put up an economic program for the first 100 days of the elected government that is likely to take office by the end of the year.//////IF any politician of this country is to be remembered for uncommon qualities of head and heart for nearly half a century of dedicated and selfless public service, the name of Yusuf Ali Chowdhury, known as Mohan Mia, comes to the fore. He died on November 26, 1971 at the age of only 66, with his dream of making a significant contribution to building the new country of Bangladesh remaining unfulfilled.//////THERE was an article in the press the other day saying that the world's first piece of humour had been found: an ancient riddle composed in Sumeria, now called Iraq. //////Instead of freeing the public roads from illegal occupancy, Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) has embarked on leasing out roads of a residential area for car parking.//////Although the quality is going down every day, the once famous delicacies of old Dhaka still today attract the food connoisseurs and gluttons.//////
