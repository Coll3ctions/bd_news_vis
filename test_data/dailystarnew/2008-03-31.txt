Then Suchitra Sen was Roma Das Gupta. Her father Karunamoy Das Gupta was the sanitary inspector of Pabna at that time. //////Farmers are the most neglected class in our society, whereas more than seventy percent people are engaged in agriculture. It is hard to believe that most of them are living below poverty line. We have celebrated our thirty-seventh Independence Day but do we ever think seriously about their needs? Every government finishes the task just giving subsidy in the budget but they never did anything worthwhile that could bring some relief to the farmers.//////Recently, I wrote a letter on medical education and now I feel my assumptions were very much right, after reading the news of present deplorable status of the Khulna Medical College.

According to a recent report in several national dailies, on 25th March 2008, the 19th infantry division commander Major General A. K. M. Mujahid Uddin alone with his brigade commander and Sherpur district commissioner (DC) inaugurated a Shaheed (martyrs) memorial plaque and some income generating rehabilitation programmes for the first time for 39 Shaheed families of Shohagpur village in Nalitabari upazila. The barbaric Pakistan army, aided by their local collaborators, on the morning of 25 July 1971 killed 187 innocent men - mostly farmers and day labourers including all the adult males - of that village. Since then Shohagpur village is locally called as 'bidhoba para' or the village of widows. Whoever in the government has initiated this rehabilitation programme, has done a highly commendable job.//////Professor Anu Muhammad has campaigned for reason and fairness in protecting the rights of Bangladeshis faced with expropriation of their land and livelihood by mining developments such as that pursued by the mining companies in Phulbari. Professor Muhammad has rightly pointed out the risks and damages from the proposed open-pit coal mining development, where the costs will be born first by those in the vicinity of the mine and then by all Bangladeshis in the resulting contribution to climate-induced sea level rise. Those who have questioned the Phulbari mining development have been subject to violence and intimidation. This includes the deaths of local protestors after police fired on crowds and the current death threats against Professor Anu Muhammad for speaking out on the project. //////The mass media in South Asia is taking keen interest in the upsets and trends witnessed at the recent general elections in Pakistan. Democracy was not allowed to take roots in Pakistan in the past. //////For quite sometime we were talking about the war criminals but now everyone seems to have forgotten this issue. //////A few days back, I was going through the newspaper and was reading a report on some government employees becoming millionaires. They built up their own industrial kingdom. I was wondering whether the reporter has ever given any thought about their business acumen and entrepreneurship. Maybe at the beginning of their career they earned money through corruption or illegal means which as a conscious human being I cannot approve of . But eventually these men have invested in building industries and creating job opportunities for hundreds of unemployed youths and are generating crores of taka to add to the national GDP growth.//////Bird flu has stopped the wheel of our economy. Our economy is now passing through a crucial moment. How can we handle the situation? It is a million dollar question. The government failed to understand this problem at a very early stage. Now it has spread all over the country.//////Should it be an existing bank or a new bank that is now the question. Why? Because a) Vast numbers of NRBs are investing overseas through many different vehicles - from banking to real estate, from mutual funds to individual stock portfolios, from pension plans to retirement homes and much more. Yet, due to the lack of an established and secure infrastructure in Bangladesh this money is going to fill the monetary reserves of other countries. Therefore, Bangladesh is losing large amounts of foreign investments (foreign currencies); b) NRBs are no different from resident Bangladeshis and they are not PBOs (people of Bangladeshi origin) who may think differently. How? Consider that most NRBs left Bangladesh when they were adults; therefore, their views regarding money management are similar to local Bangladeshis'. Confidence levels for small community banks (such as Williamsburg Savings Bank) far exceed those for giant investment companies (like Prudential Bache Securities). In fact, they also feel more comfortable investing with Chase Manhattan Bank's Investment Banker over its parent company JP Morgan Chase, (a leading global financial services firm with assets of $1.6 trillion). This is probably one of the main reasons why local investment firms have had very limited success in bringing NRB investments to Bangladesh. A bank in Bangladesh established for the NRBs, of the NRBs and by the NRBs would go a long way in attracting many non-resident Bangladeshis to invest in their homeland. //////Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh comprises 16 districts with an area of 34,495 square kilometres. According to 2001 population census, 3,02,02,000 people live in these 16 districts. It is assumed that the present population is about 4 crore. There were two active airports until January 2007 at Rajshahi and Saidpur.
