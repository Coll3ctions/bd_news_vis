It is also a day of triumph. //////WE in Bangladesh have observed two strands of reaction to the question of terrorism. There are those who have always cried wolf at any mention of terrorism, to a point where they have ended up exaggerating or over-estimating the influence of religious extremism in the country. That has often created a rather sickening doomsday scenario. And then there is the other, equally lamentable truth, which is that influential quarters in the government have always been in denial mode on the terrorism question. One has only to go back to the JMB issue to know how resolutely the government of the day denied its presence, with consequences that were to be horrific. The point here is that we as a nation cannot afford to fall into the pitfalls created by either of the two assumptions above. In other words, we cannot afford to panic and at the same time must not be tempted into adopting a laid-back position.//////IF conflict between civilizations is replacing the ideological animosity that ended with the cold war then it becomes necessary to understand the term civilization, that Samuel Huntington described as basically a cultural entity, and that the most important conflicts in the future will occur along the cultural fault lines.

But the most significant part of his tour has been the resumed peace process between Israel and Palestine, which had remained dormant for more than seven years as it received very scant importance from the Bush administration. George Bush's visit to Ramallah gave the green signal for the Middle East peace process, as he called for an end to Israel's 41-year occupation of Palestinian lands and stated a commitment to forge a peace agreement before the end of his tenure in office. Bush said: "I believe its going to happen, that there's going to be a signed peace treaty by the time I leave office." He further emphasised that the Palestinian refugees would be paid compensation for the loss of homes when they fled after occupation by Israel.//////Indian captain Anil Kumble hailed one of the greatest wins of his career after his side again halted a record Australian winning streak with a famous 72-run victory in the third Test at the WACA Ground here Saturday.//////Shaun Pollock's farewell tour of South Africa started in triumph when he steered his team to victory in a Twenty20 international against the West Indies at the Wanderers Stadium Friday.//////Bangladesh Army were unbeaten champions in the President Cup Super Four volleyball competition when they won the final against Bangladesh Navy 18-25, 25-20, 21-25, 27-25, 16-14 at the Dhaka Volleyball Stadium yesterday.//////There were some amazing figures in the Parachute Women's Open cricket tournament at different venues across the country yesterday.//////Irrespective of what has gone in this series and what lies ahead, Ishant Sharma's mesmeric spell to Ricky Ponting will remain one of the highlights of the series, and will be remembered for years to come. Cricket lovers still talk about the working-over Andrew Flintoff gave Ponting at Edgbaston but that lasted only one over. Here at the WACA, the torment continued for an hour. Harbhajan Singh has had his number for some time now but rarely has Ponting been shown up as so vulnerable for such a long period of time since he established himself as Australia's best batsman. That Ishant is 19 and playing his fourth Test only added to the drama and romance.//////Australian captain Ricky Ponting admitted the prospect of a suspension affected his tactics after he was fined 20 per cent of his match fee for a slow over rate during the 72-run loss to India in the third Test Saturday.//////The national selection committee will meet here today to choose the Indian cricket squad for next month's triangular ODI series in Australia with the biggest dilemma facing it whether to recall former captain Rahul Dravid.//////Roger Federer flirted with Grand Slam disaster before pulling off a desperate five-set Australian Open victory Saturday, but there were no such dramas for young Serb hotshot Novak Djokovic.//////Kevin Keegan has set his sights on breaking into the top four after insisting Newcastle United are fully-equipped to upset the Premier League big guns. //////The west African state of Ghana is about to take its place in the international spotlight as hosts of the 26th African Nations Cup. //////World number two Svetlana Kuznetsova slumped to a shock loss at the Australian Open Saturday, joined by sixth seeded fellow Russian Anna Chakvetadze as the upsets continued at Melbourne Park.//////Manchester United's pursuit of global domination will see a squad including Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney land in Saudi Arabia on Sunday for a visit that will see the Premiership champions play in a testimonial game for Saudi legend Sami al-Jaber. //////Playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme and midfielder Javier Mascherano will play for Argentina at the Beijing Olympics where the South American giants are the defending champions. //////Barcelona's teenage sensation Bojan Krkic could be in line for a shock call-up to the Spanish national side for this summer's European Championships after impressing Spain coach Luis Aragones. //////Valencia are building a wall around their training ground at Paterna to keep out prying eyes after Ronald Koeman complained he needed more privacy when coaching the team, Spanish media reported on Saturday.//////Dutchman Louis Van Gaal on Friday made his desire to return as coach of the Netherlands official. //////Chess legend Bobby Fischer's victory in the 1972 "match of the century" with Soviet world champion Boris Spassky elevated the game into a Cold War weapon and turned the eccentric young American into a national hero.//////Buoyed by their stunning 72-run win in Perth inside four days, India have set themselves to square the four-Test series against Australia.//////Australia captain Ricky Ponting said Saturday his team weren't pressing the panic button following their first Test loss in two years, but admitted they erred in team selection for the third Test against India.//////Ricky Ponting refuses to believe Australia's global domination is over after their record-equalling winning streak was ended in Perth. While India's 72-run victory gave the world hope that the gap between Australia and the rest was closing, Ponting was not convinced his team was "on the slide".//////The end of the era came quickly. An Australian unit that seemed unbreakable over the past 24 months had actually been admirably masking the dints.
