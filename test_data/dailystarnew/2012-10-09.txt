A productive life and a quality life for all irrespective of developed or developing country is a rightful demand of this science and ICT century. For this purpose, womenalong with men should be given ample opportunities to enter and excel in science, technology, and related professions. While women constitute half of humanity, even in countries where they have ready access to higher education, the number of women studying mathematics, physical science, and engineering remains disproportionately below parity with that of men. Talented and capable women are practically turned away from these and other fields, and the few who persist typically find themselves isolated and marginalized. As a result, the overall participation of women scientists and engineers in the workforce continues to be very limited, and these professional women seldom reach the top of the hierarchyat universities, research organizations or policy making institutions in the government and the private sectors. Bangladesh is no exception in this regard.//////A well-preserved mammoth carcass has been found by an 11-year-old boy in the permafrost of northern Siberia.
