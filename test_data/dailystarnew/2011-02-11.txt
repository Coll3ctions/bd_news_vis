His assassin was quickly pounced upon by a mob and lynched. The incident sent shock waves throughout Pakistan, especially since it was the first murder of a leading political figure in the country. The subcontinent had already been reeling from the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in January 1948.

If indeed the security forces have had to act to defend themselves in crossfires and in the process shoot alleged criminals dead, there must be ways of validating such claims. Professor Mizanur Rahman has suggested --- and one cannot but agree with him --- that only the judiciary can determine if the principle of self-defence is a cause for law enforcers to kill their would-be assailants in extra-judicial manner. No one argues that in a skirmish where the Rapid Action Battalion and the police must defend themselves from criminal elements, they will do all they can to save themselves. //////The skyrocketing cooking oil price has dealt another blow to the consumer public. Faced with losses as they are bound by the government-fixed price tag on the bottled cooking oil, refiners have slashed their supply substantially, thereby leaving the market at the mercy of the middlemen, who have taken full advantage of the situation to charge the customers unfairly. On this score, the refiners' point that the upward trend of oil price in the international market is behind their quandary cannot be dismissed out of hand. But what fails our understanding is why the government has been simply looking on while the crisis in the cooking oil market was going from bad to worse? And if the refiners' contention is grounded in fact, why hasn't it taken apt measures to offset the instability in the market or even revise the price of bottled oil in keeping with the international market as well as with the consumers' and the refiners' interests? //////It's in the air that this port city is going to be a part of history.

We hope such actions are taken by the Department of Environment on a regular basis. The fine imposed on Ehsan Steel Mills at Charpatherghata, in Chittagong is a good example! However the time frame of only 25 days, given for installing proper pollution prevention equipment is too little and unrealistic.//////The 5 column photograph of cattle egrets (A dash of white in a concrete city) published in the front page of The Daily Star were quite interesting. I live by the side of Gulshan-Banani lake on its southern side in south Gulshan. I have been watching with lot of interests that a big flock of the white birds flying up and down the length of the longish lake for the last couple of weeks. Sometimes they descend on the thick carpet of green hyacinths for food. The lake is terribly polluted, particularly during winter when the water-table falls. Good that the birds don't mind the pollution and search for food in the water hyacinths! It is a beautiful sight when the flock of white cattle egrets flies along the lake. Even in this bustling and overpopulated city with its myriads of problems it is a wonder and we are lucky to get a glimpse of nature! One good thing- when the birds descend children don't throw stones but quietly watch.//////The concept I read about recently of enlisting qualifying foreigners as 'Goodwill Ambassadors' and 'Friends of Bangladesh' is an excellent idea.//////In the Islamic culture when two Muslims, either known or total strangers to each other meet, they offer greetings by saying Assalamu alaikum which in English means Peace be with you. The one who pay Salam first is said to be in a better position. Answering the Salam by the one who receive it is obligatory. The answer is Wa alaikum assalam (And upon you be peace). I have noticed with regrets that some of us while paying or answering one's Salam do not maintain the proper norm, simply say Wa alaikum. But this should not be done. Salam should be offered and answered in the way as has been asked by the Almighty. Allah orders in the holy Qur'an: When a greeting is offered to you, answer it with an even better greeting, or (at least) with its like. Allah keeps count of all things. [Surah an-Nur: 4:86]//////People are the ultimate judge to give verdict about success or failures of a government. Although a third world country, Bangladesh is far better than many developing countries in case of free access of information. Here the newspapers, private TV, periodicals, weeklies are abundant. The writers of those print media are freely writing their views in those papers without any fear. This situation is good for establishing democracy. As a citizen I am proud of my country. In fact print media in Bangladesh is very powerful. I believe the first pre-requisite of democracy is "free press. The free press has more responsibilities to deliver correct information to the people. Confusing news from media create unnecessary rifts among the friends living abroad and to people at home. So they should play major role in bringing democracy in the country.//////When a female member of a family is raped, she may need solace and some counseling in the beginning.

There is a Cyber Centre at TSC in the campus. But it has only 40 computers. The computers are not enough for 30,000 students. Moreover, about 10-15 computers always remain out of order. While the world is aiming to provide Internet connectivity to all, we are still deprived of basic technologies. I would like to draw the attention of Dhaka University Cyber Centre authority to take proper steps for installing huge number of computers for better service.//////It is nice to see that, the first science and technology university is getting back its golden era flavor. Now there is no session jam in this university from 2006-07 batches and another semester's session jam is going to be minimized. This university has taken the first step toward digital Bangladesh by introducing digital admission system. If all the department of the university work properly it will be number one university of Bangladesh. //////Are we ready for a major earthquake mentally and logistically? I'm sure most of the people will die a sinner, if earthquake strike them off guard. The moment a man visits an erotic site, give full play of his libido and become all engrossed in the rat race of materialism, he negates the omnipresence of God. Today's earthquake that I felt while sitting with my friends in the drawing room will remain the reminder of the Almighty Allah from whom comes everything. I was wondering what will happen to those who wants to destroy a huge bread basket to make room for a huge unnecessary high cost airport at a time when the black clouds of price hike is looming in the horizon. What will happen to those who feel no compunction about indicting a person like Sirajuzul Islam Chowdhury for the unrest on Arial beel. When it is the government that should be indicted for a stupid airport plan on Arial beel and the resultant unrest and deaths, now it is the government itself that is playing the role of a double villain by victimizing the victims. //////Moscow's Domodedovo airport had been rocked by a bomb explosion that killed 35 people on January 24. More than 100 people were injured by a suicide bomber. Such Bomb attacks are not new for Russia rather it is a continuing process because there were 6 massive bomb attack in past 7 years which killed more than 500 people. The question is when the world will be safe for us?//////We are nonplus and horrified to see a photograph and news of our innocent child Felani. Earlier Indian BSF has killed hundreds of Bangladeshis on trifle matter. Later they promised and assured us that such inhuman acts would never be repeated but all in vain. We wonder how and where from Indian Border Guards get such power and courage to shoot Bangladeshis like shooting of birds? We request our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to raise the issue in UNO on humanitarian ground. //////One of the reasons for severe traffic congestion in Dhaka is railway gates. It seems that trains leave and arrive Dhaka station almost every few minutes. Once a railway gate is closed, traffic backs up quite a bit, before a backlog is cleared, it is time for another train to pass. //////Through the columns of your esteemed daily I venture to voice my views about dowry system.
