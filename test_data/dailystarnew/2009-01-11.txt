In these past few days, close to 800 people, most of them innocent Palestinians, have been killed in Israeli air and ground attacks. And that is not the end of the story. Israeli forces have fired on medical teams trying to extricate wounded civilians from the streets and have also blocked supplies of essentials to the besieged region.

It is worth mentioning that we have ugly political parties who when in power have absolute disregard for the rights of the people. It is here that we have political parties with very little competency for what they are bestowed with every 5 years running the country. Now, I believe the people have had bitter experiences during the tenure of every government. Frankly speaking, so far we have had no realistic vision from anyone. It is all big talk and no action. Basically, every party has been following their whims and desires to varying degrees, whenever possible. //////I am not a great fan of the Awami League. Yet, I have accepted the people's verdict. Now remains a great future to see where the new leaders will set a trend of sacrifices and relentless endeavours to make the lot of the millions of this ill-fated nation shine with pride.

In 2001, it was perhaps an anti-incumbency vote for the Awami League, though there is ample evidence available now with the Election Commission database that the 2001 elections might have been rigged. However, this time it is a positive vote. Despite all attempts by the BNP and the Jamaat to wipe out the Awami league during their coalition rule, the later emerged as the single largest party. Maybe many will try to take credit for the large turnout of voters, but this time it is due to our resilience, and to our younger and women voters.//////Being a marginalized male in a female dominated in front of TV household, I have been forced to watch the endless series of Soap Operas on the three popular Indian Channels evening after evening and far into the night (sports, news, NatGeo, Discovery, others only during commercial breaks). Sleep eventually comes as a merciful escape into the world of reality. My observations (since this is the time of Observers, foreign and local!)://////I welcome the letter by Eng. Enamul Huq on 4 January about an Islamic Calendar like the Gregorian Calendar which has the same day and date spanning the whole globe in a period of 24 hours. However, for this we need to learn very simple mathematics and physics in addition to what is in our holy scriptures to give the act of 'moon-sighting', which is always a local matter, a global effect which does not go against Islamic traditions. When the Gregorian Calendar was introduced in 1582 AD to supersede the Julian Calendar it was only applied in Italy and a handful of European countries, because it was still only accurate in a local manner. The invention of the marine chronometer, and the division of the globe into latitudes and longitudes, and longitudes with further 24 hour time zones with an agreed International Date Line(IDL) are scientific concepts introduced much later to enable the Gregorian Calendar to be applied throughout the whole globe in a consistent manner. These concepts were unknown to Pope Gregory or the Christian world at the time, and although the accepted solar calendar worldwide is known as the Gregorian Calendar, it is actually the scientific International Calendar. England only accepted this calendar in 1752 and Russia around 1910, showing about a passage of 400 years for the maturity of a local calendar into a worldwide phenomenon with scientific expertise which does not violate any religious belief or tradition but is neutral and for the benefit of all mankind.//////History says the flatterers are more dangerous than the opponents.//////The Ninth National Parliamentary Election-- fair, credible and acceptable to all-- was held amid a peaceful, convivial and favourable environment wherein the Awami League-led grand alliance unpredictably secured a landslide victory with a huge number of seats. //////The BNP has been trounced, out of 299 seats, they managed to get only 32 seats. It is very unfortunate for the party which came to power twice. //////The caretaker government has delivered what they came to do almost two years ago. One must congratulate the CTG, the Election Commission and, last but not least, the Army. They worked together and with each other to make the voter list, the national ID card and ultimately gave us one of the finest elections which was conducted not only peacefully but with an overwhelming participation from all. It was a long wait for almost two years but they did manage to give an election that might create yet another milestone for Bangladesh. When the present caretaker government took over with the backing of the military they had an overwhelming support but as the time was passing the people seem to have been getting tired and restless.
