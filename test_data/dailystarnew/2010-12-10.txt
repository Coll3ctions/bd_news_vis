But parking problem is also a reason that should not be ignored. The vehicles cannot run smoothly on the roads, because the parked vehicles occupy a part of the roads. Vehicles are parked on the roads because no designated car-parking spaces are available for them in the city.

After two days, the teen ended up in the hospital dead. //////I work at Nokia in Finland where my office is like a mini United Nations with people from around the world.

Last Wednesday, late in the afternoon Bangladesh time, it released a statement that should clear the smog of doubts hanging over Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus. The Norwegian aid agency has confirmed that there was no embezzlement done by the poor man's banker and his bank, although Grameen Bank did transfer Norwegian fund to Grameen Kallyan, breaching agreement. //////Cutting off the nose to spite the face is an age old adage to describe an action out of pique. Albeit metaphorical, this defines a desperate act that would damage oneself more than the source of one's anger.

Not those on the cranky buses, slithering three wheelers, the most carefree rickshaws and the sleek cars, but the pedestrians streaming in any direction of their choice and the hawkers defiantly settled on the footpaths and spilling over into the roads with their merchandise, chanting their marketing hymns and describing the aphrodisiac potency in sensuous details. Surely, the numbers are bewildering. //////It doesn't take a genius to understand the law, but you do have to be smart. Some might call the law a whole set of common sense statements, including a whole spate of things ranging from pronouncements to dictums, accumulated over a span of centuries.
