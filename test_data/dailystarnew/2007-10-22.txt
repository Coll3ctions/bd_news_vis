The strategy was to promote import on which our market for essentials is critically dependent, keep supplies from the wholesale to the retail markets steady and oversee retail market behaviour. At the same time, open market sales (OMS) operated by BDR rather extensively with TCB sale outlets at designated places helped prevent prices spiralling out of control. But now, things appear to have changed as the 'seasonal arrangements' are being cut back on. //////Criminality has lately been taking a disquieting form in the capital. The recent arrest of a group of young men, all coming from well to do families, on charges of possessing such lethal drugs as yaba have only revived concerns about the damage being done to our youth largely on their own account. And possession, sale and inhalation of drugs are not all. There are also instances where youngsters appear to be veering toward increasing levels of violence and even outright murder. Quite some weeks ago, the sad story of a young man in his late teens made the rounds through the newspapers. Having gone out to buy blood for his ailing father, he was pounced upon by a group of young people of his age and soon bludgeoned to death in Uttara. Add to such grisly incidents one more, that of the young student found dead, his throat slit, on the rooftop of the building in which his family lives. He had earlier been called out by some people whom he obviously must have known.//////EVEN as the authorities have been attempting a Cesarean rebirth of the polity and feeding it with the syrupy promises of a bright future once the agenda it has undertaken comes to fruition, belying the prospect of any windfall, things have worsened -- at least for the present. //////TRUST a Calcuttan to come up with the perfect political metaphor.

To be precise, there are the following reasons behind it://////Great souls never die but they live on amid their good deeds! The late journalist Obaidul Huq was such a great soul who will never die in our minds. We will remember him in his pious works. Obaidul Huq was an outstanding journalist, litterateur and a social reformer. Personally, I had the opportunity to come in touch with him. He used to encourage me in my writing while I used to write in the 'Young Observer' page of 'The Bangladesh Observer'. Indeed he was a soft-spoken, gentleman with exceptional human qualities. He was a great teacher who had all the skills to navigate his students in search of knowledge. I admire him from the core of my heart. //////There are no frontiers in this struggle to the death. We cannot remain indifferent in the face of what occurs in any part of the world. A victory for any country against imperialism is our victory, just as any country's defeat is our defeat." That is the word of Che Guevara, inspiring epitome of all leftists. Che is the man who opposed the modern imperialism of the USA and alerted the global leaders against US invasion. He didn't limit his opposition to words; he used all his efforts to destroy the US position in Latin America.//////The students of Dhaka University are going to face session jam once again. Time has value of its own, we all should realise that. However, we can just hope there won't be any more unfortunate incidents on the university campus. //////A timely and interesting editorial on the subject (Oct:6) focuses on the load- shedding phenomenon and the associated excuses given fairly realistically on a regular basis. Even the CTG, like the past political government run administration; only makes claims, without relating it to the reality on the ground. On load-shedding any statement from any administration source or authority may be defined as only idle, ideal talks-- nothing more!//////International Day of the Elderly was observed a few days ago, reminding us once again how much we neglect the old people. Our sense of respect and love for elderly persons who are just like our own grandpa and grandma have faded away. Nobody cares a little for them , but the most astonishing matter is that we tend to forget that we all will one day be like these persons, not capable of moving or eating properly. While riding a bus if we see an aged man not finding a seat in the bus, standing all the while during the journey, we should courteously offer our seat to him but the real scene is just the opposite. If eventually that person requests the young passenger just to give him a seat only for some minutes, then he feels outraged. This is shocking but it is the most common scene in our society. Some perverted teenagers even mock the octogenarian people. //////Mr. Dalton McGuinty, Premier of Ontario, Canada and leader of the Liberal Party, declared to observe the Family Day on Monday in the 3rd week of February, 2008. This deserves appreciation to revive the family bond and celebrate a day with pomp and pleasure among family members.//////In the backdrop of mixed reactions from the political parties and individual politicians, Dr. B. Chowdhury has now come up with little more information on his idea of national consensus government. He is talking about three phases, and at the same time setting some kind of conditions like denial of the idea would mean supporting terrorism, corruption etc, etc, and also talking about ultimate option for a referendum. We will have to wait for political reactions again. Hopefully, Dr. Chowdhury would ensure justice to his idea by making issues for consensus very concrete with clear agenda. The piecemeal approach and patchwork are not helping the march for clean democracy the people want to see in Bangladesh//////We have heard a very useful discussion on BBC Bengali Service. Two senior editors have reviewed the status of politics and suggested needed action by the government. As an example of negative outcome, the current political situation in Pakistan was referred to. The case of Pakistan should be an eye opener for our government. The government may kindly listen to the third angle views very attentively and take a firm decision to reopen democratic practices in Bangladesh including a clear plan of action to make their repeated commitment of general election a reality to dispel any doubt anywhere. The editors have also explained the need for such an action by the government. //////Americans in general have been brainwashed to think that Iran is preparing for a nuclear war. Senator McCaine said recently, There is only one thing worse than military action against Iran and that is a nuclear-armed Iran. It is American belief that Iran is going for nuclear weapon. If America can have nuclear warheads to destroy the world a few times over, on what moral ground can they deny Iran the use of nuclear power for peaceful purpose? Why should America be so adamant to stop Iran in its pursuit to use nuclear power? //////Once I came across the souvenir published by the trainee Outsider Cadets of the Police Academy, Sardah, Rajshahi. I went through the publication carelessly as one always does. But I observed the qualification of a cadet to be a B.Sc. in chemical engineering. It seemed unusual to turn an engineer into a police sub-inspector. I went through the other pages carefully and became astonished to discover that out of 829 Outsider Cadets passed-out in 2005, 250 of them are graduates, which is the minimum qualification of a police sub-inspector. Eighty-five cadets graduated with honours in different disciplines. At the time of recruitment they were students studying in post graduate classes but could not complete their courses for their training in the Police Academy. But many of them earned their post graduate degrees in the meantime. Two-hundred and one cadets earned their post graduate degrees (after graduation without honours). The majority of the Outsider Cadets are highly qualified having graduated with honours and then earned their post graduate degrees from different universities and affiliated colleges of the National University.//////The way the two senior most university teachers were picked up from their quarters at night and then were made to parade in front of the nation on the electronic media, while seeking
