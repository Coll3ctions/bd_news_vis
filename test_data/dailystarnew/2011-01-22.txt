You sent in your best predictions for the coming year -- and nominated the worst prediction of last year.//////On the 20th of December, 2010 an oil spill was detected in the Bay off Sitakunda in Chittagong. It was over 3 kilometers long and 300-400 feet wide with a reddish- black layer. It is suspected that, the cause of the oil spill was the unauthorised transfer or intentional dump of oil into the sea to salvage the grounded Indian flag carrier Ocean Pearl. It was a huge spill but still it is unknown how much oil they actually released into the sea. We have yet to know to what extent the area was affected. The DoE has served a notice to Sygma Shipping Line, the parent company of Ocean Pearl, to answer why the company would not be prosecuted for causing oil spill in the Bay. But we have yet to know what necessary action has been taken. So far we only know that the port authority has not taken any legal action against the Ocean Pearl.//////Bangladesh is blessed with suitable soil and climate for growing rice in all three crop seasons in a year. Rice grown during summer is locally known as Aus, during monsoon as Aman and during winter as Boro. The Boro is really the improved rice variety that is cultivated in almost all rice fields during winter. Winter rice is typically called Boro but is now cultivated in other seasons too. Gradual expansion of improved rice farming contributed much to total rice production increasing more than three times over the last three decades. The winter rice farming was a demand-led adoption by all types of farmers because of its higher productivity and it being produced in dry season almost in risk-free environment.//////Akhtaruzzaman Elias is arguably the most radical novelist of Bangladesh. Although he had written only two novels, he is recognised to be among the most critically acclaimed Bengali novelists. To read or confront his writing is to go through an experience that radically changes our worldview and questions carefully constructed rationales and dogmas. In the canon of 20th century Bengali fiction, no one's writings are more unsettling yet fascinating than Elias's. However, it is beyond the scope of this article to give what is usually called an overview of Elias's writings. In what follows I attempt to present some of my observations on his second novel ////// (1996).//////Those tiered pancakes were awesome,//////A foot is what keeps the world standing.//////It makes us foot all those sad bills of life//////.It roots us to the realities of the cosmos.//////A pretty foot on an elegant woman is//////Something else, though.//////Diet and physical activity have major effects on body cholesterol. Eating healthy foods and exercising regularly can help you lower your cholesterol or maintain a normal level. Likewise, lack of physical activity and poor food choices can send your cholesterol soaring.//////Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is an alternate form of providing a complete form of nutrition, containing protein, sugar, fat and added vitamins and minerals to those patients who are unable to get full nutrition through mouth. It is crucial for severely ill patients as it keeps people alive where they can not eat to sustain themselves. This method bypasses the digestive tract completely and places nutrients directly into the bloodstream. //////Countries that vaccinate babies against rotavirus, which can cause severe diarrhoea and kill in days, have significantly reduced the number of children admitted to hospitals with the disease, a report showed recently.//////A new study may offer women one more reason to kick the smoking habit before becoming pregnant: a potentially reduced risk of early miscarriage.//////A test called HbA1c used to check how well the blood sugar was being controlled over previous 2-3 months has now been approved as a diagnostic test. A report on a World Health Organisation (WHO) expert consultation issued recently on the diagnosis of diabetes recommends the acceptability of glycated haemoglobin, or HbA1c, as an additional test to diagnose the debilitating and deadly disease. Experts from WHO say the addition of a new test for diagnosing diabetes is a positive development.//////"An enemy's visit to the sickbed is worse than the disease itself"  goes the Arabian proverb.//////Aspecial counter-terrorism unit called "National Police Bureau of Counterterrorism" is on the cards. It has been reported in the press that this special units was proposed a year ago but the pace of forming the unit got tangled in bureaucratic red-tapes. However, the process has been accelerated when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took special interest in forming this. //////For the Korean peninsula, the year 2011 opened with hopes of a return to peace, with North Korea making a series of gestures to South Korea to "open their hearts" and resume talks after a hiatus marked by hostility. The North's offer coincided with the 28th birthday of the heir apparent Kim Jong-UN. North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said, "We do not want to see the present South Korean authorities pass the five-year term of their office idly without North-South dialogue." It further said that "there is neither conditionality in the North's proposal for dialogue nor need to cast any doubt about its real intention." Further, Pyongyang pledged to reconnect the hotline between the Red Cross organisations of both Koreas and reopen the Consultative Office for North-South Economic Cooperation at the Kaesong industrial complex to take the lead in pushing for inter-Korean talks. //////India launched a new naval research centre for warships on Tuesday, part of efforts by the South Asian giant to build its sea defences and counter the perceived threat of China in the Indian Ocean.//////Ataul Ghani Osmany remains a point of reference for Bengalis who take justified pride in his role during the War of Liberation. There is then a class of people who have never failed to underscore Osmany's credentials as a democrat through reminding everyone of the manner of his resignation from parliament in January 1975 once the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution came to pass. Osmany was unwilling to accept a switch over to the one-party state that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman brought into being with the setting up of the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League in that year. Osmany will remain noted for his valedictory remark in the Jatiyo Sangsad --- that he was not willing to see a Mujib Khan in Bangladesh. The allusion was of course to the dictatorship of Ayub Khan in Pakistan between 1958 and 1969.//////Bangladesh's history in its first decade of freedom was fundamentally a story of bloodletting. You do not have to go into research to arrive at such a morbid conclusion. But you cannot escape feeling a certain sense of irony as you recapitulate the whole episode of the country's actually claiming, and taking, its place in the global community. If the war of liberation in 1971 saw three million Bengalis dying at the hands of the Pakistan armed forces, the post-liberation era turned into a long tale of blood and gore as most of the new nation's founding fathers and war heroes bit the dust through bloody coups d'etat and internecine armed conflict. The series of tragic happenings that engulfed Bangladesh between August and November 1975, followed by the execution of Abu Tahir, a soldier for freedom, in July 1976, will remain a blot on the conscience of a nation which yet struggles to find a way out of the woods for itself.//////
