Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) personnel assaulted and injured a Municipal commissioner, some 50 common people and members of the press in Satkhira on Sunday evokes condemnation. They allegedly went out in a body with the mood for vendetta when the local commissioner handed over a BDR man to the police for his questionable behaviour. Instead of allowing law to take its own course, the BDR men purportedly picked up the commissioner and beat him up for his initiative. It is further deplorable that they did not even spare women inside shops or households while venting out their rage. And the assault on the members of the press was reprehensible as they were only performing their duty. It was a gross violation of professional norms as we understand and therefore the persons responsible should be held accountable after thorough investigation as per law.//////LOVE makes the world go round.

about the Chuadanga jail incident. I think lack of sense of responsibility is killing our nation completely in every sector. Four top outlaws were kept in a cell which was not at all fortified. How silly! I have read that the quality of the substances (like cement, sands etc) with which the cell was built was very low. What's wrong with our engineers and contractors? They are constructing prisoner cells and making money here too! They should realise that they are not only putting our lives in danger but also inviting trouble for themselves. The prison guards are certainly responsible for this incident.//////One fails to understand the illogical and irrational behaviour of Mynamar's military junta. In this hour of grave humanitarian crisis, they should have allowed unfettered inflow of foreign aid as the UN estimates that rudimentary aid so far has only managed to reach just 270,000 people. With the death toll, according to UN Assistant Secretary General Catherine Bragg, at 100,000 and with 2 million cyclone victims suffering from lack of access to food, shelter, clean drinking water, diseases (such as cholera, fever and other illnesses), the military regime must act in a much more responsive manner. They cannot afford to reject visas to disaster management experts and aid agency officials; they cannot rely on inefficient local aid distribution of their military workers and they cannot afford to store the aid in their airports for days and not distribute it. //////Our national football coach's detailed clinical analysis was published in a local English daily (May 13).

The major greenhouse gases are the- carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons etc. Generally, the earth is heated by the sunlight and some of the heat that is absorbed by the earth is radiated back into the space. The important feature of greenhouse gases is that they absorb certain infrared wavelengths. Thus, they trap heat in the troposphere and stop it from escaping to the space. The net result of the heating of the earth's surface by this type of phenomenon is the Greenhouse Effect.//////I would like to ask Mohammad Ashraful why he is hanging on to the captaincy, even after performing so poorly in recent times. I know he might point his finger towards his lone century that he could manage to get out of 115+ ODIs. Even after maintaining an average of 20 odd runs per match, he might claim to be the BEST player of the country. But sound reasoning is missing in our assessment of not only the players, but also our performance in the international arena. //////I was praying for Lakshmi as she was undergoing operation in a Bangalore hospital. This beautiful girl was born with four hands and four legs. She was regarded as goddess in Bihar. But her poor father had no intention to use her as a source of money-making. He decided to give her a chance to live a normal life by undergoing an operation. I appreciate and thank very much all those doctors in Sparsh hospital in Bangalore for their patience, sincerity and humanity that they showed during the 17-hour operation. //////Nowadays we are talking about the call centre business prospects, but are we really ready to welcome and develop this business? In the past, we missed many good opportunities in this sector due to lack of government patronisation. //////My expectation has come true. There is nothing new except the possible time of election in December 2008, and he bailed out the confined "Ghoroa Rajniti" to local level with nine undemocratic restrictions. There is no political statesmanship in the address. Nothing was said about the present economic hardship of the people. Freedom of expression, press freedom and free information flow are still restricted. The survival of democracy is put to more tests as the government is keeping the trump card in hand. The big political parties have been discouraged to join the dialogue with the government through imposition of well-articulated conditions in disguise. The political parties, except a few minor ones, are not satisfied. //////Dialogue is the most popular buzzword of Dhaka today.//////Only in Bangladesh perhaps does one come across such blatant disregard for one's fellow citizens. I don't believe that any child or its parents wake up one fine day and declare that his future lies in rickshaw-pulling. It appears that ever since the British colonial rulers imported this mode of transport from China, unskilled men and boys from poor families have had to drift to this awful and demeaning occupation.//////The CA in his address to the nation declared a tentative national election time frame. And to pave the roadmap, among others, he has declared his government's withdrawal of restrictions on indoor politics nationwide, unconditional dialogue with all political parties to frame a national charter to hold a free, fair and credible election. The address has cleared the clouds of doubts among the public about the present government's intentions. We profusely thank him. We are also happy to note that unlike other times, all the politicians have expressed cautious but positive reaction to his speech.//////The media carried a news item that the donors are satisfied with the address of the CA. They also expressed their full confidence that the election preparations were progressing well and the voter list would be ready in time for the election. Our respected guests from abroad are well informed about our ground realities. They are financing the voter list preparations. There is every reason to defend their funding which has accountability. But they have never explained to us what makes them so sure about all those episodes when Bangladeshis themselves are not yet sure, despite a timeline for general election being declared by the CA. //////I am an expatriate who reads your newspaper everyday to keep up with what is happening there on a day to day basis. I have been away from Dhaka for over 25 years and living mostly in the US since I left Bangladesh.//////I travelled from North America to the Middle East to South Asia. I went from very cold zones to very hot ones and finally to Bangladesh where the winter is very mild. I was surprised that in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand there is no winter. To me winter is a natural terrorist in northern countries like Canada or in North Europe. But for people of these countries this is normal. The cost of living is higher due to higher heating costs, but there are more financial opportunities to help deal with this particular problem.//////China said it was struggling to find shelter for many of the 5 million people whose homes were destroyed in last week's earthquake, while the confirmed death toll rose Tuesday to more than 40,000. //////Pakistan government is giving finishing touches to a sweeping constitutional amendment package that will clip President Pervez Musharraf's powers and pave the way for reinstating judges sacked by him last year, an issue that has imperilled the fragile ruling coalition. //////Myanmar began three days of mourning for some 78,000 cyclone victims yesterday, after its ruling junta appeared to relent to foreign pressure to allow more outside help for its storm survivors. //////The end of the marathon race for the Democratic presidential nomination in sight, voters weighed in Tuesday in primaries in Oregon and Kentucky as a top Barack Obama adviser urged Democrats to unite behind the Illinois senator for the fall campaign. //////At least 12 Tamil Tiger rebels and three government soldiers have died in renewed clashes in northern Sri Lanka, the military said yesterday.//////Iraqi troops poured into the Baghdad Shia bastion of Sadr City yesterday for the first time in eight weeks, without resistance from militias who have fought deadly street battles with US forces.//////Scientists said yesterday they had "resurrected" a gene from the extinct Tasmanian tiger by implanting it in a mouse, raising the future possibility of bringing animals such as dinosaurs back to life.//////Ahead of next week's talks with the Left on the stalled Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement, the UPA government has said that it hoped that "national interest" will prevail and it will be able to persuade its allies who have reservations on the deal to go ahead with it.//////Nepal's Maoists were on the defensive over their human rights record Tuesday after being linked to the abduction and murder of a local businessman.//////Twenty-five pilgrims have been killed in a bus crash in Nepal and around 20 more are missing presumed dead, police said Tuesday.//////Amelia Gabriel and her two children spent the night sleeping head-to-toe alongside 2,000 other frightened foreigners, a far cry from the life they hoped to find in South Africa's economic capital.//////A 13-year-old boy and a second Palestinian were killed in Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip yesterday, as talks continue in Egypt for a possible truce, medics and witnesses said.//////The threat of cyber-terrorism is growing and most countries are vulnerable to attacks that can shut down critical infrastructure, global experts told a conference here yesterday.//////A grand rally of Bangladeshi freedom fighters living in the USA will be held here on Sunday next.//////For his surrealistic painting titled ////// M.M.
