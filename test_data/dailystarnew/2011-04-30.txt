Ever since the sixteen year-old was shot by RAB personnel on the dubious charge that he was a criminal, he has had his left leg amputated and has had the further misfortune of seeing the police determined to implicate him in criminal cases. Limon's background suggests nothing that can remotely link him to any criminality. The police themselves have found no record of any earlier case against him. Recently, the RAB chief went public with his view that Limon was a victim of circumstances, meaning he was caught in 'crossfire'. That was something of a climb-down for RAB, but it was clearly not enough. Limon now faces persecution from the police, who have their cases against him ready.//////Nothing could be a greater tribute to the state of inter-religious relations in Bangladesh than that paid by Cardinal Tauran in Dhaka Wednesday.

Judicial supremacy is, admittedly, the hallmark of an orderly and just society, at least in matters relating to affairs of the state.//////POLITICIANS often make loaded remarks to convey what they have in mind without spelling it out explicitly.

Waterwhich scientists tell us always finds its own levelalso happens to be the great leveler. It is fundamental to our very survival. Availability of surface water is the most important means to attain food security. Even if we provide improved variety of seeds to the farmers, if there is no easy accessibility to surface water we will achieve little success in attaining food security. //////EXTREMELY poor women and girls throughout Bangladesh are surviving on the absolute minimum, facing multiple constraints to making their lives better in a way that might be meaningful and lasting.

This is unfortunate for no prime minister could have escaped criticism in handling a crisis of such proportions, and Kan is no exception. At this critical time, Kan needs support and not criticism. Unfortunately, politics in a democracy is a different ball game. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) heavyweight, Ozawa Ichiro, has issued a document, which indicates that many members of the ruling DPJ are still loyal to him and that they have joined the Ozawa bogey to criticise Kan and thus appease the frustrated voters.//////New Delhi: Lobsang Sangay, a Harvard-educated academic, has been elected prime minister of Tibet's government in exile, according to results released Wednesday.

Described by the Afghan government as a "disaster that should not have happened", the escape has made a mockery of the national security forces barely three months before Nato troops are due to hand over control of several parts of the country. Inside help is almost certainly to blame. According to a triumphant Taliban spokesman, insurgents on the outside spent five months excavating the tunnel before finally breaking into one of the cells late on Sunday night, using car-jacks to crack through the final layer of concrete. //////Days before a mass movement compelled him to relinquish power, General Hussein Muhammd Ershad approached the military establishment for support. He did not ask for such support in so many words, but it was obvious he could look forward to hanging on to authority if his base, the army, agreed to go along with him. It was something of a throwback to the final days of Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan in Pakistan. Battered and bruised by ceaseless resistance to his regime in both East and West Pakistan, Ayub in early 1969 wanted the army to help him declare a second round of martial law as a way of clinging on to power. The army did declare martial law, but not before informing the long serving dictator that a new spate of military rule ruled him out as its symbol. The new ruler was to be General Yahya Khan.////// Written by former Chief Justice and former Chief Adviser of the caretaker government Muhammad Habibur Rahman, it is a pioneering book on the importance and preservation of mother languages. //////Shohag Parvez, considered one of the most devoted among contemporary Bangladeshi painters, has a zeal for portraying the splendour of nature, serene environment, riverine life, cloudy skies and hilly areas.
