Not as a ritual but to take a vow to imbibe them. Our national consciousness was embodied by the language movement six decades ago. It then came into a crescendo of a glorified series of achievements through our distinctive cultural assertion, famous 21-point programme of Jukta Front in 1954, anti-Martial Law struggle, 11-point programme of students, 6-point struggle for autonomy in the late sixties, and finally the Liberation War leading to the birth of a free Bangladesh. //////It would not be an exaggeration to say that the entire nation is waiting with a feeling of apprehension about the likely outcome of 12 March.

It cost me only 10 bucks and was probably the best book investment I have ever made. It was a heart-warming account of how, against all odds and with lots of passion, Howard Schultz went on to make the biggest brew of his life -- Starbucks. //////Like any ism, capitalism is a social construct; capitalism is only a term for what capitalists tend to believe and do. Beyond a few fundamentals -- that it puts faith in markets as the best way to allocate resources, that it depends on private ownership of property, that it features mechanisms for accumulating capital to fund endeavours larger than individuals can undertake alone -- very little about it is set in stone. This is why we often hear phrases suggesting different styles of capitalism: capitalism with Chinese characteristics, for example, or Northern European social capitalism.

Language is the most powerful instrument of preserving and developing our tangible and intangible heritage. //////Every good election contributes something to folklore. Uttar Pradesh is the land of lore; and the turbulence of its politicians is matched only by the sardonic wit of its voters. The culture of the sons of Awadh has many dimensions, but a principal inheritance is the nuance of language, both written and verbal. Awadhis can turn a conversation into a duel of scalpels, interspersed with the stiletto stab that penetrates just enough to puncture an ego without hurting the flesh. Cut and thrust are an art form, not a Westerner's duel at high noon. The sophisticate leaves invisible scars; he does not kill. That would be vulgar. The poet prefers to die a thousand deaths rather than injure a feckless or faithless lover; he might be tempted to ambush a rival but he would never waylay.//////Sixty years ago, in 1952 , the Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in the then Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements -- emergence of self-rule consciousness in 1954 general election, student movement in 1962, 6-point movement, uprising in 1969, and finally the Liberation War in 1971. //////Language is the medium of culture.

There are about 6,000 languages in the world, including the many dialects. //////Stony Brook University researchers have devised a numerical model to help explain the linkage between earthquakes and the powerful forces that cause them, according to a research paper scheduled to be published in the journal Science on Feb. 17. Their findings hold implications for long-term forecasting of earthquakes//////Scientists are strongly speculating (backed by the 1995 Galileo Spacecraft mission's findings) that Europa, the smallest of the four Galilean satellites and the 6th closest moon of the planet Jupiter house a liquid ocean underneath its solid icy crust. That cosmic mission discovered that underneath the icy crust of Europa, lies salty ocean which is kept warm by tidally generated heat and volcanic activities. It is believed that the biggest of Europa's craters are surrounded by concentric rings and these rings are likely to be filled with ice. And there is a possibility that this outer crust of ice is approximately 100km thick where only the top 10km are frozen solid which ushers the great possibility of the existence of a global ocean in a liquid form and at least 62 miles deep beneath these icy crust. And chances are, wherever there is water, there will be life. But what kind of life it would be in Europa that is a matter of great research. But some ideas are already there. //////Nepal is looking to scale up its flagship household biogas programme, which has made forays into other developing countries in Asia and Africa. //////An ancient royal garden has come back into bloom in a way, as scientists have reconstructed what it would've looked like some 2,500 years ago in the kingdom of the biblical Judah.//////If carbon dioxide emissions don't begin to decline soon, the complex fabric of marine ecosystems will begin fraying and eventually unravel completely, two new studies conclude.//////Where in the world is all the water vapor?
