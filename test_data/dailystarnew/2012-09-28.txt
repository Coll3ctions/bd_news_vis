Yet the WB has not stated clearly where the government has misrepresented the bank's position. We are perplexed and concerned why such a rather stern tone has been taken by the WB giving the impression that the government must stay in line and observe all conditions. We think this is unfortunate considering that it has been only five days since a green signal was received on the troubled project. We are taking exception to the reprimanding line. //////We are saddened by the passing away of the veteran journalist Ataus Samad who, through his fearless reportage in times of the country's acute political crises, had brought in a journalistic trend marked by honesty, authenticity and above all, a vision. We express our deep condolence to the bereaved family.//////Bangladesh cricket is in a strange place now. The Tigers' winless exit from the ICC World Twenty20 should not be cause for outrage, neither can it be said that it was expected. If the emotions of a cricket-crazed nation can be pushed aside for a moment, the impression that emerges is that Bangladesh's World Twenty20 campaign has not really revealed anything new about the country's cricket. The old truths are still true -- there is still a talented core led by the irrepressible Shakib Al Hasan, the bowlers form the weak link and mental strength, evidenced by the mindless bowling of bouncers in the last group game against Pakistan, is still an issue. //////Sri Lanka beat New Zealand in a one over eliminator after the 40-over Super Eights contest was sensationally tied at the Pallekele Stadium on Thursday.//////No Australian Twenty20 team has been as aggressive in word or deed as the one about to face India in a critical Super Eights match at the World T20.

He said, You can't keep tourists more than one day by showing one particular attraction. We need to bring diversification in tourism with a blend of natural beauty, culture and heritage. The government has taken a significant approach to make Bangladesh one of the top 10 Asian tourist destinations, he added.//////Water logging is more harmful than natural flood. It is more destructive because it stays longer than flood. But unfortunately, we give more emphasis on flood control than water logging. The marginal farmers are mostly affected by water logging. //////It is natural to get irritated whenever insulted or provoked. It is also a constitutional right to protest such provocation. But the way I see protests are being conducted is not right. Of course religion comes first but I saw in The Daily Star that a police car was being vandalised by the protestors. The maker of the provocative film is far away from Bangladesh, but the police car that was destroyed was an asset of the state and the people. If the police had not come early, more damage or destruction would have happened. The government will use the taxpayers' money to replace the police car and repair other cases of damage. This is the money that could be used in other development works. My point here is, let opinion leaders ask people to adopt peaceful means of protest. The same message of anger can be communicated and received peacefully. There are so many means of protest which are equally effective. Condemn provocation but don't destroy national property. And not every foreigner in Bangladesh is the maker of the film. Some are development experts and we need them; others are tourists, they bring money to the economy; some are investors, they create jobs. I am an African student living here for 2 weeks but I made friends with people.//////Most students of public universities belong to middle class or lower middle class families. Their parents send them to the universities with the hope that one day they will complete their studies and take the responsibility of their family. But instead of studying, they get involved in dirty politics and political violence only for power and money.//////In Houston, Texas, USA, we were watching Meher Afroze Shawon, wife of late Humayun Ahmed, featuring on Tritio Matra on Channel i. We have seen Shawon acting in a number of dramas and cinemas in the past while staying in Dhaka.//////The article "Mutant butterflies in Fukushima: What's next?" written by Abdul Matin on September 25 in your pages is a scientific analysis of possible harms of nuclear accidents. The writer has given different examples of nuclear accidents around the world. Bangladesh has intended to produce electricity through nuclear power in Ruppur to meet its increasing demand. We hope the government will take all necessary precautions to contain the damage from possible accidents. Japan has struggled a lot and is still suffering after its nuclear disaster originated from an 8.9 magnitude earthquake followed by tsunami. We have to proceed more carefully and carry out several experiments before we go ahead with the nuclear project.//////The person or persons in the USA who made the film dishonouring the holy Prophet of Islam Muhammad (sm) committed an unforgivable crime. Their criminal act has created a terrible situation in the world. Scores of people have been killed due to their criminal acts.//////Last week I went to the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital as one of my family members was admitted there. I was really shocked to see the pathetic condition of the hospital. This famous hospital, which is one of the biggest hospitals in South Asia, is beset with mismanagement due to indifference of the hospital authorities. Each ward commodates 70 to 90 patients and is supervised by only one or two doctors. Though the Emergency department promises 24 hour service to the patients, actually this is not possible because of lack of doctors. Almost no washroom is in usable condition. Even bribery is rampant inside the wards. Doctors are seen giving their visiting cards to the patients to meet them later at their private chambers. The most pathetic thing is doctors' rude behaviour with the patients. It seems that doctors are just like machines. They have no human feeling or sympathy for the patients. Maybe this is a common picture in all public hospitals. Perhaps those who are not affluent go to public hospitals. Sensing their weakness, the authorities concerned maltreat them. The government should take initiatives to improve the condition and services of the public hospitals.//////Needless to say, Dhaka is an unplanned city with worst traffic jams. Probably it would take many more decades for our present and future governments to focus more on the development of infrastructure to deal with traffic mismanagement. To ease traffic congestion, authorities build intersections mostly in VIP areas overlooking others. For example, there is no intersection at Khilkhet area on the airport road.//////Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday accused the West of pursuing policies that had destabilised states in the Arab world and now risked creating chaos in Syria.//////Pakistan appears headed for another political crisis as the ruling PPP has decided not to exclude the clause of presidential immunity from a letter to be sent to Swiss government on reopening graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari despite the Supreme Court's objection to it. //////A caretaker set-up to oversee Pakistan's next general election will be installed only when the current government's term ends on 18 March next year and consultations with political parties on the interim administration will be held at an appropriate time, Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said yesterday.//////Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda insisted Wednesday there could be no compromise with China on the ownership of a disputed island chain drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.//////The Palestinian leader has asked the UN to grant Palestinians "non-member observer state" by the end of the year.//////Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has accused US President Barack Obama of seeking to exploit the Arab Spring revolutions for political gain.

Anyone in his/her right mind would immediately fall in love with this place. Naturally, the conqueror did too and thus founded a city by the sea and named it after himself. //////Ahsan Habib Nasim has made a name for himself by performing in a variety of plays based on short stories by Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam. He has worked in adaptations of Tagore's stories: Konkal and Shesh Puroshkar.

When it spreads its wings, in the literal sense it's your home in the sky. Everything that happens on the ground gets airborne and travels with you. Corruption, sloppiness, inefficiency and partisan bickering are aviation fuel to an airline gone way out of line. Every time it flies is a miracle. //////Aung San Suu Kyi is currently in the middle of a triumphant visit to the US.//////Once, I told Samad Bhai should I outlive him, I would write his epitaph. What I had in mind was not quite a memorial plaque inscribed with praise on his tomb that an epitaph is, rather what I actually wanted to convey to him was my sincere desire to write an obituary to a journalist par excellence. Though a man given to piety, and he would have been a staunch believer in destiny, he somehow nodded at my idea.//////Rabies is not a new problem. In fact, evidence of rabies dates back about 4,000 years to Babylonia. It was reported in Europe in the Middle Ages. The first record of rabies in North America was in Virginia in the mid-1700s. But it was not until late 19th century that Louis Pasteur and his assistant Emile Roux developed the first rabies vaccine. Rabies is a zoonotic disease, which means it can spread from animal to human. The virus can attach itself to the brain and nervous system and is fatal, especially without prompt treatment, unless the victim has been vaccinated against the disease.//////Spending time at a World Economic Forum event -- with members of its communities of shapers, leaders and social entrepreneurs -- always forces me to think about the effectiveness of "doing good" from first principles.//////Nowadays information technology defines how we communicate and do business.
