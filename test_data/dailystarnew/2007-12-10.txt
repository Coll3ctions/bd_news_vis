Meeting the basic needs of the retarded should have nothing to do with being an affluent country or a poor one. The approach to the retarded is essentially a matter of attitude, ethics and culture. Even in developing countries, with resource constraints, the mentally and physically handicapped children can be taken care of by private and public sectors joining hands. There is scope to garner endowment funds for them. By imparting special skills many of them can be turned into reasonably productive citizens.//////MIKHAIL Gorbachev's rise and role in the former Soviet Union had always been suspect.

for some serious rethinking on our part insofar as tackling natural disaster is concerned. There is, of course, no way in which we can prevent nature from venting its fury. Throughout the ages Bangladesh has been battered by floods, cyclones, tidal surges and the like, and the consequence of it all has always been a trail of devastation left behind. People have died, while those who survived were left homeless and destitute. It is today a tale of all comprehensive misery. With each day that passes, the body count from the disaster gets to be higher. As far as crops are concerned, they have simply been destroyed.//////The geographical range of the distribution of gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) has dwindled within the natural range countries Pakistan, Bhutan, India and Nepal but more significantly in Bangladesh. Wild populations can only be found now in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. Only few pairs in the wild are reported to be surviving in the Padma-Jamuna river system, Bangladesh. Gharials have been listed as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List 2007 and have again been identified as the most threatened crocodilian species in the world in a recent resolution of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) and World Conservation Union (IUCN) (October 2007).

The Election Commission (EC) is making all the arrangements for this election. Meanwhile, it is important to know the background of the participating political leaders. It is also essential to know their stand for the development of Bangladesh. //////Cyclone Sidr has killed over 450,000 livestock and poultries, wiping out a major source of income for millions of affected families. Bangladeshi people and their friends all over the world have responded to assist the affected people in restoring their lives and livelihood. Even the poor people have come forward with whatever little they have to help the cyclone-affected families. Most impressive was a gesture from some VGF card holders in non-affected areas who volunteered to give up their cards as their contribution to cyclone relief activities. This is the Bangladeshi spirit that we are all so proud of and has been upheld again.//////The paltry numbers of trees that can be spotted bear a queer burden upon them, to say the least! As they are being subjected to a natural decay owing to the biological grounds, they are unfortunately falling victims to the burden inflicted by the humans as well. The point gets clear if one extends the antenna of one's observation- see how the lone and withered trees in the urban towns are burdened by the sign boards that they are forced to carry on their weary frames. There are, interestingly, the signboards of the coaching centres of a variety of tantalising and at times ridiculous names: sure success, never do fail, nexus, peerless the list would rather go on and on! //////On the eve of every national and religious festival, I observe your literature page editor takes the initiative to publish special supplement for the readers which is full of the best short stories and a bag of pleasures. //////We read from newspaper that some people in the culture ministry had made an agreement with a French museum under which some of our ancient pieces would be sent to France for demonstration. That museum will demonstrate our valuable assets to the French people. //////Jamshaid Taher of Banani, Dhaka wants the camps closed and the Biharis dispersed (Star Dec.1). This expression of intolerance and disregard for the needs of fellow humans is appalling. Is their plight not bad enough as it is without attacking the unfortunate community? They would find work easily, he says. No one would discriminate against them, would they? They would be welcomed by the majority community. I do not think so.//////The present caretaker government seems to be sincere to hold a unique election to be held in 2008. The Election Commission is also struggling to make it possible by taking different steps. We the general people are happy to observe it. In my view, a free and fair electoral process is mainly dependent on two points;//////This caretaker government is only busy with cracking down on the politicians. It is a good thing but they are not concerned with the development of the country. We are suffering from power failure and price hike of commodities. If electricity is not available for 4-5 hours a day, how is it possible for us to keep pace with the other countries of the world?//////We all hate war criminals. After 36 years of independence those criminals are still living in our country. We could do nothing against them. A few days ago all the concerned people of Bangladesh burst into anger by the remarks of Jamaat leaders. Because we all know about their heinous work in our liberation war. All the political parties and leaders (except a few) demanded trial of war criminals. But the caretaker govt did not accept that. Their opinion is that "they are here to organise a free and fair election. They cannot take extra burden". They also said it is the task of a political govt. In my point of view it is true. But one think the CTG can do. They can organise a mass vote whether the people of Bangladesh want the trial of war criminals or not. People will decide about those criminals. Which will be very helpful for a political govt to take a decision about the war criminals. The CTG is doing so many things for the welfare of Bangladesh. We hope that the CTG will do this also for our collective good.//////The present non-political government is very passionately considering extension of retirement age limit of the government service holders from 57 to 62 years. It is indeed a very encouraging and pragmatic consideration of the present government in the light of the increased life expectancy of the people due to availability of better healthcare facilities. I personally welcome the decision but in view of limited job opportunities in public sectors, I would like to take the privilege of expressing my reservation without any prejudice on raising the retirement age to 62 years for the following reasons://////As an avid watcher of Bangladeshi politics, as well as its people's well-being, I have a question about relief fund.//////English is the most important in the world for its international acceptability. Our generation has now realised the necessity of learning English and are trying to improve their skills in the language. Their realisation is taken as a business opportunity by some so called 'English Language Teaching Centres. This is unfortunate, to say the least.//////The cyclone has severely unsettled the lives of millions; as a nation we need to stand behind this calamity and show our fraternity. People of all walks should really come forward and help to mitigate the giant catastrophe that had swept the nation and thousands have died and/or have been maimed. Let us ignite our moral fabric, grasp the reality of the cyclone affected people and do whatever in our capacity to help our brothers and sister leading tormented, desperate and hungry lives. Let us assuage them for losing their near and dear ones. //////An alliance of Pakistani opposition parties was set to meet in the eastern city of Lahore yesterday and was expected to make a decision on whether to boycott January 8 polls, party officials said. //////In a fresh threat against going ahead with the Indo-US nuclear deal, the CPI (M) has asked the government to end the talks with IAEA by this month or be prepared for mid-term polls to Lok Sabha.//////Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has denied that al-Qaeda leaders were present in the country.//////Afghan and British troops are winning the battle to retake the Taliban-held town of Musa Qala, officials said yesterday, warning the rebels to surrender after deadly gunbattles near the southern stronghold. //////At least 16 Tamil Tiger rebels were killed in fresh clashes with government forces in northern Sri Lanka at the weekend, the defence ministry said yesterday. //////In the face of strong BJP demand, the Election Commission on Sunday issued a notice to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on her "merchants of death" remarks in relation to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi even as it deferred a decision on his response to its notice. //////A delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Tehran on Sunday for a new round of talks on the controversial Iranian nuclear programme, the official IRNA news agency reported. //////The US intelligence community came under fire over the weekend on two fronts, as conservatives criticized a recent CIA report on Iran's nuclear program and the Justice Department announced a probe into the agency's destruction of videotapes showing interrogations of terror suspects. //////The second ever EU-Africa summit approved on Sunday an agreement aimed at forging a new relationship of equals between the two continents, a European source said. //////The ongoing climate talks in Bali have turned into a game of villains and victims.//////Russia successfully launched a military satellite yesterday from the Baikonur cosmodrome, part of a drive to modernise the armed forces' space infrastructure, Russian news agencies reported. //////TROILUS and Cressida are two minor characters in the epic //////.

Mark Ruffalo is also in the line-up.//////BANGLADESH is widely known as a flood or natural disaster prone country for many years. In recent times many European countries have also experienced floods. Once United States was free from natural calamities, but not now. US people are also afraid with possible revisit of hurricane Katrina. Why is the world facing such calamities? Environmental depletion and global warming are identified as the prime reasons for world wide natural disasters. United States did not take these factors into consideration until recently, though they are one of the accused for these causes. However, though delayed, people all over the world are now concerned about the environmental depletion and global warming. But the irony is that prime victims of these two disasters are nations which are not really responsible for the creation of these disasters.//////GULISTAN Square falls in the route I take for my evening walk.

The floating vendors were evicted to restore order to the city. //////IN the aftermath of the devastating Cyclone Sidr, millions of people are now homeless, surviving without food, clothes, drinking water, medicine, etc. Many of them are living under the open sky or tents or shelter centers. //////EVERY time I step before a podium, someone will inevitably raise his hand, and say: "So, Mr. Hosseini, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Afghanistan?" The first thing I do is remind the audience that I am a novelist. If I have any expertise, it is in the inner lives of the characters I have created in my books -- which makes me spectacularly underqualified to answer a question of such magnitude. But even as I say these words -- and they are true -- I know that I am stalling because I do not have a ready answer. So I do give an answer, but one that in the end amounts to the verbal version of a shrug.//////The place appears to be a grazing field for cattle, a picnic spot for locals or a yakking and lurking site for hoodlums and vagabonds.//////It was 6 in the morning.
