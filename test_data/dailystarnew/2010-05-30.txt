The very fact that since February this year the Maoist guerrillas have been making violent raids on targets in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, in the process causing the deaths of scores of people, says a whole lot about the horrific and mindless lengths to which extremism can go in staging such orgies of destruction. It also points to the desperate measures they appear to be adopting in their war against the establishment. This desperation becomes clear from the fact that the Maoists are now beginning to target civilians, a clear change in strategy considering that earlier the focus was on soldiers and policemen. Obviously, with the Indian government going in for a direct, no-holds-barred assault on Maoist strongholds, the rebels find themselves in a beleaguered position. It is a back-to-the-wall approach that they now have decided on. The consequences have been horrendous.//////HERE is a specific, tell-tale instance of corruption and malpractice glaring through any smock-screen of generalisation and deserving to be dealt with in public interest.

Police quoted local people as saying that Subal Sarker came in touch with a live electric ware in front of their house at around 11:30pm. As Shefali tried to save her son, he was also electrocuted and killed on the spot.//////As the summer is in, the power situation has taken a turn for the worse. In other words, we are facing a multitude of problems because of frequent disruption of power. The students are suffering as they cannot read at night. The miseries of patients in different hospitals are increasing manifold, as the electricity plays hide and seek. Production in different factories are being hampered because of power cuts.//////May 25 was the birth anniversary of our National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Throughout his life, he fought for humanity. His works are our national assets. He believed in equality and universal brotherhood. He was above all kinds of narrowness. //////Advertising to children has become big business in recent years. All around the world, children spend a lot of time watching television. Such prolonged hours of TV expose them to various advertisements, convincing them to buy. As kids are becoming more powerful consumers, marketers are targeting them more bluntly. Advertisers are letting their imagination run wild using catchy jingles, dances and cartoons, portraying mysterious worlds, implying false reality. Young children have difficulty distinguishing between advertisements and reality, and may not understand that ads are there with pure intention to sell something for profit. Additionally, many parents feel guilty about buying products for their child but they worry that by constantly saying no they will increase their child's depression. Parents, meanwhile, in their earnestness to give the best to their children may go a bit overboard with their generosity and give in to their endless demands. //////The perpetuation of the dynasty rules and the culture of obeying two leaders of the Mujib & Zia families have become the norm in our politics. Bangabandhu & Zia, by dedicating their lives to the freedom struggle, earned the right to lead the country. But the same cannot be said about the later day Sheikhs and Zias. As long as the ruling and opposition parties retain their outdated, feudal organisational structures, where sycophancy, nepotism, and ad-holism rule, a revival of their past glory will be a far cry. So can Joy and Tarique as leaders help? //////I was deeply shocked to read in almost all the newspapers that the main opposition party called hartal for 27 June. I did not understand why the opposition party called the hartal as they are mostly responsible for all the current problems of our country. //////I was driving through New Market intersection a few days ago in a hurry to pick my son from a Dhanmondi school at a piercing hot mid-noon. Suddenly, a traffic policeman signalled me to stop my car. Though I was in an extreme hurry, yet I did not ignore the dictum of the law enforcer. He showed me a paper with the allegation of violating traffic rules a few days ago. I defied the allegation as my car on the said date was in a garage for necessary repair for a few days. The traffic man instantly started a noisy fracas with me.//////A local English daily reported on the matter on 22nd. May. It was a disgusting and deplorable criminal act. More so is the impotence of the law enforcing units of Police and Rab who in this matter seems to be 'sucking their thumbs', although police had apprehended a few persons! Are the law enforcers a party to the crime, given their indifference to it? Can they not take any initiative? //////On 19 May Khaleda Zia called a dawn to dusk hartal for 27 June for what she called, electricity, gas and water for Dhakaites. In her public speech, she told the nation that the present government has done nothing during the last one year or so. The supply of electricity, water and gas that people are enjoying at present are her own legacy. This government has not added any unit of those utilities.//////The setting up of atomic power station has become the crying need as the people of Bangladesh are facing many problems over the years due to the shortage of power generation. Power generation has become the key index for the continuous development of a nation. For example, we can cite China where the production of power generation is doubling every year and the country has already secured the position of the 2nd largest economy after USA. Needless to say, power generation ensures the rapid growth of production and hence takes the pivotal role to boost the GDP of the country. According to statistics, Bangladesh is a country having only 3000 to 3500 MW power generation but our demand is more than 5000 MW. The deficit of power generation is around 3,000MW.There is no controversy that power sector is the driving force for the continuous development of a country, especially for a least developed country like Bangladesh. Considering the projected demand, it is advisable for the govt to step onwards for setting up the atomic power station. The recent visit of foreign minister Dr. Dipu Moni to Russia will open a new horizon of bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and Russia. As a least developed country, Bangladesh would be benefited in different ways. Making the frame-work deal with Russia, setting up of an atomic power station would be possible and that would contribute to lessening load shedding as well as meeting the projected demand of the country.//////In an article entitled Religion and women published in The Daily Star on May 18, 2101,columnist Mr. Chaklader Mahboob-ul Alam commented, As far as the dress code is concerned, the Holy Quran requires both men and women to dress and behave modestly. Nowhere does it ask women to wear burkha (full veils). //////As a matter of fact, we all know about the ill-effects of cigarette smoking and tobacco use but a smoker really is helpless against this menacing addiction. When he has to, he 'will' smoke. The 'Will' is associated with the short-term effects. Let us see the quick-effects of a cigarette smoke that makes a man physically and mentally dependent on it.//////A child is compared to a bud in which the potentiality of sweet smell is concealed. Usually a bud needs a favourable environment to be bloomed well; like a child needs a good family environment and care to be developed morally. Here, moral development means learning of good manners or behaviour and formation of character immaculately.//////Every day of the week, except Friday, thousands of patients, their attendants, medical students and on-duty physicians and other professionals and visitors who have business at the hospital and the medical college have to cross the Mirpur road on foot or by car to enter the hospital and college premises from early morning to evening. The Mirpur road in front of the hospital is always filled up with all types of speeding motor vehicles, especially the big buses which never slow down to allow the pedestrians and physicians' cars to enter the hospital and college. Every entrant to the hospital has to risk his/her life and fear damage of the vehicle in their attempts to enter. Considering the arrogance of the bus drivers and reckless driving of cars, people and physicians cross the road and enter the hospital at great risk of being run over. There is a traffic signal but all bus and car drivers disregard it. //////The two major political parties are fighting out their last ideological war with records of respective political history. We are innocent watchers of the events since early 50's. The independence movements which began back in 1952 and ended in 1971 all belong to the ordinary " lungi clad" people and not to any Generals; rather the war was against the Generals, internally grown or externally directed. The leadership came from the politicians and not from any Generals. Unfortunately, the Generals have succeeded in taking away the democratic rights of the people time and again during the last 39 years.//////The newly elected UZ Chairmen are fighting for their basic rights, vis a vis the existing role of the concerned MP in their constituency.//////The subject is a difficult one; I bought the book and had to abandon it only after reading seven pages. How am I going to travel through time machine to the future? Prof. Hawking talked extensively about God particle which is beyond our imagination. How small is small and I am already scratching my head to figure out just a billion-trillion-trillionth of a centimetre. //////Khulna PDB power station has two power plant units, one having 110MW capacity and the other one having a capacity of 60MW both fired by HFO. Though old they are supposed to generate altogether about 140mw power. But the reality is that these two power station units are constantly remaining out of generation in the name of maintenance or overhauling or due to this reason or that. On the other hand, the nearby rental power company has been producing 40MW of rental power by diesel in Khulna since 2008 under a three-year rental contract. The cost of this rental power is high. With this costly power what are we actually doing? It is simply mixed up with the low cost power generated from the other fuel sources, dispatched and consumed in a fashion business as usual. What specific purpose is being served with this costly power? This is nothing but luxury in the name of supplying electricity. Though the Khulna PDB power plant units remain out of operation but expenditures are regularly being incurred against purchase of spares, service etc. etc. making it a double loss. We could avoid purchasing high cost rental power if Khulna PDB power plant units could be made operative, thus saving a huge amount of money and supplying more power. The business of rental power plant is ensured while Khulna PDB power plant units are shut.//////China came under intensified pressure from South Korea and Japan yesterday to join global efforts to punish North Korea over the sinking of a South Korean warship in March.//////Japan's Social Democratic Party (SDP) yesterday maintained its threat to leave Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's coalition government, in a row over a US military base on Okinawa.//////Thailand's premier said yesterday it would be hard to hold elections this year as he lifted a curfew imposed across about one third of the country in the wake of deadly anti-government protests.//////The Israeli military has partially opened a motorway that runs through the occupied West Bank to Palestinian drivers, to comply with a ruling by Israel's Supreme Court.//////Chief Treasury Secretary David Laws has apologised after it emerged he had been claiming MPs' expenses to rent rooms in homes owned by his partner.//////Police in Indian Kashmir fired teargas yesterday to disperse thousands of villagers protesting against what they said was the staged killing of three Muslims by the security forces.//////Indian rescue workers recovered more bodies yesterday in their gruesome search for victims of a train wreck blamed on Maoist saboteurs, with fears that the final death toll could exceed 150.//////The US Army is studying options for a 'unilateral strike' in Pakistan, in case a successful terror strike on America is traced back to the semi-autonomous tribal regions of that country, top military officials have disclosed.//////Former child star Gary Coleman, who shot to fame on TV sitcom "Different Strokes" but suffered personal troubles as an adult, died in a Utah hospital on Friday, after suffering a brain haemorrhage. He was 42. Coleman gained stardom as the sharp-talking Arnold Jackson, adopted son of a wealthy New Yorker, in the hit sitcom that aired on US television from 1978 to 1986 and in syndication around the world.
