Whether it is the collapsed and tilted structures at Begunbari causing deaths and injuries of depressed folks or the scores of horrendous deaths in the tragic all-engulfing fire at Nimtoli or the multiple casualties consequent to the landslide in Cox's Bazar, the deliberate flouting of safety rules and precautions is all too apparent.//////OBAMA acknowledged young people, who thrust him into the White House, as much as he could in his victory speech in Chicago's Grant Park after winning the presidential election: "It was the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep."//////IT is axiomatic that politics in Bangladesh does not centre around peoples' aspirations any longer.

Even on an auction site, we will find thousands of Shakespeare-related items: books, films, T-shirts, bottle openers, coffee mugs, ties, caps, coat pins, buttons, chocolates, toffees and much more.//////It was an arduous Albertan winter. The temperatures fell to - 45 degree centigrade. Edmonton was the coldest place on the planet for a week or two. The winds moaned incessantly and snow drifts piled up high in our front lawn. Nature appeared insensate. I ventured out for grocery essentials on one of those sub-zero days and thought I was in the midst of an Alistair Maclean's novel, namely Ice Station Zebra! In times such as this, a human being asks one self... Where am I? Where have I been? and... Where am I going?''. Then one evening there were sparks in the dark night sky. I saw flashes of the aurora borealis that only manifests itself in the arctic zone. It was eerie-the skies lit up like a fireball and then the spirit of the great North appeared to speak: Patience, my child...life unfolds in its own patterns, of which you are only a small part...Embrace the North and it will embrace you. //////I, The immortal, wander through the night//////In some sad and lonely flight.//////I thirst for blood and//////crave to feel pain.//////My lights have fled and//////my spirit is dead.//////The previous week was distinctly special for millions of people living with end stage liver disease (like liver cirrhosis or liver cancer) in Bangladesh.

This is according to researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in collaboration with colleagues at University of Cape Town, South Africa, who conducted the first randomised controlled trial of patient-nominated treatment-supporters providing partial DOT in resource-limited settings. The researchers found that mortality rates were lower among DOT patients than among self-monitored antiretroviral therapy (ART).

In fact, most of life is habitual. It is estimated that out of every 11,000 signals we receive from our senses, our brain only knowingly processes 40!//////HISTORY of modern world agrees that in spite of the continuous barrage of advices/support/aid from the developed countries, Third World countries maintain a volatile socio-political environment. Military coup or multidimensional political somersault is the order of the day. It is quite unfortunate for the people and also for the leadership that they are yet to figure out how and why it happens, let alone when it takes place. It is extra conducive in a country where the leadership is encircled by associates with minimum sense of patriotism and is totally consumed in enjoying power. To avoid such intermittent political fiasco we need to learn how to detect it. Only then we would probably be wise enough to prevent it.//////IN his Cairo speech on June 5th last year, President Obama had raised a great deal of hope and expectations among Muslims that his administration would make sincere attempts to address their concerns. Instead he has sent more troops to Afghanistan and has decided to win the war against terror, primarily militarily. In Iraq, there was an election that was heralded to be a major step towards establishing democracy. But three months have gone by and still a government has not been formed and though conflicts, deaths and suicide bombings have declined, Iraq is far from being a safe country. President Obama seems to be following the script of his predecessor.//////Saudi Arabia has conducted tests to stand down its air defences to allow Israeli warplanes to use its airspace in any bombing raid on Iran's nuclear facilities, The Times of London reported June 12.//////About 450 U.S. and NATO forces are working to bring the 3,300 members and 48 aircraft of the Afghan army air corps up to par as part of a long-term effort to give the country a self-sufficient air force, the Air Force general leading the transition team said June 10.//////THE cover painting by Jamal Ahmed depicts the title of //////TWO unforgettable stories, Impulse and Temptation, are put into the book ////// and the result is a two-in-one pulsing romance.

With clear-eyed vision and a sure pen Roberts nails her characters and settings with awesome precision, drawing readers into a vividly rendered world of family centered warmth and sheer magic.//////ON 11 August 2008, Peter Clark writes in a Guardian obituary that as a poet, author, and politician, Mahmoud Darwish 'did as much as anyone to forge a Palestinian national consciousness.' While Clark's comment is undebatable, it is also true that Darwish's poetry transcends its national boundary by reflecting on universal humane values through the mirror of the Palestinian experience. It is one of the major reasons why Darwish now is a great name in world literature. Memory for Forgetfulness is his exquisitely written prose-memoir. Ibrahim Muhawi's adept translation brings out the delicacy of the piece. It is based on Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 that was aimed at wiping out the PLO's base from southern Lebanon. The fact seems most startling when one reads the memoir containing evocative details of Beirut under siege. Darwish, however, lifts up the sufferings of the invasion to an aesthetic level through his musings on reality, belonging, history, resistance and the role of art involving these. The entire book is an extended internal monologue (the poet's thoughts in his mind) about which Robyn Creswell writes in Harper Magazine's January 2009 issue: //////
