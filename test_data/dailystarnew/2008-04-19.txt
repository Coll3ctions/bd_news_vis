We only wish the government had acted thus sooner. But now that the extremist elements opposed to the policy have drawn back from the threats they made earlier about opposing the policy, we feel the government should keep up the pressure on them and see that they are no more able to disrupt social order in the name of religion. In the last few weeks, motivated controversy has been generated around the provisions of the proposed women policy. We note that despite reassurances by the government that none of the provisions goes against Koranic principles, a section of the religious right has continued to misguide the public.//////HOW an intrinsic improvement in the projected output and availability of rice can start impacting positively on the staple market has been proven by the firm predic-tions of bumper boro crop. The private sector has begun releasing their old stocks. The wholesale prices are al-ready tapering off even though any marked fall is yet to be reflected in the retail market. //////SOME intellectuals from the western world have at times suggested that democracy; democratic norms and democratic behaviour are not always synonymous with Islam and Muslim countries. A few of these analysts have also pointed out that real democracy and associated freedom have really been enjoyed by Muslims more in non-Muslim environment rather than in typical Muslim states. In this context, they have referred to democratic rights enjoyed by Muslims within United States, in United Kingdom, in India, in Europe and even in Israel. They have compared such enjoyment of rights and the ability to seek functional legal redress with what has been happening in Pakistan and in almost all the Muslim countries in the Arab world and in Africa.//////ELECTION results in Nepal should not come as a surprise to India when it first persists with kingship and then with a non-performing political party. New Delhi's failure is in not gauging the popular mood. This should be a point of concern because the span of thinking between India and Nepal turns out to be not a few months, but many years. People were changing and New Delhi was stuck in its wishful thinking of saving kingship and its old ally Nepal Congress. The king is as good as gone.//////THERE is no doubt that the recent sub-prime mortgage meltdown has led to a collective loss of faith in the way the United States financial system works. When the turmoil in the sub-prime market spread to other parts of the securities market it created a huge liquidity crisis, forcing the central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to pump billions of dollars into the system to create liquidity. Yet, in spite of these efforts, confidence in the credit market has remained shaky. Financial institutions are still hesitant to extend new credits. //////Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said on Friday that his charges must post a score close to 300 runs to have any chance in the fifth and final one-day international against Pakistan at the Karachi National Stadium.//////When Bangladesh beat India and South Africa in the 2007 World Cup, there was reason to believe they would finally shrug off their minnows tag and begin to challenge the top teams more consistently.

Consultants are working on eighteen thematic areas. Of them, resource mobilisation from domestic and foreign sources could be a vital means of poverty reduction at a level set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Some flaws of the previous PRSP, particularly problems in its implementation, were identified in a meeting of the Planning Commission. In this article, I would like to discuss some points related to resource mobilisation that are important for drafting a realistic PRSP. //////THE passenger train service named Moitree Express has started, creating amity between the people of Bangladesh and India. This has to be recognised as a really good piece of work by Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav, the Indian railway minister, and also by the CTG and the army chief. Let us hope that Bengali New Year, 1415, will usher in a new era of better understanding and cooperation among the people of Bangladesh and India. We have to admit that, despite differences of opinions on some issues, the common people of both the countries want to come closer, particularly after our independence in 1971.//////In spite of getting diverse interests of commissioning power plant at Kaptai in Chittagong Hill Tracts, its ecological consequences were many-fold. Firstly, the population pressure increased in the vicinity of the Kaptai lake for swallowing most of the best valley-bottom land and consequently there was an acute shortage of suitable cultivable land. Secondly, competition for jhum land increased so greatly that the fallow cycle has been reduced and the natural system of soil conservation became fragile. Thirdly, destruction of the forest exposed the ground surface to the rainwater and the traditional slash and burn techniques resulted in incessant soil loss, depletion of plant nutrient, competition from weeds and yield decline. Such widespread land degradation manifests itself in a declining rural income, fuel wood shortage and silting up of the Kaptai reservoir. The changes have also greatly increased the fire hazard, environmental pollution, wild life depletion, scarcity of safe drinking water. Therefore, the long-term sustainability of hill land agriculture in the watershed area of Kaptai lake is obviously threatened in terms of productivity and ecology. //////Water, a critical component of the ecological cycles, is theoretically a renewable resource, made continually available -- through the water cycle -- by the constant flow of solar energy to the earth, which evaporates water from the ocean and redistributes it back to the globe as precipitation. As the world population increased, the water demand continued to rise and the per capita availability of freshwater continued to decrease. About 70 percent of the earth's surface is covered with water, but only 2.53 percent of that is freshwater, the rest being saline. Again, most of this freshwater is locked in ice and snow in glaciers and ice sheets. Only 0.26 percent of all freshwater stock (about 90,000 cubic km of water in absolute terms) is globally available to us for use -- from rivers, lakes, soil moisture and groundwater; apparently the quantity is not so small for a world population of 6.4 billion. In reality, however, we (humankind) are living at the mercy of the water cycle, which acts as the bloodstream of the biosphere. //////You are an ass and the rest of your life you will remain one, Rocky Mirza said, condescendingly blowing a ring of smoke at him, We live only once, mate, my philosophy is live like there is no tomorrow, have fun.

Apart from the 22-year-old war that's scarred the country, and cricket, one hardly reads about the lives in the teardrop-shaped Indian Ocean island. When I visited Lanka this spring, the hotel that I checked into was GFH, short for Galle Face Hotel. The name 'Galle Face' was chosen by the English colonialists and attributed to the gate of the Portuguese colonialists' Santa Cruz fortress in Colombo. The hotel faced the commercially important port of Galle on the south of Old Ceylon.//////; Tk 100.00//////This little magazine has been around for a long time--as recollected in a anecdotal, semi-brooding piece on////// 20 years by Tapan Barua titled //////.'

Initially he fulfilled a desire to see into the depths of space by using telescopes but the ultimate desire has been to launch himself into space. This required understanding of the laws governing the motions of bodies around the planets. Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton worked out the mathematical laws that govern the motion of bodies in orbit round the heavenly bodies. The laws of motion and the basic notion of differential calculus opened the door to the technology of artificial earth satellites. //////THE Arab Summit, which was held on the 29th and 30th of March, 2008 in Damascus, Syria, faced serious regional challenges. This annual summit is usually held in a different Arab capital. The current Damascus Summit was defined by the failure to attend by Saudi Arabian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Lebanese leaders. These four countries made a tragic and strategic mistake by failing to attend the summit. They will become more vulnerable to Arab national voices, which will perceive them as collaborators with the United States.//////POLITICAL Corruption is in fact a matter of debate all over the world. In Bangladesh, the debate and discussion on political corruption is not anything new. I have had knowledge about this term since my boyhood during the Pakistan period. However, in view of the promulgation of emergency as per article 141A of the constitution on 11 January 2007 and various reform actions taken since then in Bangladesh, the topic has become a talk of the country and the people want a positive end to all kinds of corruption. //////To both its critics and backers, globalisation is a phenomenon to be seriously studied and debated. And when leading experts like Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Jagdish Bhagwati, representing the two sides of the debate respectively, are brought together in a single volume, one can expect a lively and state-of-the-art discourse on the subject. A recently published high profile book offers exactly just that a reasoned and sophisticated update on the debate about the benefits, risks and future prospects of globalisation. //////The Hundred Secret Senses makes one comprehend the hidden resources within each one of us. We all have senses that are many in number, buried deep within our psyche, that we are often not aware of. We all experience gut feelings; we are able to sense that which is not obvious to our ordinary senses.//////All teaching is a matter of involvement. Ask anyone who has been a teacher, especially in a school. There is the likelihood of your coming by a recapitulation of a sense of values, those which in these more uncertain times seem to be falling by the wayside. It just so happens that Angela Robinson is one individual who has held fast to those values even as they constantly appear to be slipping from our grasp. And she does so through informing the young she has been teaching in Bangladesh for a good number of years now that the classroom is but a window to the world beyond it. And that world is of course an appreciation of the truths and the beliefs we have always held dear, for the simple reason that they have underpinned our hold on politics, on history, indeed on the diversity of culture that has kept society in a state of stability for generations on end.//////The Language Movement of 1952 was the first step towards the realisation of our dream --- an independent Bangladesh where citizens would be free to pursue their unique identity and consolidate their rich literary and enlightened heritage.//////
