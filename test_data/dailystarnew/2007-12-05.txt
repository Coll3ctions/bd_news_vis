Except for some minorities, most of them from top leadership to grassroots level activists involve themselves in politics for their own vested interest. Eighty percent people of this country were being exploited under the pre- 1/11 corrupt political system. After 1/11 a new era of hope has ushered in. But this new situation has brought misery for most of the political activists. Sensing their political demise, they are desperately trying to save their supreme leaders, most of who are corrupt, so that they can preserve their old corrupt political system. For this reason they are showing blind loyalty and support to their supreme leaders. Nation's interests come last to these political activists. But they should by now realise that their days of exploiting this nation has come to an end under a sham democracy. No matter how hard they try they cannot turn back the clock before 1/11 and deceive this nation any more. //////Hum Namaj parega, Roza Rakhe ga, hum Musalman hai etc. This was the Urdu reply of my father who was a 60 years old, influential village man with no knowledge of Urdu at all. He had to prove that he was a Muslim to a squad of Pakistani soldiers who were led to our home by a group of Razakars. One of the members of Razakars was my father's brother-in-law.

He was complaining about the pain and I still feel that if I could found that soldier I would have killed him. Even if I face him today, probably I will hurt him if I can't kill him.//////The year 2007 will remain as a nightmare for every Bangladeshi, may be for many generations.
