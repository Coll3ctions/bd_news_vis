It made a turnaround when the Awami League unveiled its election manifesto Friday. More than a list of promises to lure voters, it is an economic document for development with clearly set goals, some achievable and some quite lofty, to hold the party accountable if it is elected to power. The problem with the manifesto, however, is elsewhere -- in the question of implementation and financing.//////Residents of the capital are witnessing significant changes in this year's election campaign with no graffiti and poster on city walls and no decorated campaign gate on roads, thanks to the new electoral code of conduct.//////Economists have termed the Awami League's projection of time-bound economic plans in its electoral manifesto a good sign and said it would hold the party accountable to the people.//////The Election Commission (EC) has cleared the candidature of BNP nominee Dr Enamul Haque in Rajshahi-1 constituency ignoring the electoral laws that clearly disqualify him from contesting the upcoming parliamentary election. //////The nation pays tribute to the martyred intellectuals today amid increasing demand for trial of war criminals who systematically killed prominent Bangladeshi intellectuals and professionals at the fag end of the Liberation War on this day in 1971.//////A total of 9,976 candidates have filed applications for contesting the January 22 Upazila Parishad elections in 481 upazilas of 64 districts across the country. //////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia yesterday urged people to vote for the BNP-led four-party alliance to foil the conspiracy to make the country a 'failed and subservient' state.//////Awami League (AL) will not formulate any anti-Islamic law if voted to power since the party is committed to restoring the image of Islam as a religion of peace and equality, said AL presidium member Matia Chowdhury yesterday. //////Jatiya Party (JP) Chairman HM Ershad yesterday said the grand alliance would secure a 'landslide victory' in the upcoming parliamentary election as people want a change in real sense.//////Sammilito Sangskritik Jote, a platform of cultural organisations, yesterday launched its four-day-long Victory Day celebrations across the country with a vow to boycott war criminals in the upcoming national elections. //////Chief Adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed sits with top bureaucrats at the Secretariat today to give them instructions on holding the ninth parliamentary election in a free, fair and peaceful manner.//////The Workers Party of Bangladesh (WPB) yesterday unveiled its 21-point election manifesto with commitments of building a prosperous Bangladesh-- free from corruption, terrorism and militancy.//////The Election Commission (EC) could not finalise the list of contesting candidates with their election symbols as some political alliances are yet to withdraw their additional candidatures from around 60 parliamentary constituencies. //////India yesterday piled new pressure on Pakistan to crack down on Islamic militants in the wake of the Mumbai attacks, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh citing a "moral duty" to combat terrorism.//////A planet-wide forum on climate change yesterday hammered out a work schedule designed to end in a treaty for expunging the darkening threat to mankind from greenhouse gases.//////For some, a marathon UN conference that ended here on Friday cleared essential ground for building a new treaty on global warming, while others saw it as a disappointment or an outright flop.//////Suspected Taliban militants yesterday attacked a Nato supply depot in northwest Pakistan while five people were killed in roadside bomb blast in the same region rocked by violence.//////IT is that time of year when we remember some of the bravest sons and daughters of the soil who made the supreme sacrifice in order to ensure the liberation of Bangladesh. In December 1971, only days away from freedom, the Bengali nation lost a whole group of its intellectuals to the murderous onslaught of the Pakistan occupation army and its local collaborators, the Razakars, al-Badr and al-Shams. Between 12 and 14 December, perhaps even later, our doctors, academics, civil servants and journalists were picked up by these forces and then systematically picked off. Their sinister objective was clear: an emerging Bangladesh was to be left maimed so that it could not realise the full meaning of liberty. The occupation army and its collaborators were clearly on the run, but along the way they sought to inflict as much damage as they could on this freedom-loving nation.//////AMID a mix-up of world economic crisis descending into recession and the climate change challenge intensifying, it is not perhaps surprising that the UN summit on climate change has ended in Poznan, Poland more on a rhetorical rather than substantive note. The global leaders have merely iterated a commitment to keep on negotiating to reach a consensus on a Green deal in the next UN climate change summit in Copenhagen due in December, 2009.//////SHEIKH Hasina announced the AL's election manifesto in a televised session on Friday. The nation was eagerly waiting to see what AL had to say on the future courses of action, especially, taking into consideration the domestic and international socio-political and economic crisis. We shall try to pick up few things from the submission.//////ELECTIONS are days away. The political parties are ready with their pledges to the people. With the army having prepared perhaps the least faulty voters list in the history of Bangladesh and the Election Commission determined to hold a free and fair election, the people are raring to send members to parliament who would not conduct public affairs for private gain. //////IF the Assembly elections in four states and Delhi were "semi-finals" which determine the shape of the next Lok Sabha, then the Bharatiya Janata Party is in trouble.

Hailed as a "genius" and "world-class" last Sunday after his two goals illuminated Goodison Park, the Aston Villa manager today claimed Young belongs in the same company as Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. For someone not prone to hyperbole, it was a quite a compliment.//////Didier Drogba insists he has not considered leaving Chelsea in January, although admits he will speak to the club about his future next summer.//////Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said the growing influence of players means that the breaking of Premier League rules by 'tapping-up' players and even managers now happens regularly.//////Ronaldo, the now portly three times FIFA Player of the Year, has been branded as a "phenomenal traitor" by Rio de Janeiro sports daily Lance after he joined Brazilian club Corinthians rather than their great rivals Flamengo, with whom he had been training for the past four months.//////Mexico's Pachuca came from behind to sink six-time African champions Al Ahly of Egypt 4-2 in the quarterfinals of the Club World Cup in Tokyo on Saturday.//////Ex-Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has said he learned enough from his five years under Arsene Wenger at Premier League side Arsenal to consider a career in coaching.//////The January transfer window, the last opportunity for players to join English clubs this season, will in fact end on February 2, the Football Association (FA) announced here Friday.//////England's experienced batsman Paul Collingwood reckons his unfinished partnership with Andrew Strauss on Saturday will serve as an example for his teammates who just have to "change their mindset" when playing in sub-continental conditions.//////Matthew Hayden is ready to combat the threat of Dale Steyn, the South Africa fast bowler, during Wednesday's first Test at the WACA.

But be careful, I am not asking you to be dishonest. All I am saying is do not air your honest views too honestly. Recently, for the greater interest of the organisation I proposed some holistic changes that would have had a synergetic effect. Quite rational, quite logical, you would have said. However, I completely misjudged the power play that goes with organisational changes. The result is a taxing stalemate that is sapping away energy and commitment. //////Global stock markets came under heavy pressure Friday as fears mounted of a collapse of the Big Three US automakers but Wall Street rebounded after the White House vowed to come to Detroit's rescue.//////Ericsson, one of the leading telecom equipment providers, has tied up with Telekom Malaysia International Bangladesh (TMIB) to provide spare parts management services (SPMS) to AKTEL'S network.//////Oil prices rebound while aluminium and copper futures hit fresh multi-year lows in a week of volatile trading for commodities.//////China is facing "worse-than-expected" risks of an economic downturn, as the global recession looms large, the country's top economic planner said on Friday.//////Islamic banks have largely dodged the financial crisis, thanks to their low exposure to toxic assets like sub-prime loans, and may rebound faster than other sectors once the global outlook strengthens.//////FinanceAsia, a Hong Kong based financial publishing company, has awarded Citi as Best Cash Management Bank in Asia for 2008. //////Signs that the recession will be long and severe mounted Friday with a fresh round of bad economic news, including plunging US sales from manufacturers to stores and falling prices that raise fears of dangerous deflation.//////Vauxhall, owned by crisis-hit American carmaker General Motors, said Saturday it would offer staff in Britain sabbaticals of up to nine months in a bid to cut costs amid the global economic downturn.//////Canada has agreed to issue some 2.8 billion dollars in aid to the country's auto sector once the United States agrees on a rescue plan for its carmakers, authorities said Friday.//////The leaders of China, Japan and South Korea pledged Saturday to drum up funding to spare Asia the worst of the global financial crisis, vowing the region would help revive the global economy.//////Federal regulators reached a deal Friday with the Wall Street financier accused of a $50 billion swindle to freeze his company's assets and appoint a receiver to manage the firm's financial affairs.

No doubt, he is concerned about the future but I would not expect him to express that explicitly in public. The next day headlines would have been like Sunil thinks Bangla has got no future? Well, that would have created a huge controversy and so-called pundits could have spoiled his nostalgic visit of Bangladeshi ancestral home.

We risk our ear-drums and even our limbs, as we go along with our daily lives, unaware of these dangers around us.

For the uninitiated, Emo is actually short for emotional and essentially a punk style. Those who do not conform to any particular norms and are known for their own trends are seen sporting this hairstyle. The most typical characteristic of Emo hairstyle is the attitude it reflects. Asymmetrical bangs, partially covering the face and often dyed in bright colours are what make Emo hairstyle absolutely distinct.//////On December 14, 1971, when the members of the Al-Badr abducted Professor Munier Chowdhury, his son Asif Munier Tanmoy was only a child of four.
