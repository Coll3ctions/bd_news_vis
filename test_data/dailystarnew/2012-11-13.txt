But a lot of improvement has been made in recent years in the plastic sector and its use in agriculture is increasing very rapidly throughout the world. Bangladesh is no exception in this regard.

In protected agriculture, vegetables and small fruit are grown giving some kind of protection from adverse weather like rainfall, temperature, wind, diseases, insects, water logging, etc. all of which seriously affect crop yield. In this system, crops are shaded by plastic sheets put on top of structure made of bamboo or galvanized iron pipes. Summer tomato is grown commercially in this system.
