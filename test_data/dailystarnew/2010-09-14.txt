In that scam one Pakistani gambler has been arrested in the hotel suit of Pakistan team with a huge amount of money. It is presumed that entire deal of match fixing was supposed to be done through that gambler. Pakistan Premier Yousuf Raja Zilani vowed to bring to book the culprits of match fixing who tarnished the image of Pakistan. Match fixing is not new in the cricket world. Previous Indian Cricket Captain Mohammed Azharuddin had been implicated into the scam of match fixing. There had been voice of denouncement and condemnation from around the cricket world against this heinous act. People in India spitted at the portraits of the cricket captain in public places where those were available. Azaharuddin had been banned from cricket for life by a ruling of Indian Cricket Board once this scam had been proved. The Daily Star in its 30th August issue in the sports page quoted some foreign journalists as saying Pakistani cricket players are after money, women and food whenever they visit England. The Pakistan cricket captain in his immediate reaction told one cannot be implicated or prosecuted into a case without proof. It has been estimated at least 7 Pakistani cricketers will be implicated into the case of match fixing.

Discovered as early as early as 1998, this strange force, though invisible, makes up a staggering 72 per cent of our known Universe! Of the rest, 24 per cent is made up of dark matter, which is also invisible but can be detected by its gravitational pull. And as for the rest of the Universe, a measly 4 per cent is actually made up of the stuff that makes up people, planets, stars and everything that are made up of atoms. Scientists strongly believe that the pressure exerted by this dark energy is exactly what that pushes the Universe to expand at an ever-increasing rate. And a recent finding by an international team of astronomers, with the aid of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and European Space Agencies Very Large Telescope, concludes that, it is very likely that our Universe will expand forever. Led by Prof. Eric Jullo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, the study findings, the details of which have been published in the August 20 issue of the journal Science, also conclude that not only the Universe will not stop growing but also eventually it would become a dead and cold wasteland with a temperature that is scientifically referred as absolute zero. //////Carbon-rich organic molecules, which serve as the building blocks of life, may be present on Mars after all, say scientists - challenging a widely-held notion of the Red Planet as barren.//////Researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have devised a new technique -- using a sheet of carbon just one atom thick -- to visualize the structure of molecules.

A dental surgeon upset by the Japanese attack on the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor proposed attaching tiny incendiary bombs to bats. The creatures were meant to set thousands of small blazes across Japan's cities as they flew to roost beneath building roofs. But the idea floundered after receiving the green light from President Roosevelt. Many uncooperative bats simply dropped like rocks or flew away, despite the U.S. Army using as many as 6,000 of the mammals in their experiments. The U.S. Navy spent $2 million after taking over the effort, before finally giving up. Still, the bat bombs did manage to set fire to a simulated Japanese village, a U.S. Army hangar and a general's car. Nowadays, Pentagon scientists study how bat flight mechanics could inspire future aircraft designs and spy robots.//////Zero net is the modern strategy to regulate pollution by controlling the use of energy in constructions...//////
