Although the reports are encouraging, one can not but worry about the ban on manpower recruitment imposed by the Middle East countries -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Libya and UAE. Manpower export is one of the most significant foreign currency earning sectors of our country. It contributes to our national economy in a large measure by increasing foreign exchange reserve, per capita income and employment opportunities. Any barrier to our manpower export to Middle East will have a negative impact on our national economy. Diplomatic and high profile discussions should be held to address this issue. Allegations of irregularities and malpractice raised by manpower importing countries should be taken into account in order to check the same strictly. All necessary measures for regaining the mutual trust and good relation with the host countries should be initiated soon by the authorities concerned to bring back normalcy and save the valuable income generating sector of the country. //////Our leaders play terrible games with our lives creating political issues. Ridiculously, their issues repeat themselves pushing behind the country's development. Bangladesh is a potential country. It has bright future. But everything is going out of our grip due to political instability. The ruling party and the opposition confront each other over every issue. The opposition calls hartal, the ruling party challenges to resist it in the field. Who are the victims of this game? It is only the ordinary people. The ruling party should ensure rule of law, solve gas and power crisis to draw the attention of the foreign investors. And politicians should ensure congenial political atmosphere and settle all the problems by holding discussions. Otherwise, this unending fight will certainly lead our country to destruction.//////I was attracted by the charming photo of Hatirjheel published in The Daily Star a few days back. The project has been partially completed. I could not believe my eyes when I saw its panoramic view and I thought it to be an artist's layout drawing. But then I decided to take a walk around the jheel. It seemed as if it was a place in a developed country. It can be a tourist spot of immense value. The different varieties of trees that are planted around will be an added beauty to the site if properly taken care of. And, in addition to this, I suggest the authorities should add some water sports such as -- water skinning, boating, oaring, etc. Government can also construct a Dhaka clock tower like that of the Thames clock tower. Last but not the least, the illegal BGMEA building is not worth looking at.//////This is not for a debate or putting counter arguments against the article by Mr Mamunur Reza published in The Daily Star on 9 January 2013 titled 'In response to 'Maritime boundary with India: Tough days ahead' by M. Inamul Haque; but for expressing thanks and regards to him to bring this matter to public concern by responding to my article. Yes, I am not a student of law, but I do not believe any legal matter should have limited access to those who have legal backgrounds only. I express full respect to the world famous experts like Dr. Joseph R. Curray of USA, Dr. Hermann Kudrass of Germany and Dr. Lindsay Parson of UK. I express full respect to Mr Mamunur Reza as well, who has studied Law of the Sea at National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK and University of New Hampshire, USA; but, I shall never agree with the Map 2 he has produced in his article. The other Map 3 in his article is not of much relevance, and Map 1 is the map published in my article in The Daily Star on 14 November 2009.//////We, the members of the young generation did not fight for our country but we respect our Liberation War and always want to do something for our country.

When our university authorities have finally decided to build a Liberation War memorial on our campus, some of our teachers have opposed it and they are trying to get support from the local people. They are saying it will hurt the feelings of the people of this holy city. But we, the general students, want this monument. It will inspire us as well as our next generation. We believe people of Sylhet are with us.//////The recent fall of temperature in Bangladesh, especially in the North Bengal, is a fallout of climate change.
