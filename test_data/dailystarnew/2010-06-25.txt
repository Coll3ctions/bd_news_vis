We are convinced that if and when the plan is implemented, citizens will derive unadulterated advantage from it. This we say with a caveat, though. The minister of state for housing and public works, who was vocal about dealing sternly with land grabbers only the other day, now appears to have taken a step backward. The government, he now says, will adopt a soft stance regarding DAP in certain instances. He also informs us that the authorities might have to accept violations of land-related laws where necessary. Such statements on the part of a functionary of the state cannot but cause grave worries, especially when we are all faced with the reality of how Dhaka has been losing its appeal and indeed its character over the years because of the exploitative way in which it has been 'developed'. //////ADMISSION trade by Bangladesh Chhatra Leagur (BCL) activists has gone to such an extent that now different factions of this student wing are at each other's throat in claiming their stakes from the college administration in different districts. They have roughed up college principals in Pabna and Bogra and pressured the college administration at the Hatia Government College Noakhali to have students of their choice admitted into those colleges flouting all laws and rules. In consequence, the process of admission in those colleges has been put on hold to the utter dismay of the admission-seekers. And the outraged teachers in one of those colleges have gone on an indefinite strike protesting the assault on the principal of that institution. //////Superb free-kicks by Keisuke Honda and Yasuhito Endo inspired Japan to an exhilarating 3-1 win over Denmark that sends them into the last 16 of a World Cup for the first time on foreign soil.//////Twenty years ago, England struggled through the first round of the World Cup, just as they have done in South Africa.//////Paraguay topped Group F at the World Cup on Thursday after a drab 0-0 draw with surprise packets New Zealand.//////The journalist girlfriend of Spain's goalkeeper was accused of breaching professional ethics Wednesday after she reported on live television from behind the net ahead of the country's World Cup loss to Switzerland.//////Vuvuzelas aren't just loud but they can spread germs too, a South African clinic warned Thursday, urging fans to keep their lips on their own horns to avoid catching colds.//////You won't find any American or South Korean flags in any rooftop of Dhaka.

incident of Nimtoli has opened everybody's eye and at the same time raised our level of fear and concern. My younger sister is living at Mirpur-2, Dhaka. Although this is a small housing, this is going to be an industrial housing-cum residential area very soon if immediate measure is not taken. At the very entrance of this housing, there is a welding factory which belongs to a very powerful man, just after few yards there is a make-shift generator plant and a few yards after there is a garment's factory belonging to a very high level police officer. The factory is located along with the residential flats. It was learnt that incidents of small fire also happened in that building. People complained several times to the City Corporation but as one is a very powerful man and another one is a very high level police officer, the City Corporation did not take any action. Apart from these, also there are other factories in this housing, such as water bottling plant, CNG garage etc.//////As soccer fever grips the entire world, Bangladesh also joins in the bandwagon with great enthusiasm. Sale of flags, jerseys, wristbands and other accessories corresponding to different nations participating in the football extravaganza is at its peak all over the country. Thus the vendors also seem to be making some extra bucks cashing in on people's passion for the world event. We see that the skyline of Dhaka city undergoes a total change with all the colourful flags. Even amid the clashes between the fans of Brazil and Argentina, we still see Brazilian and Argentine flags fluttering from the same pole on the same rooftop which again symbolizes our centuries old spirit of peaceful coexistence. Everyone, starting from the driver to the top executive, is upbeat about the upcoming soccer carnival. //////Contract for Sylhet 90 M.W. combined cycle power plant (2nd.

At least the task has begun and as usual it was too little too late, and at the cost of over a hundred innocent lives was this harsh lesson learned! Shame on Rajuk for not doing it earlier! They have clearly failed in their duties, and must share at least part of the guilt for the building accidents.//////A Tk. 38,000 crore budget for development of Bangladesh has been proposed for 2010-11.

He said this while responding to the allegation made by a BNP lawmaker that the government had shut the newspaper. "The deputy commissioner, be it of Sherpur or Dhaka district, is the authority to give declaration of newspapers. The DC can cancel the publication in case of any of violation of the law," said the information minister. At one stage, during his prolonged speech, he resorted to personal attack against an opposition MP. The Speaker intervened, saying, "Honourable minister, your point is: the deputy commissioner has closed the Amar Desh and the court shut the Channel One". "Yes, Honourable speaker," said the minister adding the present government believed in free flow of information. //////When the BSF thugs routinely kill Bangladeshis in the border regions, they do not discriminate whether their victims in Bangladesh belong to the Awami League, BNP, Jatiya Party or Jamaat. However, in condemning BSF's regular violations of human rights and its killings of Bangladeshis, Bangladeshi political parties are sharply divided. Some Bangladeshi political parties raise a hue and cry now and then to register their protests against BSF's murderous actions. But, unfortunately, a very prominent Bangladeshi political party remains dead silent with regard to BSF's wrongdoings. //////Is the safari park concept in our country viable? The Dulahazra "Safari" Park is merely a zoo and is in shabby condition. If the proposed "safari park" is planned on the same intended lines, then the government has to think again before embarking on it. //////It is highly appreciable that recently in our cities manually driven rickshaw is being replaced by battery driven auto-rickshaw. It is smoke free and is not noisy. So it is pollution free. Moreover, pulling rickshaw manually is inhuman and it causes traffic jam. Introducing auto-rickshaw will play an important role in keeping the environment pollution free. //////Illiteracy has become a major issue in Bangladesh. Along with Bangladesh, many other countries throughout the world are not being developed due to lack of education. Education is a system of training and instruction designed to give knowledge and develop skills. Education helps a person become more aware and get better technical knowledge. Educated people are able to contribute to the country and help it to develop. They are aware of their rights, responsibilities and the importance of education. They are capable of fulfilling their basic needs and maintaining their health, hygiene and safety rules. The uneducated people's lives are not the same. They don't realize their potential and lead a poor life. As they don't know the importance of education, many uneducated people make their children work to have a better life. Many women are also not getting their right to education and several are suffering due to early marriage. Education is a right and a basic need for everyone.//////We are shell shocked to see the atrocities perpetrated by Israeli commandos on the Turkish cargo ship which came to Gaza to supply much needed relief. The raid is reported to have claimed lives of 10 civilian aid workers. Israeli blockade in Gaza has left the impoverished region in the lurch. What staggers us to say is that when any occurrence takes place in the Palestinian terrain, condemnations come thick and fast. But any concrete action against the defaulters fly in the face of reality. It has emboldened the defiant Israeli regime to carry out this type of disproportionate attacks on the plea of self-defence. //////I am writing with reference to letter: "Re-designing rickshaw" by Sikander Ahmed (June 4).//////Infrastructures and buildings are gift of modern civilization. Buildings have given shelter, a workplace. But it turns to a matter of great sorrow when this gift of civilization becomes a killer! We have faced this worst situation.//////The last few days were catastrophic. The shockwaves of Begunbari collapse, Nimtoli conflagration have jolted the nation in terabytes. There goes a saying, disasters sink nations not because of the poverty of the poor, but because of the poverty of the minds. The harrowing tale of the two catastrophic events once again redefines the poverty of our collective psyche. The clarion call now urges a nationwide awareness. Home of millions, this bustling city has structures clustered in concentrated fashion that makes it more vulnerable to earthquake. But Begungari collapse was not an aftermath of an earthquake. Rather the collapses were virtually invited. Ignorant of future, we flouted the rules to build structures in slapdash manner. Building code exists; however, we the very independent people, don't want to follow it anyway. We got to help Rajuk by following building codes. Situated in Old Dhaka, the dilapidated and rickety buildings should be brought under special vigil. Demolition or reinforcement is the option we have. Apart from that, we don't have a well organized disaster management system for emergency. Unfortunately, our management is limited to calling in of the Army since independence. On the other hand, the fire service system needs development throughout the country. Inadequate water hoses and ladders, absence of modern masks and fire hydrants makes our fire fighting team a mere spectator at the time of crisis. Moreover, capacity building is direly needed to combat the future disasters. As time marches off, our enthusiasm wanes off and plans don't march forward until disaster strikes again. We, the whole nation, face a mammoth task to mobilize ourselves to grapple with future disasters. We are the resilient nation that withstood Sidr, cyclone, floods. So, be it. Let's not be greedy but considerate for a future that we shall face together.//////President Barack Obama on Wednesday placed the flagging Afghan war effort in the hands of Iraq hero General David Petraeus, after firing US commander Stanley McChrystal for speaking out of turn.//////Members of political parties contesting Myanmar's first elections in two decades will be banned from marching, waving flags and chanting to garner support, under rules announced Wednesday.//////The foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan yesterday ended their talks in Islamabad, which will firm up the agenda for the meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries next month.//////Sri Lanka will ban visits by the United Nations panel investigating alleged human rights abuses in the final months of the island's civil war, a senior minister said yesterday.//////American and Russian leaders once arrived at Cold War summits ready to swap fierce rhetorical grillings.//////Five Americans have each been sentenced to 10 years in jail by a court in Pakistan after being found guilty of terrorism charges, prosecutors say.//////The two-hour-long foreign secretary-level talks, which took place at the Pakistan Foreign Office here, included a mind reader among the officials taking part in the deliberations.//////Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik has sensationally revealed that the government has come to know where and when the conspiracy to assassinate former Prime Benazir Bhutto was hatched.//////A Pakistani court has issued notices to President Asif Ali Zardari's parents in connection with a case registered by anti-corruption agency the National Accountability Bureau.//////An explosion in a commercial area of Sri Lanka's capital yesterday wounded nine people, police said, adding that Tamil rebels were not responsible.//////Australia's ruling Labor Party has taken a huge gamble by unseating the prime minister months before elections, but is banking on a boost in polls from new leader Julia Gillard, analysts say.//////President Barack Obama's job performance rating has dropped to the lowest level of his presidency as Americans grow less confident in his leadership, according to an opinion poll published on Wednesday.//////Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak promised more goods will enter the Gaza Strip after Israel's decision to ease its blockade of the Palestinian enclave, the US State Department said on Wednesday.//////A high-speed train passing through a Spanish railway station has hit a group of young people crossing the tracks, killing at least 12 people.//////President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev will seek to kick start trade and investment yesterday to complement a political reset between the former Cold War foes.//////Jaago, claimed to be the first Bangladeshi film based entirely on football, received six honours at the Film Award Bangla 2010.

Cambridge professor Nicholas Boyle writes in his book 2014 - How to survive the next world crisis that the year 2014 is going to set the tone for rest of this century. Nation states will cede place to global governance, and what will make or break the future of the world is going to depend on how American leaders react to the emerging crisis.//////THE voters in the Chittagong City Corporation election gave the mayor a red card, ending his sixteen-year rule, and a yellow card to the grand alliance government. You may think differently, but an election reflects the voters' mood. Postmortems and analyses of this verdict will be useful if the grand alliance takes lessons and acts accordingly. The result is a verdict against non-performance and empty rhetoric.//////FORMER president, H M Ershad, put forward some of his thoughts on the issue of future stewardship of his party (JP) in this column on June 15. By all means, this has been an encouraging move on the part of the JP leader. This could be even a turning point and a catalyst for all other political entities, large or small. //////It is strange that elections in selected primary schools were held on June 15 when annual students' union elections in universities and colleges have been in abeyance since 1991.
