Today the shipping minister, also the transport big-wig, wants tolls and extortion to be legalised to stop rampant corruption in the transport sector. Half the prime minister's time is spent in warning various ministers, members of parliament, government officials and party men to behave, all to no avail.

Are we supposed to listen in awe their wise words?//////This report was published on 12th February in most local dailies, of the inhuman torture inflicted on a Bangladeshi woman by the brutal Indian BSF personnel.

So, by definition their main function in the JS is to frame laws. One is, therefore, hardly surprised when last Thursday February 16, 2012 the lawmakers of the ruling Awami League (AL) in a motion resolved that those who are out to obstruct the trial of war criminals should be punished by the government. To this end, they passed a motion in the JS so that the resolution thus adopted may pave the way for enactment of a law. //////The Indian Supreme Court's judgment in the 2G-spectrum case cancelling all the 122 mobile telephony licences issued in 2008 is a slap in the face of the United Progressive Alliance government. The licences were the end-product of an illegitimate process begun in the early 2000s which, the Court held, violates the public interest and "Constitutional principles."//////The ugly spectre of war criminals in our community is creeping its way back onto the national agenda. Efforts to hold some of the perpetrators of war crimes in 1971 accountable continue today, raising the questions: is it ever too late to pay for a crime? Is justice delayed justice denied?//////The Daily Star's 19-point wish list published in its edition dated 6th January, in line with the election pledge of the Awami League (AL) Government reflects the hopes and aspirations, not of the AL but also of the nation as a whole.
