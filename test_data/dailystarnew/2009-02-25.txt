So, the only job of an MP is to look after the interests of the populace. But the field realities are quite different from their assigned job descriptions. We find that the public representatives are more interested in cars, jeeps, land plots and other perks. //////I am a resident of Shantinagar/Nayapaltan locality of Dhaka city. For over a month or more, we have been experiencing the worst kind of water quality supplied by Dhaka WASA; the stench and sewer-like smell make it impossible to drink and all kinds of boiling or filtering would fail to get rid of the stench.
