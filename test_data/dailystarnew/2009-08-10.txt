It is certainly a matter of appreciation that in recent years countries and governments around the world have grown increasingly conscious of and sensitive to the rights of indigenous people; and in fact there have been conditions where governments have tried making amends through tendering formal apologies about injustices committed against indigenous communities in the past. It is only proper that at a time when global social awareness has focused on addressing the ills that have kept some communities in a straitjacket, governments and societies should come forth spontaneously to convince indigenous people that they too have access to the opportunities that others are privy too.//////CHILDREN continue to suffer, even die and yet the company responsible for manufacturing the toxic drug still remains outside the purview of the law.

They are of all sizes and all ages. I am sure most of us are familiar with Oscar winning movie 'Slumdog Millionaire', where the cruel array of the begging industry is exposed. The deliberate chopping of the limbs and feet to make it a medium of earning money, I tell you what, isn't at all nonsense though the veracity of the sense may differ to some extent in our country. Yes it's all but true; the next big industry in Bangladesh will be the begging industry. It attracts a substantial amount of people because it's comparatively easy to sit there and beg in the shade instead of sweating your brow and doing something decent. I've once heard that the monthly incomes of 'profound' beggars are equal to income of one regular rickshaw-puller. Many have adopted this as a regular profession, rather than something to be done at extreme circumstances. Isn't this just ludicrous enough. While Dhaka city gets crammed up day by day, it has become equally difficult to stand there for a while without getting haunted by these menacing beggars. The other day I saw street urchins circumscribing a foreigner and obliging her to grant something more even though she gave them enough money! Due to the irregular development between our big cities, it's the capital which people prefer to come to looking for a job and consequently getting thrown into this fraudulent profession. //////When commenting on this year's results of Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations, the education minister told that the relentless effort by the students and hard labour of the teachers and guardians paved the way for such good results. He also told that the government wanted to reach the goal of making hundred percent pass rate and ensure quality education. //////Efforts to achieve Bangladesh's macroeconomic goals have been problematic mostly due to corruption within the government. The privatisation of public sector industries has proceeded at a slow pace--due in part to worker unrest in affected industries--although on June 30, 2002, the government took a bold step as it closed down the Adamjee Jute Mills, the country's largest and most costly state-owned enterprise. The government also has proven unable to resist demands for wage hikes in government-owned industries. Access to capital is impeded. State-owned banks, which control about three-fourths of deposits and loans, carry classified loan burdens of about 50%.//////We are astonished to see that the construction of an extension from the Farmgate footbridge to a privately owned market is going on. We are confused if it is being constructed at private level or by the government. Those having experience of this area know well, how busy the farmgate overbridge is. Thus bridge connects three important points of as many as five extremely busy roads. The above extension would only increase the rush, creating severe congestion and other hazards. Definitely the extension would help the business of the private market. We do not know if this market would at all pay the government for this additional business. Even if the market pays, we do not know to what extent it would compensate the increased trouble caused to the passers-by. We do not understand who in the government suddenly became so kind to a private market and what made him to favour a market by ignoring the interest of the millions who use this bridge.//////The Bangladesh born former British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Mr. Anwar Choudhury arrived in Dhaka on a three-day visit. Some BNP supporters namely Shacheton Nagorik Shomaj and Anti-Repression Student Group staged a protest rally at the airport. The leaders of the protesting supporters of the BNP demanded among others, arrest of this British high profile diplomat. His offences, according to the protesters, are his support to the 1/11 changeover, destruction of democracy in Bangladesh etc.//////A letter published on your daily dated August 3, 2009 by Mr. Sohel Ahmed with the title: "Road network" caught my attention. In the letter, the writer blatantly blamed the present government for not doing anything in erasing the present traffic problems of Dhaka city. //////The AL has been in power for only six months. If anyone is to blame for the progress made by India towards building Tipaimukh project it is BNP - Jamaat since they were in power for five years prior to the caretaker government. It is intriguing why they did not raise the issue as effectively as they do now. Is it because their policy is to appease India when in power and to oppose it when out of power? //////Blind obedience to the AL and its leader may bring apparent good to the party but may not be good for the whole country. So, statesmanship is needed in selecting leaders. //////Awami league is one of the biggest and oldest political parties in our political arena. This year it has celebrated 60th birth anniversary. Since its inception it has proven itself to be a party of mass people. From the historic Language Movement to our Liberation War or to the overthrow of autocratic rulers to establish democracy, its contribution is matchless. It has been vocal for change. //////Eve-teasing is a euphemism especially used in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India for public sexual harassment. It's a form of sexual aggression that ranges in severity from obscene gestures, indecent body language, sexually suggestive comments, inadvertent brushing in public places, catcalls, to outright groping.//////I fully support the views about DST of Dr Q.M. Ohidul Alam which was published on August 2, 2009.//////His dream was to educate people around Santos and every part of Bangladesh. If he was alive, this tragic clash would have pained him so much. //////The need for proactive attitude is very important in every aspect of personal as well as national life. If you look at half a glass of water, you can say that half the glass is full, which is true. At the same time, you can also say half the glass is empty, which is also true. Obviously, the first attitude is admirable in the sense that it shows proactive attitude. Elderly members of families often demoralize children saying, You are a hopeless guy. I cannot see any hope for you. You are a blockhead. By showing such attitude and by behaving in such a negative way with our children, we, in fact, destroy the little confidence they have and spoil their potential. On the other hand, expressions such as You can win, you will be successful, you are as talented as others will not only encourage them but also bring significant improvements in their performance. //////After rigging the election and brutalising non-violent protestors, Iranian dictator Ahmadinejad is now murdering political prisoners held during the mass uprising after the election. Fears are mounting over the safety of hundreds of political prisoners in Tehran's Guantanamo Evian prison following the death of two political prisoners. Mohsen Rouholamini and Amir Javadifar died in Evian prison due to beatings by the security forces. //////The out-going German Ambassador in his farewell meeting with the press before his departure admitted that the EU and Europe, on principle, do not support any emergency rule anywhere in the world but in the case of Bangladesh they supported emergency at that moment to save lives and properties and democracy here. This statement clearly supports the view that the security of lives and properties in Bangladesh were in danger before 1/11 and democracy was at stake. We believe, the situation was more serious than he explained just to maintain the norms of diplomatic gesture as a diplomat.//////In a bid to ensure that Islamabad doesn't call off or delay its military offensive in Waziristan following the reported death of Baitullah Mehsud, the United States has told Pakistan to continue fighting the war on terror in the tribal areas.//////The Taliban have no trust in the Western-backed Afghan government and no immediate incentive to accept calls for talks which could stop their insurgency dragging on for decades, analysts say.//////A top official with Iran's Revolutionary Guards called on Sunday for the main opposition leaders to be put on trial for trying to orchestrate a "velvet coup" after the disputed presidential election.//////Iran's police chief acknowledged yesterday that protesters detained in postelection unrest were abused in custody but said the deaths of prisoners were caused by illness, not torture.//////As investigators try to piece together how a small plane and tourist helicopter came to enter each other's airspace over the Hudson River on a clear summer day, divers were to search for clues to the crash believed to have claimed nine lives.//////The British government was warned Sunday by a body of lawmakers that regularly using information gained through torture could be legally construed as complicity.//////Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged yesterday that he will never evict Jewish settlers from occupied Palestinian land as Israel did in 2005 in the Gaza Strip.//////The mayor of Nagasaki called for a global ban on nuclear arms at a ceremony marking the 64th anniversary of the devastating US attack on the Japanese city that killed about 74,000 people.//////Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik has challenged the Taliban to prove that their top leaders-Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud - are still alive.//////The possibility of the Tamil Tigers regrouping again has been 'thwarted completely' with the arrest of their new leader Kumaran Pathmanathan, Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said in remarks published yesterday.//////Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi faces fresh uncertainty this week over her internationally condemned trial, with her US co-defendant's illness threatening to further delay the verdict.//////Separatist rebels shot dead four more policemen and threatened to execute other hostages unless Pakistan withdraws troops and releases detainees in southwestern Baluchistan, police said Sunday.//////A Kazakh journalist was Saturday sentenced to three years in prison for divulging state secrets in a ruling slammed by media rights groups who accuse the Central Asian state of stifling press freedom, Interfax reported.//////Eight gunmen were killed in clashes in northern Yemen between Zaidi Shia rebels and Sunni hardliners amid continuing tension between the rebels and the authorities, local sources said on Saturday.//////Experts from 65 nations gather in Indonesia yesterday to assess progress in the battle against HIV/AIDS amid concern only a quarter of those in need in Asia and the Pacific are getting treatment.//////Anisuzzaman is one of the well-known printmakers of our country.
