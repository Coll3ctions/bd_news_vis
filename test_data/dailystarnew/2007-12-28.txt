The increases in wage rates in manufacturing, agriculture, fishery and construction sectors which are slender compared with those of FY06 kept below the rates of consumer price inflation of 7.2 percent in FY07. In other words, real income fell as purchasing power eroded. //////The resignation of Education and Culture Adviser Ayub Quadri in the face of an outcry over the theft of two archaeological artefacts from ZIA is surely a welcome response to public sentiment. By acknowledging his overall responsibility, as the man at the top of the culture ministry, for the scandal and deciding to send in his resignation to the president, Quadri has done a commendable deed. In a country where voluntary resignation from high office is a rare occurrence, indeed where individuals in positions of power and privilege are generally all too ready to pass the buck on to someone else, Quadri's decision to quit reinforces our belief in the ability and moral courage of some, if not all, of our influential men to act in the larger interest of the nation without any thought to their own short term welfare. There was dignity in his action.//////Some years are transitional and some are transforma-tional. I would like to argue that while 2007 falls into the former category that 2008 will fall into the latter one. But what does it mean to be a transitional year -- especially a year in which so much has transpired in Bangladesh. Especially for those who have suffered losses during the course of the year -- and there is no shortage of such unfortunates -- nothing is transitional, everything is transformational.//////Thanks to television, we can see where the sight doesn't reach. We can see people and places, and then, of course, put faces to names while listening to what they say. And this is how it works. The transmitter broadcasts signals over airwaves. These signals are electrical in nature and are transformed into radio waves, which are then picked up by receivers and processed back to audio and video electric signals that are played on the television set. But somewhere there is a loss of quality in this transformation, because what is released on the screen may not accurately reflect what is captured at the scene. //////Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said some of his star batsmen must look to carry on after they are set at the crease ahead of the second one-day international against New Zealand at McLean Park in Napier today.//////Khulna, Dhaka and Barisal bowled themselves to great positions at the end of the first day's play of their respective ninth round National Cricket League matches across the country yesterday.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan maintained his cunning way of defending himself even after accusing the media of being dishonest and politically motivated.//////The three cricketers to join Bangladesh for the Test series in New Zealand will leave Dhaka tomorrow.//////Pacemen Brett Lee and Stuart Clark captured four wickets each to deliver Australia a potential match-winning innings lead over India in the first cricket Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday.//////Sachin Tendulkar's misjudgement to throw away his innings with another impressive century beckoning could be the turning point in India's opening Test against Australia, the batsman admitted Thursday.//////Captain Suharwardi Shuvo and Rony Talukdar shone on the opening day of Bangladesh under-19s' three-day practice match against their South African counterparts at Sedgars Park in Potchefstroom on Thursday.//////Brett Lee's seemingly unstoppable rise to become one of the greats of Australian bowling reached another milestone here Thursday when he joined the 250-club of Test wickets.//////Shoaib Malik, the Pakistan captain, needs a further three weeks to recover fully from the ankle injury that curtailed his tour to India.

He ended the five Tests without a single half-century and was never the same force since.//////Ian Healy believes the man who takes over the gloves from Adam Gilchrist will need to be a man of dual talents. "Our next wicketkeeper will first have to be as good a keeper as him and then as good a batsman," Healy said soon after Gilchrist equalled his own Australian Test record for most career dismissals. Having caught Zaheer Khan off Brett Lee, Gilchrist's tally rose to 395, the number of dismissals his predecessor Healy ended his career with in 1999.//////Stuart Clark arrived at the MCG expecting nothing from the pitch, but with the assistance of reverse-swing he was able to overcome his pessimism and seriously damage India. The surface did not inspire him during a Pura Cup match for New South Wales at the start of the month -- it still doesn't -- and he requested series-opening matches in conditions that would give the home side an advantage, such as Brisbane and Perth.//////India batting legend Sunil Gavaskar says Rahul Dravid is opening the batting reluctantly against Australia.//////Salma Khatun claimed six wickets as Khulna defeated Rajshahi by five wickets in yesterday's opening match of the Meril Women's divisional cricket tournament.//////The 18th National Women's Volleyball Championship commences today at the Dhaka Volleyball Stadium with two matches on the opening day.//////By all but one measure it has been a vintage year for English football. //////Rafa Benitez and Paul Jewell could find themselves in hot water with the Football Association after clashing at Pride Park during Liverpool's last-gasp 2-1 win over the Premiership's bottom side.

It's so inspiring to see that people from all corners are getting united to realise the demand "Trial of War Criminals". We made mistakes in the past and do not have to make the same mistakes over again. The very issue has been used for Political Mileage many times. The usual Professional Intellectuals are already on the road again. We need to protect our greater interest. Let's not forget the " Spirit of the Liberation War " while we are chasing War Criminals. The widow of Birsreshtho Flt. Lt. Matiur Rahman the other day appealed to implement the Spirit of the Liberation War. Do we really understand what is it ? //////Although this is a grave matter and enquiries are being made, I feel the following anecdote will lighten the matter somewhat.//////The EC has adopted the right policy and the decision to enrol the Urdu-speaking Biharis on the current voter list except of course the ones who expressed their allegiance to Pakistan and have been living inside the refugee camps.//////Yes, it has been rightly said by Professor Anwar Hossain detained at the Dhaka central jail for reasons still unknown. Unknown because no verdict has been given against them yet. Yes, Professor Hossain is correct in the sense that we have been used as food for birds and animals for a long time. But we no longer want that situation to continue. //////Mr Proful Patel of World Bank has offered an unsolicited suggestion to expand the size of the Advisory Council in order to ensure the GDP growth of at least 7% as stipulated to ensure the targets of PRSP. This observation was contradicted by the Adviser for Agriculture instantly. //////If an applicant for mobile phone is allowed to get his/her application form attested by a mobile phone owner/subscriber of the same service provider, it will no doubt ease the difficult situation arising in case of re-registration of mobile phones purchased before February, 2006. There are now over 20 million mobile phone owners/subscribers in the country. Therefore it would be easier for an applicant to get his/her application form attested by an active mobile phone subscriber who may be a friend or a relation. The government agencies concerned and mobile phone service providers may consider this proposal as another option for the applicants. //////The incident that is hammering my mind for last few days is perhaps bothering many others as well. A number of hard working workers' lives were lost for no fault of theirs. The only reason they were there was for earning from honest labour. They died ignominiously. This death was not for them. Yes, I am feeling angry and humiliated as a human being who had to witness such deaths in the capital city of a sovereign country, which was too earned through a bloodbath in the same month of December a few decades ago. //////Everyone wishes to greet relatives and friends on special occasions during the year. Ideally, one would like to meet the person to greet him. Since this is not always possible, we take the help of greeting cards. To meet the demands, greeting cards are manufactured and sold. When you send a card to greet a friend or a relative, you expect it to be reciprocated. //////The nation is really confused. How are the collaborators of 1971 openly challenging the big parties? It seems some foreign powers are behind them. Otherwise, the party, which cannot master more than 2% votes and at the moment there is a strong national demand for trial of the leaders of that party as war criminals, could not take such a defiant stand. //////The Daily Star has been publishing many articles on drug addiction. Addiction to intoxicants is not a relief from pain, but rather a disease that prevents one from taking medicines. //////December 19 was not only election day for South Korea but it was also the 66th birthday and 37th wedding anniversary of the leading contender--Lee Myung-bak. Although Mr. Lee has enjoyed top position in the opinion polls (with over 20 points ahead of his main rivals), his campaign seemed to lack the fire and enthusiasm which were usually present in previous South Korean presidential elections. But then again he was the favourite to win because his two main rivals --Lee Hoi-chang and Chung Dong-young-- failed to grab the public's attention and support. In other words his rivals failed to provide any sort of competition.//////Thank you very much for your interview-based article on the "High Internet Tariff" in today's (17/dec/07) Star Business Page. This is a long-standing issue which needs mass awareness and campaign to make Internet a commodity for the public and businesses in Bangladesh. Internet is a global phenomenon in this highly interconnected world. It is in fact a boon to LDCs like us, which can catalyse our developments and exports growth. As the BASIS President aptly put High Internet Pricing is seriously holding back our ICT exports growth in Bangladesh. //////It has been exactly 36 years since Bangladesh, a small South Asian nation of approximately 55,000 square miles of land successfully separated itself from the nation of Pakistan - a geopolitical absurdity until 1971. In the process, the people of Bangladesh known as Bengalees paid a heavy price for liberating their country and becoming a sovereign nation. Husbands were killed, wives and daughters were raped and tortured, children were thrown into raging fires, and houses were burned down to ashes by the members of Pakistani armed forces. People who were fortunate enough fled to the countryside and ran from one village to another just to stay ahead of Pakistani occupation forces. It was their sheer luck and the topographical features of our land that saved many lives, not the mercy of Pakistani soldiers. Another chunk of Bengalees, almost 10 million, took refuge in the neighbouring Indian states of West Bengal and Assam. //////Benazir Bhutto followed her father into politics, and both of them died because of it - he was executed in 1979, she fell victim to an apparent suicide bomb attack. //////Air force jets destroyed a Tamil naval base in Sri Lanka's north yesterday, a day after a fierce sea battle and a wave of infantry attacks killed at least 66 rebels and 14 government troops, the military said. //////Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was killed Thursday in a suicide attack at a campaign rally, the interior ministry told AFP. //////Deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra will be arrested if he returns home from a self-imposed exile as planned, even if his victorious allies form a government following last weekend's general election, officials said yesterday. //////North Korea is likely to miss the Dec 31 deadline to declare all of its nuclear materials, since its draft falls short of the United States' expectations, sources here said Wednesday. //////Hindu extremists burned down the house of a prominent Christian politician in eastern India Thursday, officials said, as violence by gangs from both sides continued despite a curfew imposed after two days of attacks against Christians by Hindu hard-liners. //////Sri Lanka sent a crack commando unit to the state-run television station yesterday to rescue a government minister seized by journalists for allegedly assaulting a colleague, officials told AFP. //////US forces killed 11 Shia militants in an early morning raid yesterday in the town of Kut, south of Baghdad, the military told AFP. //////About half of a claimed 32,250-strong Nepal rebel army is authentic, the United Nations envoy to Nepal said Thursday. //////The second most senior European Union official in Afghanistan and a top UN political advisor left the country Thursday after being expelled by the government for posing a threat to national security. //////The burgeoning talk-shows on various TV channels are making it difficult to distinguish one from the other, as the basic format and interaction are almost identical. Subsequently the resulting monotony weighs heavily on the audience. Against this backdrop, the state-owned BTV has sought to regain the lost ground caused by the misuse of the political parties who over the years made BTV into a virtual party mouthpiece. //////Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai is gushing about three subjects right now in her interaction with the media -- her forthcoming film on Mughal emperor Akbar's marriage with the Rajput princess Jodhabai, life after her own marriage with actor Abhishek Bachchan and her equation with the comeback of the former queen bee Madhuri Dixit.//////Written and directed by Shahiduzzaman Selim, tele-film ////// features the dilemmas of a Bangladeshi expatriate Ajmal Hossain, who lives in the US. //////Sundarban, a large block of littoral forests with thousands of meandering streams, creeks, rivers and estuaries that have enhanced its charm, was devastated by Cyclone Sidr leaving 30 percent of it severely damaged and another 30 percent partially spoiled. //////Thailand's parliamentary elections on December 23 provided fresh evidence (if evidence is still needed) of the futility of military intervention as a means of changing the fundamental political trends of a nation. //////This article examines the possible environmental problems that the forest might face after Sidr devastation and looks at management approaches to address them. //////Today one of the most hotly deliberated topics on Earth is the issue of global warming or climate change. Increased populations, extreme demand for energy and limited resources have put the global environment under threat. As a result we are getting increasingly aware about the stake of environment we reside in. Nowadays the terms greenhouse effect, industrial pollution, air pollution, sustainable development, and biodiversity etc. have become frequently used words. //////Primates are considered closest living relatives of mankind. These living relatives -- apes, monkeys, lemurs and other primates -- are becoming rarer from the tropical forest. Reasons for the decline are no mystery: they all relate directly or indirectly to human actions" says a Worldwatch Institute report. A survey, worked out by 60 experts from 21 countries, cautions that failure to respond to the mounting threats has now been worsened by climate change. On the whole, 114 of the world's 394 primate species are categorised as threatened with disappearance on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Illegal wildlife trade and commercial plant-meat poaching have been largely blamed for their disappearance. //////
