What is more, the BCL cadres can easily get away with their most horrible crimes. The law enforcers don't nab the culprits who are seen moving with arms in front of them. Needless to say, this creates the culture of impunity. We are shocked by the activities of both the administration and the party in power. Awami League should not forget that the public who voted them to power will not take much time to throw them out of power in the 2014 national election. So, stop BCL.//////The Pentagon has officially removed the longstanding military ban on women in combat.

DMP may post a policeman at every bus stop to ensure that buses actually stop and park at the designated bus stops. They should even fine the bus drivers who violate these traffic rules.//////Very recently, the Bangladesh English Language Teachers Association (BELTA) hosted a three days long 6th international conference on "The Multiple Realities of English: ELT and Beyond" at National Academy of Educational Management.
