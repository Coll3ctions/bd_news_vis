And while his performance in this year's BPL was arguably not the best -- he was half-fit -- his 329 runs and 15 wickets in the tournament was enough to get him yet another brand new car, a Ford Fiesta to go with the Honda City he won last year.//////"Blade Runner" Oscar Pistorius put on his artificial legs and walked across his bedroom before firing four handgun rounds into the locked bathroom door, killing his cowering girlfriend in cold blood, prosecutors said on Tuesday.//////Top-seeded Victoria Azarenka pulled out of the Dubai WTA Open on Tuesday with a bruised heel, paving the way for Serena Williams to hold on to the world number one ranking this week.//////Mohammedan SC notched their first win in five matches of the Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League when they handed a lone-goal defeat to bottom-side Arambagh KS at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Amid the grief, some mourners at South African model Reeva Steenkamp's funeral on Tuesday demanded punishment for her boyfriend, Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius, who has been charged with her murder.//////Smarting from a 2-5 drubbing at the hands of Ireland, Bangladesh will be looking to bounce back when they take on China in their second match of the World Hockey League (round-2) at the Dhayanchand Stadium in New Delhi, India today. //////Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was on Tuesday ruled out of the forthcoming home series against Bangladesh because of a finger injury, the cricket board said.//////Rory Kleinveldt will replace fellow fast bowler Morne Morkel in the South African team for the third and final Test against Pakistan starting at Centurion on Friday.//////Matt Smith was fined a week's wages on Monday for throwing his shirt into the crowd after scoring cash-strapped League One side Oldham's injury-time equaliser against Premier League outfit Everton on Saturday in their FA Cup fifth round clash.//////The Bangladesh Football Federation has decided to run a medical test on Team BJMC's Nigerian player Ajagun Abdul Rasheed after his club sought his replacement three days ago claiming the forward is HIV Positive.//////Lou Vincent, the New Zealand batsman, has announced his retirement from all cricket.

But failing to do so, he killed her. //////I enjoyed the Spelling Bee contest arranged jointly by The Daily Star and Channel-i held at Comilla Zilla School on 16th February, 2013. A large number of students from different schools of Comilla city took part in the competition with spontaneity and merriment. I, being spell-bound, remained with the spellers as long as the programme continued. The participants, the guardians and the teachers were joyous and cheerful being present at the programme. The arrangement was so nice and flawless that we found no breach of discipline anywhere. The organisers left no stone unturned to make the programme a success.//////The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 in an attempt to prop up a communist regime beset by civil war. Afghan rebels fought the Soviets to a standstill, wearing them out much in the same way that Vietnamese forces wore out U.S. forces in Vietnam. More than 2 million Afghans were left dead in a war that ultimately saw the ouster from power of the communists, though war continues in Afghanistan to this day.//////The Shahbagh movement is an inspiration for the freedom loving people. Religion must be one's personal matter and should not be linked with politics, and definitely not with politics of hate and chauvinism. Parties like Jamaat should be banned in any society.//////Government banned YouTube quite sometime back because of an anti-Islamic film. It is like cutting the head off to cure headache. This Internet site has lots of information which are very useful for people of all walks of life. For me it was the only source of music which cannot be accessed from anywhere else. YouTube gave me the privilege of listening to Abdul Karim Khan, Bare Ghulam Ali Khan, K.L. Saigol, Kanan Devi, Juthika Roy, Kamala Jharya and Pankaj Mullick of the long lost times. I could also enjoy the incomparable gazals of Mehdi Hasan, Ghulam Ali, Jagjit Singh and Bangla songs of Jaganmoy Mitra, Dhananjoy Bhattacharya, Hemanta Mukherjee, etc., just sitting in front of my PC. Alas! It appears those days of heavenly bliss for me are gone forever. Will the government have mercy on people like me and not deprive them of this innocent pleasure?//////I am a Canadian of South Asian descent, who was living in Canada during 9/11. In those uncertain and terrifying post-9/11 days, my family and I were constantly on edge and felt we had to prove our loyalty and patriotism - even in Canada. It was truly a climate of 'you are with us or against us' and there was no grey area in between, no space for opposing viewpoints. I feel the same sentiments today when I look at what is happening in Bangladesh. George Orwell described patriotism as the "devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people." Conversely, he described nationalism as the feeling that your way of life, country, or ethnic group is superior to others and warned this feeling can lead a group to impose their way of life on others. That is something worth pondering over, whatever one's political affiliations.//////After dillydallying for long, BNP's reaction to the ongoing demonstration at Shahbag has really frustrated the nation. Instead of expressing solidarity, they literally gave some 'advice' to the protesters. It is really surprising. We the youths of Bangladesh know it far better than BNP that our motherland is beset with many problems of different magnitude. And we also promise to take our country to a bright future together, irrespective of class, race or religion. Mentioning some sensitive issues like border killing, they are trying in vain to divert the attention of the youths. We are protesting the killing of three million people of our motherland and one day we certainly will protest against border killing and all other political killings committed since 1975. We will surely remain vigilant against corruption and hypocrisy. But for God's sake, for now, either support or just keep listening to the roar of Shahbag. But no advice, please. //////Top Jamaat-e-Islami leader Abdul Quader Mollah was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of capital punishment for committing crime against humanity during the Liberation War. People have become outraged and demonstrating at Shahbag intersection for the last two weeks demanding capital punishment for him and other war criminals as well. A killer must be punished, whether he kills one person, or many.//////President Bashar al-Assad said he is confident his troops will win the conflict ravaging Syria as the number of Syrians who have fled their homeland has topped 850,000.//////Nepalese political parties on Monday agreed to have a chief justice Khilaraj Regmi-led interim government to hold general elections by mid June for a constituent assembly.//////Turkish police yesterday launched a massive nationwide crackdown against a radical Marxist group which claimed a suicide bomb attack against the US embassy this month, the state-run Anatolia news agency reported.//////Photos released to publicise a new documentary on Sri Lanka show that government soldiers executed the 12-year-old son of separatist chief Velupillai Prabhakaran in 2009, its director claimed.//////One of Britain's most celebrated authors has launched a withering attack on the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, branding her a "shop-window mannequin" with a plastic smile whose only role in life is to breed.//////Machine-gun toting robbers disguised as cops made off with $50 million worth of diamonds in a spectacular heist on the tarmac at Brussels airport, prosecutors and dealers said yesterday.//////Politicians named after Adolf Hitler and Frankenstein are among 345 candidates competing in elections this week in a North East Indian state with a history of bizarre naming conventions.//////Pakistani cabinet ministers yesterday opened negotiations with Shia Muslim protesters who are demanding army protection and refusing to bury victims of a bomb attack that killed 89 people in Quetta.//////Insurgent attacks on Afghan government employees soared by 700 percent last year even as the overall 2012 civilian death toll from the war fell for the first time in six years, the UN said Tuesday.//////Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali was pursuing "another solution" to Tunisia's biggest political crisis since the uprising two years ago yesterday after his plan to form a cabinet of technocrats failed.//////A Yemeni air force plane crashed in the capital Sanaa yesterday, killing at least 12 people, security sources said.//////A person suffering from a SARS-like virus has died in Britain on Sunday, hospital officials said yesterday, becoming the sixth fatality from the illness worldwide.//////The European Union agreed Monday to lift some of its punishing sanctions against Zimbabwe as a reward for ongoing political reforms, but the move brought a furious response from President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party.//////Egypt's justice ministry yesterday referred former presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq to the Cairo criminal court on charges of corruption and squandering public funds, judicial sources told AFP.//////I was passing through the older part of the city. Nishat or today's Manashi cinema hall was on my way. It was difficult for me to make out whether the people in the Manashi corridor were cine-goers because I could not associate them with the cross-section of cine-goers that used to throng it in my time. There was no large banner; a handful of garishly printed posters displayed the name of the movie Torture.//////Popular playwright and director Mohon Khan has been writing short stories and novels since the 1980s. His previous career in journalism inspired him to expand his works with the pen, and has resulted in the publication of 15 books so far.//////The 'Ekushey Book Fair' opened with 40 stalls in Pabna on February 12 at the Pabna town hall premises, marking the fifth consecutive book fair in the district. Vice chancellor of the Jahangirnagar University, Dr. Anwar Hossain inaugurated the month-long book fair. //////Since the protesters in Magura took to the streets demanding the immediate arrest of killers of Ahmed Rajib Haider, a blogger and activist of Shahbagh movement, local cultural activists joined hands in protest and also to raise awareness against Jamaat-Shibir politics.//////In the latter half of the 20th century, Jibanananda Das emerged as the most popular poet of modern Bengali literature. His unfamiliar poetic articulation, choice of words and thematic preferences took time to reach readers' hearts. He was also known as a surrealist poet because of his spontaneous, frenzied overflow of the subconscious in poetry and especially in diction. The poetry of Jibanananda has become the defining essence of modernism in twentieth century Bengali poetry.//////The gala eighth Citycell-Channel i Music Awards (CCMA) will be held on February 24 at M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong. Citycell, in association with Channel i has been organising the award for the last eight years to honour artistes and musical talents in the country.//////Marking International Mother Language Day and centenary of Bangladesh National Museum, a competition of 'best handwriting' for students was held at Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin art gallery premises in the town on Friday. //////History is alive and kicking at this year's Oscars in an unusually rich year for movies that plumb the distant and recent American past and have resonated with both audiences and voters.//////In all this revival of the spirit of 1971, in this collective national urge for the war criminals of more than four decades ago to be brought to justice, it makes sense to travel back to the past and revisit the mistakes made in free Bangladesh by the powers that were soon after liberation. That early dawn of freedom came in intimations of an enlightening kind. Within hours of the liberation of Bangladesh, the Mujibnagar government decreed a ban on the Jamaat-e-Islami, Muslim League, Nizam-e-Islam and other communal parties and outfits. It was the first sign of secular democracy actually planting itself in the psyche of the nation. And it was just as well, for the entire War of Liberation revolved around the substantive concept of Bengali nationalism. For the very first time since East Bengal linked up with Pakistan as its eastern province in 1947, the message was going out that Bengalis were returning to their heritage, one of all faiths and beliefs enjoying equality of space and opportunity in the People's Republic of Bangladesh.//////Thank heaven for little Doordarshans. An offshoot of the government-controlled TV behemoth, Doordarshan Bharati, broadcast a moving hour-long documentary on the late genius Ustad Amir Khan, at least 35 minutes of which was free from the excesses of a garrulous presenter and experts tripping over their own repetitions. This unknown channel had the pawmarks of its parent's ethos: a logo like a design patch from a 19th century sari; a script font quivering in a style that was synonymous with deep emotion in the 1950s. But whenever Doordarshan dips into that treasure house, its archives, there is magic.//////French President Francois Hollande was welcomed to Delhi by his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee with great pomp on February 14 when he arrived for a two-day visit. A 21-gun salute heralded his arrival at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.//////All of a sudden going to Shahbagh became the thing to do, everyone was there, checking-in, posting pictures and calling for death of a criminal a lot of them did not know or care about till a day ago. We have always been a frantic generation, our patriotism during February and December is always forceful and short-lived. I laughed the first time I heard people call Shahbagh a square, it was clearly meant to imitate Tahrir or Tiananmen. I was annoyed at the streams of people I personally knew, who were going to Shahbagh because it was just the "in-thing" to do, not because they had strong feelings about the ongoing trial and the controversial verdict. //////The Shahbagh junction in Dhaka has become Bangladesh's Tahrir Square. Hundreds of thousands of young protesters are occupying it and raging against radical Islamists. Even sympathetic politicians cannot control the movement. The protesters damn them as appeasers, who have compromised with unconscionable men.//////
