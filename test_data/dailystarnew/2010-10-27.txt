Otherwise how could a scheme of such dimension, providing for 27,000 plots, even be conceived without a thorough planning and thinking about its feasibility, not only in terms of finding such a huge chunk of land but also in terms of public reaction to such a move. Reportedly this scheme to be funded by personal savings of the members of the armed forces, was approved by the Prime Minister's Office, following which a limited company was formed with the Quarter Master General as the chair and a Brigadier General as Managing Director. So far 1,400 bighas have been purchased, with the target of getting 13,000 bighas in total.//////The High Court directive that the authorities free all children currently in various jails all over the country could not have come sooner. By the standards of civilised behaviour, both on the part of individuals and institutions of the state, it is morally and even legally inexplicable why persons under eighteen years of age should be kept confined in prison. Yes, there may be offences committed by the very young, but that does not allow the state to treat these young in the same way that it treats all hardened criminals. Besides, when the institutions of the state begin to feel that children should be kept in jail, without any possibility of freedom, they are only making sure that these children will in time turn out to be hardened criminals themselves. It is just the sort of condition we as citizens would like to prevent from shaping up.//////A late strike from substitute Towhidul Alam Sabuj took star-studded Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club to the final of the Grameenphone 23rd Federation Cup with a loan-goal win over Muktijoddha Sangsad in the second semifinal at Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////Rokibul Hasan and Naeem Islam struck centuries to power their sides to wins in the National Cricket League one-day competition yesterday.

They had hoped for a judgement based on impartiality but it seems that the judges were influenced by the propaganda war unleashed by the anti-Muslim groups.

But they forget the safety and security enjoyed by the vast majority of non-Muslims in the Muslim areas/countries. In the recent past Muslims were brutally killed in Gujarat, Mumbai, Nelie, Bhagalpur and a number of other places. The denial of job opportunities and discrimination of Muslims in India is a well-documented fact.//////Once a mighty military power, Britain is now talking of major defence cuts to contain the budget deficit.

He set an example of objective journalism in the country for others to follow. //////I had the misfortune of travelling by road from Dhaka to Chittagong recently. It took us over ten hours. It was not because of heavy traffic but because of the slow pace and congestion resulting from the abysmal condition of the road. The stretch from Baroiahat to Chittagong, perhaps some 70 kilometres, is in particularly bad shape. It is virtually without any surface and has innumerable potholes. It is difficult to imagine how the authorities could allow the condition of the most important highway of the country to deteriorate to this level when the concerned ministry is waxing eloquent about subways, magnetic trains, bridges and elevated expressways.//////As Halloween approaches I feel it important to remind parents and children that the feast of Halloween was once the vigil feast of All Saints' Day, which is celebrated on November 1.

People are passing their days in great misery. Power, water and gas shortage has become acute. In addition, prices of essential commodities have gone out of reach of common people and crimes of all sorts have increased manifold. Instead of tackling all these serious problems, it seems that the government is bent upon creating further distress for the people by asking Begum Khaleda Zia to vacate the cantonment house.

We do not want fresh unrest; it is the government's duty to see that people live in peace, not to shatter it.//////When the midterm US election is just around the corner, all of a sudden Osama Bin Laden, who is believed to be dead, has appeared in the media from nowhere.

And history, if you must know, is something you cannot live without. Anyone who tells you history does not matter is someone who is only exposing the brilliant ignorance he suffers from. Ignore his philistine behaviour and move on. For those of us who have lived through some of the most stirring of times, October is a journey back to some old tragedies, some near forgotten tales of heroism and some defining moments in the lives of people across the world.//////On October 24, 2010, the United Nations turned 65. While speaking at a function to observe the day, it occurred to me that I was only a couple of years younger.

The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) earns around 30% of its revenue from Custom House Chittagong (CHC) and Chittagong Port. //////
