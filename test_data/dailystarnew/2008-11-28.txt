This attack, vicious in its nature and with wide-ranging ramifications, has brought home to all of us in South Asia the lesson that a serious, purposeful and united effort toward combating the terrorist menace is now necessary. Indeed, the series of attacks that have occurred in India in recent months, together with the violent attack on the Marriott Hotel in Pakistan's Islamabad, were broad hints of how wide the network of terror was getting to be. With the Taj and Oberoi hotels in Mumbai (as well as other spots) now coming under attack, it is clear that terrorism is now no more a national but a broad regional menace. It is now anyone's guess as to where terrorism will strike next. But what is clear is that no one is safe and at this point it is for all South Asian nations to come together to combat the threat. At the same time, people everywhere must condemn the atrocity perpetrated in Mumbai. After having been claimed responsibility by the so-called Deccan Mujahideen, it is especially for Muslims everywhere, seeing that such atrocities are being perpetrated in their names, to condemn the killings loudly and make it clear that their faith abjures violence of all kinds.//////The Commission on Aids in its report has shed light on different aspects of the killer ailment, which continues to be a major concern in many Asian countries, despite a number of programs being taken up by the governments to contain it.

The Muktijoddha Monument a prominent landmark in the area, built to symbolise the supreme sacrifices of the greatest sons of the soil is lying in utter neglect. It is a matter of shame and disgrace that our brave sons are not being honoured. The entire roundabout appeared extremely chaotic with buses, maxis, CNGs and rickshaws parked haphazardly. Garbage has not been removed for months. Posters of school coaching, latest movie release, broadband are pasted on the monument itself. Vendors sell peanuts, jhaal moori and chatpati and serve juice extracted from sugarcane and carrots. People gossip lazily and throw all types of litters. The roundabout is devoid of any ornamental garden. After dusk, the entire area is shrouded in dark as there are no overhead lights. Such is our respect for the brave sons of the soil!

This is, surely, not the basis of 'child rights'. No, no, no! They are part of the present! The purpose of their existence is not because of what they may be in the future but because of what they are now. They are not merely adults in the making a smaller version of ourselves. They are real people with their own fully justified needs and demands, at this very moment, and worthy of respect and consideration as part of society and the world today. //////The educational institutions in Chittagong and Dhaka are burning. The flame may engulf the entire education system. The PSC is showing its true allegiance and colour. The political leaders are back to square peg one.

The last political weapon, the militant act, is yet to be unveiled, and might be seen if politics of power so demands. A grim uncertainty has engulfed our political future. //////Begum Khaleda Zia asked the government to lift emergency- it was reported by an English daily on Nov 24. Our query is- why?//////Environment pollution has become a matter of concern all over the world in recent years. Existence of human life mainly depends on environment and a sound environment is a must for sound health. Simply, the environment means surrounding conditions and circumstances and environmental pollution means any sort of disorder in these conditions and circumstances. Surrounding conditions consist of many objects and forces, both natural and men made. //////It is depressing to see Sheikh Hasina's AL going with the JP again. I am still trying to understand why. The AL is only ruining its opportunity of a fresh start. After all the talks about reform, the AL could easily separate itself from bad influence and very easily win the next election, as the BNP is in a mess. Such a move would have been very effective. //////I wish to draw the attention of the high-ups in Tele-Talk BD Ltd. & BTRC (Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission) Dhaka to the messy situation prevailing within Tele Talk BD Ltd., graveyard road, Banani, Dhaka.//////The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest. It offers us a huge amount of natural resources.//////Imams are regarded as the ideal Muslim leaders in any Muslim community. They are helping society by imparting their knowledge and bringing people to the path of religion. But they are financially ignored. They do not get a good amount of money as their remuneration. No basic salaries are determined like other professionals. Most of the Imams usually get Tk 3,000 to Tk 3,500 only per month, whereas even a primary schoolteacher receives nearly Tk 5,000. So, it is really hard for them to survive.//////While on a Tour-of-Duty abroad I am now viewing the TV today to see the heart breaking news of the different political groups of students locked in feuds leading to casualties, damage and ending up in the closure of Chittagong Medical College that is the second oldest and largest seat of medical education in the country.
