Not only has it lost over 40 percent of its land resource to illegal occupation, the size of its inventory with which it had originally begun in 1971 has also shrunk terribly over time.

It is also an attempt to focus on the strengths that we still possess and maybe, just maybe, we can force a glimmer of hope that will lead us to a new beginning of change from this morally and intellectually decaying society. //////The story begins with a prologue and dramatic description: "On a hot, dry night, well after midnight, seven silent but exiled youngmen approached the single-storied building, and then stopped in its garden. Each knelt and touched the earth with one hand, holding the other to his breast. They made a pledge committing themselves to brotherhood and to a new form of organisation to fight rural poverty." The building was the RHD resthouse at Uthuli in Manikganj and the time, March 1978. Of the seven two were employees of BRAC, already a prominent NGO, one a government employee, another a local college teacher and three worked for CCDB, an international NGO. //////On 11 August 2008, Peter Clark writes in a ////// obituary that as a poet, author, and politician, Mahmoud Darwish 'did as much as anyone to forge a Palestinian national consciousness.' While Clark's comment is undebatable, it is also true that Darwish's poetry transcends its national boundary by reflecting on universal humane values through the mirror of the Palestinian experience. It is one of the major reasons why Darwish now is a great name in world literature. ////// is his exquisitely written prose-memoir. Ibrahim Muhawi's adept translation brings out the delicacy of the piece. It is based on Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 that was aimed at wiping out the PLO's base from southern Lebanon. The fact seems most startling when one reads the memoir containing evocative details of Beirut under siege. Darwish, however, lifts up the sufferings of the invasion to an aesthetic level through his musings on reality, belonging, history, resistance and the role of art involving these. The entire book is an extended internal monologue (the poet's thoughts in his mind) about which Robyn Creswell writes in ////// January 2009 issue: //////Khushwant Singh was still a practicing lawyer with the High Court in Lahore. It was just days prior to the partition of India and Pakistan in August 1947; he was travelling to his family's summer home in Kasauli at the foothills of the Himalayas. While driving on the lonely road he came across a jeep packed with Sikh men who boastfully narrated their immediate action of butchering an entire Muslim village.//////Doris Lessing, the 2007 Nobel Prize winner, definitely has had a fascinating life. She was born to English parents, lived in Iran until she was five, and then moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where she spent her most formative years growing up on a farm. It is said that by and large the first novel is a writer's own shadow of his/her life. ////// is not out of this stream as well. This is Doris Lessing's first novel, published in 1950, which is based upon the life of a distressed woman and her marriage against the backdrop of the Rhodesian society of the late 1940s.//////
