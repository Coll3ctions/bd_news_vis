By now, the rule of reason, ethical responsibility, proper surveillance and supervisory activities have become comforting illusions. //////HOW much water is there in Bangladesh?

It is hoped the scientists will surely prove their efficiencies through implementing innovative technology to face climate change. //////Countries around the globe try to promote various activities in mitigating the environmental degradation. One of the vital steps developing countries have undertaken is the 'Go Green' concept through which, believably, we can save resources of our planet to let our future generations survive. This environmental issue is more than important for the existence of our country.//////Nature conservation anchors a discourse that articulates a nexus of nature-culture-artificiality-stability-biodiversity. The concepts of human disturbances have been enjoying increasing popularity in the discussion of biodiversity conservation. Anthropogenic behaviour that harms nature" or human activities contrary to nature" leads to unnatural conditions. The notions of pure naturalness are totally dogmatic and the present environmental conditions are the products of a plethora of human disturbances. Human activities are the result of evolution of the other life forms in the biosphere. The Homo faber ("man the maker") plays the most significant role on the highly complex manipulations of the nature.//////Keeping animals in zoo for public recreation is an old concept. In a few past centuries many zoos have been established around the world as refuge for the captured wild animals mainly for giving people pleasure.

Rather, some new zoos are being set up with a view to promoting care of people for the wild animals, reproduction of endangered species and scope of research on wild animals. //////1//////The stretched grilled veranda along the bedroom was so narrow that one would only use it for dry clothes or mature pickles. Yet the young bride from the second floor would come to the veranda whenever she could. There would be only buildings to stare at though some covering the mighty sky; others reducing their distance with the sky with every opportunity, enforcing a chaotic surrounding. The only saving grace was the plot next to theirs, where no building was yet to be built. It had a long tin-shed house where several families lived. The place also contained three trees within its boundary a date-palm tree, a guava tree and a boroi tree.//////There is something about bleakness, about snowfall, that causes some of the saddest thoughts to well up in you. The sight of an old book, the death of a celebrated playwright, remembrance of a year, images of graves far away . . . these and similar workings of the mind are what you encounter as the winds howl and daybreak does not show much of a difference with twilight. You watch the flakes fall to the ground, wondering all the while what could be happening to the birds that on sunlit days flit across your window many times over. And then you hear television dwelling on the danger that birds are confronted with if the snow refuses to melt. These tiny emblems of Creation, always foraging for morsels in the grass, do not have it in their beaks to probe through the snow and into the soil.//////A psychologist has cautioned certain categories of men and women against marrying. He seems as least generous enough not to generalize as Thales, an ancient Greek philosopher, did long ago --- 'for a young man not yet and for an elder man not at all. I would like to ask readers not to heed the philosopher in order to be spared the confusion and frustration, which such marriage-related views may lead to.//////Haiti, one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change like Bangladesh is already overwhelmed with high rates of tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea, meningitis and respiratory infections. With 7.0 magnitudes earthquake that struck on last Tuesday added severe burden of injuries and chance of further tropical and infectious diseases. In addition to death, a large number of survivors are struggling to access healthcare and suffering from severe trauma/ injuries, lack of safe water, sanitation, food and shelter. World Health Organisation (WHO) urged international communities to serve immediate health needs in crisis with rapid and coordinating life-saving care.//////Cold weather is responsible for various types of skin disease. Not only adult but also children are affected by winter. Although dryness of skin is the main cause of this problem, there are other diseases like scabies which can occur in winter.

It is the manifestation of different clinical condition where there is accumulation of serum bilirubin in excess resulting yellow colouration of eyes and skin.

It was, thus, for very good reasons that the Indians were greatly excited when the Awami League won the 2008 elections by a massive margin. The assurance given by Sheikh Hasina within days of becoming Prime Minister that Bangladesh would not allow its territory to be used for carrying out insurgency against India was welcomed in India with great enthusiasm, both by the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP. By her just-concluded state visit to India, Sheikh Hasina signed and sealed that assurance by signing three security related agreements that would give the Indians the handle over its insurgents who either hide in Bangladesh or are inclined to cross over to Bangladesh in search of sanctuary. The agreements ensure that all that India had wanted and expected on the important issue of security from Bangladesh has been delivered. It was Mamata Banarjee who perhaps spilled India glee over these three agreements when, after a meeting with Sheikh Hasina, she told waiting reporters that India must give Bangladesh whatever it wanted.//////BANGLADESH Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's landmark four-day visit (10-14th January) to India has created an excellent environment of mutual trust that will lay foundations for a much more stable and fruitful relationship with India. The two neighbours lacked mutual trust and the visit has been successful in restoring the spirit of trust between the countries.//////President Obama says he has "no intention" of sending U.S. troops to fight militants in Yemen and Somalia, and that al-Qaida's activities are still centered along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.//////Nothing is more in need at this critical time, when political democracy has re-started but a limping journey, than the publication of a centenary commemorative anthology on Abul Fazal (1903-1983), the foremost humanist of the country. He was considered the conscience of the nation in his time. Though primarily a writer, all his life it has been a trademark with Fazal that he participated in and led almost all intellectual and civil movements against the pseudo-religious Pakistani autocratic regimes. At the advent of the Bangladesh movement Abul Fazal became a truly national figure guiding the progressive forces with courage and high morale.//////Binod Bihari Chowdhury, the iconic revolutionary figure of the subcontinent, turned one hundred on 10 January. By all accounts yet a young man, he has produced a book called ////// (The Flaming Days) through dictation where he has deliberated on his long as well as told and untold stories of his eventful life. There is no doubt that the publication of the book will help us learn more about this centenarian figure who has observed the three phases of the evolution of the Bengali nation the British era, the Pakistan era and the present Bangladesh era and thus has made himself an erudite figure in the historical perspective. //////Jharna Das Purkayastha is very well known to Bengali readers.
