He also said: "In the late 1930s when I was a student we knew that war was imminent, but there was no clear idea of what to do about it. We think that something unpleasant may soon happen but we are still as confused over what to do about it as we were in 1938.Our response so far is just an attempt to appease. The Kyoto agreement is uncannily like that of Munich, with politicians out of show that they do response but in reality are bidding for time."//////Now all conscious people know at least some common consequences of global warming, the first and foremost being melting of glacier and sea level rise as its result. Mountains occupy 24% of the global surface area and are home to 12% of the world's population (ICIMOD, 2008). Mountain regions of this planet are not only vulnerable to climate change but also areas to visualize the impact of climate change since measuring the melting snow caps helps us understand the glacial retreat rate linked with climate change. The superb example of this is the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region. //////Ambia could never think of it. Never ever. This is absurd. How can things come to such a strange pass? How can a woman be yoked to a plough together with a cow? It's quite unthinkable! Unimaginable! But facts prove stranger than fiction in Ambia's life. She herself is doing what was even beyond her wildest dream. She is pulling one end of the yoke with the cow at the other. She is trying to keep pace with the front feet of the cow. The yoke on the rugged neck of the cow and in the crook of her arms is failing to maintain enough equilibrium to pull the plough, causing inconvenience to both the woman and the cow. The cow turns her head and looks at her strange counterpart with large moist eyes. Ambia tries to ease the cow. She is big with young. Ambia's husband Kasem is guiding the plough from behind. The curved blade of the plough is digging and turning over the soil. Long furrows are being left behind. //////The second session of Shakespeare Study Circle, Bangladesh (a literary organization of the Department of English and Humanities, University of Liberal Arts, Bangladesh), was held on 29 October 2009 in the University Board Room with Professor Mohit Ul Alam, Head of DEH, presiding. //////A pet cat ought to be buried//////again and again.//////Every time you fill its//////grave with earth, sand, gravel//////it scratches up through the layers//////to wriggle itself out in the open.//////Then at night you find your cat//////pussyfooting in the bedroom//////or sitting stoned, eyes wide open,//////on your high wardrobe.//////Cats beckon peace and solitude//////When they're alive,//////Many see in them bad omens,//////Many never know the feline magic.//////Everything told, //////dead cats are a nightmare,//////Tell me why ---//////A strong urge prompts you and me//////to bury them with so much love.//////But we cannot.//////Health and safety is always a big concern of about 3 million Muslims who have already started and will travel to Saudi Arabia within a few days to perform the holy Hajj. One must be in good health, not only to perform Hajj and Umrah but also to make maximum use of the opportunity to make as much prayer as possible. The more physically fit one is, the easier it would become to perform the many rituals that a complete Hajj include. The following is a guideline to follow during performing Hajj which must be accompanied by your own doctor's advice pertaining to your health needs.//////With the advancement of medical technology, use of improved imaging equipment like Computed Tomography (CT) scan, X-ray, CT Angiogram, heart scan have raised manifolds.

Things were looking better about a month back with the army operation winding down in Swat and the IDPs returning to their homes. Pakistan Army's operational success in Swat and Malakand and the killing of Baitullah Mehsud, the Head of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in a US drone attack appeared to signal a turning point on the war against the FATA militants. However, the euphoria was short-lived. Hakimullah Mehsud, Baitullaha's successor, is proving to be an even more aggressive and audacious terrorist. The attacks on the GHQ, the heart of Pakistan military, and a few days later in the PAF Base, Kamra proved that the Taliban can plan and execute a complex suicide attack at a time and place of their own choosing. More worrying signs are the emerging entente between the Taliban and other militant organizations, such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). Once nurtured by the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to conduct terrorist operations in Kashmir and elsewhere in India, they are now increasingly turning against their mentor since the government, under increasing external pressure, clamped down on their operations. The new coalition called Punjabi Taliban could make the task of combating insurgency even more difficult now that the Punjabi dominated Army will be fighting in their backyard with people from their own linguistic clan. //////MARITIME strategy is the set of principles that govern a maritime war, in which the sea is a substantial factor. Naval strategy is but that part of national strategy which determines the movement of the fleet, in time of war. Maritime strategy determines how and what part of the fleet must be engaged in relation to the land and air strategy. //////ON 21 October 2009 negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme wrapped up in Vienna. Terms such as breakthrough and victory were prematurely used to describe the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) preliminary agreement with Iran. The agreement was seen as a way to assuage international concerns over Iran's nuclear intentions and prove a substantial vindication of President Barack Obama's engagement policy. Even before the international optimism has settled in, the wariness has begun to creep in. How distant has the attempt to build cooperation is a question that may only be answered if the Iranian leadership accepts the proposed agreement in its entirety and after the IAEA inspectors complete their inspection of the recently discovered clandestine nuclear enrichment facility near the city of Qum.//////Studies of various aspects of Rabindranath Tagore are legion, and a fair proportion of them deal with his achievement as a lyricist and composer. One of the best-loved critical studies in Bengali, Abu Sayeed Ayub's Pantha Janer Shakha (The Traveller's Friend) analyses this aspect of Rabindranath. Yet this beautifully produced volume a collector's item can rightfully claim to be the first of its kind. //////With the advent of the British traders, the Muslim Mogul rulers of India who were the 'patron of power descended to a position of petitioners in the durbar of the firangi.' //////A brilliant novel of lust, ambition and betrayal, ////// is a work that vividly represents a young woman's struggles to settle down in a new place.//////One associates certain attributes with a nuclear engineer --- precision, knowledge of applied physics and mathematics.
