It has been given out that the arrests were made as part of security measures related to the Puja celebrations. Reports of bombs hoaxes at some puja mandaps in the capital certainly prompted these law enforcement drives. One surely cannot underplay the threats that may come in relation to religious or other collective celebrations and observances, which is why one fully understands the need for the security forces to be in a state of constant alert. No citizen will ever be inclined to disregard any question about ensuring the security of people at any given time.//////COMPARED to a developed country the capability of an underdeveloped country is very limited. Bangladesh, being a least developed country, should never be oblivious to the fact that she will have to overcome lots of hurdles before reaching the stage of mid-income country. To attain this stage she needs good governance and good administration. It is regrettable that, despite the passage of more than nine months, the new government has not been able to make us hopeful about attaining its declared commitment. To a neutral observer, the AL-led government appears to be more concerned about consolidating its power without concentrating on promoting national interest. Admittedly, the administration has failed to speed up work to attain the national goals in time. In fact, the prime minister has already conveyed her disappointment and disapprobation to the secretaries to the government about the painfully slow disposal of government decisions. Her admonishment could not bring any positive result as it is beyond the powers of the secretaries to gear-up administrative actions. //////PRESIDENT Obama, in his maiden speech to the UN General Assembly last Tuesday, pledged a new willingness to work with the global community, and urged them to set aside "an almost reflexive anti-Americanism" and collectively confront the global crises. The tone and tenor of his speech were markedly different from his predecessor Bush's policy of "acting alone" and flouting the opinion of the international community. Obama sought to clearly delineate differences between his administration and that of his predecessor.//////After agreeing in principle to extend the tenure of head coach Jamie Siddons in the second week of this month, the Bangladesh Cricket Board yesterday held an informal meeting with coach Jamie Siddons over the terms of his new contract.//////Shoaib Malik smashed a brisk century to set up Pakistan's 54-run victory over arch-rivals India in the Champions Trophy on Saturday.//////New Zealand started and fini-shed their 50-over innings superbly to make 315-7 against Sri Lanka at sun-baked Wanderers on Sunday in a crucial ICC Champions Trophy match.//////Chelsea lost for the first time under Carlo Ancelotti as Wigan claimed a shock 3-1 victory at the DW Stadium, while Manchester United defeated Stoke 2-0 to move top of the Premier League on Saturday.//////A superb five-for from left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo helped visiting Bangladesh A cricket team dominate hosts Maharashtra Cricket Association Under-22 on the first day of the three-day warm-up match in Nasik, India yesterday.//////Football has once again been kept out of the government finance when the National Sports Council proposed a budget of Tk 1.76 crore for 32 federations and associations for the 2009-2010 fiscal.//////India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is looking forward to an improved performance from his team in a crucial match against formidable Australia in the Champions Trophy here on Monday.//////Weightlifter Fahima Akter bagged a silver medal in the 58kg category of Asian Junior Inter-club Weightlifting Championship in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, said a press release yesterday.//////A two-day training course for floor hockey and young athletes, organised by Special Olympics Bangladesh, will get underway today at St. Joseph School in Mohammadpur.//////Some 50 to 60 members of Mohammedan Sporting Club have requested the convenor of the club's ad-hoc committee to extend the deadline for depositing money to become members of Mohammedan Limited.//////Vitali Klitschko successfully defended his World Boxing Council heavyweight title on Saturday stopping previously unbeaten Cristobal Arreola after 10 rounds of a scheduled 12.//////Mladen Petric scored 18 minutes from time to earn Hamburg top spot in the German Bundesliga on Saturday, ending Bayern Munich's five-match winning streak.//////Barcelona joined Real Madrid on a maximum 15 points at the Spanish league summit with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring for the fifth consecutive game as the champions won 2-0 at Malaga on Saturday.//////Giampaolo Pazzini scored the only goal as Sampdoria beat champions Inter Milan to return to the top of the Serie A table on Saturday.//////Marseille's build-up to their crucial Champions League assignment at mighty Real Madrid in midweek suffered an embarrassing setback on Saturday when they slumped to a 3-2 defeat at humble Valenciennes, twice surrendering a lead.//////Carlo Ancelotti has promised Chelsea will provide a response when they travel to Apoel Nicosia after suffering their first defeat under the Italian.//////Hat-trick hero Fernando Torres helped Liverpool make their best goal-scoring start to a league season in over 100 years - yet manager Rafa Benitez has told him he is still not fulfilling his potential//////Hat-trick hero Fernando Torres helped Liverpool make their best goal-scoring start to a league season in over 100 years - yet manager Rafa Benitez has told him he is still not fulfilling his potential//////Virender Sehwag has said his fellow opener Gautam Gambhir is a leading candidate to captain India in the future.

The house is in the most restricted area, and public entry is either restricted or subject to permission of Begun Zia. The news is not clear whether Begum Zia sent any list to the cantonment security to allow her guests to visit her on Eid day. //////We have been observing, albeit silently, an incremental yet disturbing trend among the burgeoning fashionists in today's Dhaka city. Apart from the sheer mockery it makes of the holy month of abstinence, the fashion ads smeared across the magazines and billboards reek of over-exposure of the feminine form, in complete denial of our treasured cultural identity. Our collective cultural identity had long been embedded in the notions of modesty and grace, and these are traits and values we are and should take immense pride in. Even The Daily Star for certain features in its Lifestyle and weekend magazines may stand accused of implicitly endorsing an ethnocentric view, when it is pivotal for a national daily not to lose sight of the fact that Gulshan-Banani-Dhanmondi views on trends and fashions do not necessarily reflect the collective values of the entire city, let alone the country as a whole. Many people echo this view in inconspicuous settings in fear of being branded a fundamentalist, but as social engineers our elected authorities indeed have a responsibility to nurture and preserve positive aspects of our cultural identities before they go awash in prevalent global tides.//////Whenever we turn over the pages of the national dailies, we come across may headlines on Child Trafficking. The illegal traders have included children in their list, like commodities. They make the children fall into their trap. The illegal traders normally offer an angel like child candy, apple, sweets and what not. The children, who are basically poor, respond to their call. The traffickers catch them. They sometimes buy children from local agents at a very high rate. The unscrupulous traders sell them outside the country. Hundreds of parents go mad losing their sons and daughters. The law enforcing agencies are there. Still, the traffickers carry on their inhuman business year after year. Again, we know the sufferings of a child after he has been sold. We just shudder at hearing the unbelievable, unimaginable and inhuman stories. //////In an impoverished country like Bangladesh our progressive dreams of socio-economic development are the only route to national prosperity. However, vicious social cancers like crime and corruption often prematurely trample our budding dreams and grossly contaminate our perceptual world with their filthy nightmares. It's absolutely undeniable that despite all the seemingly compelling promises of the governmental policy makers, the overall 'law and order situation' has deteriorated significantly over the last few months. The relentlessness and ferocity of crime have made us utterly speechless. We hopelessly witnessed the vivid blossoms of our collective peace and safety being ravaged by the outrageous outburst of violent crimes that literally made us vulnerable in every corner of the country. It appears that we have been hurled back to a medieval age of sheer lawlessness where the value of human life and liberty was absolutely negligible. Murders, muggings, extortions, kidnappings, robberies and rapes have almost become an unannounced norm in Bangladesh in the recent times and it appears that our representatives in the government are either shamelessly incompetent or they really lack any sincere determination to resolutely counteract the monster of crime. It seems that the incumbent government is represented by a bunch of uncreative sycophants as they are recurrently failing to device feasible and effective plans to curb crimes. //////I feel saddened by the news of thirty thousand Jhau trees being felled by the ruling party men at Teknaf beach.//////It is one of the worst forms of environmental pollution. It has great impact on the human body and mind. But it seems that some unscrupulous people are completely oblivious to this fact.//////Ms Nur Jahan in her letter published in DS on 18 September expressed her utter disappointment at the response by the people towards the hartal called by the national committee to protect gas, oil mineral resources and power in Dhaka city on September 14. But I am quite surprised that she did not utter a word against the main opposition party BNP and its close ally the Jamaat for not giving any support to the hartal. Opposition parties are duty bound to the nation to check the government misdoings, if any, by voicing protest in parliament or on the streets or both. But the BNP has miserably failed to do the same mainly by abstaining from parliament for a childish demand for more front-row seats initially, though gradually adding more demands which include the issue of Khaleda Zia's huge palatial complex at Dhaka cantonment. It is obvious that people are now allergic to hartal because of its frequent use and misuse in the recent past. If we want to develop as a democratic country we, irrespective of our political inclinations, should encourage/ pressurize the political parties to debate all national issues in parliament in open public view on radio and TV channels. //////It is nearly three months since the new timing was introduced. Unfortunately there are lots of problems with that. The problem is much bigger, especially for the students who are taking exams in the morning session.

The Goldstone report fairly and accurately documented violations of human rights and international law, war crimes, and possible crimes against humanity committed before, during, and after Israel's December 2008-January 2009 assault on the occupied Gaza Strip. This report is obviously an eyesore to the Israel- lobby within the US government and the Congress, including the AIPAC, who are trying to bury the fact-finding report at the UNHRC level where it will be discussed on September 29 so that it is not referred to international bodies with enforcement powers such as UN Security Council, General Assembly, or International Criminal Court, as the report recommended. //////Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged a ministerial meeting of southeast Asian nations late Saturday to take a tougher line with fellow member Myanmar in hopes its military junta will free political prisoners and hold fair elections.//////Rescuers plucked bodies from muddy floodwaters and saved drenched survivors from rooftops Sunday after a tropical storm tore through the northern Philippines and left at least 106 people dead and missing.//////A suicide car bomb explosion targeting Afghanistan's energy minister killed four civilians yesterday, while attacks and a violent storm killed six international troops, including three French and two American forces, officials said.//////Foreign Minister SM Krishna, took the podium at the United Nations General Assembly to remind the world of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, and said that India wants to resolve all outstanding issues with Pakistan through peaceful dialogue.//////Pakistan yesterday slapped bounties on the heads of five Taliban and militant leaders, part of an ongoing manhunt for the masterminds of deadly attacks rocking the northwest.//////The suicide blasts that rocked northwest Pakistan over the weekend signal the Taliban remain a threat despite intensified military operations and unmanned drone attacks targeting the group's leaders, analysts said yesterday.//////Myanmar's junta has not yet fixed the dates for elections in 2010 but the opposition is already debating whether to boycott them and lose all influence or take part in what critics say is a sham.//////A light plane crashed at the site of an international fair packed with thousands of visitors in South Korea on Sunday, killing one of its two pilots and injuring 11 people on the ground, an official said.//////A suicide car bomber on Sunday killed four Iraqi policemen and wounded four others near the predominantly Sunni Arab western city of Ramadi, a police official said.//////Sri Lankan troops opened fire to stop dozens of war-displaced Tamil civilians escaping from a government camp where they have been detained in the island's north, the military said yesterday.//////Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit yesterday accused Israel of lacking the political will to enter "serious and credible" peace talks with the Palestinians.//////Germans voted in a national election yesterday with Angela Merkel favourite to win a second mandate to lead a country hit by the global recession and at odds over its military role in Afghanistan.//////Premier British intelligence agency, MI6 chief, has been told that Saudi Arabia will permit Israel to fly over the kingdom to bomb Iran's nuclear sites.//////The United States has reassured India that it would move forward with their landmark civil nuclear deal notwithstanding New Delhi's position that it would not sign the discriminatory Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).//////Russia, which has the deepest relations with Iran of any big power, is to play a critical role in the Iranian nuclear crisis in the next months as the clock ticks on efforts to find a diplomatic solution.//////A report ordered by the European Union into the causes of the 2008 Russia-Georgia war is to be released Wednesday but the potentially explosive findings which could prove delicate for the EU.//////Swiss police detained Oscar winning director Roman Polanski on a US warrant over three-decade-old charges of unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, a film festival's organisers said yesterday.//////Dozens of people were killed or wounded as fighting raged anew on Sunday between government troops and Shiite rebels in the Omran and Saada provinces of northern Yemen, military sources said.//////How important is one's name?
