That is the bottom line in a report carried by a leading daily in the country. We have no reason to disagree with such a finding, especially against the background of the recent incidents of building collapse and fires in different parts of the capital. There is little question that Dhaka has always been an unplanned city. But what is mind-boggling is the rapidity with which it has in the past three decades or so mutated into a symbol of chaos and confusion. The mere fact that a few minutes of rainfall leave entire areas of the city water-logged speaks of the myriad problems which now the city is confronted with. The bigger reality is that the relevant urban development authorities have little clue as to where all this will push the city in the short term as well as the long-term future.//////WE are told that the government is going for revising the already revised monthly pay order facilities. Let us get the fact straight. The first version of the MPO list, that was finalised by the education minister and was ready for implementation on 6th May, and was held back and revised under the instruction of the PM by one of her advisors, is in for another revision. This time the education minister has been tasked with the responsibility, apparently for the same reason that the first revision was done - the list was not to the liking of many in the ruling party. //////Steven Finn took five wickets as England thrashed Bangladesh by an innings and 80 runs inside three days in the second Test to wrap up a 2-0 series victory at Old Trafford here on Sunday.//////When cricket matches are interrupted by the weather, broadcasters like to fill the spare hours with highlights packages from previous games.

The ineffectuality and hollowness of such warning has been delineated in the editorial of The Daily Star (May 22, 2010), which needs no further elaboration.//////It is a matter of great concern and regret that as a nation our consciousness regarding hygiene is very poor. You'll find people doing all sorts of things that are considered unacceptable according to the norms of social and personal hygiene. It comes as no surprise that we often get to see outbreaks of diarrhoea, typhoid and other diseases that can easily be prevented if we become a bit more knowledgeable on how these diseases are caused and how these spread.//////Deaths on the roads across the country have assumed a monstrous proportion. You come across the death news in road accidents almost every day; either an erratic bus collides and crushes another vehicle or some passers by are run over by some over jaunty vehicles driven by inefficient and crazy drivers without a valid driving licence --- a common but tragic phenomenon unchecked at work at the cost of human lives. //////Many years ago I read a true story which touched me very much and often it comes to my mind. It was written by a man called John Kord Lagemann. He spoke of a man who was sitting in a railroad coach next to a young man who was obviously depressed. Finally the man revealed he was a convict returning from a distant prison. His imprisonment had bought shame on his family, and they had neither visited him nor written often. He hoped, however, that this was only because they were too poor to travel, too uneducated to write. He hoped, despite the evidence, that they had forgiven him.//////Good results of SSC are soaring higher than expectation every year. Board examinations are just like a veiled fiction and when we unravel it we face the tragedy. Every year the number of GPA-5 students goes on increasing. Besides, this year NCTB has introduced the structural question based examination for the first time. But before undertaking this daunting task, they didn't consider for a while the students' problems. In fact, there had been hardly any teaching courses for the teachers. Moreover, the little amount of information that the teachers grab from different sources is not even enough to set questions for school exams, let alone the board exams. //////I think Twitter, Myspace and Facebook are social networks helping people to communicate with others. Just think about the cousin or friend who's now abroad. Without the social networks, would it be possible to connect with them every day? You can see their activities online now on your homepage. Okay, let's not go far. It is connecting us with the relatives who're in the city or outside Dhaka. We can meet friends every day at schools and workplaces, but not our relatives. //////The most important causes of poverty all over the world are poor education, teen parenthood, lack of opportunities, and being a child or elderly. Lack of food, natural resources, and efficient government are some of the causes. Taxes also cause poverty. In our country households with lower levels of education face difficulty in escaping poverty. It seems a chronic problem for us.//////Labour unrest has become the most talked about issue across the country. Garments industry is now the 2nd largest sector that is contributing to our economy a lot. Statistics show about 95 percent workers engaged in this sector are women. But the recent unrest led this industry to destruction. Extortion, killing, looting, strike have become quite common in the present context of the country. To resolve it, I want to draw the attention of the authorities concerned on the following points://////It has been reported in the print media that Barrister Moudud Ahmed has vowed to bring General Moin U Ahmed and other CTG leaders to justice for what he called their illegal take-over of state power which according to Barrister Maudud, pushed the nation to an economic disaster. He strongly vowed that he is organising a countrywide campaign in this respect.//////The blocking of Facebook for what they called the satiric portrayal of some of our politicians including the PM and the leader of the opposition was least acceptable and hence only exposed the intolerance of the ruling people. When the government does not spare a single opportunity of talking about free access to information and ' a digital Bangladesh", the hasty move to silence critics on the cyberspace by blocking the Facebook not only transmitted a wrong signal to the outside world, but was also tantamount to negating the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution. By blocking a social networking site reputed worldwide, were we going to follow the examples of the bigots in Iran and Afghanistan? //////Recently, Bangladesh and Russia signed a framework agreement for development of a nuclear power plant. Bangladesh plans to produce about 2000 KB energy from that plant. //////Every year a huge number of Hajj pilgrims are visiting the holy places of Mecca and Medina to perform Holy Hajj and say salam to our beloved Prophet Hazrat Muhammad(Pbuh).This year, according to the agreement signed between the government of Saudi Arabia and the government of Bangladesh, 75,000 people from Bangladesh will be allowed to go for Hajj, out of which fifteen thousand through the ministry of Religious Affairs(MORA) and the rest sixty thousand will go through govt. approved Hajj agents. Hajj is a major religious ritual and it deserves to be given top priority in respect of service. //////If people are educated then they can differentiate between right and wrong. There are eight millennium goals and they are-- eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce childe mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS malaria and other diseases, and ensure environmental sustainability and global partnership for development. //////A staggering 156 billion pounds in deficit has forced the new Tory-Libdem government of the UK to cut costs at every conceivable area, including asking ministers to walk to office or take public transport. Shocking, as it may seem, for the Britons, from a life style of plenty to a life of austerity will be a tough go, no doubt. This is the price of wasteful expenditures over so many years.//////When Musa Ibrahim as the first ever Bangladeshi conqueror reached the summit of Mount Everest to hoist the Flag of Bangladesh, he took down his name in gold in our history. He not only made history, but also became the national hero in the hearts of sixteen core people of Bangladesh. No eulogy is enough to praise his deed, as it was a utopian thinking for us before 23rd May, 2010 to reach Mount Everest. //////So far we know, using tinted glasses in the cars and jeeps is prohibited in our country, albeit a good number of those are garbed with coloured covers flouting the laws. Some of those are so darkly covered that you cannot even recognise who is in, which sometimes scares us. These sorts of transports sometimes may be used by the criminals to hide themselves in as and when they think necessary.//////While addressing a function in the city's Mohakhali area on 25 May, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called upon the physicians to render their services to the poor people, especially in the remote areas, being confident of their profession, knowledge and experience.//////In recent years tourism has become a major element in the balance of payments of many countries. At present Bangladesh is failing miserably in attracting international tourists. Bangladesh accounts for only 4.5% of all international tourists visiting South Asian countries, and almost two-thirds of foreign tourist arrivals in Bangladesh are from India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries. The majority of visitors from the UK and USA are ethnic Bangladeshis, who come to visit relatives and friends. Almost 60% of foreign tourist arrivals are for business or official purposes, and the number of leisure tourist arrivals is insignificant. There are many possibilities of tourism industry in Bangladesh and tourist spots are available. But there are problems in this sector. The problems are given below-//////UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has proposed a multinational investigation of Israel's raid on a Gaza-bound aid ship in which nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed, an Israeli official said yesterday.//////North Korea threatened yesterday to retaliate against South Korea for taking it to the UN Security Council over the deadly sinking of a warship, calling the action an "intolerable provocation."//////Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said yesterday that an emergency decree would remain in place for now, but the situation was calm and an election was possible early next year.//////New Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan is likely to keep his predecessor's cabinet with only minor changes but is moving to curb the influence of powerful backroom fixer Ichiro Ozawa, reports said yesterday.//////Asia-Pacific nations should adopt a more coordinated response to relief operations in the disaster-prone area, top regional officials said at a security conference yesterday.//////A car bomb exploded outside a Baghdad police station yesterday in the deadliest of a pair of attacks that killed six people in the Iraqi capital, security and hospital officials said.//////Turkey, seething with anger after an Israeli raid on an aid ship bound for Gaza, hosts leaders from Russia, Iran, the Arab world and beyond this week for a Eurasian security summit that may further isolate Israel.//////A containment cap on a ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico is now funnelling off 10,000 barrels of oil a day, BP's chief executive Tony Hayward says.//////Afghanistan's president yesterday ordered a review of the cases of hundreds of prisoners linked to the Taliban and other militants in a first step to fulfilling the demands of a landmark peace conference.//////Pakistan has announced it is to increase defence spending by 17% in the coming year, with analysts saying much of it will be used to combat militants.//////Tagged as the world's most electorally successful Communist party, the Marxist leaders of West Bengal might finally be nearing the end of more than three decades of uninterrupted power.//////Myanmar has given no clear signs that it would welcome regional help with its elections expected later this year, its Southeast Asian neighbours said yesterday.//////The US State Department has been left red-cheeked after sending birthday greetings to the Queen a week early.//////Heavy rains and winds lashed the port city of Karachi yesterday, killing at least four people as Cyclone Phet swirled along Pakistan's coast after claiming the lives of 15 people in Oman.//////Pakistan People's Party's Syed Ahmad Mujtaba Gilani defeated Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz's Naghma Mushtaq Lang in the by-election in the PP-206 constituency on Saturday.//////The United States has finally given India access to a US national accused of planning the Mumbai terror attacks two years ago, a senior White House official said on Saturday.//////The author of a "fictionalised biography" of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born power broker of Indian politics, has vowed to fight attempts to stop it being published.//////After a trial lasting more than two decades, the judgement on Bhopal Gas tragedy, the world's worst industrial disaster, which killed and maimed thousands of people, would be pronounced today.

By the second half of the Sixties most of the world -- Latin America, Africa, Asia, most of Europe -- was awash in its many hues, and Vietnam took its counter-intuitive edge to the campuses and television screens of America. //////GHULAM sold his father's land and paid an exorbitant sum to an agent to find him a job abroad. On arrival in Malaysia, he found he had been duped. There was no permit and no job. He eventually found work in a factory, but was arrested because he had no papers. He has been languishing for over a year in an overcrowded, sub-standard detention centre outside Kuala Lumpur, awaiting deportation to Bangladesh. //////THE view from the sun-lit terrace of Paro's Zwiling hotel was breathtaking. High mountains of the majestic Himalayans range reached for the sky. The Kingdom of Bhutan, now a fledgling democracy, nestled cosily in the loving lap of the picturesque mountains. //////AS the global economy recovers, our business community is beginning to see a glimmer of hope. Under the circumstances, the last thing Bangladesh can afford is another wave of crippling national strikes, aimed at toppling the government, putting the country back on the verge of perpetual political chaos. Neither of the major parties can speak from a moral high ground about anti-government strikes or hartals. Both them, when they were in opposition, perpetually stormed out of Parliament and launched ceaseless strikes to destabilise the duly-elected government. //////
