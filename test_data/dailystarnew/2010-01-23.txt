One such plan would help mechanise farming in Bangladesh and another, if implemented without delay, would help prevent reduction of cultivable land that is being lost to urbanisation to the tune of almost 1 percent annually. The other project is related to bringing more land under irrigation. //////Another teenaged girl has killed herself as neither her family, nor the community could protect her from the tyranny of her tormenters. Naspia Akand Pinky, a 14-year old ninth grader from the Shyamoli Ideal Technical School and College, could not stand anymore the disgrace she had to digest everyday on her way to school at the hands of a street-corner bully Murad and his cohorts. Her repeated complaints to her parents about the daily harassment she had to suffer were of little avail.

Sri Lankans will go to polls to elect a new president on January 26.

Riding on the wave of popularity, Rajapaksa has called for a fresh election two years before expiry of his current term, and is confident that his mandate will be renewed.//////SEEMINGLY there were high hopes attached to the outcome of the Bangladesh-India summit held on 11-13 January at New Delhi. What is, however, realistic about the outcome of the meeting is an expectation of the opening of an era of enhanced friendship and cooperation between these two close neighbours after a period of 34 years (1975-2009). This, after so many years, of course, requires further building of mutual trust and confidence. //////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president AHM Mustafa Kamal has questioned the integrity of the national cricketers saying that the players are not giving their hundred per cent. //////Rajshahi and Dhaka have scored big wins in their respective matches of the National Cricket League against Barisal and Chittagong while the match between Sylhet and Khulna is poised for an exciting fourth day finish.//////Jamie Siddons, the Bangladesh coach, has said batsman Mohammad Ashraful was fortunate to retain a place in the national team but felt there was no adequate replacement for him yet.

Compounding the peace and stability of the country is the gun battle that people witnessed recently in the Dhaka University campus between two groups of the Chatra Dal. Unhappily, even after two years of suffering during caretaker regime, political intrigue, bickering, in-fighting, and bankruptcy have almost become the norm. //////THE government's decision to formulate a new population policy, emulating China's single-child families by 2015, to avoid a serious socio-economic debacle due to ever-increasing population is an eminently sensible one. According to the draft policy, couples having only one child will be given preference in all state facilities, including the government's assistance during admission to educational institutions. //////CHINA has been the cause for envy as well as inspiration. Its steady economic progress has been based on active inter-action with the international community. That has resulted in massive foreign direct investment. It has made it the 'factory of the world'. This gradual flow of economic power from West to East has however also raised questions about the manner in which China controls its economy and the imperatives that are associated with its strategic planning. It has added to scrutiny.//////The analysis of the outcome of the climate change summit held in Copenhagen pointed out a stark reality for Bangladesh and other most vulnerable countries (MVCs) that we can't just rely on greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting developed countries to come to our salvage. We will have to increase our domestic capability in terms of adaptation and mitigation plans. The formulation of Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) is a valuable document and a step in the right direction. This document outlines many action plans including strategy for flood protection and management schemes, coastal green belt, cyclone shelters, resilience of vulnerable groups, centre for research on climate change, climate change resilient crops, and coastal embankments. //////Last time, when I was in Bangkok for a few days, my friend Mr. Siriraks and his daughter Candy took me to a tree plantation project in Thailand's Samut Prakarn province and I stayed there for about two days. This was a great experience for me. At the start, I was reluctant to go there but my friend was a very tenacious fellow. Finally, I nodded to his request to pass a good amount of time there. When I reached there, I found the place to be a real greenery which will remain imprinted in my mind for many years to come. I had an amazing time. Thanks to my friend and his daughter so much for giving me the opportunity to experience such a beautiful greenery.//////Wetlands are invaluable components of the environment, ecology, resource potential and biodiversity in Bangladesh. They are integral part of the local ecosystem based cultures. These consist of wide variety of types ranging from lakes, rivers, coastal forests to deepwater paddy fields and ponds. All these wetlands form a unique mosaic of habitats with extremely rich diversity of flora and fauna, much of which as yet biologically undiscovered. The wetlands also support the livelihood of millions of people engaged in such diverse activities as fishing to collecting honey, thatching materials and fuel wood.//////I am a narcissist. That is what Glory told me while she was in the U.S. two months ago for Thanksgiving holiday. I have always known that. After hearing it aloud felt very strange. Well, I knew that her eyes are windows that could see deep into my soul. That is why I avoid seeing or talking to her. We keep in touch through emails. She writes to me more often than I do. I want our correspondence to be occasional but she pays no heed as to what I want. She kept on writing until recently. She doesn't write anymore after our last phone conversation which lasted only six minutes. That is when she said I was a narcissist. If I see her or talk to her then she says things that I do not want to face or think about myself. Her voice haunts me. With emails, I can choose what to say and avoid answering things that are deep in nature. She once told me she believes we are soulmates. This was very early on. And I laughed since I do not believe in clichs. She looked hurt. And never mentioned it again after I laughed her off. No, we are not in love. How could we be? I am in love with myself. I do not take other people's feelings into consideration anymore. I am happy to be alone. That is what I tell myself.////// is a creative writers' group that meets regularly at Bengal Shilpalaya in Dhanmondi. New Year 2010 was a happy start. On 4 January, ////// welcomed Syed Shamsul Haq, an iconic writer of Bangladesh, to a discussion session on creative writing. He spoke to a rapt audience for an hour and ten minutes, sharing his experience of over a five-decade long career in writing. His works cover 27 volumes of poetry, 16 plays (including 7 verse plays), of which the most prominent is //////, 9 novels, 57 novellas, 6 collections of short stories, 5 books of essays and impressions and 6 books of poems and adventures for the young. //////You wonder at times about the state of reading in the world you are part of. There is the sense that it is dying, that indeed these increasing levels of sophistication coming into technology are in essence putting holes into our old habits of reading. Not many people read today, which is a pity. Worse is the knowledge that bookstores are being downsized because business is not good. And what you have in place of these truncated, eventually murdered bookstores is storehouses of all those things that reflect the decline of intellect in our times. Visit any bookshop in Dhaka. Chances are it will be empty or perhaps a visitor or two will be there. Those of you who might be tempted to visit the bookstores at Aziz Market in Shahbagh too cannot boast of high visitor numbers, though you have some of the best books, newly published, to be had in the shops there. The old shops in New Market are yet there, but there is something about the arrangement of the books on the shelves, together with the narrow space in the shops, that is pretty disquieting. The stores that specialise in English language works, of course brought in from abroad, today offer hardly anything that shows light at the end of the tunnel. Besides, there are the prohibitive prices to consider. Omni at Dhanmondi has seen its book section confined to an increasingly narrow space. Et Cetera started off well. It is only the past about it you recall now. Words N' Pages, in Gulshan, is yet out there. Will it stay that way? At the old airport in Tejgaon, The Bookworm remains a beacon of happiness. How much longer will the lights gleam?//////O Saviour, save us from the clutches of rogues,//////O God, help us to fight fraud.//////O Guardian, guide us to uproot cruelty;//////O Leader, lead us to banish barbarity.//////O Creator, aid us to salvage society,//////Stand by us to face any ferocity.//////This pursuit of mine to discern the self//////Shall never come to a close//////Through the quest//////I search for Thee, O Lord.//////Foodborne illness and food safety is a growing concern across the globe. Apart from Diarrhoea and Cholrea, other foodborne diseases like Salmonellosis, Campylo-bacteriosis, infection of ////// Listeriosis have emerged as a major threat in the world. World Health Organisation (WHO) urged governments to intensify efforts to improve food safety and work proactively in response to an increasing number of food safety problems and rising consumer concerns.//////Very often, women in Bangladesh present to a doctors room when their diseases have already progressed to a grave condition and need aggressive treatment. Sometimes, physicians have very little to do with a woman when she comes at the end stage of a fatal disease like cancer. With simple and inexpensive screening tests, women can prevent a range of deadly diseases like cancer, glaucoma, complications of diabetes etc. and help remain heal and hearty.//////Mental health is deeply influenced by external social and environmental factors. Along with physical illness, it is now well evident that extreme climatic events can cause significant psychological stress with long-lasting effects on anxiety levels and depression.//////GlaxoSmithKline Plc hopes to seek approval by 2012 for its experimental malaria vaccine and said it would seek only a small profit and ensure it is widely available in hard-hit countries.//////A modern twist on traditional acupuncture may bring some pain relief to people with knee arthritis, at least in the short term, a small study suggests. The study, published in the journal Pain, looked at the effects of electro-acupuncture among 40 adults with knee osteoarthritis  the common "wear-and-tear" form of arthritis in which the cartilage cushioning the joints breaks down.//////Pumps that deliver insulin to the body as needed may be more effective than insulin injections for helping people with type 1 diabetes keep their blood sugar under control, according to a new review of 23 studies comparing the two approaches.//////The agreements reached between Bangladesh and India during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's state visit to New Delhi to combat terrorism is a positive move. It should allay fears abroad that Bangladesh could turn into next Afghanistan, a view expressed by then US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on a visit to New Delhi in 2005. Bangladesh is also not in the list of 14 countries whose nationals have been placed on special security checks recently by US security agencies following the failed attempt by a Nigerian national to blow a Delta airlines plane short of landing in Detroit on last Christmas day.//////THE political administration of Bangladesh suffers from two major weaknesses. One is the concentration of all powers in one hand, rendering pluralism a farce; the other is the non-existence of a full-time defence minister that makes civilian control of the armed forces dysfunctional. //////OUR closest neighbour India has been trying to have multiple corridors crisscrossing Bangladesh for a long time. A group of people views this as a threat to our national security. Well, perception varies from individual to individual. As for India, it can always ask this favour from its neighbour as long as the level of confidence permits such a venture and there is a potential win-win situation for both parties. Strategists of both countries need to sit with unveiled intent and committed candour. It is unfortunate that issues like Bhutan, water sharing and border demarcation between the two countries depict an obscure scenario in bi-lateral relations. Regular killing of Bangladeshis by BSF only adds to the bruised confidence. We need to consider the 60 years of sub-continental history before venturing into such a major undertaking.//////Breaking with tradition is a courageous act. In the social arena one is labeled either a rebel or a crank. In the political world one risks finding oneself on the wrong side of popular opinion. In academia one can face blazing guns unless equipped with solid arguments and references. Breaking the stereotyped portrayal of Jinnah as a villain in mainstream Indian historiography, Jaswant Singh's recent assessment of him is one such act. He is candid without malice, a rare feat. He doesn't mince words when pinning due responsibility for partition on the leadership across all divides in general but Gandhi, Jinnah, Nehru and Mountbatten in particular. His wit and eloquence are superb, though a bit repetitive at times. Nevertheless, since history is viewed through the prism of the present no matter how objective (a highly sensitive topic like partition more so), his appraisal of Jinnah on the wide canvas of India's independence movement too is not free of its constraints. I will mention only two. //////Isabel Allende, like so many of her compatriots, left her native Chile long ago. Unlike many of them, however, she has kept returning to her country, coming away every time with newer insights into the society and politics of the land. As a writer, indeed as a novelist, Allende has known enough about Chile, about herself, to convince herself of her identity. She knows, certainly, that her second marriage, to an American, was guided more by the temptation of making a home abroad than giving expression to romantic passion. For all that practical demonstration of reality at work, though, Isabel Allende has remained the Chilean she has always been. For her, Chile is something more than a patch of geography. It is an image, an idea she has constantly nurtured and shaped and reshaped in the mind. And that is how she has reinvented the old country.//////Over the centuries, and in many different countries, women have spoken out for their sex, and articulated, in different ways, their complaints, needs and hopes. In England, right up until the 1960s, the word `feminist' was usually pejorative. Writers like Rebecca West and Virginia Woolf sharply attacked the word `feminism.' American feminist Estelle Freedman argues that right from its origins, the word has carried negative connotations. Juliet Mitchell and Ann Oakley, in their third collection of essays, //////?, argued that `attacks on feminism frequently merge into a wider misogyny.' Who is a feminist actually? Margaret Walters has tried to answer the question in her book. //////The third novel by Dhaka-born Monica Ali is a superbly written, behind-the-scenes account of a commercial kitchen in London.//////
