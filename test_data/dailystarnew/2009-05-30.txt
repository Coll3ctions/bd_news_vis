Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), the organisation responsible to protect the rivers from encroachers, has set up structures on the filled-up land and rented out those, apparently encouraging these greedy people to violate the laws. //////Diarrhoea spreads fast in some upazilas of Satkhira, Khulna and Barisal districts as thousands of cyclone-affected people there are forced to drink contaminated and salty water.//////Despite repeated protests at home and abroad, extra-judicial killings by the law enforcers continue unabated, causing concern among the people.//////Around 300 gangs have struck panic into the hearts of Dhaka's businesses since extortion-related crimes have spiralled out of control, with two people dead and around 50 people shot in connection with extortion in the last two months.//////The government could not constitute the National Integrity Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the Ethics Committee within the specified time since the National Integrity Strategy (NIS) is yet to be finalised, officials concerned said.//////It is not the farmers, but the traders are reaping the benefits of public procurement of rice as the peasants are selling paddy at much lower prices than the government's fixed rate in this Boro season due to the present procurement system.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said the services of heroic army and police personnel of Bangladesh would continue in the UN peacekeeping missions and in other diplomatic endeavours to ensure a peaceful and prosperous world for the next generations.//////Foreign Minister Dipu Moni yesterday said she has been attending international conferences and meeting with foreign leaders to garner support for the government's move to try the war criminals of 1971.//////Rejecting the government probe report on BDR carnage, BNP yesterday demanded formation of a powerful all-party parliamentary committee to identify the perpetrators, planners and behind-the-scenes instigators of the carnage.//////The cabinet is expected to approve in its next meeting the much-awaited Child Labour Eradication Policy for welfare and protection of working children, said Labour and Employment Minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain.//////Home Minister Sahara Khatun yesterday brushed aside BNP secretary general's allegation about partial release of the government probe body report on BDR carnage and said the authorities had made the report public in full.//////Four people, including two contractors and a physician, were shot and wounded in three separate incidents of gun attacks in the city's Mohammadpur and Pallabi yesterday.//////Industrial waste has polluted Dhaka's rivers beyond purification. Even the groundwater in Hazaribagh is polluted. The putrid stench of Wasa water now seems trivial compared to its lethal health effects. Dhaka dwellers face the disturbing prospect of importing bottled water from abroad in a country known as the Land of Rivers. Meanwhile, the arteries of Dhaka's four rivers - Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Turag and Balu - are being choked by the infinite greed of encroachers. Ruthless in approach and powerful in practice, these encroachers continue their mindless destruction with impunity by maneuvering the legal system and pocketing the police.

The number of the dead appears to be going up and is now close to two hundred. The damage caused to homesteads and crops has been serious enough to be compared to the loss caused by Sidr in 2007. The state of things at present seems to be getting increasingly newer dimensions with every passing day. Survivors have been left without food and drinking water. A very large number of them are marooned all across the region, with relief workers unable to reach them with the help they need. Add to that the incidence of diseases, such as diarrhoea, which have been afflicting them.//////BANGLADESH polity is now challenged by hostile groups that profess a philosophy of life and of government that is inimical to our own. In fact, we are now facing an adversary who is armed enough to commit widespread violence. In our free society, while our defenses and deterrents are largely prepared in open fashion, our new antagonists have succeeded in building a formidable wall of secrecy and security. So, to bridge the gap and warn ourselves in time, we have to rely more and more upon our intelligence operations. There is a need to break through the shield of secrecy of the bigots. Special techniques, which are unique to secret intelligence operations, are needed to penetrate the security barriers of the extremist outfits.//////THE advent of summer this year has underlined once again the vulnerabilities of the residents of Dhaka.

If you add to that period the months in which he was effectively in charge as military leader of the country since November 7, 1975, you could say he was in control of Bangladesh for five and a half years. In all that time, there were no fewer than eighteen (some say the figure is higher) coup attempts against him. He did not survive the nineteenth, which was ostensibly led by Major General M.A. Manzoor.//////I wish I did not have to write this piece. One must do it since there has been a silence on the part of the commentators and the politicians, except this daily which published a strongly worded editorial on this issue on May 26.

Yes, I am talking about the recent incident at a village in Daudkandi, where a girl was whipped with 39 lashes in the presence of a few hundred peoplethe outcome of a decree of a local salish. //////THE four rivers, Buriganga, Shitalakkhya, Turag and Balu, that surrounded Dhaka city are being polluted by industrial wastes and encroached upon by land grabbers to such an extent that they could cause an environmental disaster for the city dwellers.//////A poet and writer of renown Khaleda Adib Chowdhury passed away on May 28, 2008.//////A good part of villagers in Bangladesh invest considerable time and energy in subsidiary economic gardening. This is often in the form of a vegetable garden and tree orchard on whatever household land is available to them. In fact this has been the mainstay both for the basic nutrition balance and the homestead forestry contribution of which in the rural economy and its well-being is well recognised. However, the practitioners of such gardening usually follow traditional technologies, and the absence of better seeds has been one of their acute problems. The extent of support services for farmers during the last decade in Bangladesh has proved efficacious. //////Generation of solid waste in voluminous amount in modern cities has multifarious environmental implications. So its management is one of major environmental concerns. Municipal solid waste not only contains solid phase waste but also many semisolid or liquid, at times volatile substances. Over time it degrades with action of microbes and creates nuisance to the citizens if not properly handled and disposed of. Solid waste containing organic substances may pollute surface and ground water, air and soil, but can be very useful resource if properly managed.//////BORO rice in Bangladesh, either HYV (High Yielding Variety) or traditional variety covering more than 4.5 million ha, is entirely irrigated production, mostly with underground water. Irrigation has become a very costly input in rice production because of increasing cost of fuel. Farmers pay about 25-30% of the price of their harvest for irrigation. For producing 1 kg of paddy, it is estimated that a farmer has to use 3-4 thousand liters of water for maintaining pond water during the growing stage of plants. As a result, besides the increased cost of irrigation, groundwater level is also declining due to excessive withdrawal threatening the environment. Therefore research has been conducted through BRRI-IRRI collaboration for long to develop water saving techniques in rice cultivation by the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) method.//////My de-mystification process with the 'Rat' began one afternoon during my PhD studies at Boston University in 1987. I knew the Rat's location, and made my way from the graduate student office next to Commonwealth Avenue, continued along that thoroughfare, and then past another city landmark, Kenmore Square. The walk was all of five minutes, give or take a few seconds. It was the swansong of high summer, and the heat that day was oppressive, turning my T-shirt into virtually the outer skin of my sweating self.//////Football fans will know what I'm talking about when I say that sometimes even a much anticipated Chelsea versus Manchester United match in the English Premier League can turn out to be a rather unexciting encounter, with ordinary dribbling and passing that is only enlivened momentarily with flashes of genuine footwork. So too with this issue of ////// where genuine inspiration lurks amid the mass of plodding literary essays. It is not the themes that are at fault here since they range from Rabindranath to eminent historian/archeologist Hassan Dani and poetry written during the 1960s to communal disharmony. Rather, it's the style of writing, which leads one to suspect that perhaps the magazine should be aware that 'literary' writing, like all other types of activities, too can fall into a rut. It is also a truism that serious essays for publication in literary journals that also aspire to popular readership can be difficult to produce on a consistent basis and that standard publications being brought out over the long term with deadlines to meet can mean that at times the match-up does not live up to its expectations - a sentiment that I'm fairly sure the editor of this particular page will also agree with! It is a fate that only the irregularly published little magazines can avoid, who can afford to wait until they have enough material they deem worthy of publication. And even then//////A graphic novel is a 'novel' in a comic book form. Its origins lie in the United States post-World War II era of the pulp novel and the newspaper comic strip, which in turn gave rise to comic books. Today that comic book form is no longer what most older generation figures will remember it to be. From the 1960s on it came under pressure for change came from the Japanese 'manga' comic books, the increasing popularity of science fiction books and 'underground' comic cults. Graphic novels are hugely popular in Europe, with some favourite 'characters', even though they are American creations, far more familiar to European readers. As that change in the comic book character became pronounced, it was simply a matter of time before it incorporated the novel's themes and linear devices, with lengthy and complex storylines bound in durable formats. Today graphic novels are hugely sophisticated in terms of themes and artwork qualities, with Art Spiegleman's work on the holocaust, titled Maus: A Survivor's Tale receiving a special Pulitzer prize in 1992. It is increasingly starting to gain acceptance among mainstream publishers and readers as something qualitatively different from being mere comic books. In this context John Updike's words, when in 1969 he addressed the Bristol Literary Society on the death of the novel, are much quoted: "I see no intrinsic reason why a doubly talented artist might not arise and create a comic strip novel masterpiece." Last year a graphic novel on Che Guevara - 'Che: A Graphic Biography' by Spain Rodriguez, published by Last Gasp - appeared to much acclaim.//////I am done.

This year theme for the Day is Tobacco Health Warnings. Health warnings on tobacco product packaging are critical to any effective tobacco control strategy. They increase public awareness of the serious health risks of tobacco use and help to ensure that the packaging tells the truth about the deadly product within. Tobacco package health warnings that include images are a particularly powerful and cost-effective vehicle for communicating health risks.//////Adopting a healthy vegetarian diet is not as simple as scraping meat off your plate and eating what is left.

You can also use dental floss to scrape up and down the sides of each tooth. If plain dental floss gets stuck in your teeth, use the waxed variety. If you have a hard time handling dental floss, try a floss holder. Other options might include special brushes, picks or sticks designed to clean between the teeth.//////THE two-day EU-Russia summit concluded on 22 May. The venue chosen by Russia, the city of Khabarovsk, is near China, about 8,000 kilometers east of Brussels. President Medvedev made a point on 21st May of noting EU leaders would understand how large Russia is by having to fly so far. //////FROM Nato's foundation in April 1949 until dissolving the Warsaw Pact in July 1991, the role of Nato was dictated by confrontation with the Soviet Union. The United States functioned as a protective umbrella for Western Europe and played the leading role inside the alliance. This was accepted by European governments, although France's decision to quit leading NATO bodies in 1966.//////THE Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have been waging a relentless war for a separate Tamil homeland, have now been tamed. The LTTE's top leadership has been wiped out; most of its cadre are dead; some have surrendered and the remaining are scattered. The fall of the LTTE coincided with the re-election of UPA government in India and India's overall policy towards Sri Lanka, therefore, is not expected to change dramatically. The new government under Manmohan Singh however, will want Colombo to address two key issues on a priority basis.//////Brave of Heart is a 352-page book by Bir Pratik Habibul Alam (Sector -2 and K- Forces) on the guerilla operations conducted by him and his friends in Dhaka during the liberation war. The book provides a fascinating reading of the daredevil actions of the guerilla FF's that shook the Pakistani junta to its core. In a simple but thrilling way, reminding one of the style of either Mario Puzo in The Godfather or Truman Capote in In Cold Blood, Alam describes the incidents and happenings in a matter-of-fact manner though the reader will every minute while reading it be haunted by his language laden with a fictional quality. Though written, naturally, from the rival perspectives, Alam's book will also remind one of the Pakistani classic written on the Liberation War of Bangladesh, Witness to Surrender by Siddik Salik. //////Tired of all those tomes?
