For Prof Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank in which he served as the managing director, those ten years were the golden time of phenomenal rise and glorious shine.

To our mind, it has not quite ended. //////Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao's call for joint efforts towards putting an end to killings of people on the Indo-Bangladesh border draws attention once more to an old, known problem. To be sure, Ms. Rao's remarks, made to a group of Bangladeshi journalists in Delhi, are welcome and reflect India's concern over an issue that has exercised Bangladesh's mind over the years. That both Dhaka and Delhi need to sort out the problem through making sure that civilians, both Indian and Bangladeshi, are not pushed to unexpected death on the border, has never been in doubt. But the realities, particularly for Bangladesh, have been rather painful. With reports almost always coming in of some Bangladeshi national or other being shot by India's Border Security Force, it makes sense to ask if better measures cannot be taken to deal with the issue.//////Nigerian striker Kingsley Chigozie celebrated his Grameenphone Bangladesh League debut with a brace as Brothers Union registered their fourth win with a 3-2 defeat of Arambagh Krira Sangha at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Leaders Muktijoddha Sangsad will desperately look to improve their profile against Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club when they take on the new leviathans in a crucial Grameenphone Bangladesh League fixture at the Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has so far made little progress in appointing a new head coach for the national team.//////The GP-BCB National Cricket Academy started the last leg of their series against the touring South Africa Academy on a positive note, winning the first of two T20s by 26 runs courtesy of brilliant bowling and some lusty hitting from Alauddin Babu at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday. //////A fine half-century by Eoin Morgan went in vain as Kochi pulled off a 17-run upset win over Kolkata Knight Riders on Thursday to spice up the race for the play-offs in the Indian Premier League.//////Kieron Pollard provided a late flourish with the bat and Lasith Malinga picked up three wickets as table-toppers Mumbai Indians beat bottom-placed Pune Warriors by 21 runs in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Wednesday.//////Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad were appointed as the new captains of England's one-day international (ODI) and Twenty20 teams respectively, it was announced here on Thursday.//////South Africa's home Test series against Australia will be played over just two matches -- as opposed to the customary three of recent times -- with a packed international cricket calendar being offered as the reason.

Imagine bin Laden living there with his family; and the ISI knowing nothing about it! Seems very surprising! There seems to be "many a slip, between the cup and the lip", as the popular saying goes! Pakistan's ISI is today at the bottom of the 'rubbish bin', worldwide!//////The players of Bangladesh Cricket Team have become known as Tigers all over the world. We become highly delighted whenever our team wins a match, especially against a powerful team. But what about our real tigers? Do we care for them? The lives of the tigers in the Sundarbans are in jeopardy. Various factors are responsible for this. For example, the illegal intruders in the Sundarbans are cutting trees indiscriminately and hunting the wild animals. Moreover, climate change and other manmade problems are making the Sundarbans ecologically imbalanced. As a result, availability of food and hunting ground of tigers are decreasing day by day. So, the govt. has to take immediate initiatives to protect the tigers, otherwise tigers will be extinct very soon in the Sundarbans.//////With the honest intention of saving the poor people from the onslaught of ever-increasing price of rice, the govt. has been selling rice at a reduced rate through Open Market Sales (OMS) throughout the country. But very often the rice sold at OMS centres is of such a low quality that it is only usable as poultry feed. It is actually a mixture of particles (Khud) of different varieties of rice full of husks and grits. The rice seems to have lost its original colour and emits a bad odour. Perhaps it had remained heaped up in godowns for years. It will be nice if the authorities do not consider OMS as govt. charity and the people who queue up to buy OMS rice as beggars!//////Apparently, the whole world was taken aback by the pomp and grandeur of the British fairytale royal nuptial on 29 April 2011. To the awe of the spectators, this couple was much brighter than the movie stars. And indeed they have to be, as they are the real prince and the real princess. //////The ruling government is changing names of the old famous structures and also naming every newly built structure after the name of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Every famous place, whether it's a hospital or bridge or conference center, is getting the same name. On the other hand, same name for different things is creating huge confusion. And some changes are really difficult to remember. I sincerely request the govt. to stop this useless name changing game. Because, we all know that your work will make you memorable, not your name. //////It was in the school I read about the Geiger-Muller counter in our nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry subjects. Since then I heard a little about its extensive use. But after the recent devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the use of Geiger-Muller counter increased tremendously as the disaster caused serious damage to some of the nuclear power plants. //////Congratulations to Md.

This is a profitable business in the name of providing education. The recent annual reports published by the UGC indicate that private universities are widely offering business oriented courses to produce graduates and post graduates. There are many universities which are running without having the UGC's approval. Thus, the quality of education has deteriorated alarmingly. Also, foreign culture is being widely exercised in those universities, which has a long term detrimental effects on our moral values. It is high time the govt. stopped giving permission to set up any more private university. //////If one takes a closer look at the American presidents, one shall see that soon after assumption of the office, they begin to grow grey hairs and appear to be older than usual, which presumably results from thoughts and worries.//////On 26th April 2011, a news was published in The Daily Star that a student of an English medium school in Dhaka stopped attending school because an administrator hit her and six others with a wooden ruler for protesting the expulsion of two classmates. This is unacceptable. //////Clashes among student groups are becoming front page news in the national dailies. We observe that clash between activists of two political parties are more ferocious than that of two factions of a same party. Some days ago such a clash between two factions of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) took place at Dhaka University over establishing supremacy at the dormitory that left 50 hurt. In the past, many promising students were killed and injured in these types of clashes. These sorts of incidents mostly occurred between pro-BNP and pro-AL activists. Even over a trivial matter, the activists used to entangle themselves in the fierce clash using illegal arms. //////Our dearest Rasul (pbuh) often prayed to Allah to protect him from poverty. He says, ''The utter state of poverty leads a person to become even a 'kafir' (atheist)." Poverty is obviously a big hindrance to any type of development of the country. So, the authorities concerned should soon take some urgent initiatives to alleviate poverty from our society.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.

The puzzled friend asked what that was supposed to mean, and the man replied that he woke up every hour and cried.

For Obama there could not have been perhaps a more opportune moment. His popularity was sliding, the ratings of his Democratic party had come down, and in spite of the public uprising in different parts of the Maghreb and the Middle-East championing democracy, human rights and reforms, things did not appear to be under his control. //////The British East India Company disbands the 34th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry whose sepoy Mangal Pandey had earlier revolted against the British and is considered to be the First Martyr in the War of Indian Independence. //////Last week one of my friends showed me his new smartphone with a lot of excitement, which he bought recently.
