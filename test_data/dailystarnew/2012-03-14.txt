In other words, he was advocating two governments for the two regions of Pakistan. On the demand that power at the centre be handed over to the Awami League, he stated that such a move could be made only if the AL decided to shelve its Six Point plan. It was clearly a position Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was not willing to adopt. //////The eldest son of film actor ATM Shamsuzzaman was stabbed to death by his youngest brother in the capital's Sutrapur yesterday afternoon. //////The High Court yesterday directed the government to take effective steps immediately to stop construction of all kinds of structures on the Cox's Bazar sea beach till further order.//////Bangladesh yesterday sought the support of the European Union (EU) in resolving the long-standing issue of repatriation of Rohingya refugees.//////The International Crimes Tribunal yesterday rejected all six petitions submitted by BNP lawmaker Salauddin Quader Chowdhury.//////Five al-Qaeda militants were killed in an air strike on their car in Yemen's Bayda province yesterday after deadly unrest there, and with the air force blasting jihadist positions in nearby Abyan, security officials said.//////President Barack Obama and Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron offered a united front yesterday on many global issues, including in Afghanistan, ahead of talks between the two leaders.//////A court in Myanmar yesterday sentenced a leader of the Karen ethnic minority group to two decades in prison for treason, his legal adviser said, in a case that has soured peace efforts.//////In the last few days this newspaper has been highly critical of the manner in which the BNP's 'Dhaka Cholo' programme was handled by the AL.

Begum Zia has given three months to the government to announce the restoration of the caretaker system, otherwise she will launch a movement to dislodge it. //////A survey of Save the Children informs that children aged between 12 and 18 do not receive proper treatment from public hospitals and health complexes. The survey, conducted on 466 children of 64 districts, shows that about 69 per cent of those could barely access healthcare facilities.

Their ultimate hope is to secure a reliable job. But it is a predicament for most of the private university graduates that they have to face a bleak and discriminated recruitment circular by the department of Human Resource Management (HRM) of many private companies, banks and academic institutions. Whether a candidate is qualified or not can be determined after her/his going through a competitive written test and viva-voce. But it is very illogical and unlawful to deter the private university graduates from appearing in the recruitment tests by mentioning only a few universities eligible in the circular recruitment we are observing in the daily newspapers and websites. Such kind of open discriminatory circulars discourage and frustrate the university graduates from achieving academic excellence. To ensure the quality of education is the collaborative duty of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the university authorities. It will be an injustice to make most of the private university graduates victims of Private University Act 1992. So the UGC and the respective university authority concerned should come forward to resist the HRM policy of many companies who are openly discriminating, rejecting and consistently barring the private university graduates from appearing in the recruitment tests.//////That day I went to Dhaka by train. The living condition of the people living in the slums set up all along the rail lines stretching from airport to Kamalapur station appalled me when I compared it with that of those living in those flats, condos and luxury dwellings quarters mushrooming in the city. Some rich people have got bathroom fittings worth taka one lakh, while the slum dwellers hardly have space to lie on let alone lavatory. Who is there to mitigate this discrimination? We must all sacrifice some of our luxury for the welfare of those ill-fated people otherwise we will remain mean in the eye of the civilized people of the world and Allah will definitely punish us for our sin of miserliness and selfishness. //////We are passing very hard time now-a-days. People are busy about their own interest rather than the interest of their neighbours. Sometimes, we do not even think of the other members of our family. Such practice is common among the helpers of town service buses and other vehicles as they drop passengers in the middle of the busy streets violating rules and regulations. It is a serious matter causing accidents which can be seen from the newspapers' headlines. Local services are always in competition resorting to pushing and pulling to win the race to get more passengers. The government should take stern steps to check the undisciplined transport sector to save the lives of people.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and many other ministers seem to have become blind with power and are failing to distinguish right from wrong and making comments which are totally unacceptable to the people.

Majority people belong to the low income group. More than 30 percent of the population are ultra-poor, while more than 60 percent of them live on the poverty line. Access to modern medical facilities is merely a dream for them. But most of the doctors advise a lot of tests and of prescribe costly medicines. //////Nakhalpara is situated at the heart of Dhaka City's Tejgaon area near the office of the Prime Minister. But the area remained ignored and neglected by Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) for long. Many real estate companies have built hundreds of apartments in this area. The roads and lanes of this area are very narrow and both sides of the roads are occupied by the grabbers. //////First of all, I would like to salute Akram Khan, former captain and chief selector of Bangladesh Cricket Team for his bold decision to resign from his duty of the chief selector. He once again proved his personality by protesting against the misconduct of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).

BCB Chairman and the Technical Committee.//////It is regrettable that Bangladesh lost the opening match of the Asia Cup against Pakistan from a winning position entirely due to the poor performance of Mashrafee. This is not the first time he has done this. He did the same thing against Zimbabwe where due to his mistakes Bangladesh lost the entire series and not just that particular match. //////The Adviser to the Prime Minister Dr. Tawfiq e Elahi Chowdhury announced the other day that the domestic users are wasting gas as they get it cheap.

Offenders will face a minimum of six months behind bars and Rs.100,000 ($1,100) in fines.//////In recent weeks and months, the issue of macroeconomic stability has received a good deal of attention in Bangladesh. The concern appears to have arisen from a number of relatively recent developments in the economy that include: (i) persistence of high inflation, (ii) excessive government borrowing from the banking system, (iii) depreciation of the domestic currency, (iv) decline in foreign exchange reserve, and the (v) continued ill health of the country's stock market. //////One does not have to be a political analyst to understand that the AL-led ruling alliance did everything that could possibly be done to strangle the opposition's fundamental political rights to hold the March 12 rally. But one surely has to go deeper to comprehend first the undemocratic manner in which all these were done and secondly the goals that the ruling alliance sought to realize through these means. //////Happy Friday," I said to a reader on (you guessed it) Friday last week. Normally, I would consider this one of my less controversial statements. But he thought otherwise, narrowing his eyes. "Yes," he said. "Only it's really Saturday, right?"//////
