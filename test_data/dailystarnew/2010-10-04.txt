There have been ninety such deaths between January and September of the current year. And the aggregate figure killed since early January 2009 when the Awami League coalition government assumed office, that exceeds 200, conveys a horrendous picture. That is what causes us concern, and calls for a government probe into the magnitude of the number. //////The Awami League advisory council has urged Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to ensure that ministers, advisors and party lawmakers do not, in their public pronouncements, use language that might turn the media hostile to the government. We welcome the advice, given the fact that in recent weeks it has been the hostility of certain leading figures of the government towards the media that has surprised the country by its vehemence. Lawmakers have most unfortunately engaged in a bad demonstration of media-bashing in the Jatiya Sangsad, to a point where unseemly attacks were made on the person of the editor of a reputed newspaper. It was an attack that was not only unprecedented but also deeply disturbing, especially when juxtaposed against the government's repeated assertions that it believes in a free press. Then again, attempts by some powerful elements in the ruling party to dismiss the disturbing happenings in Pabna as a media exaggeration only surprised citizens because they were all aware of the truth.//////After making an impressive debut in the Commonwealth Games 20 years ago with a gold and few bronze medals in New Zealand, Bangladesh have since performed inconsistently in the showpiece event.

These walkways are not really commuter-friendly, many of them having cracks and others having litters of all sorts lying here and there. Still a good number of people use them either to save time or money or both as travelling by other means ensures getting stuck in traffic jams. But it seems that people now have to find an alternative to walking on footpaths, because a new trend is on the rise- parking and driving vehicles on footpaths. Now-a-days people are often seen riding their motorbikes or bicycles on footpaths causing immense discomfort to commuters. If the roads are congested, these bikers simply drive onto footpaths. Astonishingly, some policemen are appreciating this outrageous act by performing it themselves. It is extremely dangerous to drive a vehicle on footpaths. The driver can easily injure himself or others. Besides driving, some people also use footpaths as parking places. Parking cars or bikes on footpaths compels people to get down from the footpath, which can lead to accidents. All these can be avoided if everyone respects traffic laws and tries to abide by them. And if someone does not, the law enforcers should be on hand to take action. Vehicles are meant for the roads, not for footpaths.//////With the arrival of the specially designed equipment, hopefully the 33 trapped Chilean miners shall soon be rescued. It is heartening to know that after an ordeal of couple of months, the trapped miners shall finally be rescued, as reported by Al Jazeera Television. It would require almost a day to rescue all the trapped miners, said the report. May Almighty Allah save their lives!//////Corporal punishment is still being practiced in the classrooms, as Sir Frank Peters predicted. I have received many phone calls from the upset parents who were telling me that there has been no change in the teachers' attitude and they continue to beat the students, as if they are above the law. After all, they are the 'highly-respected' teachers -the supreme power in a classroom.//////Traffic jam in Dhaka city is getting intolerable day by day. The government is planning for building monorails, circuit rails or metro rails which are in fact quite ambitious and time consuming ventures. If the govt. builds some flyovers in some key points of Dhaka instead, traffic jam will be reduced obviously. //////Recently I had the opportunity to travel by United Airways (BD) Ltd. from Dhaka to Kathmandu. It is encouraging to learn from their brochure that the United Airways has made remarkable progress as a private airliner after its inception in 2007 with only one Dash 8-100 aircraft. Now the airlines have a number of jet aircrafts with its routes to several domestic and international destinations. It has been stated that the United Airways has plan to increase both of their fleets and flights in the near future. //////Is promoting maths and science education the best way to stimulate future innovation? This was a question asked at an international debate moderated by a respectable weekly. Well, the answer can be both 'yes' and 'no.' Of course, maths and science play an important role. But I believe that true innovation comes from a solid education, which includes liberal arts as well as economics, business and various disciplinary fields with different worldviews. Improved education in all fields might have a more successful result. Learning to develop thinking does not necessarily come from highly structured classes of maths and science. Many innovators in history were philosophers. There are many examples of innovations by the men who did not have maths and science education. Aristotle's views about science were remarkable though he was not educated in science. Gottfried Leibniz was educated in philosophy, but he had contributed a lot to maths and science. Einstein did not start out in math. He said that imagination is everything. These are just a few examples of where innovation and creativity comes from.//////Ibrahim died in a dubious situation. The case got disproportionate media attention as the alleged murder took place in the jeep of a ruling party MP. The gun used in the killing belongs to the same MP. Police after unusual reluctance lodged a murder case and promptly arrested two persons who immediately made confessional statements implicating themselves. The case appears to be solved and ready to be tried in the court. But media and general public appear not fully convinced. They want to know whether the police version is oversimplified or something is being concealed. The state minister for law who is also a lawyer at one stage indicated that the MP may be charged for unauthorized use of his licensed gun. It also appears that at initial stage some attempts were taken to hide the facts and even destroy evidences. The victim was taken to a private clinic in old Dhaka area, the blood stained seat of jeep was washed, dead body was left at DMCH emergency as unidentified and at last an unnatural death case was started by the killer driver himself. These irregularities need careful examination. Investigators should not jump to conclusions quickly. Provisions of arms act and regulation should also be analysed. In certain situation absolute custody of licensed arm is necessary. //////Filing false cases is another sign of our social decay. This is an effective tool for a wealthy and powerful person to harass another person by using law. It is observed that the law enforcers' responses to the false cases are prompter than that of the genuine cases. May be one day the falsely accused persons would be proven and declared innocent by the court, but in the meantime his family would be destroyed. However, I believe that at least the law enforcing agencies, through their sincere and honest investigation, can reduce the number of false cases.//////As many TV channels are being operated in Bangladesh, we are getting many high standard programmes on different channels. The competition is so tough that if the viewers find any distasteful programme on any channel, they can change the channel at once. Therefore, every channel authorities are careful about the standard of their programmes. But CTV (Chittagong Television) is different from other channels where some unskilled persons are making low standard programmes. The inhabitants of Chittagong who do not have satellite connections are bound to watch it. I think it is a complete waste of money and time. The government can utilise that money in other development works. I think either skilled people should operate CTV or government should ban this channel.//////Our prime minister deserves kudos for raising the war crime issue in the United Nations. She was also vocal in enumerating atrocities by her rival parties to her family and party members quite forgetting what her party men are doing now to the opposition all over the county. We are very pleased that she uttered the word 'justice' in her speech. I hope she will do justice to her utterance of justice by administering justice where breaking the laws by the ruling party has become the norm.//////From the news telecast by CNN on September 27, 2010, I learned that a Jewish boat is heading towards Gaza carrying aids, despite the Israeli blockade, there are ten people on board including Jews and other nationals. A passenger of the boat Yanatan Shapiral said that all Jewish people do not support their government's actions against the Palestinians, they think it most unjust and they want the world to know it. He also said that let the Israeli authorities handcuff them and the whole world will see the event.//////We were stuck with awe and astonishment to read in the news that a group of pro-Awami League doctors from Swadhinata Chikitshak Parishad (SCP) and Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) allegedly assaulted Professor Dr. Pran Gopal Dutt, the Vice Chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), after not being selected for the posts of medical officer. Moreover, these outsiders had a meeting with the leaders of SCP and BMA at the academic council room of BSMMU violating the rules of the university. It has become a norm of the ruling party men to swoop on responsible people who do not cater to their petty and unjust interests. Even an imminent medical professional like Professor Dr. Pran Gopal Dutt has not been spared. We deeply resent the attack on this prominent personality of the country and demand that those responsible for the heinous act be brought to justice.//////At present, a person in the country can apply for a job in public services till 30 years of his or her age. However, for the offspring of freedom fighters the age limit is 32 years. Those who did not register their real age in SSC or Dakhil level are thought to be conscious, even lucky ones. Because, they will get more chances to apply for jobs than those who did not reduce their age during the registration. It seems that the truthful failed and the untruthful won the race!//////Over the last few days many local dailies reported the litany of violence and killings all over Bangladesh. It seems that even the police are beating up and sadistically killing people! One wonders if "Law & Order" has forsaken Bangladesh in General and Dhaka in particular?//////It refers to the published editorial in The Daily Star on September 28,2010 entitled "Right to Know Day, Reap the benefits of RTI." The Right To Information (RTI) Act is no doubt a progressive instrument of democracy empowering citizens to obtain information. At the same time, the government cannot be faulted for proposing to exempt file notings from the Act's purview. As rightly pointed out by the media experts, the disclosure of file notings will harm the process of decision making as officials will refrain from rendering objective advice. The best course would be to have a full-fledged debate on the issue before introducing the amendment. The government's withdrawal of the move to dilute the RTI Act is doubtless a significant victory for the people of Bangladesh. Who would want to dilute the Act except those who have something to hide? RTI activists should not become complacent though. Like a dormant virus, the amendments can reappear with virulence. In order to exercise the freedom of speech and expression effectively, we need an informed public opinion. The right to knowledge includes the right to information. The right to information thus flows out of freedom of speech and expression. //////Rangpur Medical College and Hospital has lost its past glory. On 26th July 2010 I went to RMCH to see my ailing brother. I found him lying in a dirty bed of a general ward along with other patients. I had been there for quite some time but no doctor or nurse visited the ward to enquire about the patients. //////The US State Department issued a formal alert Sunday warning Americans travelling in Europe to remain vigilant against "the potential for terrorist attacks" and urging precaution in public places and transportation systems.//////Pakistan has sent a team to Afghanistan to probe a cross-border Nato attack that allegedly killed three Pakistani soldiers, forcing a key border crossing to close, officials said yesterday.//////Afghanistan has begun disbanding private security companies operating in the country, shutting down eight firms and seizing over 400 weapons, the Interior Ministry said yesterday.//////Softening his tone, al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden issued a humanitarian appeal on Saturday urging Muslim governments to do more to help Pakistan's flood victims and expressing worry about climate change.
