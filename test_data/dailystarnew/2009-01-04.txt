That the tendentious disorder is erupting in spite of the exhortations and instructions of the AL chief for her party loyalists (some of them post-election turncoats) to apply restraint in their behaviour is a proof enough that all out effort will have to be made to checkmate the incidence of violence. //////THE aggressive actions of the Israeli government against Hamas in the last one week have been as outrageous as they have been morally upsetting for all men and women of conscience across the globe. As matters stand, Israeli strikes have killed an altogether 429 people, with casualty figures rising all the time. More than 2000 Palestinians have been wounded, most of them severely. Buildings, including a mosque, scores of homes and offices have been razed to the ground.

All of us should contribute towards making a better Bangladesh. It would be highly appreciated if the opposition parties do not engage themselves in finding the government's faults only.

Even our students, from a very early age, are preparing themselves to be eligible to earn money. They're studying not to gather knowledge but for earning money in future! Is there anything else in our lives except money?//////The judicial department is the last hope of the people. There is an aphorism that money buys justice. This is not totally false, as any sensible and conscious citizen can understand the difference in application of law in case of an ordinary citizen and a so-called VIP. Why such discrimination? The 1861 police regulation act formulated by the then British government is still being applied in our context, though the rules are obsolete and contradictory to many human rights issues, but they are not being changed or reformed, as the rules are necessary to protect the interest of our ruling class.//////Despite the fact that African nations are enriched with natural minerals it is sad to see that still most of the people of the African continent live below poverty line.

While the people of the African nations suffer, the countries who buy these minerals enjoy lavish lifestyles. Recently, a coup occurred in Guinea by the country's young army officers after the death of its long time dictator Lansana Conte died. //////There is a popular Chinese saying-//////If you plan for a year , sow a seed.//////If you plan for a decade, plant a plant.//////If you plan for a century, teach the people.//////'' Learn swimming, save life'' -- No , this is not an advertisement of a Swimming Training Academy.
