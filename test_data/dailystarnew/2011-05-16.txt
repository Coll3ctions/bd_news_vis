As a doctor I see the physical damage regularly.//////Elephants of Bangladesh are starving. The forests of Bangladesh have become smaller in size and are no longer typical rain forests with various types of big and small trees and plants which provide abodes and food to varieties of birds and animals. These have been replaced by jungles of several varieties of foreign trees which can be used as firewood for brickfields, domestic purposes, curing tobacco and making inferior quality furniture. The photograph of elephants eating water hyacinth published in your esteemed daily recently is heartrending. Emaciated and starving elephants are being compelled to change their ancient food habits. They are now making forays into villages situated in the outskirts of their natural habitat, at times killing or injuring villagers and destroying their thatched homes. On the other hand, thousands of acres of fertile paddy fields in the valleys in hills remain untilled because of fear of elephants. The net result of this situation is sufferings, of both elephants and humans. Sincere desire of the govt. and a meticulous planning and vigorous, coordinated action by the ministry of forest, ministry of agriculture and law enforcing authorities could correct this intolerable situation.//////In the present competitive global market trend, regional and sub-regional co-operation is essential for sustainable growth. In Asia, there exist at least 4-5 regional and sub-regional co-operations for the promotion of tourism, among which Bangladesh is a member country. Some of those are Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), Bay of Bengal of Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Asia Productivity Organization (APO). The objectives of all these co-operations are to pursue common goals that are regional development, employment generation and poverty reduction through co-operation of various issues. Tourism is one of those issues. But the progress is very tardy of these cooperation due to various reasons and fund constraints. Different meetings and seminars on tourism of these forums determined to promote South Asia as a single tourist destination. For having an effective result, there needs a strong co-operation and political will of the member countries.//////Thanks to the government's initiative to fix the fares of CNGs, the drivers are now asking for Tk. 20/- more than what is registered on the meter. The reason? Now the meter is showing too small a fare. Previously, the fare used to be Tk. 100/- for a trip from Banani to Baily Road. Thanks to the new rate, the meter shows Tk. 70/-. It makes sense to ask for the extra twenty, right? It seems that whatever the government does to reduce the sufferings of the public, the CNG drivers will find their logic to impose their rules of fare. I fail to understand why the govt. fails to adjust their plans. The public has to be at the mercy of the drivers to go with the legal rate. //////Boat race is one of the traditional sports of entertainment of riverine Bangladesh. The race is held mainly in rural areas and organised by the rural people of Gopalganj, Madaripur, Norail, Munshiganj, Narayanganj, Pabna, Sirajganj, Sylhet, Brahmanbaria, Narsingdi, etc. //////Our telecommunications minister announced on May 10 at a function in the capital that the 3G (third-generation) mobile network would be launched in Bangladesh by this year. We hailed it. Actually, this service has long been active in a number of countries of the world. So, we also would like the authorities concerned to take immediate step in this connection.//////France has banned using veils which some Muslim women regard as a religious duty. France is also reported to have arrested two Muslim women violating the ban. French women are displaying their bodies in public. On the other hand, French nuns are wearing a special dress covering from leg to head.//////It seems the government has given a dark force license to abduct, maim and murder those opposed to it. In the absence of any accountability, RAB is serving the wishes of the government by monopolizing its position as a demigod among the Bangladeshis. //////Last year the High Court declared corporal punishment in schools unlawful. Sir Frank Peters wrote: Any teacher or headmaster who engages in corporal punishment is an enemy of a student, family and state, now that corporal punishment has been outlawed. It could not be said more simply than that.//////A former law minister recently called this government a autocratic. Ironically, he was the Vice President under a military dictator. Dictators are hated species around the globe, for they lack legitimacy as they are not public representatives. //////Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire co-founder of Galleon Group Hedge Fund has been found guilty of insider-trading, fraud and conspiracy. He illegally traded on 35+ stocks including names like Intel, IBM, Hilton and Google.

Surprisingly, it is alive and nurtured in Bangladesh by RAB; who seem to be proud of their animal like cruelty! //////Recently the White House has released the long form of President Barack Obama's birth certificate in response to festering questions about whether he was born in the United States. Production of birth certificate by an American President to prove his American citizenship and to confirm his President candidature is really unfortunate. I cannot believe to have such a treatment in a highly civilized country like the United States! Had Obama not been born in the United States, how he received the majority votes? Was he a stranger to his supporters? Meanwhile I warmly appreciate President Obama's initiative to end the on-going debate over his birthplace and I sincerely wish his success in the office of the President.//////Abbotabad will open, not a can of worms, but a barrel of venomous serpents. A deluge of awkward questions will follow. The picture, shorn of all verbiage shows an unarmed middle-aged man shot to death with admittedly only his wife resisting, while other wives and a dozen children were mute spectators. It is irrelevant that his head had a price-tag of $ 25 million, allegedly for a crime that he was never formally charged with, tried or convicted in a court of law. But is it irrelevant, the killers were one nationality, came from another country and completed their 'contract/supari' in a third? What happened to the sanctity of national boundaries? Where is the sovereignty of independent states that the 'civilized' countries love to teach? Extra-judicial killings are nothing new. The young puppy has been doing it with impunity for years. Now the tail is wagging the dog! //////Pakistan's spy agency has stopped sharing intelligence with the CIA following the unilateral US operation to kill Osama bin Laden as a report revealed.//////Israeli gunfire killed 12 people and wounded hundreds yesterday as Palestinians marched on Israel's borders with Lebanon, Syria and Gaza in a mass show of mourning over the creation of the Jewish state.//////Thailand is interested in an asylum seeker deal similar to the one Canberra plans with Malaysia as Prime Minister Julia Gillard reiterated yesterday that new boat people will not be processed in Australia.//////Japan yesterday started the first evacuations of homes outside a government exclusion zone after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled one of the country's nuclear power plants.//////Tensions between the US and Pakistan over the killing of Osama bin Laden and a speedier US withdrawal from Afghanistan are likely to reinforce China and Pakistan's already strong ties, analysts say.//////The head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has been charged yesterday by New York police over an alleged sex attack on a hotel maid.//////The UN special envoy was yesterday headed for Libya to urge a ceasefire between Muammar Gaddafi's troops and rebels seeking to topple the strongman, as an anti-regime revolt entered a fourth month.//////The billionaire founder of Blackwater Worldwide, a scandal-plagued US security firm accused of abuses in Iraq, was hired by the crown prince of Abu Dhabi to put together an 800-member battalion of foreign troops, The New York Times reported yesterday.//////US Senator John Kerry said yesterday relations with key ally Pakistan were at a "critical moment" as he headed from Kabul to Islamabad as the first senior US visitor since the death of Osama bin Laden.//////Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been put "under a spell" by his chief of staff Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie, an ultra-conservative cleric was quoted by local media yesterday as saying.//////An Indian soldier was killed when Pakistani snipers allegedly shot across the sensitive border in divided Kashmir, an Indian paramilitary official said yesterday, leading to a gunfight.//////It was the first, live televised press conference in US history, and President John F Kennedy beamed his 200-watt smile as he looked across the assembled media gathered in the cavernous, newly opened State Department auditorium. //////Clashes between Muslims and Christians in the centre of Cairo have left 51 people wounded, the health ministry said yesterday, as Coptic Christians pursued a sit-in protest against the violence.//////Militia and mercenaries loyal to Ivory Coast strongman Laurent Gbagbo killed 220 people while fleeing through the southwest of the country, a spokesman for President Alassane Ouattara said on Saturday.//////A Saudi mother said yesterday she defied a ban on women drivers in the ultra-conservative kingdom by getting behind the wheel for four days without being stopped.//////North Korea and Iran are suspected of sharing ballistic missile technology, according to a UN sanctions report which China has sought to block, diplomats said yesterday.//////US army engineers have opened yesterday floodgates in Louisiana that will inundate up to 3,000 sq miles of land in an attempt to protect large cities along the Mississippi River.//////Belarus on Saturday jailed opposition leader Andrei Sannikov for five years on charges of organising protests after the disputed re-election of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.//////Somali pirates received a ransom of seven million dollars for the release of two Spanish hostages held for four and a half months, a pirate said yesterday.//////The US Navy ship from where Osama bin Laden was buried at sea arrived in the Philippines for a port call yesterday, but the crew avoided any mention of the historic incident.//////Pakistani hoteliers in the now notorious town where Osama bin Laden was killed by elite US forces are praying the views and balmy weather still reel in bumper tourist numbers this year.//////Suzanne Mubarak, wife of toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, was expected to undergo open-heart surgery yesterday night, the manager of the Sharm el-Sheikh Hospital said.//////The Taliban once banned all television, music and cinema in Afghanistan, but now they are fighting their war via Twitter, the online messaging network that revolutionised global communication.//////Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil al-Arabi was unanimously elected Arab League chief yesterday, an AFP correspondent at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo said.//////Book launch programmes are becoming more frequents than ever in Dhaka these days -- a positive trend.

The routing of the party's 34-year sway in West Bengal at the hands of the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamul Congress (TMC) seems to have shaken it at the base. The major partner of the Left Front, CPI (M) won only in 40 seats, down from 176 last time. It even lost this time by two seats to Congress, which won 42 seats and played a crucial role in TMC's victory. //////One of the more bewildering aspects of electoral democracy is the mesmerising power of false comfort. It stretches from silly posturing to incomprehensible self-delusion, but nothing illustrates its meaninglessness better than the answer to an obvious question: what does a politician hope to achieve by denying a truth that is glaringly evident to everyone else, and will be officially confirmed within 48 or 72 hours? Nothing. //////
