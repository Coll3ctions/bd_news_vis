We find hardly any words strong enough to condemn these mindless acts, barbarity which reduces lives to chaos and disfigures the fabric of society. On Wednesday, even as Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh was on a visit to Bangladesh, a bomb explosion outside the High Court in New Delhi left 11 people dead and as many as 76 injured. The figures could go higher, as they usually do in such circumstances. On the same day, suicide attacks by the Taliban in Quetta left 24 people dead and no fewer than 86 others receiving injuries. In the case of the attack in Delhi, the notorious Huji outfit has reportedly claimed responsibility by e-mail.

He wrote about the respected social activist who was on a hunger strike vowing not to end it until the government would eliminate corruption. He wished that there was one Anna Hazare in our country where corruption was devouring every public sector. But it seems he has forgotten that this is Bangladesh, and not India. Here patriots like Anna Hazare may go on a hunger strike, but it will not have any effect.//////During construction of a building, especially in a densely populated residential area like Dhanmondi or Uttara, developers are hardly respecting the ethics of living. I do not know if there is a guideline or law about how and when to start and close the work every day or what should be the highest permissible decibel level of noise at a construction site but this matter must be brought to the attention of the authorities. //////Use of polythene bags was banned by the government a few years back, but environment friendly jute bags are not being used largely all over Bangladesh.

However, I had the opportunity to talk with many people who stayed in Libya for a few years. I found that everybody was highly impressed with the leadership of Gaddafi.

Gaddafi may not have been elected by the people but he has ensured food, housing, education and medical facilities to all the citizens which most of the governments (even the so-called democratic, but corrupt governments) failed to give. Western world needs both Libyan blood and oil. They got the first one and will get the oil soon. The world is for mighty people and not for the good people at this moment. //////Was that at all necessary to arrest a lawyer from his house in front of his beloved family members at dead of night? The deceased M U Ahmed was a lawyer of the Supreme Court, who was not a fugitive. While some of his colleagues were hiding from the law, he was sincere enough to be staying at home. So, what prompted the police to pick him up to the intelligence office in the dark?

It questions her loyalty to non-performing ministers and is non-appreciative of her overall vision. Please note: one minister, who also is also a trade union president, recommends issuance of 25,000 driving licenses to anyone who can differentiate between a cow and a goat. Human beings don't count. Another one advocates that the malnourished people of Bangladesh (except the Fat Cats) should eat less; on the lines of Somalia?//////Eyes are the most precious organs of our body and eyesight is the greatest gift from the Almighty. So, it is extremely essential to take proper care of our eyes so that our eyesight remains active when we become old. Lutein and Zeaxanthin are two powerful antioxidants which greatly help in protecting our eyesight. These antioxidants perform two roles: (i) absorb excess photon energy (blue light) and (ii) quench free radicals before they damage the lipid membranes.//////For China low value of currency is an advantage as China emphasizes maximum export and minimum import. Our currency value is also low. We have to think like China how we can make the right use of it.

It was high on promise but low on delivery or something else that's hard to explain. Or, may be they are making too much fuss about it. May be it was meant to be like this. A humble host got carried away because a prominent guest was coming. //////Praful Patel had a good point to make. "If such a Bill is passed," the former Union minister for civil aviation and present Union minister for some portfolio which escapes my memory, said "bureaucrats like a joint secretary will be running the sports federation. What is their competence in sports administration?"//////It is refreshing on no-loss-no-gain basis, instructive and can be good for the future, if a little too dramatic for anyone's comfort, far less that of Dr. Manmohan Singh and Sheikh Hasina. The failure hasn't been exactly an "orphan," nor has the degree of success had any "fathers." If crisis is an opportunity, then this certainly promises to be one. The failed negotiation with the moral thrown up has a guiding implication we need to press into service to cut corners of sensitive deals. //////The recent visit of the Indian prime minister was more important than any other previous meeting as it was hoped that many things would be discussed and many problems resolved. But just before his arrival, the outcome of the meeting was almost clear to the people of Bangladesh through the refusal of Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of Paschimbanga, to be a part of the Indian team; and later on through the press briefing of the foreign secretary of India that the two countries were not going to take any decision regarding the Teesta river. //////Shykh Seraj, who turned 55 in June, is an innovative and intuitive genius in the mainstream media of Bangladesh.
