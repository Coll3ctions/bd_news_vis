It is so because it happened in an unnatural manner, allegedly at the hands of some villagers. It has emerged that the death of Asaduzzaman was the result of a confrontational situation between students and villagers, portents for which reportedly existed. Adding to the tragedy is the fact that it was a case of mistaken identity that led to Asaduzzaman's death. Predictably, it led to consequences we are all too familiar with.

I only put on lights in rooms which are essential and that too only one lamp and a fan when necessary. My living room lights are usually off unless I have some guests. I was wondering if we all could use electricity very prudently and when and where it is necessary. I think we could all contribute in saving power and bring down the number of power outage in a day. I get surprised when I see many apartments having scores of lights on after dusk which can be avoided.//////It is very difficult to find any footpath especially of Dhaka city which is not occupied by unauthorized people. We always say poor businessmen such as " Hawkers" occupy footpath and make them dirty. I agree that they are responsible for making footpath dirty but only partially. But at the same time it is almost impossible to find any footpath in Dhaka city which is not occupied by developers and/or where vehicles are not parked. Developers not only occupy footpath but also destroy them. I have never seen any developer repair the footpath after their work is finished. Moreover, the whole area remains dirty and dusty till the developers finish their work. After the finish of work of one developer another developer starts working nearby. Hence, the footpath remains dirty and occupied. The government should strictly enforce the rules so that people can walk through footpaths.//////Bangladesh's development efforts have, in recent years, been severely frustrated by the devastating impacts of natural disasters which are a result of climate change. Erratic rainfall and deviation in temperature are going to bring critical changes in the country's rice farming pattern seriously affecting crop yields thus causing serious food insecurity, according to experts. A study, conducted by Action Aid Bangladesh, says erratic rainfall in the rainy season is going to affect the food grains production. According to the Meteorological Office, the country experienced 32 percent less rain than normal during the June-July period the last year. Prolonged summer and shorter rainy and winter seasons has only increased the trend of droughts and desertification, inflicting an adverse impact on the country's agro-based economy. //////The image of children scouring for metals and scraps in a garbage dump speak volumes about the woefully miserable and pitiable state of the have-nots, especially children. We, as citizens of Bangladesh, should hang our heads in shame. That children of seven and eight are forced to sift through hazardous waste on a daily basis to contribute to the income of their families is shocking. It is indeed saddening to know that when they are supposed to be in school, the unfortunate children are wading through used bandages, syringes and old batteries to salvage some metal pieces and plastic containers. The government should take serious note of the inconvenient truth. Child rag pickers are deprived of love and education and are at high risk of being exploited by others, especially bandits and those running junkyards. Children resort to street life due to their instinct to survive in hard life conditions. //////It is heartening to learn that on the basis of the assurance given by the Information Minister and the Law Minister, the journalists, press workers and the general employees of THE BANGLADESH OBSERVER newspaper have deferred their scheduled fast unto death programme to press home implementation of the agreement till 19 April. It is sincerely hoped that the agreement signed between the owners and the journalists, press workers and general employees of The Bangladesh Observer will soon be implemented allowing Observer employees to take a fresh breath in comfort after several years of suffering!//////This is one of the areas of medical profession, which keeps them under tremendous pressure, especially the specialists. Many countries have this problem, there are many cases where a cancer drug was provided instead of the drug for some other ailment, instruments were left in the body, operation was performed on wrong limb/eye because of lack of co-ordination among the medical staff. In Saudi Arabia we have people from different countries working together in a single place. Hence it is important that the communication should be clear. The employees should undergo regular refresher courses on understanding various factors leading to medical errors. A good labelling system should be in place. A proper integrated approach will definitely help in reducing the number of medical errors. //////Re: Water pipeline a blessing for Satkhira villagers by Reaz Ahmad, Daily Star Monday April 5, 2010//////We have been observing a new trend in our movies for the last couple of years. Some brilliant drama directors have turned into film directors which is the main reason behind that improvement. Movies like Monpura, Jago, Third Person Singular Number and so on are really attracting our young generation toward Bangladeshi movies. //////With intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq the United States of America has been able to create a serious threat of instability in the Middle East and Southeast Asia region with chaotic conditions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan while India and Bangladesh are already suffering from its fallout. To some extent, the Afghan intervention is understandable but the seizure of Iraq defies all logical interpretations. It is almost unpardonable that a power like the USA with extremely sophisticated electronic spying devices and superbly trained manpower for espionage and counter espionage activities would commit the mistake of wrongly assessing the military capability of Baghdad as gravely as it did. But, might is right, who would question the mightiest on the earth?//////It is unthinkable in this era of enlightenment that a young man can go so far as to kill a girl for refusing to marry him. Our government is up and doing in bringing the crimes committed in 1971 to justice but very much blind to crimes perpetrated by their own men. We know how the youths let loose their libido on the girls of Dhaka University, Ananda Mohon college and Jahangirnagar University recently. We do not know how many girls are in the pipeline to be teased, humiliated and ultimately killed. My sister-in-law will never visit my college because she will definite find those golden boys throwing remarks at her. A few days ago the hecklers killed a government college teacher in Sylhet for the latter's opposition to a love affair. Actually, those hecklers in most cases are the ruling party cadres who are disturbing teachers, students and snatching tender documents all over the country. //////After the suicide of another schoolgirl in her Madhya Nandipara residence on April 3 last, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has deployed plainclothes in front of the city's female educational institutions to stop eve teasing and harassment of girls by delinquents. The home ministry, however, instructed all the law enforcers to take strict measures after the suicide of Umme Kulsum Elora, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, who, repeatedly harassed by some delinquents led by 20-year-old Rezaul Karim, committed suicide by swallowing pesticide.//////From the Star Sports on 7th April, 2010 we came to know the turmoil prevailing in the marital functionality of the two stars namely Shoaib Malik of Pakistan and Sania Mirza of India in detail. Sania has always been a controversial figure owing to her sartorial minimization. It's actually a matter of personal belief and practice of any individual but yet both the stars have very murky lifestyles indeed. Shoaib was earlier married to an Indian Muslim girl named Ayesha which he tried to deny at first, while Sania was betrothed to her boyhood friend, a young man of the same township, which she ignored latter. //////Re "A war without end," by Harun ur Rashid (April 7).//////Over the last one year, climate change scientists have been sending alarming news that a significant part of Bangladesh will be submerged in the next twenty or so years due to the effects of climate change and resulting sea level rise. The Bangladesh government is naturally concerned and has been highlighting this perilous problem in national and global forums in an effort to look for solutions. But will this be enough? There is an urgent need to inform the young generation about the implications of the impending crisis since they will be most affected if the gloomy prediction comes true. They will need to play an active role in finding ways to mitigate the adverse impact on our people and society.//////In the nascent democracies military coups are a constant danger. It derails the development of the political institutions which helps to consolidate democracy. It also stalls continuation of the democratically elected governments and erodes international confidence in the nation. The military coup of 1975 was an unexpected development in Bangladesh but the political situation gave a few military personnel to embark on this misadventure. //////The whole country is reeling under acute power shortage. The high-ups of the government have even shutdown five fertilizer factories to supply 246 mmcfd additional gas to power plants to generate 500 MW extra power. This was done from April 3-10 but with no visible improvement in power supply situation. Duration of routine load shedding is increasing, The prime minister's call to keep A/Cs off during peak load period has fallen into deaf ear, the government order to close the shops and markets after 8:00pm is being widely ignored. Ultimate result is the people's suffering as well as impotency in country's forward march.//////In Germany University of Rostock Bio-Scientists are conducting a field trial of a genetically modified potatoes which would provide the raw material for a biodegradable environmentally safe plastic. The scientists have successfully regenerated potatoes in which a gene from a cyanobacterium (blue-green algae) has been transferred using gene cloning technology. The cloned gene produce the polypeptide cyanophycin in the potatoes providing the raw material for a biodegradable plastic that would help prevent environmental degradation due to excessive use of synthetic plastics. Currently plastic is manufactured from petroleum-based products which is a non-renewable resource and the product is not bio-degradable. Scientists developing the cyanophycin potatoes have already succeeded in increasing the yield from an initial 1% to 6% of the dry mass of the potatoes. These genetically modified potatoes would be utilized primarily for starch production with the stacked trait for cyanophycin production as a secondary product. The new stacked gene cloning technology would provide two important product from the same plant.//////The number of crimes taking place almost every day suggests that the crime rate has gone up by leaps and bounds. Different Human Rights organisations are largely to be blamed for this alarming rise in crime. Time and again they have voiced their concern against the actions of elite force Rab. These Human Rights organisations have almost rendered Rab useless and this in turn has encouraged the criminals to commit more crimes.//////Bangladesh, our beloved country, has been suffering due to the power crisis, as we see load shedding and low voltage have made people's daily life very difficult.//////Millions of people faced worsening travel chaos yesterday as a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland, which risks lingering over Europe for up to five more days, forced countries to extend flight bans. //////Thailand's beleaguered government insisted yesterday that it had no plan for an immediate crackdown on protesters despite handing over security operations to the army chief, saying too many people are camped in central Bangkok to use force.//////Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called yesterday for the setting up of a global body that would oversee nuclear disarmament.//////The Philippine government said yesterday it would drop murder charges against two prominent members of a powerful Muslim clan over the massacre of 57 people last year.//////The chief of the European Union's vote monitoring team said yesterday that Sudan's elections failed to meet international standards.//////Iran slammed the United States as an "atomic criminal" which should be suspended from the UN nuclear watchdog yesterday, while urging changes to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).//////It's a tiny misprint, but an Australian publisher has had to pulp a cookbook after one recipe called for "salt and freshly ground black people" to be added to the dish.//////German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been caught up in the travel turmoil caused by the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland, which has paralysed European airspace, government sources said yesterday.//////The ailing mother of Sri Lanka's slain Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has been denied entry to India for medical treatment, the Press Trust of India reported yesterday.//////Palestinians held rallies and vigils in an annual day of support yeserday for the thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, a day after a detainee died in custody.//////The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on Friday evening decided to withdraw its order imposing restrictions on SMS services in Jammu and Kashmir.//////Tens of thousands of mourners massed in a historic Warsaw square yesterday for a public memorial service for president Lech Kaczynski and the 95 others killed in an air crash a week ago.//////Monks wearing face masks set ablaze piles of the blanket-wrapped bodies of China's earthquake victims on a mountaintop yesterday, as necessity forced local Tibetans to break with the tradition of leaving their dead out for vultures.//////David Cameron has warned of the dangers of a hung parliament and said only a "decisive" Conservative government would "get the job done".//////The United Nations has raised concerns about Australia's decision to freeze asylum applications from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, saying it could leave people in detention for prolonged periods.//////Supporters of deposed Kyrgyz president Kurmanbek Bakiyev have seized control of the local television station building in the southern region of Jalalabad, a report said yesterday.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai has named a new head for the country's election commission, replacing a chairman accused of ignoring fraud during last year's presidential election.//////Terrorist groups may be planning attacks in India, the US has warned in its latest advisory and asked its nationals to exercise caution during their stay in the country.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai has promised a "transparent and fair" probe into claims that three Italian medical workers were part of a plot to kill a provincial governor, his office said yesterday.//////Micha is stopped by East German police on his way to Mariam's house.
