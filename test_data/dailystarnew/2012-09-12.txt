It was a health report by WHO which showed the discrimination in health services between the rural and the urban areas. Pregnant mothers and children are the worst victims of inequalities simply because they are poor and live in villages where healthcare services are not available. Statistics shows that only 13% mothers get the services of skilled birth attendants during delivery period in the villages whereas the percentage is 37 in urban areas. Before delivery, 37% women living in the urban areas receive ANC (Antenatal Care) for four times, while only 14% village women can access it. Bidhan Krishna Sarker, Research Investigator of Reproductive Health Unit, ICDDR,B talked to Prothom Alo and said that it has not been possible on the part of the government to build comprehensive emergency obstetric care facilities equally across the country. At the same time, poor people cannot afford to buy the private healthcare services. He also talked about the lack of information for which people sometimes do not get health services. Correct information and awareness may create the demand for health service utilisation among poor and rural people, which can contribute to reducing the existing discrimination. So, there is a need for a massive health education campaign to aware people who are poor and living in rural areas. I would like to request the government, NGOs and donors to give sincere efforts to minimise the gap and ensure equal and better health services for all. //////King Agamemnon crossed the Aegean sea to get Helen back. But our lords and leaders can't even cross the floor to salvage national interests. The constitutional provision that disallows floor-crossing in our parliament is a tool for hegemony by the ruling majority. This approach is like fixing results to back-calculate to the test, instead of administering the test to arrive at results. It undermines the merit of issues and that of individual representatives. It stifles dissenting voices. Members of Parliament must be allowed the scope of individual thinking, analysis and decision-making. //////Four years ago Barack Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States, an African-American to go to the highest office.

What is even more unfortunate is that many parents are unaware of the negative impacts of early marriage on mothers' health. Lack of awareness and health education are at the root of this evil.

Early marriage is a national problem and there has to be a comprehensive strategy to uproot it.//////Latest researches have found that antibiotic destroys essential gut flora or microbiota which plays an important role in keeping us healthy and well. In fact, 90% of our genetic materials are from the bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms, i.e. microflora which influences our genetic expression, immune system, weight, mental health, memory, and also the risk of numerous chronic and acute diseases, from diabetes to cancer.

What would happen to the students if they do not attend classes? //////At age 33, Ralph Reed was the Christian Right's wonder boy.

The 28-year-long sentence awarded to Maya Kodnani, who organised the massacre at Naroda-Patya in Ahmedabad, makes me confident that justice can be delayed -- the riots took place in 2002 -- but not denied.
