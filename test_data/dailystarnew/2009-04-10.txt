Coming only a few days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appealed to the Leader of the Opposition, in the Jatiyo Sangsad, to vacate her home, which was gifted by the Sattar government in 1981, the move was truly precipitate. And it was because the authorities do not appear to have waited for a response from Begum Zia to the appeal. Are we now to believe that the decision to have the former prime minister evicted from her house had already been taken and the appeal to her actually amounted to little? Even if the government had legal rights to take such action, there are standard procedures that need to be employed in handling such situations. The most basic one is for the government, through the appropriate department (in this case the cantonment board), to have served notice upon Begum Zia and given her time to respond. Had there been no response, the authorities could have gone ahead with appropriate action, including the one it has taken now. //////Not even four-day old, the enactment of the Upazila Parishad Bill is being assailed in such a convincing manner with such outpourings of arguments that it is easily the ruling party's most controversial legislation to-date. This has already driven a wedge between the large community of elected Upazila Parishad office bearers and the large body of MPs giving rise to a conflict of stakes issue. The very working of the Upazila Parishad may have got off to an inauspicious start.//////Men in Bangladesh take an awful lot for granted. We take it for granted that we can walk down the street without harassment. We take it for granted that we can come and go late into the night. We take it for granted that we can dress pretty much as we please. We take it for granted that we can travel alone without fear for our safety.//////I was writing about the Truth Commission this week until I saw the breaking news on television. The cabinet, in a momentous decision on Wednesday, cancelled the lease of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's cantonment residence. Politics is drifting again. //////God showed His love for mankind in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The Bible declares: "God is love" (1 John 4:16).

Being a former secretary to the government, I would have expected balanced views where the interests of all Dhakabashis are served. Unfortunately, some of your suggestions lack logic and practicability viz://////In recent times, the plight of the Rohingyas has come to light. They have been subjected to extreme inhuman conditions by the military junta of Burma. //////I welcome the JS resolution to this effect and hope that the long cherished hope of Bengalis everywhere comes to fruition. Having said that, from my own experiences of UN service, I can see very cogent objections which we must be able to refute. Firstly, although Bengali is the 5th most widespread language in the world, the UN membership is not of individuals but of soveriegn States. State-wise Bangladesh (with a population of 150 million people) is the only member of UN, so that on the basis of population of the State members of UN, perhaps India with Hindi, or Indonesia with its own language, or even Pakistan with Urdu has a stronger claim to make these also the official languages of UN.//////In our country, road digging is one of the major problems for the general people. I am also one of the sufferers.//////A local daily's staff correspondent's interesting report of April 1 on the subject clearly showed that PWD had been fooled even before the All Fools' Day (1 April)! However, they can get some satisfaction, that they were temporarily fooled! Now they are hopefully wise (?) after the event at least.//////Many political organisations have changed their names but we have not seen any noticeable change in their way of thinking or in their activities.

Does Nepal generate enough energy to meet its domestic consummation? My personal experience in Kathmandu does provide enough evidence that Nepal cannot export electricity. Kathmandu suffers from acute shortage of power supply, load shedding takes place for at least 8 hours a day even in winter. //////Remittance inflows will slow down in the coming months as migrant workers are returning home, following strict enforcement of immigration rules in different countries.//////We certainly do understand that it is somewhat a little too early to broach this since the govt. and BDR are preoccupied with important and urgent issues. Still life goes on and we have to address and attend daily issues. We have to attend day-to-day matters and resolve pending matters.//////All higher educational institutions in the city, including Rajshahi university of Engineering and technology, Rajshahi new Degree College, Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute and Institute of Health Technology were closed following violent clashes at Rajshahi University. This was really unexpected. Every student wants to get a better environment free from any type of violence. From 1947 to 1990 student politics played a crucial role but now student leaders use their muscle power through showdowns on the campus, creating panic among the general students. Our student leaders have no patience to observe the situation. //////From media sources we came to know that the government is not in a position to implement the recommendations of the Pay Commission in one go. It was also learnt that the minimum salary bracket to be recommended by the Pay commission will be 4,500 and the highest bracket will be 45,000. Although it sounds reasonable that our government can not afford provision of additional funds required to implement the pay commission recommendations in one go, I would still request the government to consider implementation of the recommendations fully from the next budget for the government staff working in the lower brackets of the pay scale. For example, the government may consider implementing the recommendations fully from next budget for the group falling in the range of 4,500-6,000 taka salary bracket, as this group could hardly benefit from gradual implementation due to present high living costs. //////According to a recent newspaper report, 'Ongoing crisis splits BCL leadership.'//////Investment in Bangladesh will not be dependant only on cheap labour or govt's repeated calls to foreign companies. Law and order is the second biggest point. Legislation has to be done so that the police dept can work without political influence. Although the PM and the home minister asked police to become honest and dedicated, but they failed to prevent unholy influence via telephone calls. //////International Mother Language Day was observed throughout the country. It is true that our martyrs who had sacrificed their lives for this language are remembered, but real respect lies in showing proper respect to the very language for which they struggled. //////We must be aware of the fact that a government is a variable force which may change in course of time. But the common people together form a constant force which has an immense power of regeneration. The nation never mortgages its power to a government after a parliamentary election. So any problem, whether it is created to embarrass the government or not, certainly afflicts us. Recently, our country passed through a series of violent crises viz. Pilkhana carnage, helicopter crash, some terrible conflagrations, workers' turmoil and change in labour employment policy abroad. There is political instability and violence in many educational institutions. Moreover, we are inflicted by a global economic slump. We are like prisoners whose destiny is uncertain. Ultimately, there will be a great economic crisis in our country. //////A top adviser to Iran's hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday said Tehran will study the "constructive" offer for talks made by six world powers regarding its controversial nuclear drive.//////A deal between the Pakistani government and the Taliban to restore peace in the Swat Valley yesterday collapsed with a radical cleric withdrawing from the pact he helped broker, reports said.//////Can rice, the staple food of most South Asian people, decide the fate of coming general elections in India?

This year, the preparations started from March 25 under the banner of Baishakh Udjapan Parshad-1416. Several items like shora, tyapa putul, masks, T-shirts, scarves and watercolour paintings by the students are sold at Charukala premises to generate funds for the Baishakhi celebration.

I nearly get jerked onto the street as two young boys pull me by my hair and cycle off. It was fun. For them, I mean. Me? I looked at the people smirking around me as the rickshaw-driver helped me back onto the rickshaw. Instead of going to class at Chhayanaut, I went home to chop off my hair in a style that didn't suit me at all and annoyed my mother no end, but left my hair so short that no one could possibly grab hold of it again. //////WALK down the road with your eyes down.
