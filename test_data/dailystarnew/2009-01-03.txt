He hasn't forgotten to mention in a curiously, but understandably, nuanced fashion that a 'so-called elected government' is better than an unelected one.//////A comment by Jatindra Lal Tripura, MP-elect on Awami League ticket from Khagrachhari, has caught our attention. He suggests that with the ushering in of an AL government, prospects for full implementation of the accord have brightened.

Emissions are growing beyond imagination and way faster than even worst case scenarios. Every year the science becomes more dire -- abrupt climate change of horrific speed and consequences looms.
