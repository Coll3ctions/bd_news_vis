Besides politicians, some people from other walks of life have been deliberating on the issue of electoral reforms to suit to a system of democracy that the country would like to practice. So far little progress appears to have been made. The Election Commission, on the other hand is organising to have dialogues with some of the political parties on certain issues which have not been clearly spelled out. There appears to be a lack of courage of conviction.//////BHOBODOHO is a small place in Jessore, accommodating ing of about 8,000 families. It was fertile like many other places of Bangladesh even a few years back. It had been yielding three crops of paddy a year, various vegetables during winter, fruits like mangoes, berries, jack-fruits during summer. The place used to be crowded with school-going children, market-going peasants, mosque and temple-bound worshippers. But currently the situation has reversed. Having been water-logged almost throughout the year ,no crops are harvested, no fruits, vegetables or even grass for cattle feeding are grown. Consequently there is every day shortage of food. The area used to grow Tk 80 crore worth of agricultural produce, this has dropped down awfully. Most of the dwellings being submerged by water, cooking food and eating it, collecting pure drinking water, washing clothes, taking bath etc have become difficult and unhygienic.

It appears that such relentless pursuit has also desiccated their heart. The malaise seems to be not only persistent but also prone to aggravation.//////The historian Arnold Toynbee said the twentieth century would be remembered not for political conflicts or technical inventions, but as an age when people dared to think of the health of the whole human race as a practical objective. //////It may surprise many if not all, to know that acute crisis of experienced and qualified teachers in Bangladesh will soon necessitate import of teachers. M. Saifur Rahman who enjoyed longest tenure as Finance Minister, predicted such a possibility in a London assembly of Bangladeshi citizens in the early part of the last four party alliance government. He made this statement out of disgust in the face of serious shortage of English teachers in the country resulting in dearth of Bangladeshis who could communicate fluently in English required for employment prospects in the United Kingdom. With the passage of time and continued negligence of our policy makers at the helm of affairs, the crisis has deepened further bringing it to the present impasse, which draws serious attention to the non availability of teachers of Mathematics and Science subjects also. To speak the truth, even teachers who can teach Bangla with correct pronunciation and adequate knowledge in the subject, have also become rare now. //////Forests cover one third of the earth's surface and estimation is that more than two thirds of all available terrestrial species are found in the forests. Bangladesh also supports a wealth of plant diversity and is located in transition of two mega-biodiversity hot spots of Indo-Malayan region. The country has been endowed with rich plant diversity because of its fertile alluvial land, warm and humid climate. More than 5,700 angiosperm species and several sub-species are available in Bangladesh. The diverse agro-ecological (30 agro-ecological zones) regions or the 12 Bio-ecological zones of the country have sustained rich genetic resources of crop plants, which are unique to this country. The forest of Bangladesh covers approximately 2.60 million ha which is about 17.62 percent of the land area of the country. Of these, the hills consist of moist tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which extend from northeast to southeast of the country. The forests are generally uneven-aged and multistoried with the valuable tropical species of Dipterocarpus turbinatus, D. alatus, D. costatus, Swintonia floribunda, Aphanamaxis polystachya, Artocarpus chaplasha, Tetrameles nudiflora, Duabanga grandifolia and Pterygota alata. The understorey is a tangle of shrubs, creepers, climbers, ferns and orchids. The species were adapted to the different ecosystems after a long successional process. //////The tiger is arguably the most magnificent and recognized of all animals, but is facing a very real risk of extinction in the wild. As human populations continue to soar, the tiger's forest home has reduced to about 7 percent of its former extent. This severe habitat destruction as well aspoaching and prey depletion has reduced tiger numbers to probably less than 5,000 worldwide. In Bangladesh, this same forest destruction means that less than 10 percent of the country remains forested and the Sundarbans makes up around half the remainder. The Sundarbans ecosystem is essential for human existence, supplying oxygen, absorbing greenhouse gases, regulating weather patterns, protecting the country from cyclones and securing sources of fish, golpatta, wood and honey. The tiger is an integral part of the Sundarbans ecosystem and its protection will also secure the protection of its forest home. The tiger is also the national symbol of Bangladesh and often referred to in the country's literature. Conserving the tiger both in its own right and as guardian of the Sundarbans, will therefore preserve a cultural icon and help protect humans and their livelihoods. So, if we understand the tiger's importance and the threats it faces then why do tiger numbers continue to plummet, and what can we do about it?//////It was a deafening roar. The fighter planes thundered by close to the rooftops, then it was quiet for a few minutes and then it started all over again. For a few muddled moments the silence sounded as loud as the roars. Shanta pulled her shawl closer and covered her ears without knowing what she was trying to muffle: the deafening roar or the steely December silence.//////M G Vassanji, who describes himself as an Indo-African Canadian writer, was born in Kenya on 30 May, 1950. Being of Indian descent, raised in an Indian-African community in Tanzania and having studied in the US, several languages and cultures have contributed to the making of the man and the author. In 1989, with the publication of his first novel, ////// he wound up a career in nuclear physics. He was awarded the Giller prize twice in 1994 for his ////// and for //////in 2003.

Feeling like a deserted lover, Bangladesh haunts me, creeps upon me when I least expect it, in the most unlikely of ways in the reflection of a woman's sunglass, in the tinkle of a certain laughter, in the rear view of a car, in the folds of a billowing //////, in the act of crossing roads, or in the columns of cigarette smoke. Abruptly out of nowhere bits and parts of experience rise in front of me, like sudden flashes of dj vu, mingle with the sense, smell, din, traffic roar, twittering bird, ////// of keyboard keys, television volume, suffuse with the teeny-tiny particles floating in the air and play out its course. I pause, and become a mute witness, while deep, very deep in my heart something stirs. //////Mood swings, tender breasts, a swollen abdomen, food cravings, fatigue, irritability and depression ... ... if you experience some or all of these problems in days before your menstruation, better known as monthly period, you may have premenstrual syndrome (PMS).//////Tuberculosis (TB) has been a major public health problem for centuries. It is a leading infectious disease that represents more than a quarter of the worlds preventable deaths. Increase in the incidence of TB in the developing countries and its re-emergence in the developed world led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare TB as a global emergency in 1993.//////A gluten-free vegan diet full of nuts, sunflower seeds, fruit and vegetables appears to offer protection against heart attacks and strokes for people with rheumatoid arthritis, Swedish researchers said.//////In people who are at risk of developing diabetes, treatment with metformin (an oral drug used in the treatment of diabetes) leads to modest improvements in weight, lipid (fat) profiles and fasting blood sugar.

The last Israeli incursion into Gabalia, in the northern part of Gaza, failed to achieve its goals. The Israeli government has realized the ineffectiveness of using its arms capabilities in civilian areas. The limited Israeli penetration caused 130 Palestinian casualties of which two-thirds were civilians.//////Most wars have heroes, victims and villains. Not the Iraq War.

President Gen. Pervaiz Mushharaf is credited as the doyen of the gradual change in Pakistan's traditional Kashmir policy. He has always talked about finding an "out of the box solution", besides meeting India "half-way" in order to carve out a solution to this chronic problem. Accordingly he drew up a "four-point formula" which created a stir in the valley and bisected the separatist camp - one supporting it and the other opposing it.//////Khondakar Ashraf Hossain is perhaps the finest voice on the literary horizon of Bangladesh, particularly in the field of poetic activity, at the present time. He has made his mark on the literary scene as a Bengali poet and has published several volumes of Bengali poems. ////// is his first collection of English poems written on a kaleidoscopic variety of themes. Although the poems are written in English, Ashraf Hossain does not claim to be an English poet. His soul, as he says in the preface to this volume, is nourished and nurtured by the alluvial soil of Bangladesh the lush green countryside with clusters of boats sailing on the river, hosts of plants and flowers dancing in the breeze, the twittering of birds in the sky have always been a source of inspiration for his poetic creativity.//////The title of the novel is a most fascinating one, particularly to a reader who is a Bengali in spirit. The title sends out vibrations of musical elements to one's images. It is a family saga based on stories and events that actually had happened over a long period of time dating back roughly to 1950 and ending sometime in early 1971. The locale is the then East Pakistan where the father, an ICS officer, was posted in various places both small and relatively big, raising a family of six children along with his hardy and well-educated wife. Also part of the family was Nanibibi who was looked upon as a much dependable person, particularly by the children as they grew up. //////Military governments or army-driven governments usually erupt in poorer countries. They even try to rule in countries that are at break-even point vis-a-vis prosperity. They do not have a chance in countries like the United Kingdom, the United States or even Saudi Arabia --- nations that have already become prosperous and where the 'poverty' jargon does not work any longer for the ruling class.//////There have been, since 15 August 1975, several attempts by different authors to write a meaningful biography of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Unfortunately, they have been either fragmentary or superficial. In most cases, the treatment of the subject and his era were also not comprehensive.//////An invaluable collection of short stories based on the 1971 Bangladesh War, this work is simply an eye opener. For history buffs all across the South Asian subcontinent, a new and positive understanding of a tumultuous period in the region is what these stories promise. Each story is a gripping read.//////
