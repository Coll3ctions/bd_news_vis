Part of our surprise springs from the fact that the commission is meant only for businessmen. The suggestion also lacks details. While we certainly appreciate the novelty of the idea, there are some significant aspects of the issue that are not known to us. Among those aspects are the probable terms of reference of the body, its legal basis, the morality governing its establishment and functions and finally the applicability of the commission's decisions. Besides, to what extent does such a commission affect the working of the normal laws pertaining to criminal conduct?//////There is no denying a sense of loss being unfortunately felt over the Malaysian authorities applying a freeze on fresh intake of Bangladeshi workers into their country. In the middle of last month two incidents occurred highlighting mismanagement and nexus between Bangladeshi agents and their counterparts in Malaysia over export of manpower to that country. Bangladeshi workers' agitation and hunger strike at the Bangladesh High Commission premises protesting poor working conditions and a few thousand of them being stranded at the airport without any Malaysian company receiving them created a disconcerting situation for all concerned. While the poor exploited workers suffered in the process and there was no satisfactory resolution of the issues, the suspension of new intake comes as a heartbreaker for the employment seekers from Bangladesh. More so because an earlier ban put in 1999 had been lifted not so long ago. Currently, the country is hosting about 200,000 Bangladeshi workers and 100,000 more are expected to arrive in Malaysia by virtue of a previous approval. The potential for intake is huge into that country.//////2007 continues to be the year of sweeping changes and thorough-going reform.

Rahman refers to his crossing over to Afghanistan when he was denied permission to join Bangladesh in 1971. The fact is that Rahman crossed into Afghanistan only in early 1973 with many thousands of other Bengalis who were following the same hazardous route of the Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier and from there to Kabul and onward to New Delhi. These people after crossing the frontier to Afghanistan would make their way to the Indian embassy in Kabul and the Indian embassy would in its turn arrange air tickets from Kabul to New Delhi for them by Afghanistan's Aryana Airlines. The Bangladesh High Commission officials in New Delhi were receiving these Bengalis returning from Pakistan via Kabul at Delhi airport and arrange their onward journey to Calcutta and finally their home country. //////Rahat, a teenager, has become a drug addict after the separation of his parents. He left his college and mixed with bad fellows and has started taking different types of intoxicants. Rahat's mother has become anxious about his condition but finds no way to take him out of this. Another boy from an aristocratic family has developed relationship with a woman who is older than him. This has become an acute problem in many families. The c problem is worse in the aristocratic and lower class families, rather than in any middle class family. Teenage girls face the same kind of problems. The psychologists have noticed that the age between 13 to 22 is a very critical period in a person's life because most of the mental and physical changes occur during this period. The malicious attributes can easily influence them. Their parents pursue them to give up addiction and they fail to do that. Their fortunes are nipped in the bud. The factors behind the problems of the teenagers are :(1) Too much mental pressure and rules and regulations that have been imposed by the parents, (2) Mental and physical changes (3) Negligence of the parents, (4) The confused and curious ideas about sex, (5) Lack of family bond and religious values, (6) Influence of Western culture and so on. Parents have to take the most important responsibility to save them from this kind of moral degradation. They have to make their children aware about their future. Life is only one, so if a person has done anything wrong , there is no way to amend the fault by returning back to the past. So, the teenagers have to be cautious when they take a step. Parents must make their children's life more enjoyable and panic-free. They must be friendly and expressive and they must talk with their children openly about their problems. They must teach their children about moral and religious values and also about our culture. //////'You see a huge signboard here.

Not a place anyone would like to go to every day, but unfortunately some of us are unlucky to end up there somehow.//////After a decade of slumped trade, the film industry in Bangladesh is expecting a pick-up this coming Eid. People in the mainstream film industry, otherwise known as 'Dhaliwood', are hopeful to reset cinema as one of the major sources of mass entertainment during the Eid festivity.//////Eid brings in a festive air.

Corruption has eaten away at the basic processes of administration. //////Over the past few years, there have been several instances of building collapse, as in structural failure, some with devastating and telling tolls so much so as to awaken concerned professionals to search for answers as to who, why and how. 'Where' was as obvious as the heaped debris, burial mounds may be more appropriate an expression, and 'when' was a simpler inquest.//////One 9-storied sweater factory building owned by Spectra Sweaters Ltd., located at Palashbari Village under Savar Thana of Gazipur District collapsed in the early hours (1.15 am) on April 12, 2005 killing more than 60 and injuring more than 100 workers.

The site was also visited by political leaders, members of IEB, RAJUK, BGMEA, BUET, BACE and other concerned organizations a short time after the incident and several times later. Separate investigation committees were formed by different organizations to find out the causes and frame comprehensive recommendations to prevent this type of failure in future.//////Building collapse rescue is an often complex and confusing situation. It will frequently involve large numbers of specialized rescue personnel and equipment that might not be generally recognized as being part of a normal rescue organization. It should also require a combination of a variety of technical rescue skills and an advanced knowledge of building structures and materials. //////
