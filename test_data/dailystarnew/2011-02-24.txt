According to a 2011 survey carried out by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), a prestigious research wing of the London based weekly Economist released last week: Dhaka was placed at 139th position out of 140 countries surveyed. The criteria of the standings were based on the following factors: stability, healthcare, environment and culture, education and infrastructure.

They are from poor families but they are closely attached with the fashionable hairpieces that made them able to earn Tk 1,800-2,000 a month.//////In ancient Egypt, both males and females wore wigs made either from human hair, sheep's wool or vegetable fibers, depending upon their social status. There were a number of benefits for Egyptians from shaving their heads. First it was more comfortable in the hot Egyptian climate not to have hair. Secondly, a baldhead helped avoid the danger of an infestation of lice, which was a problem at that time. However, it appears that Egyptians preferred having hair which resulted in the creation of wigs that gave the appearance of hair. The new wigs also protected the Egyptians' baldheads from the brutal sun. Wigs became part of daily wear for the Egyptian people indicating a person's status as well as their role in a society or politics. In Women's wigs were adorned with braids and gold, hair-rings and ivory ornaments making them more stylish than men's wigs.

Right from the time of our liberation, but more so after the "rebirth" of democracy in the country in 1991, leadership of political parties had been viewed with keen interest by the public, more so when that in certain cases, had been more often thrust on the people rather than acquired by dint of one's merit as a politician.
