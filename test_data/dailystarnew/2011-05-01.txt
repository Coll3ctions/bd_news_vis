We see giant billboards on the roof tops of almost all the high rise buildings, risking fatal accidents to the pedestrian, motorists as well as people who live on those buildings in the event of fire, cyclone, tremor etc. It is needless to say that billboards in Dhaka city have become a booming business for both outdoor advertising companies as well as the city corporation since they both earn substantial amount of money. However, the practice of approving billboards should be done with due care and sincerity. I would also like to advocate the city corporation to take care of the neon signs and other mode of illuminated outdoor advertising which consume huge amount of electricity unnecessary.//////That day I saw a poster of an unusually fat Chinese wrestler on the wall.

This crisis includes declining militancy, falling union densities, shrinking wages and benefits, and declining overall working conditions. Some common sources of these crucial problems in the era of globalisation are hyper mobility of capital creating a race to the bottom among nations; decline of state sovereignty, especially in the third world, undermining traditional associational bargaining power and welfare of the workers; and the new work organisation and technology, representing flexibilisation, creating a vast number of part-time, and/or contingent workers. The new flexible work organisation enhances managers' prerogatives, disciplines workers and introduces piece rate processes, thereby creating hyper competition among the workers. Furthermore, employing unskilled, malleable and 'backward' rural women undermines the traditional trade union role in the factories.//////Each year, cherry blossoms herald the beginning of spring in Washington.
