On the contrary, commotion among passengers resenting arbitrary fare hikes by transport operators has led to brawls, vandalism and loss of property. //////THE difficulties in which 32 Bangladeshi workers have found themselves in Kuala Lumpur raise once again the issue of what is yet not being done to ease the plight of our citizens abroad. We have earlier and on a number of occasions drawn the attention of the authorities here in Bangladesh about the paramount need to ensure that recruiting agencies follow rules and norms aimed specifically at ensuring the welfare of Bangladeshis sent abroad to work in various firms. While we realise that a good number of such agencies have indeed been operating on the basis of standard procedures, there have been quite a few others which have not exactly been above board in their dealings with the workers they send abroad. At the same time, we think it is time to inquire into the workings of the overseas firms responsible for the shoddy deals with local recruitment agencies regarding our workers.//////WE are living through some rather interesting times. These are not momentous times and we are surely not making history that could leave an enormous impact on our future. But, yes, these are interesting times, and just as well, and they are because of everything that is happening and, conversely, for everything that is not happening. A former prime minister has flown out of prison and out of the country. Another insists that she will stay in it, but that should be no reason for her incarcerated children not to make it abroad for medical treatment. //////IN politics, a week is a long time, as the saying goes. A flawed decision of the government could change dramatically the political landscape. Volatile public opinion is one of the challenges politicians face. This has occurred in South Korea.//////THE life of a young senator in Washington can be lonely. After winning a Senate seat from Illinois in 2004, Barack Obama became a part-time bachelor. He lived three or four days a week in a one-bedroom apartment a few blocks from the Capitol. He worked all day, and at night he missed his daughters and his wife, Michelle, left behind in Chicago. "I have chosen a life  that requires me to be gone from Michelle and the girls for long stretches of time and exposes Michelle to all sorts of stress," Obama wrote in //////. "Rationalisations seem feeble and painfully abstract when I'm missing one of the girls' school potlucks because of a vote, or calling Michelle to tell her that session's been extended and we need to postpone our vacation."//////Football-crazy Germany is lapping up this month's European Championships but with a three-million Turkish minority, the country, it seems, has two national teams -- who face off on Wednesday.//////Abahani bowed out of the AFC President's Cup following their second successive defeat in Group A when the Bangladesh professional league champions went 2-1 down to Regar-TadAZ of Tajikistan yesterday.//////Nayeem Islam's unbeaten hundred gave Bangladesh A the first-innings lead against Ireland A on the second day of their tour opening three-dayer at the College Park in Dublin yesterday.//////India's in-form batsman Gautam Gambhir has credited captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the newfound confidence which has helped him cement his one-day spot.//////India captain Mahendra Dhoni would love nothing more than to emulate the feats of predecessor Kapil Dev and lead his country to World Cup glory at Lord's.//////Turkey's bid to beat Germany and reach the final of Euro 2008 is in danger of being wrecked by injuries and suspensions.//////Hamit Altintop is using insider information to help Turkey plot Germany's downfall in Wednes-day's Euro 2008 semifinal. //////It may be two years too late but the feeling that Italy need a revolution rather than an evolution has possibly never been greater.//////Spanish midfielder Xavi Hernandez on Tuesday warned Euro 2008 semifinal opponents Russia he and his compatriots were out "to make history" as they target a first title since 1964.//////Austrian far-right politician Joerg Haider questioned Tuesday why Russia and Turkey were allowed to participate in the European soccer championships, the Euro 2008.//////The defeated Croatian squad will be get a 6.25 million-euro (9.7 million-dollar) bonus for reaching the Euro 2008 quarterfinals, the country's football association said Monday. //////Russia striker Ivan Saenko has a foot injury and did not take part in training, coach Guus Hiddink said, adding a decision would be taken on Thursday on whether he would play against Spain. //////Vienna was the setting for Graham Greene's post Second World War classic The Third Man but at Euro 2008 it's not Harry Lime but Turkey's three keepers that are providing all the suspense.//////Defending champion Venus Williams successfully launched her bid for a fifth Wimbledon title on Tuesday as a sun-kissed All England Club waited to greet fellow superstars Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova.//////Left-handers Sohail Tanveer and Fawad Alam batted Pakistan out of trouble with fighting half-centuries as the home team made 288-9 against Hong Kong in the Asia Cup here on Tuesday.//////South Africa's cricket team arrive in England later this week but New Zealand's Grant Elliott is adamant he is not in the wrong tour party after turning in two standout performances for his adopted country.//////Two ex-general secretaries of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) were named in the B.

sentenced a father and his son to 10 years rigorous imprisonment (RI) in an arms case.//////At present it is a very common phenomenon that most of the talented students of our country are keen to go abroad for the sake of a better living in the name of education. We can guess it if we see the long queues of students in front of foreign embassies. There is hardly anyone who can accomplish higher education in a foreign university because of high educational expenses. So they do odd jobs. //////An overbridge for the pedestrians is essential in busy roads. The main objectives of constructing such overbridge are to enable the pedestrians to cross the road safely, ensuring that no mishap takes place, creating provision for smooth traffic system, no waiting for crossing, and last of all, making life easier etc. But the truth is that many of our pedestrians have forgotten the objectives.//////I would like to salute The Daily Star for the June 15 news River void of life forms and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology for their study on water pollution. It touched my heart and took me back to the past.//////When taxi cab was first introduced in Dhaka city in the late 90s, people thought that the transportation problem would be solved to some extent. But due to lack of proper administration, taxi cab is now a problem to the people of Dhaka city. There are many allegations against the taxi drivers. They refuse to go by the passengers' needs. //////The National Shishu Park, a major recreational centre not only for children but also for adults, has become a dull and dreary place. The park has remained unchanged since its inauguration in 1979. Very few new things have been added to it. Some of the rides might have also become rather risky, as no maintenance work is visible.//////It is a matter of great regret that our daughters do not find the universities a safe place. We are so unlucky. When two of our leaders, Hasina and Khaleda, were arrested the intellectuals continued to write so many articles in newspapers, but they have no time to write about girls and women in general.//////Khaleda demands treatment abroad for her sons, arrested on massive corruption charges. Her sons are not like the ordinary people. Their mother was the prime minister for a long time. Her claim shows that she should be accountable for miserably failing to develop the country's healthcare facilities, if we have to travel abroad for treatment.//////Welcome thinking on the part of the political parties to reform their constitution. Hope they will evaluate the educational background of the people seeking nomination. Honest, sincere and successful professionals, lawyers, scientists, intellectuals and educationists should be invited to come forward and play a role in politics. //////I am a long time fan of comedy serial Keeping up appearances - one of the products of British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC. A brief analysis of the serial would reveal, among other things, it has been designed for depicting pertinent aspects of superiority and inferiority complexes associated with human personality against the backdrop of an English social setting. //////We are very much annoyed, angry and also amused by the recent demands or 'abdars' of Khaleda Zia. Her two knee joints have been replaced in the USA and her favourite retreat KSA. Her other demand of sending Tarique Rahman and Koko abroad for treatment is far away from ground reality. The situation, circumstances and cases against Khaleda Zia are entirely different from that of Sheikh Hasina. Tarique Rahman with active connivance and consent of his mother inflicted the heaviest ever blow to our politics, economy, morality and society. Nothing moved without paying due percentage to 'Juboraj'.//////More than a week after the budget was announced through the media some members of civil society have suggested that it be made half-yearly, as the current caretaker government's tenure will end in December. Why are they so late to say so? Shouldn't have they floated the idea before the budget was announced? //////I fully support the use of eco-toilet but I do not endorse the idea of converting human excreta collected from eco-toilets into bio-fertilizer. As far as my knowledge goes, some countries including Afghanistan use such manure. But the side or adverse effects of crops and vegetables grown by the manure on human health are yet to be known. In fact, not all the technologies are good for humans and it takes a long time after the use of a technology to figure out its adverse effects on human beings. For instance, tube-well has contributed to the creation of a serious health problem, i.e. Arsenicosis. Recently, researchers found that arsenic is being deposited in rice plants during nutrient uptake, thereby putting this hazardous element into the food chain. Again poultry litter also contains good amount of arsenic which is now widely used as fertilizer in our country.//////It is a matter of hope that we are going to be a middle income country. Now the per capita income of our people is 599 dollars, which is 12.5% higher than the previous years's (2006-07 fiscal year). To be a middle income country, a country should achieve the marginal level of 750$ per capita income. The increase in GNP is good, because our country passed through some crises last year, like the devastating cyclone Sidr, two consecutive floods and economic instability. Most of the sectors performed poorly, yet the per capita income has gone up. Here remittances from abroad played the main role. //////In the budget for the current year, the duty on imported paper has been reduced. But the paper mill owners have claimed that it will put in jeopardy an investment of around Tk 3,000. In the recent years, a huge amount of tax was imposed on imported papers. And the local paper mills took advantage of the situation and increased the prices of papers. And students are the main victims. //////While appearing in the court on June 16, 2008 as an accused in Gatco case Begum Khaleda Zia claimed that her two sons Tarique and Koko are not faltu loke (insignificant persons) in our society. In a society where a personal valet is catapulted overnight into the position of a national VVIP, an alleged smuggler (now convicted for corruption) is made a minister, Tarique and Koko are certainly not faltu loke. Begum Zia is very right to claim so. She ruled Bangladesh for ten years and has been ruling over her party BNP for the last twenty six years with the same perception. What makes the people of Bangladesh in general, and the admirers of Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman in particular, sad is the way Begum Zia, after the assassination of her illustrious husband, groomed her two sons to their present shameful position. If even only 10% of the details of their activities as published in the media after 1/11 is true, it leaves no doubt in the minds of the ordinary people that Tarique and Koko did not grow up in the company of good friends and well wishers. As the sons of President Zia these two young men had no business to be friends of people like. In the absence of their father, Begum Zia should have been more careful in grooming up Tarique and Koko. //////Former US Vice President and Presidential candidate Al Gore has endorsed Barack Obama. It is very significant as Al Gore is a personof great intellect, he opposed the war in Iraq, is concerned about global warming and climate change, he is anxious about the future of this planet and trying his best to do something.//////Salaried people are badly bruised by an unprecedented galloping double digit inflation and skyrocketing of the prices of essential items in the last one year. Considering the misery of this vast section of people, the CTG should seriously consider increasing the present tax free limit from Tk.150,000/- to Tk.300,000/. //////On an average a human being consumes about 2 litres of water every day. Water accounts for about 70% of the weight of a human body. About 80% of the earth surface is covered by water. Out of the estimated 1,011 million Km3 of the total water present on earth, only 33,400 m3 of water is available for drinking, agriculture, industrial and domestic consumption. Rest of the water is locked up in oceans and polar ice-caps and glaciers. Considerable part of this limited quantity of water is polluted by sewage, industrial waste and a wide array of synthetic chemicals. Various types of water pollutants are responsible for the pollution of water such as, organic pollutants including- oxygen demanding waste, disease causing waste, synthetic organic compounds, sewage and agricultural runoff, oil ; the inorganic pollutants including various metals and metallic compounds, suspended solids and sediments, radioactive materials etc. Water pollution is indicated by various water quality parameters such as- colour, odour, DO (Dissolve Oxygen), COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand), pH, temperature range, turbidity, acidity, alkalinity etc. There are many environmental effects due to water pollution.//////I was astonished to read the news report entitled Original copy of independence proclamation missing (June 18th DS). It is indeed a shocking revelation that the original copy of the April 10, 1971 proclamation of independence, through which the first government was formed and the March 26, 1971 declaration of independence was approved, is missing! It appears from your report that after the August 15, 1975, these documents were deliberately  lost, removed or destroyed, by the people who were in power.//////The people said to Gideon, rule over us, you and then your son and then your son's son but he said to them 'I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the Lord shall rule over you- The Old Testament. //////Whenever the education policy is discussed, English is always given a priority. At the tertiary level English is given so much importance that in almost all the universities, there is a foundation course on English. But all talks, all seminars, conferences go in vain when I notice the faulty methods of teaching English adopted in schools. In the schools of rural areas if there is any lacking, it is because of the absence of well trained teachers. But when there is negligence in the renowned schools of urban areas, who are to blame? Let us take an example of teaching English in a very renowned school in Azimpur area, Dhaka. Teaching writing skills to the students of class eight is not an easy job. What does a teacher do in such a class? He comes and takes the syllabus asking students to know where they face problem in understanding grammar. He talks about grammatical rules insisting that such rules will not be found anywhere(it indicates his desire to draw the attention of the students to private tuition!) . He takes a chalk and duster to talk about grammar. Hardly there is any session of practising what he teaches because it is a class of 45 minutes. Because of this poor perception the students have to approach their parents as well as private tutors for a better understanding. Many rush to coaching centres for help. Usually composition is a part of English second paper. So after discussing grammar in a half hearted manner, the teacher switches over to the writing course. Suddenly, he will say.  For tomorrow's class your writing assignment will be about a rickshaw-puller and a letter to your mother on hostel life. He will not give any guideline on how he/she should start writing. He can give the students some key words to write compositions. This needs a lesson plan and it also involves an innovative approach. //////Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf could be impeached in July, albeit via an indirect route, with parliament washing its hands of the issue, a report in Islamabad said yesterday.//////French President Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday spoke out strongly in favour of a Palestinian state after talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in the occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem.//////Pakistani Premier Yousuf Razai Gilani said yesterday that his government would challenge a court decision barring Nawaz Sharif, a partner in the ruling coalition, from contesting elections.//////Outraged at the turmoil in Zimbabwe, the UN Security Council declared that a fair presidential vote is impossible because of the "campaign of violence" waged by President Robert Mugabe's government. //////The Bush administration is considering setting up a diplomatic outpost in Iran in what would mark a dramatic official US return to the country nearly 30 years after the American embassy was overrun and the two nations severed relations. //////Pakistani and Indian officials held counter-terrorism talks in Islamabad yesterday, the foreign ministry said, in the latest step of a slow-moving peace process between the nuclear rivals.//////Afghanistan's government yesterday said a "foreign intelligence agency" was behind an April assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai during a military parade in Kabul.//////The flood situation has eased considerably in both West and East Midnapore districts in West Bengal with major rivers flowing below the danger mark, but the outbreak of diarrhoea in some of the worst-hit areas has become a cause of concern.//////Two US soldiers, two American civilians and six Iraqis were killed in a bomb attack on Tuesday in the district council building of the Iraqi capital's Shiite bastion of Sadr City, officials said.//////Labelling Khan Ataur Rahman as one of the "pioneers of Bangladeshi Film Industry," discussants pointed out his remarkable contribution to Bangladeshi cinema at a programme held at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) on June 23.

It aims to implement reforms to improve the business environment. BBBF planned to achieve concrete results in the short-term through ministerial action, and a pragmatic and focused approach was taken, knowing that certain long-term reforms would require legislative action. //////KOSOVO'S independence is a triumph of the right of self-determination and freedom. Serbian military and security forces had for years suppressed the freedom movement of the people of Kosovo through one of the worst genocides in history. Following Nato intervention and resistance by the KLA, Serbian military and security forces were forced to withdraw from Kosovo. This was followed by the formation of a United Nations interim government under UN Security Council resolution 1244. The main objective of the UN resolution was to prepare Kosovo for a democratic, multi-religious, multi- ethnic and multi-cultural society, paving the way for resolving its final status. It was clear that Kosovo would not revert back to the rule of Belgrade after the genocide.//////AN eminent medical scientist and physician of Bangladesh, Major General Mahmudur Rahman Choudhury was born on June 1, 1928 in Sylhet. He had to his credit a brilliant academic and professional career. All through his school and college life he received stipends. //////CONSIDER the following offer.
