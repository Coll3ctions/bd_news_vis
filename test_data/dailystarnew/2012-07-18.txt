The problem is growing with ever-increasing number of hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres in the major cities of Bangladesh. //////Your Thakurgaon correspondent Rubayat's report and the real life photograph published in your pages says it all! With no front or rear lights, plying in the dark is quite rightly a disaster in the making! This needs to be overcome; the sooner the better. What is needed is for the vehicles to have two low-powered lights with good reflectors fitted on two sides at the top in the front, and two or three highly polished reflectors on the mid level at the back of these battery operated bikes. The back reflectors (without any bulbs) will reflect back the head lights of the vehicle that is coming behind the easy bike, and identify it. This can be a viable option, with little load on the battery, for safely driving in the dark. This option should be tried out immediately. This provision will greatly increase the safety of these vehicles, particularly at night. I believe this may become an effective solution for the problem. It needs to be given wide publicity to create awareness among the users of easy bike.//////Scientists estimate that existing fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal) will be in short supply by 2050 and will totally end by this century's end, unless large scale discoveries are made.

Rashed Ahmed titled "Let beggar rehabilitation project work." I would like to commend Mr. Ahmed for such a well-written letter as he has highlighted an important problem of Dhaka city which requires immediate solution.

Our government has made a good decision to spend the taxpayers' money for a good cause. It is important that beggars get removed from the streets in order to uplift our image to the rest of the world. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ministers and senior Awami League leaders are constantly reminding us that in the language movement of 1952 and in the Liberation War of 1971, the people of this country succeeded to achieve their goal and so they would be able to build the Padma bridge with their own money.//////The other day a local television channel broadcast a news which I would like to share with the readers of this daily back at home.

The kind of decency you would expect from a great man but do not usually come by is something which comes to him naturally.

It does not matter that his aides keep telling him he does not have to be on his feet all the time. Like all men of substance, Mandela knows that every individual deserves respect.

They provide avenues for investment and capital acquisition and can provide an indication of overall economic condition. There are several functions of a stock market, but the main function is economic function. Stock markets also provide facility for transfer of capital from investors to users of capital. They allow corporations looking to expand to raise capital from investors in the primary market and facilitate trade between buyers and sellers of stock in the secondary market.//////
