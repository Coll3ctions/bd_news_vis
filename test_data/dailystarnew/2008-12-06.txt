We regret the error. //////IT was only on 24th November last that this writer pointed to the lurking threat of the so-called religious extremists to our democratic polity. In fact, there are enough indications to believe that the extremists who masterminded and perpetrated the mindless violence in the not-too-distant past in Bangladesh are lying low on account of tactical reasons. The Mumbai carnage of 26th to 28th November bears fearsome testimony to the premonition that the terror network suspected to be maintaining regional connection can strike at ease even in a locale that has seen repeated violence.//////FOR all Muslims of the world Hajj is a pilgrimage to Holy Ka'ba. Situated in the holy city of Mecca the Ka'ba is the greatest place of worship for all Muslims. Hajj is one of the five strong pillars on which the grand edifice of Islam stands. Other four pillars are (1) "Iman" (Faith ), (2) "Salat" (Daily 5-time prayers), (3) "Siam" (Fasting) and (4) "Zakat" (Poor's due). It is obligatory on the part of every able-bodied, resourceful and adult Muslim to perform Hajj at least once in his life time.//////THERE is always a group of people who slip through the cracks of every form of poverty alleviation strategy tried and tested until now. Be it the manual labourers living daily from hand to mouth or the women and children who work in our houses in exchange of meagre sums of money, different circumstances always prevent them from participating in the elaborate development panaceas that are implemented. They generally tend to fall into the last quintile of the income distribution and therefore are sucked into a poverty trap and it takes a lot more effort to get them out of abject poverty compared to the run-of-the-mill strategies such as microfinance. In an effort to counter this problem, BRAC implemented a programme that has not been used anywhere in the world before, aptly named Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: The Specially Targeted Ultra Poor (STUP). //////YESTERDAY, December 5, was the International Day of Volunteers. Volunteerism is an important indicator of trust and solidarity within and between communities. The ripples of volunteerism can trickle down to foster the empowerment of marginalized groups. It can engage local people in their own development. Volunteerism has remained a source of community strength, resilience, solidarity and social cohesion. The collective ripples of volunteerism can also provide inspiration to government and vice-versa. //////Zubaida bent down to cut off the head of yet another withered rose. It broke her heart to do this: having no children of her own, each flower was like a child to her. But she knew only by cutting the shrivelled blooms would another bloom appear, twice as beautiful as the last. 'I have to be cruel to be kind!' she laughingly reminded herself.//////There are writers who create fiction by viewing the post-colonial world in the perception of their own experiences, and then there are the scholars who study the perspective of these writers and create Post Colonial Literary theory.//////Ordinarily, dry skin (xerosis) is not serious, but it can be uncomfortable and unsightly, turning plump cells into shriveled ones and creating fine lines and wrinkles.//////Recently published arguments that increased funding for HIV is to blame for the chronic underfunding of broader health systems are rooted in a simplistic analysis of how global health priorities are established.//////Every month it is the same old story. You feel like someone is stabbing in your lower abdomen and back. There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, irritability while nervousness are also associated. It compels you to spend most of the day curled up in the bed from the first day of your menstrual period. Cramps in your lower abdomen get worse with time and it happens again in next month.//////The prevalence of diabetes worldwide will far outstrip even the sharp increase currently projected unless rising trends of obesity are controlled, health experts said.//////Have you heard the term Chinese Restaurant Syndrome or CRS? This occurs in some people after they eat foods containing the food additive Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)  a common ingredient in Chinese restaurants. This is the salt version of glutamic acid, which is a non-essential amino acid.//////Why eat wheat germ? Wheat germ is the center of the wheat seed that is responsible for the development and growth of the new plant sprout. Though only a small part of the wheat seed, the germ is a highly concentrated source of nutrients, including niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin E, folate, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, iron and zinc. The germ also contains protein, fiber and some fat. Wheat germ adds a healthy crunch to virtually any recipe, from breakfast pancakes to fruit smoothies.//////THE carnage in Mumbai is a shocking reminder once again of the fear that few non-state actors can cause, which only full scale wars between nations could in the past. In 9/11 acts of terrorism, it was one score; in the Mumbai massacre, the perpetrators were fewer who actually caused the carnage and mayhem. There are of course many more involved in organizing and executing these acts such as terrorist organizations and nation-states. Pursuing them to root out terrorism has so far been futile as these terrorists and their groups keep on changing strategies as they have done in the Mumbai carnage to escape detection. The Mumbai terrorist attacks, the tragedy and carnage notwithstanding, should therefore lead those pursuing the war on terror to make a strategic shift and deal with the causes as much as the perpetrators. So far, at least since 9/11, the objective has been to pursue the perpetrators with little attention to the causes that breed terrorism. //////DOMESTICALLY, in the Israeli arena, just three months prior to the elections on the 10th of February 2009, many events are occurring in the high leadership echelons of the major political parties. In the Labor Party, Ehud Barak is facing serious challenges to his leadership. All the polls predict he and his party will suffer a real defeat in these next elections. Various political leaders, including Uzi Baram and Ami Ayalon and several authors such as Amos Oz and David Grossman, who identify with Labor, have deserted the party. //////Obama, though being 50% white Kansan and 50% black Kenyan ethnically but 100% Afro-American by choice, presented himself as an all-American candidate to the US electorate. This symbolism was unavoidable. A majority of the voters are white. Unless he got their vote, Obama couldn't have won even if he got overwhelming black and Hispanic support, as these two groups together are a minority. //////The book is dedicated to the late Mirza Ghulam Hafiz, who inspired the writer into joining the legal profession. The contents of the book include an introduction and nine chapters, references and index.//////. A tale of atrocities perpetrated on women offers a powerful testimony to different types of gender-based violence experienced by women and girls throughout their lives. //////The Wedding is a richly imagined novel in which emotions of men and women branch out in extraordinary ways. Nicholas Sparks has the gift of sketching out human relationships with luscious blends of love and lust. There is Noah who seems to be living with his long dead wife Allie. There seems to be no love lost between the living and the dead. There is this belief in him that Allie comes to him as a swan that visits him in their pond everyday. Noah and the swan give a spiritual touch to the story. There is Jane, Noah's daughter, who after thirty years of marriage to Wilson finds that there is still much to be discovered about the relationship. And there is Ann, Jane's daughter, who loves Keith in her wild, romantic ways. Their love story is yet another rich chapter of the book. The story whips up with trouble brewing in the marriage of Wilson and Jane. The family suddenly finds itself on fragile grounds, grounds that seemed to be giving away beneath love that is suddenly lost in confusion. The neighbors too are caught up with the family's gains and pitfalls. However, each of the characters is shadowed by the other and we find a touching story of love and kindness coming out of momentary dark shadows.//////This year's Man Booker Prize was lavished on Aravind Adiga for his first novel, The White Tiger, which beat out novels by two other distinguished Indian novelists: Salman Rushdie and Amitav Ghose. The award created a kind of brouhaha in literary circles because of the novel's protagonist: a con man and a murderer, who relates the story of his rise from lowly driver (for a rich Indian couple) to successful entrepreneur in Bangalorenarrated in a kind of tongue-in-cheek tone, though smirk may be more appropriate. Even the author himself has spoken of his novel, "It's not a book that's meant to ingratiate itself with anyone." //////
