It was not a long or tiresome journey for the Tigers but still everybody was tired mainly because they boarded the bus soon after the end of their second and last warm-up match against Ireland at the Moors Sports Club ground. The hectic schedule was why the Tigers were given the chance to keep away from cricket yesterday, as it was a rest day for them.

And so it is fair to ask of the economists a fundamental question: What could happen going forward that would cause you to substantially revise your views of how the economy operates and to acknowledge that the model you had been using was substantially flawed? As a vigorous advocate of fiscal expansion as an appropriate response to a major economic slump in an economy with zero or near-zero interest rates, I have for the last several years suggested that if the British economy -- with its major attempts at fiscal consolidation -- were to enjoy a rapid recovery, it would force me to substantially revise my views about fiscal policy and the workings of the macroeconomy more generally.//////LG Electronics Inc unveiled its latest high-end smartphone packed with powerful hardware upgrades on Tuesday, as the struggling South Korean firm tries to win market

Regular text messages with vulgar contents as well as phone calls have been harassing many women.

Government authorities must take urgent steps to curb this crime before it goes viral.//////A very investigative and critical photograph by a staff photographer was published in the front page of a local English daily on 15th. September. He deserves congratulations for the excellent and revealing photograph that said it all! How can the railway management allow such poor track fish plate fastening with the sleeper at a rail expansion joint, that has to permit length-wise expansion of the rails? The fish plate needs to be firmly bolted to the sleeper, which is essential for safety.//////In a modern society where language should never be a barrier, why is one bound to answer the English vocabulary questions to pass the language part of the IBA admission test? There is no denying the fact that English is an International language which one should be familiar with, to lead a sound professional life. A student can be tested for her/his analytical skill, technical skills and for other faculties. A good vocabulary in no way makes one intelligent. Before the admission test, students memorise a large number of words in SAT books. They only learn those words for the admission test, but forget those eventually! //////Fahim, a poor eight-year-old boy who lives at Narinda, works at a hardware shop at Nawabpur in Old Dhaka. He wants to go to school but can't. He has to work to support his mother who is very sick. Fahim used to go to a nearby school before. But then his mother fell ill and could not work anymore. She then decided to make her only boy self-reliant. So she sent him to the workshop. I talked to Abdul Razzaq, the owner of that workshop. He said, Fahim is an honest boy, always sincere in his work. He is also talented. If he gets a chance to study, he will do well, he added. I want to be solvent so that I can arrange better treatment for my dear mother, said Fahim confidently. I hope one day his dream will come true.//////It has become very common that one must have some experience to apply for a job. How can a fresher get experience if he/she can't get a job in the first place? This is shocking to all new job applicants. In this case, I remember Oscar Wilde who said in The Picture of Dorian Gray that experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Terry Blakeman said: If experience is life's best teacher then why do we have to learn by example?" We know that a young professional can do well without his having any experience. So, it is our fervent request to the organisations that they should have at least some positions in their organisations for the freshers who will become experienced with time.//////Electric rickshaw is a rickshaw with a rechargeable battery, extra chain and gear. This is another great creation of Bangladeshi brain after nosimon, korimon, votvotiya, etc. You can find many of these types of rickshaws all over the country. Most of the rickshaw-pullers are ignorant of controlling the these rickshaws. As a consequence, rickshaw accidents occur frequently and many of us have broken our hands or legs by these accidents. But nobody is there to look after it! The batteries need to be charged the whole night and the rickshaw-pullers charge their batteries from illegal connections. Who is there to look after this? It is high time the authorities took steps to stop these illegal rickshaws from plying our city streets. The government need to ban these electric rickshaws.//////Teachers are considered the most enlightened people in any society; they are called the nation builders. At present, most of the teachers of public universities are engaged in dirty politics to get administrative power and lucrative positions. They often do not take classes and do not assess the exam scripts in time. Hence the delay in publishing results. Teachers should never be involved in partisan politics. Their only duty should be teaching their students and getting involved in various research works. If our teachers are misguided, the students are bound to get spoiled. I therefore urge all the teachers not to engage in politics so that their students can become enlightened citizens by following their ideals.//////.//////Nato-led forces are scaling back joint operations with Afghan forces after a spate of "insider attacks" in which Afghan recruits turned their weapons on Western allies, officers yesterday said.//////Syrian troops shelled several districts in Aleppo and clashed with rebels yesterday, as Damascus ally Iran proposed an observer role for his country alongside Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia and a peaceful solution to the conflict.//////Anti-Japanese protests continued across China yesterday, as the countries' competing claims to a group of islands threatened to escalate.

The project aims to provide an introduction to key cultural institutions, and will give the participants an opportunity to meet several artists, curators and gallery directors from the UK.//////The best part of writing about politics and history is the degree of reactions and responses you get as feedback. There are many people who agree with you and some who don't, which is fair enough. The difficulty arises when some readers, their indignation aroused by what you write, sometimes hurl words and phrases at you that leave you rather surprised. But, as I have learned over the years, it is always the decent thing to listen to the other point of view, no matter how much you tend to disagree with it. Of course, Charles de Gaulle would say something different. Asked once what he thought of people who disagreed with him, he deadpanned: 'I respect people who disagree with me, but I cannot tolerate them.'//////When Pakis-tan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar suggests that they are willing to view Kashmir from "another angle" to tackle the thorniest problem and Indian Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna changes the subject, it means that Islamabad has overcome pressures from within. Of course, Foreign Minister Khar's remark is primarily meant to reopen the problem which remains frozen. Yet the mere suggestion of "another angle" indicates a new confidence that the tottering Asif Ali Zardari government has assumed.//////On September 13, five ministers and two state ministers were sworn in by the president. Two veteran leaders --Tofail Ahmed of Awami League (AL) and Rashed Khan Menon of the Workers Party, a partner of the grand alliance of the AL-led government -- who were invited to join as ministers did not accept the offer.//////As the infamous You-tube film unleashes outrage and mob violence on the streets across the Muslim world, we are confronted with a moral and legal dilemma: what are the limits of free speech? //////The increasing interest in women's empowerment, especially in the "developing" areas of the world today, is gradually taking up an important position in the agenda of world issues. Along with other female-oriented topics under immediate consideration, the role of the "eastern" woman in asserting herself as a capable individual is more openly explored today than ever before. The increased presence of "women behind closed doors" is more noticeable, even in areas where the role of women is comparatively minimised. //////
