The adverse impact has already started to impact the commodity market in the wake of repeated increase in fuel price. The transport cost has increased as a result of this unexpected price hike. Taking undue advantage of this situation, the transport owners are hiking fares whimsically defying the rate fixed by the government. As a result, the businessmen are increasing the price of essentials showing this excuse of increase in transport fares. //////Climate change is the most burning issue at the moment. Climate is changing fast but are we taking the most necessary steps to control it? We are just talking at the seminars or symposiums or planting some trees on the world environment day every year. We need funding to control climate change but more important is how we may properly use those funds. Is there appropriate programme in the country?

I was proud to see my country arranging such a high-profile T-20 tournament like the IPL. But as the tournament progressed, my hopes were turned into disappointment as the stark reality was exposed. The tournament was to help our local players, but that was not to be the case. Instead, the teams were busy catering to the foreign players, and many of our local stars like Shakib and Tamim had to give way to players like Nasir Jamshed and Jason Roy, who are unknown even in their own country. Youngsters like Anamul, Arafat Sunny, Saqlain Shajib and others proved their talent, but they got far too less chances. The spot fixing and semi-final fiasco did their bit to tarnish Bangladesh's image. But the worst part of it was that many people with no proper knowledge of cricket came to the stadium not to watch the game, but to watch Bollywood stars and cheerleaders. However, it was the first time, even IPL is not beyond controversy. So, I hope the authorities concerned will give us a much better BPL next year.//////We are deeply moved at every road mishap. But nothing appears to be as horrifying as knowing that: a kid has been run over by a killer vehicle. We castigate the traffic system; hold uneducated and reckless drivers liable and blame authorities at the end for not punishing these killers. But have we ever blamed or questioned ourselves how much we are conscious about our kids? We often see mothers with their kids crossing a road dangerously despite having an over bridge nearby. The Daily Star made this a headline couple of weeks ago which is appreciable. Yet one thing I think should have been pointed out and that is, we see a mother holding her kid in her lap with one hand and grip her husband's shoulder with other hand on a bike. They didn't even use helmet. How dangerous it is to ride! In abroad one cannot hold a kid on one's lap even inside a car on the road. How this could be allowed for a bike which itself is a very risky ride!//////During the 2011 world cup cricket, Navjos Singh Sidhu, made a remark --"Birds Fly...Cockroaches Fly...But it is birds that stay up in the air!!!" He was actually referring to the Bangladesh Cricket Team as cockroaches in his comment. Well, at present, the Indian Cricket Team is proving to be just that. After winning the World Cup, they seem to have lost all their firepower and are looking like anything but "World Champions!" It really doesn't surprise me. What does Sidhu think about this? I would like to advise Sidhu to talk about cricket in a more technical way. He should learn how to remain neutral and give positive remarks which could help improve the game.//////First I would like to congratulate The Daily Star on its 21st anniversary and thanks for being with us all these years. I would like to inform you that, we are the permanent residents of Mohammadi Housing Ltd. in Mohammadpur Thana.

Why? Because the question of whether Israel has the need and the right to pre-emptively attack Iran as it develops a nuclear potential is one of the most hotly contested issues on the world stage today. It is also an issue fraught with danger for Israel and American Jews, neither of whom want to be accused of dragging America into a war, especially one that could weaken an already frail world economy.//////Two facts stand out signifying a growing interest among our young people to know more about our Liberation War: Books on our freedom struggle topped the selling chart of the recently concluded Boi Mela.
