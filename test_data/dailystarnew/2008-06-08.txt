And it could happen because of some recent actions taken by countries where we have traditionally exported our manpower. One does not need much wisdom to know how badly off we will all be if such conditions come to pass. Of late our manpower industry has been hit badly by government actions in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other places. While we realise that the governments of those countries have the right to formulate their own policies regarding migrant workers from abroad, we also feel that the Bangladesh government should by now have adopted a strong and constructive position regarding our people working there. It is also important that the host countries go through rethinking vis--vis their own migrant worker-related policies. It is equally important that any misgivings here be removed at the earliest. //////Against the backdrop of reckless driving and tragic deaths under the wheels of vehicles at regular interval, the High Court (HC) had given a ruling on March 10, 2008 making installation of speed governor seals in all modes of motorised vehicles mandatory by March 10, 2009. The HC had also instructed the relevant authorities to publish notices in various newspapers to make the owners of vehicles aware of the ruling, particularly mentioning the provisions therein for punishment for noncompliance. It was expected that relevant authorities would take the HC ruling with due seriousness and start the implementation process without further ado. But, to our knowledge, motor vehicle owners have not yet been notified in any manner about the deadline and the details of the instruction. //////The Awami League after an extended meeting of the party on May 26 attended by more than 850 delegates representing almost every tier of their organisation from grass-roots level to the highest echelon, followed by a meeting the next day of the central working committee, the highest decision making body of the party, has decided not to join the ongoing dialogue with out Sheikh Hasina. The decision was unanimous and true reflection of the wishes and sentiments of the party workers and activists. One must admit that the decision, right or wrong, has been taken by the party in a most democratic manner, a practice not so common in the body politic of this country. //////How could my fellow-traveller Buddhadeb Bhattacharya call me the worst prime minister India has had? That stung. I rather like Buddha. I know his typea sheep dressed in wolf's clothing. I've done my bit of lip-service to socialism. What option did one have if you wanted some trajectory up the old Congress bureaucracy greasy pole? Indira Gandhi would spread nonalignment at breakfast and turn pink with the salad over lunch: poor dear, no one told her that nationalisation and nationalism are not quite the same thing.//////Candidates are often guilty of acting the part the press assigns them. This time last year, the press anointed Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Rudy Giuliani as the two "inevitable nominees." Even after Giuliani flamed out fairly quickly, Hillary continued to wear the label as a badge of honour. Of course, the press did not consult the voters.//////It would not be wise to ask the Tigers whether they want to put end to Pakistan's eleven-match winning streak when they play the Kitply Cup opener against Shoaib Malik's side at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today.//////Say, it buckets down for almost an hour.

Now the most talked about issue is the price hike. The prices of the essentials are rising almost every day. The prices of most of the food products have doubled in less than a year. But to overcome this crisis as a nation, we have to think deeply about this matter and analyse the reasons behind the price hike. If we take a look at the international arena we will see that the food prices have ascended globally in a brief period of time. Japan is looking for alternate flour because of the rising wheat price. India, Vietnam and Egypt have put constraints on exporting rice to meet the local demand. The Philippines has announced a ban on converting farmland to other uses in order to cut import of rice. It has to be realised that the food price predicament is global. Cheap local political solutions do not really exist.//////The recent incident at CU is very shocking, where a student jumped from an over-bridge onto a train, failed to reach the train, fell on the rail lines and eventually died. What the students did in response to this incident is also very shameful. May be, at first they could not know the reason behind his death. Here, in Bangladesh, if anything happens against the rights of the university students or anything they don't seem to like, they vandalise vehicles, harass commuters etc. They never seem to understand that they are destroying our national property. //////We heartily congratulate Barack Obama for clinching the Democratic Presidential nomination.

Skill//////2. Honesty//////Our country is developing with highways, multi-storied buildings, mills, factories. But the development will not be sustainable without skill and honesty.//////Too often we say, Past is past while referring to some unpleasant memory, meaning that it is better to think about the present & the future. If we scale down a little more we can even feel comfortable to keep aside the present and seriously think about the future. As a nation what is there in the future for us? Our motherland is the most densely populated country in the world and one of the poorest too. After the agricultural products, we are surviving on garments and manpower export. The first one is unpredictable as weather & other natural calamities are major factors that determine the output and the second one is already suffering due to destructive activities. The third sector i.e. manpower export is also experiencing setbacks, the most recent one being in Bahrain that halted employment of Bangladeshi workers following a crime, a solitary case that has now affected all Bangladeshis working in that country. The government of Saudi Arabia where about 15 lakh Bangladeshis are currently living, has also stopped issuing residential permits creating deportation fear in thousands of Bangladeshi workers there. Our import dependent economy is facing daily challenges from rising oil prices which may hit 200 dollars a barrel at the year end. Above all, if the present pace of global warming continues unchecked, one fifth of Bangladesh will go under the sea by 2050, making 20 million people landless & homeless. //////We heartily appreciate the most practical and appropriate speech by Dr. Kamal Hossain that was published in The Daily Star of May 31. We observe that some political leaders are regarded as Goddess by some political parties. They think the law of the country cannot be imposed on them, they are above trial and enjoy immunity.//////It seems our politicians are not interested in any smooth transition to democracy. They have put their carts before the horses. They want their leaders out of jail before anything else, no matter what happens to the nation. They do not like dialogue, they have now patched up their differences with their rival parties, they are becoming united for a sangram. We are surprised to note that even yesterday's arch enemies are demanding release of their rival leaders. The friends and foes are uniting themselves to take us, probably, to the era of pre-one-eleven.//////I have read with great interest the article on "Saving the coral biodiversity of St. Martin's Island." Congratulations to the author, Dr. Md. M. Maruf Hossain. I should like to make my own contribution to our knowledge of the fauna of the island, collected on a one-week scientific expedition to the island led by the late Professor M.I. Choudhury of Dhaka College in 1957.

Still articles and videos highlighting his social activities are coming out in different media. Mr. Chowdhury recently left Dhaka ending his four-year diplomatic assignment in Bangladesh.//////I am an undergraduate student at the department of English in a private university. As a student, I have always noticed a kind of inferiority complex among the students of my department and that is, they have a feeling that with a graduation degree in English there is hardly any possibility of getting a good job in the present job market, since all the employers are looking for MBA holders, not English literature people. However, to my opinion this is one of the wrong ideas that people have about the students of English language and literature. Why? Let's have a look at the following points://////The Chief Adviser and the army chief duly praised the good work done by the country's peace corps which took part in missions abroad. The CA also took the opportunity of mentioning the armed forces' contribution to the nation from time to time. //////People of Bangladesh are not at all surprised to see Mr. Tofail Ahmed's reaction, as expressed in the print and electronic media, to the recent filing of a corruption case by the ACC against him. The typical way he has reacted is well known to our people. All charges of corruption against our politicians are always 'false and fabricated'. He also hinted that it was a politically motivated case. His political colleagues spared no time to give him a clean chit and urged upon the government to withdraw the case unconditionally. That's what they all had been doing for the last sixteen years. Politicians in our country fail to arrive at agreements on issues related to the welfare of the people. But they take no time to come out in a body, like the members of a trade union, with full force to save their colleagues whenever anyone of them is charged with a corruption case. Can we ask them a simple question: If all of them are innocent as flowers, as it is commonly uttered in political slogans, then who did the corruption in the last sixteen years ? Who were responsible to place Bangladesh on the top of the TI's list of corrupt states for years together ? And, finally, why should the ACC, a non-political independent organisation, file 'false and fabricated' corruption cases against Mr. Tofail and other politicians ? Will any politician be kind enough to answer these questions ?//////US officials are growing increasingly frustrated with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, arguing that he is not up to addressing Afghanistan's many troubles, The New York Times reported yesterday. //////Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have agreed to start drafting elements of a proposed peace accord, the chief Palestinian negotiator said Friday. //////Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, engaged in fierce gun-battles with security forces in the island nation's embattled north, want India to intervene to halt the clashes between the warring sides, a leading daily here has claimed.//////President Bush's motorcade will speed through European capitals next week, but for many Europeans, the Bush presidency is already in their rearview mirrors. //////Relations between the United States military and the Pakistan Army are at their worst point since September 11, 2001, senior Western military officers and diplomats have said, as Pakistani troops withdraw from Tribal Areas bordering Afghanistan. //////With five months to go for the US Presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama and Republican John McCain are locked in a statistical dead heat with more than one in five voters acknowledging that they might change their mind between now and November, an opinion poll showed.//////Water flowed slowly into a manmade spillway yesterday from a swollen lake formed by a landslide in China's devastating earthquake, easing the immediate threat of a flood that had led to the evacuation of more than 250,000 people. //////Five people including three police officers were killed when a bomb apparently targeting police exploded in northwestern Pakistan overnight, police said yesterday.//////A severe shortage of housing has left hundreds of thousands of cyclone survivors in Myanmar exposed to heavy rain as the monsoon season begins, aid agencies said Saturday. //////Tibetan exiles marched in protest against Chinese rule over their homeland in Nepal's capital Sunday before police stopped them and detained hundreds of demonstrators, authorities said. //////Nearly two weeks after its historic landing, the US Mars probe Phoenix has scooped up its first sample of Martian soil and begun analysing it for water and organic compounds, a Nasa official said Friday.//////British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Saturday begged his own party's lawmakers to back plans for tackling terror suspects, in a last-ditch bid to avoid a damaging defeat.//////Iran's powerful parliament speaker Ali Larijani warned the UN nuclear watchdog on Saturday against playing for time in a dispute over Iran's controversial atomic programme.//////Just three weeks before Zimbabwe's presidential runoff, Robert Mugabe is giving the opposition little room to campaign detaining its candidate, banning rallies and attacking diplomats who try to investigate political violence. //////As oil prices surge to record levels, Japan said yesterday it would help build nuclear power plants in the United States, sensing opportunities for Japanese companies.//////Sri Lankan police detained more than 50 people for questioning following twin bomb attacks blamed on Tamil Tiger rebels that killed 23 civilians, the defence ministry said yesterday.//////Jacob Zuma, leader of South Africa's ruling African National Congress party, is to embark on a trip to India and China this weekend, the party said on Friday.//////As a cartoonist artist Shishir Bhattacharjee has attained popularity for his sharp satire on contemporary social milieu, especially the political turmoil.
