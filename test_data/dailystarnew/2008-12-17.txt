There is surely nothing wrong with governments collapsing for lack of parliamentary strength or electoral support and being replaced by new ones. The problem, though, with Thailand in these past two years has been a growing propensity on the part of powerful quarters to weed out governments in a process that laid itself open to criticism as being arbitrary. In September 2006, the military ousted Thaksin Shinawatra's elected government and so started the process that has now led to the present crisis. Thaksin enjoyed the support of a majority of Thais, particularly in the rural regions and among the poor. Those who welcomed his overthrow were the urban elite and the royalists. Despite his removal, however, Thaksin saw two governments, both formed by his loyalists, come to office.//////THERE was little contrition. There was much hubris.

Prof Dr M Anwar Hossain, Vice-chancellor, Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST), Dhaka has given the clear and rightful message that underground rail system would not be an economic and effective viable option to reduce traffic congestion and transport crisis. I agree 100% with Prof Dr. Anwar Hossain, about their conclusion after the round table discussion. I feel that the government and its relevant agencies should think twice, if not thrice, before they start digging mass graves all over Dhaka city considering the geographical condition of our soil, electricity problems and other factors related to construction and maintenance of underground rail system.//////Let me start with an observation made by late American President J.F. Kennedy about half a century ago: "Man have the power to make this the best generation of mankind in the history of the world or to make it the last." All our activities prove that we have chosen the second option, that is, to make it last.//////Bangladesh is rich in biodiversity even though it has a lot of problems to tackle.

It is furnished with good establishments all over Bangladesh. Luckily, I am a degree student of BCU. My Tutorial Centre (TC) is one of the colleges in Dhaka, so my Regional Resource Centre (RRC) is Dhaka. This why I am to visit Dhaka RRC very often to collect programme related information. But as ill luck would have it, recently I had to acquire some sad and bad experience at Dhaka RRC. I want to mean that some officials concerned of the RRC don't attend the students professionally. They always seem to be annoyed with the students, so non-cooperation is a regular phenomenon at the office. Very often, officials refer the students to the lower staff who are quite unable to solve the problems. There are some problems which might be solved by the officers only. Actually many students don't know even where they will complain against the ill-behaved staff. Even I don't know the table where I should go to for seeking remedy. It must be noticed that BOU is a public university; it runs with taxpayers' money. So the students have every right to be treated well at the BOU office.//////A math competition was held recently at Latu Mondol High School in Mymensingh.
