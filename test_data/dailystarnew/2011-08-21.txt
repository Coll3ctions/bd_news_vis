Seven years after the August 21 grenade attack on Awami League rally, survivor Abdul Matin, who has been partially paralysed, wants to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and ask for a job.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said her government wants to end killing, terrorism and militancy in the country through bringing the masterminds and killers of grenade attacks of August 21 under trial. //////The explosions which swiftly put an end to the lives of 24 people at a rally of the Awami League in Dhaka seven years ago continues to haunt our collective public conscience. //////Communications Minister Syed Abul Hossain yesterday blamed the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) for the miserable conditions of the highways across the country.//////Bangladesh and India's move for a $1.5 billion joint venture coal-fired power plant in Khulna has somewhat slowed down due to various hitches, and a feasibility study has scaled up cost of civil construction at the project site due to poor soil condition.//////Bangladesh plans to import of another 500 megawatt of power from India under the Bimstec framework. //////The government plans to set up seven power plants partly with hard-term loans from abroad to lessen pressure on the foreign exchange reserve.//////As the nation mourns the killing of acclaimed filmmaker Tareque Masud and media personality Mishuk Munier in August 13 road crash, three others who also lost their lives with them appear slipping into oblivion.//////Lawmaker and noted TV artiste Tarana Halim will go on a hunger strike unto death if the government issues driving licence without any test.//////Malaysia yesterday again extended the deadline to Aug 31 for biometric registration of irregular expatriate workers to regularise them under an amnesty programme. //////A teenaged girl killed herself on Friday, failing to stand the humiliation of being flogged at a village arbitration in Madaripur Sadar upazila. //////A fake doctor was arrested yesterday at Mirpur in the capital and awarded two years' imprisonment by a mobile court. //////The recently inaugurated Baliamari-Kaliachar border haat has been struck by flash flood and erosion of the river Jhinjiram on Wednesday.

That they have finally begun to focus on such issues nearly three years into their term as parliamentarians is appreciable, though one is tempted to ask why they desisted from doing the same till now. The MPs' ire at the patent inability of the government to handle such issues as roads, power, prices of essentials, et cetera, is a clear sign of desperation on their part. In the face of mounting criticism of the government's failure to satisfy public expectations, the lawmakers have found it extremely difficult to face their constituents. They have acknowledged as much, which obviously reflects on the government and raises a number of questions regarding governance or the lack of it. The MPs' sentiments are also, sadly, an indication of the growing chasm between them and ministers content to mouth platitudes at every opportunity. //////The latest suicide bomb attack in a mosque in Jamrud nearly 25 kilometers from Peshawar is the thirtieth of its kind since January 2011. And the figure of dead and injured is a grim reminder that extremism and violence in the name of religion is getting the better of the state machinery in Pakistan. //////Hapless India slumped to 103-5 at stumps in their first innings on the third day of the fourth Test at The Oval on Saturday after an Ian Bell double ton had fired England to 591-6 declared.//////Since last Friday when the Tigers lost the first one-dayer in Harare, the constant line from the Tigers, casually or officially, was of a win making all the difference.//////Xavier Doherty and Brett Lee took four wickets apiece as Australia defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets in the fourth one-dayer on Saturday to gain an unbeatable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.//////Bangladesh national team will be receiving Argentina and Nigeria teams on their arrival in Dhaka for the international friendly to be played on September 6, said the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) on Saturday.//////When Kyle Jarvis stood in line to receive his Test cap, his family name made history in Zimbabwe cricket.

It had double yellow lines on certain 'blind' corners which were the first I had seen here! //////London and other English cities are in turmoil. With the current coalition government where no one has a definite say, riots were at the top of things to happen. The main cause for these riots, which were caused mainly by the young underclass of English society, is that there are talks of rights but lack of responsibility. The current Conservative government seems as if it doesn't want UK youth to be educated anymore. Is 9,000 an appropriate amount for a year's worth of university education? Or, what about the budget cuts that benefits the upper class of society but destroy the underclass? Cameron's 'Big Society' in which everyone helps everyone is certainly at an all-time low. Some people need to control their children whereas a certain person needs to take control of the country. //////We know many factors are responsible for road accidents. Unskilled and whimsical driving, transport's unfitness and bad road conditions etc. might be the most prominent factors. However, as these problems solving agencies are beyond passenger's reach instantly but they are the most victim group of accidents, so they, the passengers onboard, should come forward for playing an important role in this regard.//////As per recent reports 70-90% food items of our country are adulterated. It is sad news for the whole nation. Probably we will not find any country in the world like ours. Adulteration has been happening for many years but of late it has crossed the limit, posing serious health hazards to the people. It has the worst impact on our children's mental and physical growth and women's fertility. Food adulteration causes cancer and damages vital human organs like liver, kidney and heart. It is the result of greed of a handful of dishonest businessmen. They must be dealt with rigorous punishment; otherwise, the health of the whole nation will be jeopardized soon.//////Government colleges have not been on the list of best colleges for the last few years. It is because they are plagued with multifarious problems such as lack of teachers, dirty politics, absence of easy new subjects like computer and Islamic studies, poor monitoring and corruption. There are many government colleges where only one teacher is to run the whole department single-handedly juggling between office works and giving a few classes that is humanly possible out of several classes everyday. Naturally most often students get no classes as a result they recourse to private tutors and coaching centers. So government college classes remain almost empty that too often get disturbed or closed by wrangling and violence between rival groups and college administration itself. This sorry state is there for long. The repeated application for creating new posts and opening new subjects often gets no nod from the concerned ministries. On the other hand, college administrations get discouraged to do development works in the colleges because of racketeering by the student leaders backed up by the local MPs. Only political commitment and proper monitoring and attracting good ones to teaching professions can turn the sorry state of the government colleges around. //////The unnatural death of the two prodigies, one prominent filmmaker Tareque Masud and another eminent media personality Mishuk Munier, is an irreparable loss for our film industry and electronic media. This happened due to lack of responsibility of the drivers and poor state of the roads. Tareque Masud's films Muktir Gaan (1995) and Matir Moina (2002) have achieved international awards and also represented us to the whole world. All of us had expected that he would be more renowned for his next film Kagojer Ful (The Paper Flower) but our dream is shattered with the dreadful road accident. I hope that Catherine Masud would complete the remaining work of the film Kagojer Ful to fulfill the dream of Tareque Masud.//////I have been reading some of Prof. Muntasir Mamun's articles and I find them hilariously funny and to the point. His article (Colonel Shaheb gets angry) about Oli Ahmed's distortion of our liberation history and its dissection was not only great but it was also necessary. //////The most attractive Iftar offer for the last few years has been Pizza Hut's Ramadan Feast Eat as much as you can for pizzas and soft drinks at a definite price. A very good business idea indeed we jump at it at every chance that comes our way. Pizza Hut buzzes with customers, almost to a bursting point at Iftar . //////Road accidents have become perpetual lead news in Bangladesh. Every day we get the horrific news of road mishaps in the print and electronic media. Many valuable lives are lost in these road accidents. Actually, the highways have become death traps in our country and road accidents are occurring frequently on these highways. Reckless driving, overtaking, overloading, defective vehicles and dilapidated roads are mainly responsible for road accidents. We all should raise our voice to curb these accidents. The government should take pragmatic and effective measures to check road accidents. Traffic police as well as highway police can play a pivotal role here. The commuters should be more aware in this regard. They should not travel on the roof of the vehicles and incite the drivers to overtake other vehicles on the highways. Those who own private cars should be strict with their drivers. We all should keep in mind that life is more valuable than time.//////It seems that the country especially Dhaka is having the most under aged drivers who do not have license but they are driving tempos and human haulers. Other than this they also drive mini buses and pickups when need arises. This is not only in Dhaka but also in other districts. They are doing it by managing the traffic police and the sergeants. As a result the road accidents are increasing tremendously in the city. We the concerned citizen of the country ask the police department to check these and take stern measures against all these drivers. It is also alleged that these drivers who did not even cross the age of 15 confidently tell that age does not count in this profession. It is the money that matters and we have given some money and got fake license. They say that the owner gives them permission to drive the mini buses if the driver does not show up. We vehemently ask the police to check this practice and stop these teenagers to drive these vehicles which is dangerous for the people who travel by these buses.//////An Indian army lieutenant and a dozen suspected militants were killed in a clash along the de facto border that splits Kashmir between India and Pakistan, the army said.//////Egypt called on Israel yesterday to immediately halt punitive strikes on the Palestinian Gaza Strip after militants carried out deadly attacks in Israel.//////Striking a conciliatory note, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday said there was a "lot of scope for give and take on a proposed anti-corruption law and the government was open to discussion on the issue.//////As Anna Hazare continued his protest fast, a parliamentary standing committee yesterday invited public suggestions on the Lokpal Bill.

A demand to stop coaching centres was raised in the meet. Such a demand is not new. Private tutoring is a popular topic in any discussion on education.

It was the day that my friend Minu and I had planned to watch the movie Guerilla in the Bashundhara Multiplex cinema.

However, I have to confess that, secretly, I was put off by the weather and was on the verge of cancelling the programme. //////
