They often refuse to travel to certain places on the plea that the routes to those destinations face traffic jams. Their demand for exorbitant fares is based on their daily deposits to owners having increased considerably. Worst of all, they often refuse to undertake short trips even if higher fares are offered. //////Judiciary is the last resort for obtaining redress of one's grievances. It must be able to act as an institution without fear or favour. It has to be able to respond independently. This will only be possible if there is separation of the Judiciary from the Executive in the truest sense of the term.//////I asked some high-up in the government at the centre what happened at Nandigram. He merely said: "The CPM's waterloo." The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has, indeed, been exposed, and it has lost stock among the intelligentsia. Nandirgam in West Bengal is a cluster of villages. This is where the CPM government tried vainly earlier in the year to acquire agricultural land in the name of "public interest" to establish a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). //////On July 10 this year, Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation served the notice of closure on 3,300 permanent and 2,000 non-permanent/ temporary workers of the People's Jute Mill.

And that is what I did in Jamalpur last month. South Asia Partnership Bangladesh having invited me to hear individuals and NGOs in Jamalpur district narrate their experience in providing relief to flood affected people, I thought it would be a refreshing opportunity, away from the nation's capital, of coming by perspectives on a natural happening that afflicts this country annually. And, remember, this time round the floods came twice. The first one destroyed lives and crops; and as soon as the waters receded, farmers began to plant new seeds and seedlings as a first step toward recovery. And then came the second flood, the waters simply washing away the seeds and seedlings and leaving behind a large swath of misery.//////It is always hard to comprehend the anger, vengeance or plain sadism that can drive people to commit acts of unimaginable horror.

He will live in the hearts of the vast common people of whose rights he fought for during his entire life. //////Most Bangladeshis have rural origin. The second generation urban dwellers also have rural links. The links are tenuous for most urban dwellers. They may have dwelling houses in the rural areas; these are not well maintained, nor are these under the effective control of the urban owners. The houses are either kept under lock and key or occupied partly or wholly by relatives or friends. During their infrequent visits the owners stay in these houses, the duration is usually very brief. The buildings again come under the effective control of care taker relatives or friends.//////Rich mother's son passed in her last chance////// The Baccalaureate of Conveyance.////// He lacked caution and discretion////// And caught in an act of misappropriation. //////The mother protested: "It is a dirty ploy.////// //////Let's say you have a promising business and are always looking for new ways to gain the edge over your competitors.

The government of Myanmar withdrew India's (under the Gas Authority of India Limited or GAIL) status of "preferential buyer" on the A1 and A3 blocks of its offshore natural gas fields and instead declared their intent to sell the gas to PetroChina. The offshore gas fields of the Shwe project in the Bay of Bengal have estimates of 4.8 trillion cubic feet (TcF) for the current blocks with more exploration ongoing. The controlling interests in the two blocks are Daewoo International (60 percent), O.N.G.C. Videsh Ltd (20 percent), GAIL Ltd (10 percent) and Korea Gas Corporation (10 percent).//////The security concerns of Bihar differ from other states in India. On the one hand, it does not have border-related security issues while, on the other, there is no separatist movement for creating a new state - Jharkhand has already separated from Bihar. Communities in Bihar are divided on the basis of caste identities unlike most other states of India. This division of its society on the basis of castes and sub-castes is so strong that political parties contesting elections in the state try to address only those sections that are their committed voters. Any attempt at harmonising the castes can lead to an erosion of their vote bank.//////Simone de Beauvoir was certainly not a wreck after Jean-Paul Sartre died in April 1980. But for the next six years, until her own end in 1986, she was a terribly lonely soul. The decade of the 1980s, in more ways than one, was fundamentally the end of an era, one that Beauvoir and Sartre had both epitomised for years together. They were academics who loved a good, spirited debate between themselves and with their friends. They frequented bars and restaurants, spent time reflecting on the vagaries of life and sat for hours writing and watching the world go by. Existentialism, they believed, was all. The mundane, well, it did not appeal to them much.//////This is November, a month very close to the twelfth month of the year, the memories of which are painful and at the same time joyous. Joyous because 16 December reminds us of our victory over inequality, repression, animosity and oppression of the genocidal Pakistani soldiers. This month brought the laurels of victory to the very valiant, fearless and patriotic nation that is Bangladesh.//////The original short stories in Bangla were compiled and translated into one volume by Radha Chakravarty. Situated within the same cultural context, Bengal, wherein artificial boundaries are transgressed, these writings unfold reality in so many varied dimensions of human emotions. These then echo from within the depth of the human psyche that ranges in myriad shades. It is the lives of ordinary individuals as they grapple with forces larger than themselves. These narratives leave an indelible impression. //////The study tracks and records the socio-economic and political evolution of village people and their rural economy. Based on a broad canvas, the study looks set to attract a wider audience than it was originally intended for.//////A charming offering of some of the best from the Bard. Of course, these tales have been read earlier or conveyed by word of mouth. Even so, rereading them promises to be quite an experience. The old ambience of life, a lost tradition, along with a sprinkling of smells and feelings that remain no more, these tales are essentially a journey through nostalgia.//////
