It is, however, not clear why the board is focusing more on organizing matches with some particular countries than trying to increase the number of test matches for Bangladesh. Big teams such as South Africa, England, Sri Lanka play approximately four matches in every bilateral series. On the other hand, Bangladesh hardly plays four test matches in a calendar year! Hence, it is cer5tain that one or two additional test series against teams like India or Pakistan will not bring big changes in our cricketing scenario but bring enormous financial benefit for the Board. So, BCB should emphasise more to enhance the number of matches for Bangladesh team. Moreover, now Bangladesh is the vice-president ICC. Therefore, we have got the opportunity to bring some positive changes in Future Tour Programs (FTP) of ICC. By not getting biased we can bring significant changes for Bangladesh cricket. However, we need to focus more on these practical issues.//////Time has arrived when Agricultural Extension should get its approaches re-designed to face the new challenges like climate change coupled with overpopulation and depletion of natural resources.

This is not the first case of suicide in our campus; at least eight or nine students committed suicide in the last three years. There were many reasons behind their suicides such as failure in love, setbacks in academic life, session jam, family problem, and so on. Bad teacher-student relation also contributes to the frustration of the public university students. //////I am not sure how much 'cash poverty' has to do with the numbers of uneducated children. Some poor children are not in government schools because the 'not-so-poor' parents complain if their children are in the same class as, for instance, those of shoe-makers - shock! horror! It just needs the government to apply pressure - and moral training - to the Head and other teachers to welcome poor children, in accordance with their constitutional right to be educated, face up to snobbish parents (every nation has them!) and demand Management Committees do not cave in when wailing parents ring them up! Good Heads in every country have to protect the poorest pupils from the rest and move heaven and earth to find government and/or private donors so they can afford their uniforms and books. //////Bangladeshi Terror Suspect//////President Barack Obama predicted passage of immigration reform and a deficit-reduction deal, offering a fresh glimpse of his second-term agenda as he fights for votes in the final stretch of the tight race for the White House.//////Syrian troops bombarded a town near Damascus yesterday and fighting raged in and around the northern city of Aleppo, a day before a proposed truce for a four-day Muslim religious holiday.//////Calm returned to Gaza yesterday as a truce between Israel and Hamas took hold after a bloody 24 hours of violence that left four Palestinians dead and two Thai workers wounded in Israel.//////A man suspected of involvement in an attack on the US consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi last month was killed in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, officials said yesteray.//////The African Union has readmitted Mali after suspending it from the pan-African bloc following a March coup, and backed plans for authorities there to recapture the north from radical Islamists.//////Energy giant Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani has retained his title as the world's richest Indian -- for the fifth year in a row -- with a net worth of $21 billion, according to Forbes.//////Striking South African gold miners have signed a pay deal to end months of often violent labour unrest, the country's main mining union and mine owners said yesterday.//////On Eid, it's time to unwind in front of the small screen. All the Bangladeshi channels are offering a surfeit of entertainment ranging from special TV plays, tele-films, musical performances to variety shows. Whatever the medium, there's likely to be something for everyone. A rundown of the Eid-special programmes on different channels://////The Indian home secretary was in town lately, when he supposedly said more than he was willing to listen. He talked about terrorism, extradition treaty, border security and other issues of interest to two countries. But he left us in the no-man's land when the journalists asked him about the border killings. What the secretary said in response was obtuse jugglery of words. He said that when the Bangladeshis are gunned down by BSF, it should be called death instead of killing.//////The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) is testing the water. It too realises that elections are many months away but wants to know whether Hindutva is acceptable to the voters.

The party has not yet got over from the defeat of last parliament elections when it was all set to occupy the treasury benches only to find out that the communal tag attached to it had pulled the party down. Its Hindutva image brought the surprised Congress back to power.//////Where bad ideas have nowhere else to go, they emigrate to America and become university courses."

In doing so, not only will we be able to save our environment, we will also be able to enrich it. But we must act now. We must act to create a livable, survivable, and safe environment. And we have a potent weapon at our disposal to combat the crisis -- social business.//////The alarming accident rate on the highways of Bangladesh in recent years could help them earn the title of "death trap." The number of highway accidents in our country is much higher than in any developed or even developing country. One of the major causes of these accidents is the failure of the drivers to abide by the traffic laws such as violating the speed limit or passing other vehicles at no passing zones (curves). //////The Byzantine civil war of 13411347 formally begins with the proclamation of John VI Kantakouzenos as Byzantine Emperor at Didymoteicho.//////This week Apple faces two significant tablet challengers.
