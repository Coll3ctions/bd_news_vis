It was a critical period when the cold war rivalry grew between the USA and USSR with Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The USA started to propagate global Islamic jihadism against socialist block-the common enemy of both. At that time, the innocent young Osama left the luxurious life and took part in Afghan war. Thus, Osama became a successful leader of about 20,000 Taliban warriors. He fought the battle with bravery and secured the US' interest.After the collapse of Soviet Union, to protect his own interest, accelerated by the US propaganda, Osama declared Jihad against his previous ally USA. Consequently, he has appeared as a threat to US national interest. Now it has been proved that the rise of Bin Laden as a global hero and the death of him as the world's most wanted terrorist were only for the preservation of US interest.//////This is on the news item Student left in critical state published on May 6 in the last page of The Daily Star.

The choice of the venue, by a dingy lane, may seem a little unusual to many. But the group of artistes who put together the event wanted "an art happening at Beauty Boarding." The term "happenings" was coined by American painter Allan Kaprow in the late 1950s and his counter cultural, interactive works shaped much of the course of late 20th century art. In his views, the distinction or hierarchy between artists and viewers are superfluous and viewers' reaction determines the art piece, making each "happening" a unique experience.

I'm sure he lived next to me. My neighbours were so noisy they either had 50 children or were terrorists making homemade nuclear bombs (a uranium-235 centrifuge makes a racket).
