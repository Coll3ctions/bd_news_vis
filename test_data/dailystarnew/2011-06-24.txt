The poverty rate at the national level has gone down by 8.5 per cent between 2005 and 2010. In absolute terms, this is no mean achievement, given the shock of global recession and internal political instabilities it had to absorb along the way. //////The University Grants Commission survey findings about five public universities are certainly worrying. The survey, which covered the universities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi and the Bangladesh Agricultural University, reveals the depressingly low standards to which teaching has declined among a large number of academics. When 28 per cent of teachers are observed to be extremely poor in teaching, when indeed the quality of research work undertaken by academics (13 per cent of teachers are not into research at all, while only 20 per cent are doing very well) does not conform to regional or international standards, it is time for us to sit up and take notice. There would be little point in arguing that beyond this 28 per cent are those teachers who appear to have been doing a good job. The fact is that teaching at the public universities must be of a uniformly high quality which demonstrates the intellectual excellence of academics. //////The farcical situation regarding the Bangladesh national football coaching job took another turn when the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) announced yesterday that it would be Macedonian Nikola Ilievski, and not his compatriot Gjorgji Jovanovski, who will take charge of the Bangladesh team ahead of their FIFA World Cup pre-qualifiers. //////Defending champion Serena Williams needed another three-setter to reach the Wimbledon third round on Thursday while former number one Ana Ivanovic barely broke sweat in her last 64 encounter.//////Swedish fifth seed Robin Soderling came from two sets down to defeat Australia's Lleyton Hewitt and reach the third round at Wimbledon here Thursday.//////The Bangladesh League Committee looking into a match-fixing allegation will submit its report to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) next week.//////With the title of the professional football league already won by Sheikh Jamal, the two most popular outfits Abahani and Mohammedan square off in the Bangladesh League fixture today with not much more than pride and their places in the league tables at stake.//////The Citycell Basketball League gets underway today at the Dhanmondi Basketball Gymnasium with 10 teams taking part in the single-league meet.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) picked eighteen cricketers for a three-week long preparation camp for the Bangladesh Under-19 team. //////In another demonstration of their improving record overseas, a weakened India eased to a 63-run victory, only their fifth Test win in the Caribbean on Thursday.

The four-time World Champions have had that tag stuck to them for their win-at-all-costs attitude.

Professor at the Department of Law in the University of Dhaka. And according to him it's because of the ever changing nature of the modern technologies. Due to cyber crimes surfing in the internet is harmful nowadays! In our country cyber crimes probably started with spam mails and Trojan attacks, but it now extended to debit/credit card theft, cell phone threats and frauds. On Sept. 5, 2008, RAB discovered that their website had been hacked! But RAB was successful in catching the hackers which proved that Bangladesh was not far behind in catching cyber criminals. Cell phone threats are also very harmful but the victims keep quiet as it would result in their embarrassment. We should take precautions against cyber crime. Please don't download free content from the internet as it carries within harmful software. We should not use cybercafs as most of their computers can record one's email address and basically everything that is typed! Take precautions. //////A front page report on the subject was published in local English daily on 8th June depicts the downside of plantation of exotic trees; that harms the soil. Now, belatedly, we are wise after the event! Agriculture Minister criticized plantation of such trees (like eucalyptus, acacia, ipilipil etc.). These were planted with donor money (?) in north Bangladesh by the forest department in 1990.//////On 17th June, our honourable commerce minister said that food price in our country is cheaper than any other country. It's true. But he can't take it as an achievement for the govt. Even at the time of Shaista Khan when it was thought that the food price was really cheap, it was not true at all. It was relatively cheaper from other provinces. But people were starving (ref: Sonar Bangla: Myth O Bastobota by Dr. Akbar Ali Khan in Bangladesher Etihash.) So, it should not be a topic to talk about. The thing that matters most is the purchasing power of the people. Now-a-days, the food price is really very high. Inflation is rising. Value of money is decreasing. People are forced to buy fewer products with their fixed income, which means people's purchasing power is decreasing. We have to talk and think about those problems. This should be the subject of concern for our minister. //////We are proposing the following framework for a modified Caretaker Government (CG) for running the National Assembly (NA)/ parliamentary elections.//////As the monsoon has set in, rains are more frequent now. Sometimes it rains for hours together at a steady pace. Sometimes we experience heavy downpour.

Although this field is advancing rapidly, it has been rather foreign to the young learners of Bangladesh. The textbooks often contain confusing, sometimes even false, information which has all but raised interest in the subject. To popularise this science, some well administered steps are to be taken.//////Like sizzling burnt earth, I was passing the time waiting for the Monsoon. The rain set in with a thunder since the first day of Ashar and the nature looked striking. I went out for a drive to see Dhaka in rain. While I was halfway from Gulshan to Banani, I was stuck in traffic jam for a while and rolled down the window glass of my car to feel the rain's beating. //////What it takes a man to buy something? Money, financial potentiality. I wonder with amazement how a person affords to buy a car for Tk.30,00,000 in a country where the per capita income is less than US$1000, whereas the same car in a much better condition sells for less than Tk.3,00,000 where the per capita income is more than US$ 40,000.//////Mahatma Gandhi first introduced hartal against the British rulers in India, and from then it was established as a democratic right of the people of the region. But nowadays, it has become a panic to the common people of the country. During hartal, sufferers are mostly the day labourers, drivers, hawkers and the common people of the country who are living from hand to mouth. Some offices such as garment factories, media offices, hospitals and other emergency services are open during hartal. People who work there have to attend their offices in time. Hartal makes a very little effect; rather it increases the sufferings of the people. In a nutshell, it can be said that we have no respect for hartal nowadays whomsoever declares it. Please think about alternatives. //////Torturer husband of the DU teacher should not go unpunished. Otherwise not only Rumana herself, everybody else will be losing their faith in justice.
