The sense of urgency conveyed by this move to see the dream project materialise for Bangladesh finds a resonance with the people of Bangladesh. //////The seriously aggravated condition of city streets is a source of immense suffering to city dwellers. It takes on a new severity during the rainy season when roads and streets are often waterlogged. It is in this season utility service providers dig up roads to install pipes of different sizes. All too predictably, those dug-up trenches are not filled up in time and so the dire straits the roads are being left in and circuitous traffic movement. //////The long wait was over for West Indies. They were once the mighty West Indies, proud owners and creators of a formidable legacy, but over the last decade and a half have been a shadow of their former selves.

Almost all the newspapers featured the BCL cadres lunging forward with guns in hand shooting at the opposition Shibir cadres with police taking no action to stop the fighting. BCL leaders say that they with the help of general students resisted the onslaught of Shibir. The incident begs the questions as to what made Shibir so outrageous that necessitated the resistance, what led the students to use lethal weapons and most importantly what the authorities have already done to arrest the gun wielding students. We have the disconcerting report that the very gun-toting BCL leaders went to the Motihar police station to file cases against the Shibir cadres and went away without police arresting them obviously because they are the pro-government student cadres. This cannot be the norms of a democratic country. The long culture of ruling party autocracy and resultant injustice and oppression has been creating social maladies and unrest. The government can no longer evade responsibility for making the opposition scapegoat for all these serious social malaise.//////Nowadays we can't find a single field! Children are deprived of playgrounds, which means no physical exercise. Many studies have revealed that students can become really good in studies if they have a balance of physical and mental exercise. But no, we are confined to our own homes. Now, in our free time what will we do? Playing games on electronic gadgets like Nintendo DS, PSP and watching TV, we become mentally exhausted. In the past there was no shortage of playgrounds. But now due to towers, skyscrapers (and all the other selfish reasons of petty people) there is not a single field left for us. When will a saviour come, hear our plea, and save us from our little prison called home?//////Ataus Samad, my beloved friend's death shocked me since he was my best friend since school days. Friends and political parties paid him rich tributes as he devoted his life to the profession of journalism.//////Jhenai and Bairan are two small rivers originating from the Jamuna and have been flowing across Jamalpur and Tangail districts. Once these two rivers had heavy current and abundant water all the year round. //////Street children live neither with their parents nor in a home. They have either lost their parents or their parents have left them. They live on the streets and have to earn a living by begging or stealing. Street children can be found in almost all countries. Many of them take drugs to cope with their life. Due to the drugs and horrific living conditions they often get sick. Is it not our duty to extend our helping hands towards them so that they can live a healthy life?//////According to a news report published in the DS dated Sept 29, a 26-year-old Bangladeshi, Shafiqul Islam Sohel, was shot dead in a shop at Pine Bluff near Little Rock of Arkansas state on the night of Sept 25. The young man from Rangpur worked for Big Red Food Mart owned by a Bangladeshi there. It is also reported that he was the third Bangladeshi to be so killed there over the last one month. Earlier on Sept 21, Moin Hassan, a post graduate student died a day after he was shot inside a shop at Bridgeport city in Connecticut. Another victim Lutfor Rahman was shot dead at a Food Mart in Pine Bluff on Aug 25.//////There are no excuses and the home minister has to shoulder the whole responsibility as his men in uniform and all the intelligence wings in the country took no action during continued rampage for hours. This is an act of serious human rights violation. The state failed to protect a community which happens to be a minority and we all find that there is also an element of incitement in the sad incident There are also unconfirmed reports that the whole episode was carefully carried out as a land grabbing project by a few powerful people.//////I congratulate the government on all its efforts to fight power outages and alleviate poverty, and make the country self-reliant. I believe the government has tried its best and will continue to do so to take Bangladesh to greater heights and dignity. Though power generation is a top priority for the government, we know it is a daunting task to bring a perfect balance between demand and supply at this moment. During the IRRI cultivation season, the demand for electricity hits the peak, raising the frequency of load-shedding across the country and leading to enormous public sufferings. //////Traffic jam is one of the worst and disgusting problems in Dhaka city. Every day the city dwellers face this boring problem and feel exhausted. From morning till late night the roads are busy and overloaded with vehicles. Due to traffic jam people, especially the job holders are suffering unbearable pains. When they start the day they have to face the worst traffic and at the end of the day, they have to face the same nightmare. //////Cricketer turned politician Imran Khan claimed victory yesterday at the end of his march against US drone strikes, despite failing to reach his intended destination in Pakistan's tribal areas.//////Syrian mortar fire again struck a Turkish border village yesterday, prompting artillery retaliation for the fourth day as fierce fighting rocked the key city of Aleppo and rebels lost ground in Damascus.//////Voters in Venezuela were going to the polls yesterday in what was predicted to be the country's most tightly contested presidential election in a decade.//////A decade ago, the United States had a virtual monopoly on drones.//////Libya's Prime Minister Mustafa Abu Shagur yesterday proposed to the General National Congress a "crisis government" of just 10 ministers, after the GNC rejected outright his first proposed line-up.//////Thirteen Sudanese military personnel died and nine others were injured when their transport plane crashed west of Khartoum yesterday on its way to conflict-plagued Darfur, state media reported.//////Robert Vadra yesterday dismissed as utterly false, entirely baseless and defamatory allegations over his property dealings with DLF and said he was saddened by attempt of activists Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan to malign him and his family to gain cheap publicity.//////A court in the Maldives yesterday ordered the arrest of the country's first democratically-elected president Mohamed Nasheed, who has challenged the legality of a criminal trial against him.//////Intense protests over release of water to Tamil Nadu continued to sweep Cauvery river basin areas for the eighth day as Karnataka hoped for a positive response from the Supreme Court today on its plea for reconsideration of the September 28 order.//////West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has asked her ministers not to leave their constituencies during the pujas and stay with the people to prepare for the panchayat elections focusing on 'the misdeeds' of the 34-year Left rule.

The whistleblower, the driver who opened the can of worms at the Border Guards, Bangladesh (BGB) headquarters at Pilkhana, some six months ago and then vanished into thin air, has spoken from an undisclosed location to an electronic TV channel the other day. Though essentially he has only retold the old story, what is intriguing is how he could elude the grip of police assuming that the latter at all gave him a hot chase. His remaining in hiding for so long raises more questions than answers. Of course he felt threatened for life after having spilled the beans. Yet it begs questions as to the absence of any serious full-blown attempt at unearthing the scandal which should have included probing interrogation of the driver himself. The driver is the crucial witness in this case. //////Politics is about power. How to be in position of power is what drives politicians. Some politicians will follow the culturally acceptable rules to attain power, others will be innovative. They will try to twist some of the rules provided they can get away with it. That is real life politics in Bangladesh today.//////
