Dr Kamal Hossain spent the whole of March 25, 1971 waiting for the call which General Peerzada had promised he would make. He as well as the other leading figures of the Awami League knew that time was running out, that unless a proclamation came from President Yahya Khan chaos would descend on East Bengal and indeed on Pakistan as a whole. Of course, the junta thought otherwise.

At a time when the people of the then East Pakistan as well as West Pakistan looked forward to an honourable, democ-ratic solution to the political crisis caused by the machi-nations of a class of West Pakistani politicians and the military junta led by General Yahya Khan, the regime went for the dishonourable act of subverting the people's aspirations through a resort to force.

The political critics have got enough food for thought. We have learnt through media that the tyrants who have been ruling their countries for decades were patronised by the US or by the West. Now we see that the mighty countries are supporting the protesters. That means they are going to stand by the future government formed after the revolution.We will watch another somersault of the mighty countries soon. I think millions of people of the poor countries will fall victims to morally deviated diplomacy of the West.//////Nowadays huge lumps of garbage can be seen under open sky at different places in the metropolitan city. As a consequence, the pedestrians passing by the dustbins are seriously affected by the obnoxious smell coming out of these open dustbins. Sometimes the odour becomes so acute that the passers-by have to cover their nostrils to escape from the menace. //////In Bangladesh, oppression on women has become a common scenario. Everyday we are find news in the electronic and print media about violence against women which is increasing at an alarming rate. Sexual harassment, eve-teasing, rape, fatwa based killings have become a daily routine while law enforcers including our Home Minister are claiming that law and order situation is under control. Adopting many strategies and policies, the govt. has to play pivotal role to ensure a congenial environment especially for women living in the rural areas of the country. Implementation of a new women policy and CEDAW law could change the condition of women. Materialising such a job is not an easy task for the govt. while most of the religious parties are against it. It is the core duty of the present govt. to establish a gender discrimination free society. //////It is proposed that various taxes including Property Tax be imposed by the government to increase the revenue as well as reducing the gap between the poor and the rich. The best method is an inheritance tax above a certain threshold which is followed by all western countries and which has narrowed the gap between the poor and the rich. Such tax has siphoned off the power of elites and aristocratic dynasties and the landed gentry from the western world and has encouraged philanthropic tax-free donation habit. I implore the government to introduce such a tax as well.//////France has responded by pounding Gaddafi's forces. The US and Britain have also joined. The Libyan people will be grateful to France for showing the way. With the U.S. and European joint operations, Gaddafi's African mercenaries will be defeated within a short time. By letting France to strike first, President Barack Obama has closed all doors to the accusation that America wants to control Libya's oil. However, Gaddafi should be given an option. If he agrees to leave without further bloodshed, he may be allowed to live out his life in exile in the same way another African dictator, Idi Amin. If he refuses to do so, he must face the consequences. //////I refer to the article titled "Libya Crisis" published on 18 March issue of The Daily Star. The writer claimed in the article that In 1995 there was a student uprising in Libya. It was mercilessly silenced by Gaddafi's forces. About 1500 students lost their lives in the rebellion." I had been the Ambassador to Libya from 1995 to 2000 and nothing of the sort had happened in 1995 or thereafter. However, following an incident 8 students were reportedly hanged in the campus in presence of their family members in late seventy's or early eighty's. Secondly, universities were small and at no time there were more than 1500 students in any university in Libya fifteen years ago. This kind of free-wheeling dissemination of information without any expertise on a foreign country is no help to the readers or to the Paper. Moreover, quite a number of lines and paras in the latter part of the article were "body lifted" from my article on sanctions on Libya published in the DS of 13 March without quotation or acknowledgment. Though not an admirer of Col. Gaddafi I mention the above to put the record straight.//////Recent developments in some countries of the Middle East and North Africa have made me ponder one thing - Who is the ruler representing? People do not want to be ruled by these so called leaders. By killing their own countrymen they have exposed their intention to remain in power and plunder the wealth of their country. The lust for power has made them so blind that they have forgotten that people will never forget and forgive them for their crimes. Their names will be written as repressors and killers instead of leaders in history.//////True, cricket is often driven by luck. Win or defeat is not the matter. But why the average run rate of Bangladesh cricket team varies so much between matches needs proper investigation.//////The people of Bangladesh are stunned by the government's decision of removing Dr. Yunus from Grameen Bank. We will provide 1one job for every household, we will make Bangladesh a digital Bangladesh, we will provide one kilo of rice at Tk.15, etc were the pledges that our Prime Minister made before she came to power. Has the government succeeded in keeping the promises it made? People in Scandinavia and Europe have high regards for Dr. Yunus. Removing such an intellectual person from Grameen Bank is indeed a highly unacceptable act. The government should be more concerned about the pledges it made to the people. //////In Arab countries democracy is fully absent. Most of the countries like Bahrain, Libya, Saudi Arabia, etc are selling their oil to the West and purchasing arms from them. Latest SIPRI report has showed that military expenditure is increasing in this gulf region. This upsurge and unrest in the gulf countries will adversely affect our economy. The price of oil in international market is still rising. If this oil price hits US $120-125 per barrel within a short time, this will surely affect our economy. On the other hand, this unrest will affect our remittance flow.//////The students of greater Rangpur region are facing problemd in getting admission into a good college. Rangpur Govt. College and Cantonment Public School and College have limited seats. Students have to go to Dinajpur, Bogra and other districts to study. So, we need more educational institutions in this region. And I request the govt. to resume HSC education in Carmichael College and also open some B.Sc Hons courses for the welfare of the students. The govt. should establish Rangpur Science and Technology University, Begum Rokeya Medical College and Begum Rokeya Cadet College as early as possible.//////Begum Khaleda Zia, the leader of the opposition, has reportedly called for holding an interim election.

He came at our invitation, albeit at his own expense. He was no less eager to tell than we were ready to listen. Lifschultz had covered the military trial of Colonel Taher in 1976. Shortly afterwards he was expelled from the country. //////After boycotting 74 consecutive sittings, the opposition BNP lawmakers led by the party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia returned to the House on March 15. Earlier, in a meeting on March 14, the BNP Parliamentary Party decided to join the Parliament. Lawmakers of Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Jatiya Party, which are partners in the BNP-led alliance, also returned to the House. //////The joint air command of the US, UK and France enforcing UN authorised "no-fly-zone" over Libya is content with having achieved complete impunity over the country's air space. Just five days into operation, Gaddafi's ground installations are laid open to attack, whatever little left of them, that is.//////I do not travel a lot inside the country in my present position. It was after a long time that I traveled to the northern region via Gazipur and Tangail. Dhaka city limit ends at Tongi, and I thought that traffic jam would be over once we crossed Uttara or at best Tongi. //////I have served in the United Nations for over three decades. In the course of my various assignments and travels in many nations, I have found that Bangladesh is synonymous with Grameen Bank, Prof. Yunus and Sir Fazle Abed.
