Roughly speaking, there are 32 per cent first-time voters making for a total of 2.3crore. The number of women voters exceed by more than 12lakh that of their male counterpart. First- and second-time voters comprise more than 50 per cent of the electorate. Those who have become voters after the birth of Bangladesh constitute more than 50 per cent of the electoral roll. //////The Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) will cancel its plot allotments in Gazipur and Uttara for individuals found to have submitted fake tax identification numbers (TINs). That is an appreciable decision and we are happy to note that the organisation will be assisted by the National Board of Revenue in the job of identifying people submitting fake TINs. Given a context where individuals have been supplying false TINs in a number of vital areas, it makes plain good sense to launch a campaign toward bringing the guilty to book. Where the cancellation of plots is concerned, however, the question here is one of why the TINs must be looked into after a decision on the allotments has already been made. The logical move here would be for the NBR to go for a verification of all TINs submitted by applicants before Rajuk makes its final decisions on the matter.//////THE state of emergency is now over, and street rallies and processions seem to highlight the country's enthusiasm and excitement for the upcoming elections. However, the list of nominees of the major political parties, particularly of the BNP, highlights the prominence of individuals of dubious character in Bangladeshi politics. Additionally, the higher judiciary has allowed some candidates who had been convicted in criminal cases to contest the upcoming elections.//////LIKE many, I am divided on the No-Vote option. On the one hand, this is possibly our only way to send a strong message to the party bigwigs to nominate better candidates; on the other, there is a risk of critical votes getting wasted, since it is next to impossible that the number of no-votes will reach the threshold needed for a re-election in the constituency. //////SINCE the publication of our pieces analysing the polling centre level data from the last three elections in these pages on December 4, 7, 8, and 14, the irregularities discussed here have been reported in highly circulated Bangla dailies (see N.

Sara Stadium in Colombo that proved a point -- one could still read champion off-spinner Muttiah Muralidaran if he applied himself. //////It isn't quite a bombshell but when someone with so few Tests under his belt is classified as the 'best by far' in a certain field, it does turn a few heads or in yesterday's case, warm up a few cold ears.//////England are planning to scrap home Test series against Bangladesh after 2010 because of the increasing commercial unfeasibility of such contests, suggest reports in the UK press.//////India took charge of the second and final cricket Test against England here on Saturday after posting a commanding 453 in their first innings.//////The battle between Barisal and Rajshahi will at last have a conclusion when the tenth and final round of the National Cricket League begins across the country today.//////Batsman Malcolm Waller and wicketkeeper Forster Mutizwa are the two new faces in the 15-man Zimbabwe squad, which was announced on Friday, for the tour of Bangladesh in January.//////Graeme Smith knew there would be pain in his elbow throughout his 108, but he will have to wait to learn whether the courageous display was enough to avoid the hurt of another defeat to Australia.

Sarwar was present at a meeting at a temporary office of Awami League. In fact BCC Mayor Shawkat Hossain Hiron was present there. We regret the inadvertent mistake. //////For the coming general election, the political parties are announcing their election manifestoes. In the meantime, the big two political parties i.e. AL & BNP have already unveiled their respective charter. AL has selected the slogan Charter for Change and the BNP Save Country, Save People. It is not a surprise that the election manifestoes of both Al & BNP are full of promises having 23 pledges from AL & 36 from BNP. The promises include all aspects and expectations of the people, from eradication of corruption to ensuring job for at least one youth from each family.//////It's undeniable that every history has to endure a few shameful scars, which never cease to disparage its supreme pride. As Bangladeshis we must always be ashamed of the fact that we failed to prosecute the collaborators who played a key role in the genocide perpetrated by the Pakistani invaders in 1971. Perhaps, today I'm even more ashamed of our predecessors than these sordid traitors, since our forefathers failed to wash these scars off our glorified history. Today, after 37 years, we demonstrate on the streets for the 'elusive' trial of the war criminals (as if staging a trivial drama), we watch emotional discussions on TV channels where participants ardently demand for effective tribunals and our intrepid freedom fighters hold countless meetings to boycott the war criminals from elections. At the same time, we inevitably put up with the fact that some of these infamous collaborators have served as ministers and top bureaucrats in our government administration. Moreover, we get utterly surprised to see these war criminals 'indifferently' representing one of the notorious political parties (a party reluctant to acknowledge our war of independence) and our leading parties forming lucrative coalitions with these twofaced collaborators in order to win elections! This entire scenario seems to me like a trite satire, characterized by a rather nasty sense of humour. The dauntless existence of these war criminals in our political milieu has turned the tragic tale of our liberation into a 'hysterical mockery' as we imprudently gave them the opportunity to laugh at our inability to ensure justice for our nation and for those who sacrificed their lives for our liberty selflessly. Our failure to punish these barefaced collaborators actually endorses the view once held by these traitors: 'the Bengalis are only good at talking, not at doing'. I really don't know how we should answer our next generations, who (quite logically) might not believe our luminous stories of freedom, when they'll see people who blatantly opposed it occupying the highest ranks in our socio-political system. Our political leaders have continued the perpetual blame-game regarding this issue for long and we incessantly put blames on several scapegoats. Now after 37 years it's quite natural for us to be sceptic about the prospect of 'the ultimate justice'. However, we must not forget that it's never too late to bring those to justice who remorselessly assaulted humanity in the name of God. //////With the number of students increasing rapidly, admission in almost every public medical college and university is getting tougher. //////In preparation for the general elections on December 29, if we take a very good look at Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party nominated candidates, it may be noted that many convicts and corrupt businessmen, bureaucrats are still on the poll race. Although Awami League has introduced many new faces, BNP is still in favour of controversial personalities. Both the parties have controversial alliances too. There are independent candidates but it appears that they do not have flow of cash and power. To judge the value of democracy, to save the nation from endless miseries, we must not vote the corrupt candidates. And if we find no honest candidates we must cast "No" votes.//////Public shoe beating is the worst insult and ridicule to which a person can be subjected to! This is how it is viewed not only in Asia, but I am sure in most of the world. The live TV pictures of Bush being at the receiving end of flying Iraqi shoes is really surprising, though not unexpected; given his deeds against Iraq! It is the expression of the suffering of Iraqis under the killing and destruction let loose by Bush. Given the circumstances; it is probably an appropriate farewell gift from Iraq; a pair of flying size 10 shoes! I do not remember of having heard or seen anywhere near this sort of insulting or demeaning situation that the head of any state had to face, in the last fifty years or so; as long back as I can recollect! Bush brought bombs on Iraq; and ended up being bombed by Iraqi shoes; not an inappropriate response. It reminds me of the famous lines of the poem://////In Islam, there is no provision to kill innocent people for any reason whatsoever. Islam is a religion of peace. Even in the war-field, Muslims are not permitted to kill enemy soldiers unjustly. Moreover, Islam instructed Muslims not to kill women and children even during a real war!//////For the last few days BNP chairperson and her hand-picked Secretary-General are issuing statements to the press to the effect that BNP would accept the election results if the elections were free and fair ! They are talking of conspiracies regarding the national polls. We do not understand why they are raising this issue now? After all CTG is helping the Election Commission to hold the polls in a free and fair manner and they are not stakeholders in this election. //////BSF is killing Bangladeshis on the border areas day after day. But except from a few corners, nobody is protesting it. The caretaker government has taken no action against it. Also the sector commanders' forum is silent in this issue. We are a free nation. But the action of BSF made it questionable. We expect that the sector commanders' forum will take initiatives for trial of BSF. //////The very recent shoe-assault by the gutsy and spirited Iraqi journalist has become a hotcake all over the world. People all over Iraq are in some sort of festive and winning mood having caught George W. Bush, the American President, on their own soil. //////Political parties launched a new way of campaign emphasizing what the candidates should refrain from rather than what initiatives they have taken or what manifestos they have submitted to the nation. One candidate says, "If I am involved in corruption, I take bribe, you should not cast vote for me. But if I don't do that, why do you not cast your vote for me?". //////Begum Khaleda Zia, an ex-Prime Minister and chief of BNP has started her election campaign after performing ziarat at the Mazar of a Holy Shrine at Sylhet. In her very first call to the nation she warned the people that the country "is in deep crisis" and it is only she and her party the jatiyotabadi and so-called Islamist forces can solve these crisis. She also reminded the people that "a deep conspiracy is being hatched to install a "tabedar sharker" meaning a puppet government in the country and again only she and her 4-party can accomplish their unfinished tasks if voted to power again.//////Simi a student of Dhaka university Marketing Department 13th batch (session 2006-2007) is suffering from kidney disease. Both of her kidneys have been badly damaged. She needs proper treatment right now. //////Just few days ago my sister and her family went to ZIA to fly to USA with immigration visa. They have their USA visa on their passports and have got an immigration visa packet from the Dhaka US Embassy. This packet is addressed to the American immigration officials on arrival at the airport and nobody is allowed to open this document. This fact is known to every immigration officers in ZIA. Unfortunately, an immigration officer from ZIA indiscriminately pressed my brother-in-law and sister to open that immigration visa packet. He refused to let them go until they opened it and kept them waiting. In the meantime a gentleman came from the immigration booth and asked them about their case. They explained him that the immigration officer wanted to open their visa packet. This gentleman then explained that rude man that he is not eligible to see the paper inside the packet and my brother-in-law/sister is not allowed to open it.//////It is very heartening to note that the valiant Sector Commanders of our liberation war have united together in a forum to stand against the war criminals of 1971 who collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces to annihilate the Bengalis from our sacred soil through ruthless killing, arson, rape and what not?//////Would someone kindly explain to us why we are holding this very expensive and dangerous election? The obvious answer is that Bangladesh is a democratic country and we have the power to choose who should run our country. Okay, so far so good. But, if democracy is about having the power to choose your leader, then why have we been stuck with Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina since 1991? Yes, it is possible for a leader to get elected multiple times but only if s/he is exceptionally good. Based on their 17-year performance record, do you think Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina are exceptionally good leaders? This year again Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina have decided that we have to choose between them. But how did the two ladies come to this conclusion? What selection process have they used to prove to us that they are the two most suitable candidates to run our country for the next five years? //////If Pakistan cannot keep the promises made to India on not supporting terrorist activities, India would be obliged to "consider the entire range of options that exist" to protect itself, External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Gangtok on Friday.//////Pakistan has satisfactorily complied with the UN's sanctions on the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the Islamic charity group declared a terrorist group by the Security Council, a top UN official has said.//////Sri Lanka's navy sank a Tamil Tiger rebel ship and four smaller attack boats in a battle that killed 20 guerrillas off the northeastern coast early yesterday, the military said.//////With the country's 7,500 km coastline vulnerable to terrorist attacks, the Home Ministry has decided to set up a committee to go into the difficulties on account of fishing harbours within the port limits.//////Iraq's parliament has rejected a draft law that would allow troops from the UK, Australia and a number of other countries to remain after 2008. //////UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is "extremely concerned" about the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and urged an extension of a recently ended truce, his office said Friday.//////An overwhelming majority of Pakistanis believe the country is moving in the wrong direction and nearly 60 per cent would rather prefer PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif as president than Asif Ali Zardari, a survey has said.//////Suspected Taliban militants in northwest Pakistan opened fire on an oil tanker used to supply fuel to foreign forces in Afghanistan, killing three people, local officials said yesterday.//////The chief of global police agency Interpol met Indian officials yesterday and pledged assistance in a probe into last month's attacks in Mumbai by gunmen whom India insists came from Pakistan.//////US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has ordered the deployment of a combat aviation brigade with some 2,800 troops to Afghanistan next year, a US military official said Friday.//////Thailand's new prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva unveiled his cabinet yesterday aimed at building reconciliation and reviving the economy, but the ministerial line-up has already stoked tensions.//////Eight Taliban-linked militants were killed in a joint operation by Afghan and US-led forces in volatile southern Afghanistan, the interior ministry said yesterday.//////Facing federal corruption charges that threaten to end his political career, Gov.

A meeting of local 'neutral' civil society members was called by the founder President of that organization to discuss preliminary organizational matters. No doubt the intentions were good at that time as Bangladesh was moving into a new chapter of democracy after about a decade of autocratic rule by Ershad. I rose up and thanked the organizers but expressed my skepticism as to the success of such a venture. I asked them whether they can monitor the election developments in the Raozan constituency till the day of election and come back in one piece. The team leader wanted to know why that should be difficult. Well simply because that happens to be the constituency of the infamous Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and he has his own of way getting elected by intimidating the vast number of minority and poor low income voters. The organizers had no clue as to what happens there and they would be the election observers. Things have not changed much in Raozan and similar constituencies in other parts of Bangladesh. Sure enough that same election monitoring team certified that the election in all Chittagong constituencies went on fine excepting few minor incidents and irregularities and certified that the results should be accepted. Well so far for neutral election observation and monitoring teams and their activities. //////WHAT is recession? Will it affect our life in Bangladesh? If it does, will all of us be worse off? These are the questions asked by my friend who belongs to the fixed-income bracket. He is happy to see the price of oil plummeting to less than $50 a barrel. Commodity prices have also come down substantially; he can buy rice and wheat at a lower cost. He eats more, saves more. He wants the trend to continue as he stands to benefit from it. //////THERE are some among us who dismiss the role of religion or faith in politics. They see the role of religion restricted to individual life as an instrument of moral and spiritual upliftment. But a realisation has dawned the world over that faith is proving to be a vital element in determining the mundane, be it economics or politics. //////On a smoggy December morning, an 11-year-old girl while crossing the busy intersection in city's Gulshan had a lucky escape as her schoolbag cushioned her from being hit seriously by a car that was moving despite red signal.//////Rajdhani Unnyan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) authority yesterday removed a filling station named Midway from the Hatirjheel-Begunbari integrated development project area. //////Fourteenth Dhaka Interna-tional Trade Fair (DITF), the biggest annual event for entrepreneurs and manufacturers to showcase goods and services to buyers will begin on the New Year's Day.//////
