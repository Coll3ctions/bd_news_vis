And what is of particular worry is that under-aged drivers of public transport are responsible for most of the accidents. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police is reported to have launched a special drive against these under-aged drivers and arrested 14 of them on Saturday. //////WHEN the Berlin wall came crashing down 20 years ago the Cold War ended, and the mood was celebratory in the West. Instead of two superpowers there was one, and the only ideology that survived was capitalism -- a brash form of capitalism at that. The elder George Bush arrogantly proclaimed that the world had better learn how to do things the American way, because it was they who knew what worked. He said: "Free markets work." The reach of the market grew longer over the next two decades, encompassing China, India, and former Soviet Union along with its satellites. //////PRIME Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India shortly. The visit is expected to be fruitful mainly because of a changed mind-set of politicians and bureaucrats in Bangladesh, and hopefully in India, in approaching the festering issues in an objective manner. Indo-Bangladesh relations have been bedeviled by a host of issues that both countries have been viewing from the narrow plane of self-interest instead of the changed global situation where integrated approach to presumed insoluble issues have proved to be more successful than disjointed approach aimed more at domestic audience than at the long term interest of the country and the people. //////AS we approach the climate change negotiations in Copenhagen, one thing is clear: for millions of people around the world climate change is not simply a future threat, it is a current reality. //////With the busy international commitment beckoning, injury may have been a big concern for the Tigers especially after the way the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been handling injuries to some key players.//////Despite having played a goalless draw against Pakistan, Bangladesh coach Shahidur Rahman Shantoo was not totally unhappy with the fact that they have come away with a point in a very crucial match.//////Kasun Jayasuriya slammed the first hattrick of the SAFF Championship as a ruthless Sri Lanka thumped Bhutan 6-0 in a Group B encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////If Pakistan are not to go another three years and 12 Tests without a win, much will rest, as it has always, on their bowling. The very shape and variety of this attack, the threat of wickets alive in each of them, did for New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, taking Pakistan to an ultimately comfortable 141-run win to level the series, going into Napier. Mohammad Asif and Danish Kaneria were the heavies this innings, but at all times Mohammad Aamer and a luckless Umar Gul were chomping at the bit behind them. //////Frustrated by yet another injury interrupting his career, Shane Bond has contemplated quitting Test cricket but will wait for the emotions to pass before taking a decision.//////India became the number one Test team on Sunday after routing Sri Lanka by an innings and 24 runs in the third and final Test in Mumbai to clinch the series 2-0.//////Carlos Tevez did his old side Manchester United a favour by scoring the winner as Manchester City beat leaders Chelsea 2-1 in the English Premier League on Saturday.//////Claudio Marchisio scored the winner as Juventus beat champions Inter Milan 2-1 in a bad-tempered clash at the Stadio Olimpico here on Saturday to breathe new life into the Serie A title race.//////Ballon D'Or winner Lionel Messi scored a brace as Barcelona won 3-1 at Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday to restore their five-point advantage over Real Madrid at the summit.//////Bundesliga leaders Leverkusen dropped another point when they were held to a goalless drew at Hanover 96 on Saturday, but remain four points clear as Bayern Munich continued their rise up the table.//////David Beckham does not fear being left in the cold when England boss Fabio Capello picks his World Cup squad next summer.//////On a day of good old-fashioned Test cricket, a persistent Sulieman Benn and a powerful Kemar Roach dragged West Indies into an unexpectedly strong position with two days to play. //////Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara on Sunday called for the umpires' review system to be made mandatory after India defeated his side 2-0 in the Test series.//////Abdullah Al Saif drew his seventh round board with Prakash Ved of Bihar in the 21st Telegraph School Chess Championship in Kolkata yesterday.//////Spain won its fourth Davis Cup title on Saturday when the doubles pair of Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez demolished their Czech opponents to give the hosts an unassailable 3-0 lead.//////The hospitality industry witnessed rapid growth, receiving Tk 5,000 crore in 2005-2009, said the civil aviation and tourism ministry.//////The implementation rate of annual development programme (ADP) has turned around to reach 16 percent of allocation in the first four months of the current fiscal year -- the highest in the last four years.//////The commerce ministry in a recent letter has sought clarafications from Delhi for imposing higher hidden taxes on export of eight million pieces of readymade garment products to India under duty-free facility, a ministry official said.//////AKTEL, the third largest mobile operator, recorded profits worth Tk 147 million at the end of September, rising from a loss of Tk 737 million in the same period last year. //////IPO subscriptions started for two closed-end mutual funds and an insurance company yesterday.//////The government yesterday appointed Dr Ahmad Al Kabir as the chairman of Rupali Bank as part of the ongoing reshuffling process in the state banks.//////Britain's Labour government delivers its latest taxation and spending plans next week against the backdrop of soaring national debt and a record recession and ahead of a general election in 2010.//////Banks' cost of funds may come down with the automation of the credit information bureau (CIB) of Bangladesh Bank, officials said yesterday.//////Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou may slow down an aggressive push for improved ties with China after the island's voters showed disquiet with his policies in local elections, analysts said.//////Commerce Minister Faruk Khan said yesterday Bangladesh wants the Doha round to be implemented by 2010 to help the least-developed countries gain duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) access to the advanced countries.//////Construction worker Bilal is in a happy mood as he takes his lunch break sitting next to an artificial lake near Dubai's showpiece Mall of the Emirates.//////He was late for breakfast.

One such place is Kuakata situated at the end point of Patuakhali district. It is a rare gift that nature has offered us.//////Bangladesh turned over a new leaf in the world's history with the achievement of independence through a nine month-long bloody war. It is a third world country burdened with a population abnormally higher in comparison with its small area. It is the most densely-populated country of the world whose majority of people are poor and illiterate and consequently live in extreme poverty. They cannot afford to meet their basic needs. They never bother about what democracy means and whom it serves. It is a matter out of their thinking purview. What indispensably matters to them is the interminable certainty of square meals three times a day and, if possible, the satisfactory fulfilment of their fundamental demands guaranteed by the constitution of the country.//////Looking at the progress of this project, it seems that it is moving at a very slow pace. The much expected Tk 1,600 crore development project of Hatirjheel project is unlikely to be complete in time. //////It is interesting to note that the govt. again and again publicises that food price is under control. But what about gas? There is anomaly between diesel and gas price. Though I am not an expert, but after a few months of my writing to the communications minister about gas-diesel price anomaly, now it is also endorsed by the CNG Association. They say gas price is higher than diesel. As a result, owners of transport are less interested in converting their engines to gas. The govt. in the past encouraged conversion to CNG. But the situation is changing. As a result valuable foreign exchange will be invested in importing fuel. The government should give serious thought to use of gas in the transport sector. In the mean time LPG gas price has been reduced. I congratulate the govt. for this right step. It has been reported that the govt. is contemplating further lowering of the prices of diesel. Such one-sided reduction of diesel price will not be productive. The govt. must rethink about gas price in the interest of saving foreign exchange.//////There are some people who think that to buy high priced animals for 'Qurbani' is a matter of prestige but we must remember that it is of no value to Him as there is the indication in the verses in the Holy Quran-"It is not their meat, nor their blood, that reaches Allah, it is their piety that reaches Allah.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's disclosure that the government was formulating a media policy for defence forces is something we should watch out (The Daily Star, November 23). Democratic tenets afford us the right to information on any public institution, be that the Supreme Court or the armed forces, and efforts designed to shield such institutions from fair scrutiny through laws would be undemocratic and counterproductive. As with any civilized nation, there would be occasional questions about professional competence of the forces, but that does not mean that the non-uniformed are less patriotic and have 'vested interest.' The Economist in its November 5 issue observed that Bangladesh's defence preparedness is woeful vis-a- vis its Myanmar counterpart, and it's only natural for us to ask why such is the case. You only duck behind laws if you have no answer; impact on 'morale' is a poor argument.//////Myanmar is strategically situated to take the advantages of competition and cooperation between China and India over oil and gas resources. Both China and India are seeking to control the Indian Ocean for strategic military and economic reasons. The United States has been trying to militarise the region on the ground of fighting possible terrorist attacks and has already established an airbase on Banda Ache, Indonesia. Apprehending that the US is hell-bent on a unilateral militarisation of the entire region from the Middle East oil fields to the Strait of Malacca, Beijing has stepped up its engagement in Myanmar. The Strait of Malacca, linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, is the shortest sea route between the Persian Gulf and China. Myanmar also presents a possible supply route for oil and other commodities for China. An oil pipeline linking Myanmar's deep-water port of Kyaukpyu with Kunming in China's Yunnan province was approved by Beijing in 2006. China is also Myanmar's most important defence ally, providing most of its military hardware and training. //////I live in Shekhertek, Mohammadpur area, in the capital. No doubt it is a burgeoning locality with multi-storeyed buildings, markets and office blocks. Every day there goes up a new building. But all the construction materials are piled up and dumped by roadside, obstructing the normal thoroughfare. The roads are narrow and road condition is so bad that even the rickshaws ply in slow motion. Heavy trucks are parked here and there even in day time. //////Some leaders of at least two political parties were elected members of parliament (MP) using Awami League (AL) symbol i.e. boat. Reportedly, these parties are registered with the Election Commission (EC) and were allotted respective party symbols e.g. hammer, torch etc. Certain questions obviously come to one's mind. //////Why Dhaka city's streets are so overcrowded, and parliament looks so empty? It is the political magic in Bangladesh; practised for so many decades since 1972.//////America is realizing four times what she is giving LDCs in aid. Bangladesh pays more that 15 per cent tariff while Saudi Arabia pays less than one percent. It reminds us of a proverb, To carry coal to Newcastle. America went to unjust wars that killed so many people and destroyed the economies of the poorer countries. We can now clearly see through her tokenism. The sooner America realizes that exploiting the poor does not pay, the better. //////I have been an autograph hunter since I was 12, more than five decades years ago, which is one of my hobbies.//////A few months ago we saw that price hike was somewhat moderate but nowadays the price hike is so acute and unbearable for all classes of people. //////Social Studies and Bangladesh, Book-5 (Second Edition-Nov 2008) contains a lot of language errors which are very misleading for the children. The book contains a preface where the publisher did not acknowledge the errors to correct in future editions of the same. This book is mainly prescribed for the children of English medium schools in Bangladesh. Consequently, most of the children learn wrong English. For example in page 54, chapter 8, there is a wrong sentence written like -- "The children of different groups of Sri Lanka varies from one another ...." But the correct sentence should be -- "The children of different groups of Sri Lanka vary from one another...." There are more serious spelling mistakes in the same page. Similarly, there are more grave language and printing mistakes throughout the book. //////A news report in the daily Samakal of November 1 made me write a few words under the above caption. The report from Kurigram says that a man, who is alleged to have left no deceitful or fraudulent ways on earth untried to make fortunes and acquire position, contested in one of the parliament elections and has now become vice-chairman of the upazila! //////Following the collapse of the League of Nations, the USA and the European countries established the United Nations Organisation (UNO).//////As reported, in 2008 the aid received by us from the USA amounted to US$151 million; while during the same period, Bangladesh exporters paid US$573 million as export tariff! Poor (nephew) Bangladesh paid rich (Uncle SAM)USA, US$422 million in excess of the total aid received! It confirms the saying that: "The rich are getting richer, and the poor are becoming poorer"!//////Nowadays load-shedding has become a household word. At present it is a common feature of life in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh has pushed back the clock time for decreasing load-shedding. But there is no result. In the evening electricity is very essential but it is not available. //////Profits of high-tech crimes are high; hackers are able to steal without any geographical limitations. Categories of computer crimes: 1) Computers can be used as storage or communication devices whereby information can be created, stored, manipulated, and communicated electronically. 2) The computer can be used as an instrument or a tool of crime and can be used as a weapon to commit attack on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. High-tech crimes pose a problem to law enforcement agencies for two reasons: a) These crimes are not easily detected since the offenders can quietly commit them from any computer terminal, usually in the comfort of their own homes. b) Most of the law enforcement agencies are not equipped to deal with the matter. //////The other day while I was going to Gulshan, a CNG (three-wheeler) caught my attention. Usually we see the CNG drivers lock themselves inside an iron framed door but to my surprise, in this CNG the passengers were also locked in with an iron framed door. It gave me immense joy thinking that the CNG owners have started taking measures to protect their passengers. And this is a much more effective way to save passengers' priceless lives and wealth from snatchers than all the measures taken by the govt and law enforcers so far. //////With the pressure from the opposition mounting and relentless attacks being carried out by a hostile media, chances are that Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari may try to replicate Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and opt to step down, a report in the Foreign Policy magazine said.//////The United States does not know where al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden is and has lacked reliable information on his whereabouts for years, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has said.//////Stating that over the years, India and Russia have ensured that their multi-faceted relationship acquires greater depth and maturity, Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh on Sunday said that it would be his endeavour to take this partnership forward during his three-day visit to Moscow.//////Capital city Kathmandu and other districts were hard-hit Sunday by a general strike called by Nepal's former Maoist guerrillas after clashes between security forces and homeless squatters during a demolition drive killed at least six people and triggered arson and looting in farwestern Nepal.//////Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lashed out yesterday at the US and Britain, labelling them Tehran's main "enemies" and warning they will fail to isolate Iran over its nuclear issue, a report said.//////Driven by an ever-louder drumbeat of alarm, the world's nations come together today in a bid to lift the curse of climate change hanging over coming generations.//////A man who as a baby survived a chemical attack on the Iraqi city of Halabja in 1988 has been reunited with his mother.//////Carbon dioxide indirectly causes up to 50 percent more global warming than originally thought, a finding that raises questions over targets for stabilising carbon emissions over the long term, a study said on Sunday.//////More than a billion people in Asia depend on Himalayan glaciers for water, but experts say they are melting at an alarming rate, threatening to bring drought to large swathes of the continent.//////Philippine troops arrested 62 people and discovered another major weapons cache Sunday after martial law was imposed in a southern province following the country's worst political massacre.//////Former Pakistan National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chief Lt Gen (retired) Shahid Aziz has accused former President General Pervez Musharraf of intervening in the working of the bureau to prevent action against some leading political leaders and his close associates.//////India's campaign at the crucial climate change talks appeared set for a rocky start with a key negotiator pulling out of the delegation to Copenhagen, apparently upset over the government's announcement of undertaking voluntary carbon intensity cuts.//////British billionaire Sir Richard Branson will unveil a craft yesterday that could soon carry tourists on an out-of-this-world trip into space -- for a mere 200,000 dollars.//////The 26/11 Mumbai terror attack trial is expected to be wrapped up within a week, with only 35 formal witnesses remained to be examined in the case in which Pakistani gunman Ajmal Kasab and two others are charged with killing 166 people.//////Israel's army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi, has left on a trip to India, the first time the head of the Israeli military is visiting the country, the army said on Sunday.//////Two Rwandan peacekeepers were killed in an attack on Saturday in Sudan's war-torn region of Darfur where insecurity is rampant, in the second such deadly incident in as many days, a UN source said.//////On the occasion of 37th death anniversary of sarod legend Ustad Alauddin Khan and 42nd death anniversary of renowned Indian classical musician Ustad Ayet Ali Khan, Ustad Ayet Ali Khan Sangeet Niketan held a concert featuring classical instrumental music on December 5 at the auditorium of German Cultural Centre, Dhanmondi. //////Dhrupad Kala Kendra, one of the leading Bharatanatyam dance schools, arranged a programme at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on December 5.

Many meetings across the world, of heads of governments, climate change negotiators, civil society groups, activists and the scientific community, are calling for the implementation of the Bali Action Plan. At the Copenhagen Bella Centre the parties to the UNFCCC Conference of Parties and the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol must seal a deal that significantly reduces greenhouse gases, and save the most vulnerable from increasing climate risks.//////THE BNP's national council, to be held after nearly 16 years, has generated much interest among both party loyalists and citizen groups.
