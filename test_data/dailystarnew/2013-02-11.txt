The long oppressed people here have been calling for a revolution. Will we not listen to them this time? //////February is a glorious month for all Bangla-speaking people. We are the only nation in this world that fought for their mother language. We need to take the challenge to popularise our mother tongue among the youngsters of today. And to do this, we don't need to hate other languages. We must have respect for other languages. It is not a fault to speak other languages but at the same time we have to speak our own language too. We should know and respect the glorious history of our mother tongue. We should arrange frequent seminars to highlight the activities of our forefathers who took great pride in speaking Bangla. That's how today's youth will learn to respect their own language.//////Your fantastic last page news and sketch published on 7th February based on AFP, Washington, is indeed an eye-opener! This electro-medical breakthrough has opened a new horizon for the blind. Now the rich, if blind, can buy sight! It is the first 'bionic eye' to go the market!//////Devastating fire accidents are taking place frequently in the slums where the ultra poor live, without any civic amenities. Last year, we witnessed several dreadful fire incidents at Begunbari, Rayerbazar, Mohammadpur and Agargaon slums. We came to know from the comments of the victims in newspapers that some influential persons were behind these fire incidents. These accidents are a part of conspiracy to evict the unfortunate slum dwellers and grab the lands. We urge the government as well as the rich of the country to build some permanent shelters for the slum dwellers so that they do not have to live in miserable condition. //////Every day I ask myself what have we got from our incumbent government and what will we gain if we vote the other party to power? Will it bring any change in our life? Are there any political parties which are dedicated to the welfare of the people and the country? The arson acts by Jamaat activists have severely burned one person to death in Uttara. These criminals in political garb committed this gruesome act only to execute their mission and save the war criminals. Why have the innocent people to suffer? At the same time, the BCL cadres are not lagging behind. They also created anarchy in our educational institutions and ruined the peaceful environment of the campuses. The government must ensure security of the people and non-violent atmosphere in the country at any cost. //////Only in the recent past, the death of a young Indian girl, resulting from gang rape and torture, in a moving bus, in Delhi made headlines throughout the world including Houston. People from all walks of life poured in large numbers to protest the gruesome act of the gang rape on the streets of the Indian capital. //////I fully endorse the letter of Munna Rana published in your esteemed daily on 8th February 2013. People must raise their voice against Jamaat-Shibir. It is unacceptable that Shibir men often assault police, vandalize vehicles and create chaos. They are trying to make the country unstable. On February 3, a Pakistani religious cleric named Hanif Zalondhari and some others delivered an incendiary speech after which a tense atmosphere was created in Gazipur's Kaliakoir upazila . The recent demonstrations against the war criminals have made us proud because we united against the enemies of our beloved motherland. I request the authorities concerned to immediately send these Pakistanis back to their country because they are creating anarchy in our country. God bless Bangladesh.//////We are noticing that the Jamaat activists are neither putting on traditional mufti clothing, nor have they beard. It seems that they love western attire. Moreover, the Jamaat- supported TV channels are showing dance, music and drama like the other channels. Don't these changes in Jamaat prove that their original ideology was wrong?//////At last, The Daily Star has told us what some of us already know from human rights' sources - that poor, non-Muslim children in Bangladesh are being trafficked to madrasas, far from their homes, their parents having been promised that their children will receive a good education, free of charge- sometimes (as in your report of Feb 5th of the arrest of Binoy Tripura) a 'Christian' education.

One such child, a Christian, managed to escape and get a neighbour to send a message to his father who came and rescued him. //////Switzerland has refused to reopen long-running corruption cases against Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari because he has immunity as head of state, Pakistan's law ministry said yesterday.//////Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali's gamble on forming a new government in defiance of his own Islamist party after the assassination of opposition head Chokri Belaid left Tunisia in political limbo on Sunday.//////President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday said the United States must change its attitude if it wants to hold direct nuclear talks with Iran, as he hit out at Washington for imposing sanctions on Tehran.//////A letter written by Mahatma Gandhi, described as an incredibly important document in world history, is to be auctioned in Britain next week.

But now the cultural fraternity is expressing its solidarity with hundreds of thousands.

Is it that they only want to feel the revolution that once inspired their predecessors to rise up in arms and fight the enemies of the motherland? But what compelled those youths to choose that particular moment of time of February 5 to start their agitation at Shahbagh? What was in the verdict against Quader Mollah that stretched their patience beyond the limit?//////Can militants reignite the insurgency in India-held Kashmir? This apprehension is a major hurdle in the trust-building process between India and Pakistan. Delhi is still fearful that the militants based in Pakistan's tribal areas could turn against India once they are finished with their job in Afghanistan.//////With Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) profiling, an emerging branch of genetic engineering making inroads into criminal investigation, the job of the police in arresting the real offenders in murder or sexual violation has become much easier. In fact, if proper procedures are followed, experts say DNA analysis is stunningly accurate and the chances of the test going wrong are one in three billion. //////It's very likely that I am unknown to all of you -- you, who are on the streets of Dhaka, outpouring your emotion and donating your youthful energy to a cause that belongs not only to Bangladesh's future, but to the future of all humanity. But I am not important, just a silent observer. It's really touching to see how you are drawing on the streets, singing, being vocal about human decency. I am touched not only because once I walked around TSC area like you do, I am touched because through your desperation I felt the desperation of youth all over the world. Like a ripple effect on a lake, an honest desire to uphold human rights and create a better society does reverberate throughout our global existence. //////Fixing Climate; The Story of Climate Science and How to Stop Global Warming by eminent climate scientist Wallace Broecker and his co-writer Robert Kunzig is an informative look at the science of global warming as well as a summary of the options for solving it.
