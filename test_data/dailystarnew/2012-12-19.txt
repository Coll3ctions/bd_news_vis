He subsequently printed it in The Daily Star. Almost eleven years later, another trinket in our national treasure has left us. The men and women who gave our struggle for freedom legitimacy, who brought before the rest of the world the plight of the innocent people and exposed the brutality of the Pakistani military, must not be forgotten. Aside from the monetary help, the famous concert in New York also kindled rays of hope for struggling millions and questioned the consciousness of the US population whose government was supporting our enemies as part of global chess game for supremacy. The truth was revealed, public opinion coalesced and the Congress relented, thanks primarily to Senator Kennedy and the Democratic Party. Public opinion created pressure on the US government.//////Ma, I am going to die. You will find me in a toilet, Palash Mian, an unfortunate victim of Ashulia tragedy, called his mother Moyna Begum to say a final goodbye before his death. Mizan, 11 months old, and Masum, 18 months old, are now too exhausted to cry for their mother. They can't understand what has been lost from their life.

The concert not only raised fund for Bangladesh but was also a great way to generate world support for Bangladesh. He received Padmavushan, Grammy, Doctorates, Deshikottom, etc awards. He has left world but he will live in the hearts of all Bangladeshis forever. //////National University plays an important role in our education. Many meritorious students who fail to get admitted to public universities, choose NU for admission. But it is a matter of regret that NU doesn't follow its academic calendar. I am a student of NU (session 2010-11). A few days ago, my 1st year final examination was held while my batch mates, who are studying at public universities, will complete their 2nd Year soon. Besides, NU is also late in publishing results. So, we can not concentrate on our studies properly. On behalf of the students, I beg to the NU authorities and the controller of examinations to consider our case and take necessary steps.//////First of all, let me congratulate all Bangladeshi people on their Independence Day. As a Pakistani expatriate, I meet Bangladeshi friends in Australia and don't see in them any hatred for general Pakistanis. But every year one hears calls from Bangladesh to Pakistanis to apologise for what they did in 1971. This disturbs us who were born after 1971. I can tell the Bangladeshi people that most Pakistani people deeply regret the unfortunate incidents of 1971 and often criticise the irresponsible elements within the administration for the excesses. //////A civilized society should never tolerate acts of such brutality as it happened to Biswajit Das, an innocent civilian. A young life was cut short, a bright future destroyed. Every conscious citizen should raise his/her voice against such criminality. I wonder why the present government is not being able to bring the killers to justice. Are they incapable of arresting the murderers? Or is it that the culprits have link with the ruling party?//////We, the Bangladeshis living in foreign lands are observing that some people in the present government are involved in corruption for their own interest (e.g. Padma bridge corruption, Hallmark's money laundering, etc.). It is a great problem for the country. We expect immediate measures against corruption from the government to save Bangladesh and its people. //////In order to stop the unethical practice of compelling students to receive coaching outside the classroom, our government has given a guideline for the teachers. Under the guideline, a teacher can not tutor  the students of his/her own school, but can do it for students of  other institutions. However, they can teach the weak students taking extra fees under the institution's supervision. This permission has brought blessings for them because now they have made coaching mandatory for all students. Now they are focussing more on coaching activities, neglecting the regular classes. As a guardian, I visited some schools at Mirpur-10 for getting my sister admitted in class V. The schools demanded admission fees as well as mandatory coaching fees from next January. I refused to pay this extra fee and so they denied my sister the opportunity to get admitted there. So, this new policy has not brought any good for the students and guardians, rather it has legalised coaching centres in schools and colleges. //////It is a very shocking piece of news for the investors that their money was lost but good news for the embezzlers. They did it smoothly and top officials helped them in pursuing this evil work. Common people bear the brunt of it as usual. The embezzled amount is 3,350 crore. It is hard to calculate but imagine how one group of people stole such a large amount of public money. It seems cheating is the easiest way to be rich in Bangladesh nowadays. //////There has been an uproar in India's parliament yesterday over the gang rape of a 23-year-old student on a city bus in the capital, Delhi.//////Gunmen in Pakistan have killed six health workers at the start of a nationwide polio vaccination drive, officials said yesterday, highlighting resistance to a campaign opposed by the Taliban.//////The White House promised a comprehensive series of measures, including gun control legislation, on Monday to prevent a recurrence of mass shootings such as the "horrific" attack in Connecticut that left 20 children and six teachers dead.//////For many Americans, the right to bear arms is not only enshrined in the constitution, it is a key civil liberty.//////Syrian rebels made advances yesterday in fierce fighting for a Palestinian refugee camp in south Damascus that sent tens of thousands of residents fleeing as the army prepared a counter-attack.//////Coal is set to surpass oil as the world's top fuel within a decade, driven by growth in emerging market giants China and India, according to a report published yesterday.//////The International Criminal Court acquitted Congolese ex-militia boss Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui of war crimes yesterday, saying prosecutors failed to prove his commanding role in the murder of 200 people in a 2003 attack on a village using child soldiers.//////Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who has mediated among the country's Shia, Sunni and Kurdish parties, was in hospital yesterday after suffering a stroke that left him in "critical but stable condition", government sources said.//////Japan's presumptive premier Shinzo Abe got his US leaders mixed up yesterday, when he told business chiefs he had been speaking to "President Bush" after a phone call from Barack Obama.//////Stressing on need for acceleration in electoral reforms, Vice-President Hamid Ansari on Monday questioned the current system of elections in India casting doubt on representativeness of elected candidates.//////Opponents of a Chinese-backed copper mine in northern Myanmar have resumed their protest just weeks after a violent police crackdown on demonstrators at the site, an activist said yesterday.//////The Indian economy suffered $1.6 billion in illicit financial outflows in 2010, capping-off a decade in which it experienced black money losses of $123 billion, according to a new report.//////Israeli planning committees are to weigh several plans for nearly 5,000 new settler homes in neighbourhoods of annexed east Jerusalem this week, with at least one major project set for final approval.//////Kabul has laid out an ambitious and contentious five-step plan that could bring hardline Taliban Islamists into government as efforts to broker peace accelerate ahead of the withdrawal of Western troops.//////Egypt's prosecutor general named by President Mohamed Morsi last month as he temporarily assumed sweeping powers handed in his resignation on Monday, a judicial source told AFP.//////A keenly awaited investigation into a deadly attack on the US consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi is complete and has been given to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a spokeswoman said.//////South African president Jacob Zuma scored a thumping victory in an ANC leadership contest yesterday, opening the way for him to lead Africa's largest economy until 2019.//////Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit India on December 24, according to an announcement made by the Kremlin.//////The world's oldest person -- an Iowa woman who scrubbed floors until she turned 90 -- died Monday at age 115, less than two weeks after earning her venerable distinction.//////Christians are the world's biggest religious group, numbering some 2.2 billion people, according to a study released yesterday by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.//////Nineteen people died of exposure in Ukraine in the last 24 hours amid temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit), bringing the toll this month to 37, the health ministry said yesterday.//////In four decades of independence, the Bangladeshi film industry has taken giant strides. Although the number of annual movie titles has experienced a decline in recent years, the industry previously enjoyed a boom -- when the cinema halls used to be packed to the brim.

Given that we have a clear perspective on what went on in Bangladesh in that month of triumph, it follows that people in Bangladesh should also remember, or be enlightened on, how Pakistan coped with its collapse in its former province of East Pakistan. For students of South Asian history, it is important that the incidents, minor as well as major, which occurred in December 1971 be recalled in the interest of academic analyses in the future. People in Bangladesh know how their country came into being. People in Pakistan need to know why their state came to grief in Bangladesh barely a quarter century after it had been cobbled into shape.//////India's decision to accede to the 1976 Asean Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in July 2003 was considered a major milestone in its diplomatic annals due to its swiftness and timeliness. Immediately, it upgraded India's status as well as its role in Asean. Being the same country as China pledging to respect and sign on to the regional code of conduct helped instill the two Asian giants as the most trusted dialogue countries of Asean throughout the 2000s. However, change is in the air.//////The forthcoming visit of the Thai Prime Minister H.E. Ms. Yingluck Shinawatra to Bangladesh on December 21-22 demonstrates the time-tested friendly partnership between the two countries and ushers in a new horizon for areas of cooperation.
