This was billed as the second marquee match of the World Cup after the Sri Lanka-Pakistan encounter on Saturday and it lived up to the billing and then some.//////Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) yesterday protested against government orders to shut down factories during the cricket World Cup matches, saying the move will badly affect the country's economy. //////The National e-Content Repository would play a significant role in empowering the rural people and socio-economic development as it would make access to information much easier, said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday.//////Coming from behind, a biker hit a seven-year-old boy on a pavement on Dhanmondi Road 7 and sped away. //////The government has slashed the Annual Development Programme (ADP) of the current fiscal year by about nine percent. //////A parliamentary body probing violence on the Dhaka University campus during the last caretaker government will ask the then chief adviser, Fakhruddin Ahmed, and former army chief Moeen U Ahmed to appear before it.//////The government will place a bill in parliament during the current session to enact a law introducing share buyback system in an effort to "save" the investors in the falling market.//////Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday sought two more months to complete the investigation into one of the two cases in connection with the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally.//////The government has asked the Power Development Board to supply uninterrupted electricity to the rural areas through rationing in urban areas for irrigation pumps during Boro season.//////A superintendent of madrasa, a teacher and two fake examinees were jailed and fined for adopting unfair means in the Dakhil examination yesterday. //////Writers, readers and poets yesterday recalled the brutal attack made on eminent writer late Prof Humayun Azad seven years ago near Amar Ekushey Boi Mela premises.//////The National Board of Revenue (NBR) filed a tax evasion case against Partex Group Chairman M A Hashem and nine others including his wife and six sons with Dhaka Senior Special Judges' Court yesterday. //////The son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi denied yesterday that his family had secreted billions of dollars out of the country, as he scornfully dismissed a UN vote calling for the freezing of Libyan assets.//////Although we do not have the details of the proposed changes, basing on what we have gleaned from various sources we feel that some changes are in the offing that are likely to cause the ACC to revert back to the character of the erstwhile bureau of anti-corruption (BAC).

Rickshaw puller Joynal Abedin and his wife Lal Banu have shown, in an enlightening way, that even the poor can come to the assistance of the poor. In the twenty five years since his father died from lack of proper medical treatment, Abedin has struggled body and soul (and so has Lal Banu) to come to the aid of those he did not want to wither away like his father. Scraping together the money they have earned, he from pulling rickshaws and she from working in a clinic, they have set up a small charitable hospital and a free coaching centre in their village Hashadia of Paranganj union in Mymensingh. Little wonder then that Joynal Abedin has been dubbed Shada Moner Manush (man of the mind). Little wonder again that individuals and organizations, deeply appreciative of his efforts, have in their own ways come forward to help sustain his projects.//////Writing about Sachin Tendulkar is fast becoming an exercise in pointlessness.

Today's article does not attempt to tell our readers when the sell-off will end, we will leave that for other market forecasters. But rather we wanted to explore stockmarket M&M's", not related to America's favourite candy, but rather the two issues of Manipulation and Moral Hazard. The former seems to be receiving all the attention from both the media, and, perhaps more significantly, regulators. However, we would argue the latter is perhaps the bigger risk to the healthy development of our capital markets. There seems to be a widely held view both among the protesters (perhaps they see themselves as market vigilantes?) on the streets around the DSE in Motijheel as well as some officials that the exceptional rise in the market in 2010 and the subsequent correction in the past month have taken place as a result of market manipulators or syndicates who lured unsuspecting retail investors into buying the market and subsequently pulled all their money out causing a collapse. //////Asia's first Legoland theme park is on track to open next year in southern Malaysia, its builder said, as the region goes all out to lure tourists with a series of big ticket attractions.//////Sandwip, off the southeastern coast of Bangladesh, is an island with a population of around four lakh, devoid of almost all basic infrastructure.

team has won the most crucial and nerve-wrecking match against Ireland and the outcome of the match offered us the much needed sigh of relief, anxiety and gave us the much coveted mental satisfaction. This match probably was the best ever exciting and well fought match Bangladesh has played so far. Now I have few suggestions to Bangladesh team which are; you start very well it is like a dynamite but what happens to you in a span of few overs you layoff like dominos. Please keep your tempo as well as your poise firm and have your patience solid, because you are our heroes, our pride and prestige of our country. So, keep the responsibilities that we put on you and you must carryon the job with due care and determination. We all know that you boys can beat any team if you play the way you played with Ireland. Lastly, thanks to all the members of our Cricket team and wishing you good luck. //////We all know that the colour of leaves of plants and trees in general is supposed to be green, but regrettably, the reality is different. Please take a look around you, it is very frustrating that none of the leaves are green, rather it is dusty, hampering the process of photosynthesis, through which plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the atmosphere, essential for the survival of all living beings including humans. This situation is predominant during winter when it does not rain and at this time most of the people fall victim to many air borne diseases. //////Stumpy is the certified mascot for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. He was revealed at a gathering in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 2nd April 2010. He is a ten year old elephant who is wholehearted and is strong-minded.

Since independence it has been observed that during the regime of AL, peoples' sufferings increased. Immediately after the independence, the great famine caught the nation. In 1996 the biggest ever share market debacle happened. In 2011 again the 1996 episode is going to be repeated. The Forex reserve, after a long period has gone deficit. All these prove that all has been set to make the country a bottomless basket again.//////Further to Alam's views published in your pages on 14th. February; in my opinion, CNG should not be supplied to any vehicle apart from public and cargo transport (bus & trucks) vehicles. Cars are owned by well-to-do people, and they should use only petrol or octane. The same logic is applicable for taxi-cabs, which are used by the better-off people also. Compressed Natural Gas should not be supplied to any private motor vehicle. Logically, natural gas price should be raised step by step, so that the price on unit BTU basis is at par with coal.//////Trees are essential to living, without these, the environmental balance would collapse and the effect would be drastic. Recently at regular intervals, news of cutting down huge number of trees is reaching us. Thirty thousand Jhau trees at Teknaf beach, four hundred trees around international airport in Dhaka, four thousand trees in Srimongol, the list will go on and on.A few days ago, Dhaka University authorities decided to cut down the hundred year old trees in front of Salimullah Muslim Hall, we just cannot believe it. Not only did these trees give shade, sheltered birds and lots of other small creatures, they were witness to many historical events. Those ancient trees were entitled to have special attention, but what a dismal fate waited for them, how unfortunate and disappointing! It takes many years for the saplings to become full grown trees; it is painful to see those razed to the ground in a moment. We urge the government to give special attention to this matter, stop unnecessary cutting of trees, plant more trees and encourage people to do so.//////The government is very much anxious about the sky-rocketing price of rice. The lower and middle income groups suffer due to higher prices of different commodities, mainly rice. On the other hand, the farmers of the country are in danger due to very lower price of potato. So, the government should immediately intervene to rescue the farmers as well as the low and mid income community. As a substitute of rice the government should sell potato at a fair price with rice.//////It is indeed shocking to observe that the news casters and other media personalities (both electronic and print) make silly mistakes every now and then. For example, often "airport" is pronounced as "ear-port." I really do not know what "ear-port" means.Then there is one renowned Editor Journalist, who hosts talk shows on television almost every other day late at night, no doubt he is a very good presenter and a host. The problem is quite often he utters the word "yeah" instead of "yes", both are correct, but its use denotes a person. Perhaps he is not aware that "yeah" is a word that is mostly used by Dick, Tom and Harry in a society where English is the predominant language and is widely spoken. My intention is not to hurt or humiliate the learned journalists or media personalities, rather to make them aware about the mistakes that we all do often times, by pointing out those for necessary correction. //////Bangladesh's win against Ireland gave the whole nation something to go crazy about. After the breathtaking finish, the whole country burst out in jubilation and people from all part of the city started celebrating this victory in their own way, but there is always a flip side of the coin; some people in the name of celebration created havoc amongst cricket loving people. //////The death of a minor boy saw massive violence throughout the Dhaka-Aricha highway recently. The angry mass vandalised a huge number of vehicles. The general public had to suffer due to traffic jam. I do not understand who should be blamed for this situation. One after another, accident is taking place, but no action is being taken. Till now, we did not hear that any driver was penalised for his wrong-doing. The minor boy was the son of a school teacher named A K M Nizam Uddin. Nothing would be able to console him. We could not spare even a minor boy!//////I am a reader of your esteemed daily since its inception. I am not very happy about the recent change you made in the layout of the newspaper.

I pleaded for a total ban on its use.//////There was a time, not so long ago, when Bangladesh's name was synonymous with disasters.
