If not anything else this reflects the party's inner strength of sagacity to recognise ground reality, the pro-election sentiment of the people, and strategise its policy accordingly. What is laudable is that the decision has come after a two-day meeting of the AL Central Working Committee where the highest-level policy makers had deliberated on the pros and cons and finally opted in favour of election. The interest of democracy, peace and stability of the country were the factors behind the decision, asserted the AL acting president Zillur Rahman. //////The death of Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw brings to an end a life that was as noted for its longevity as for its achievements. Manekshaw was ninety four when he passed away on Friday. To that extent, he lived a full life in a country that he honoured and which in turn remained ever grateful to him. All Indians will remember for long the singular contributions he made toward upholding the prestige of their country through shaping a military victory against Pakistan in 1971.//////THE National Household Survey on corruption 2007 by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) was among the startling revelations in the past week. The survey covering the period between July 2006 and June 2007 tends to suggest that corruption remains as pervasive as it was earlier. The survey suggests that corruption in various utility service sectors has even increased despite the caretaker government's anti-corruption drive.//////GEORGE Bush went to war in Iraq in order to create a new Middle East. Six years later, much to the shock of his allies and the horror of perceptive Americans, he has. The shock and horror arise from the fact that the Middle East has been changed by the Bush intervention in a direction sharply divergent from America's fundamental interests as perceived by the Bush doctrine.//////IT has been like trying to squeeze blood from a stone getting the Pakatan Rakyat politicians to talk about their top-secret meeting in Anwar Ibrahim's house last week.

minds. The leading political parties hardly seem to realise why we are no longer a democratic nation, why all the big heads of our so-called democratic politics are behind the bars. They are opposing the local election for obvious reason: it would hamper their way to establishing illegal power at the grassroots level which plays a very vital role in determining the results of our national elections. The reason might be clear to us but it seems that even intellectuals, like university teachers, fail to understand why the present govt wants to hold local elections first. //////A report published in your daily dated: 22-06--2008 stated that at a roundtable discussion the speakers emphasised the need for decentralisation of power and spreading out the economic activities across the country in order to save Dhaka city from any disaster. This is a good approach if it is done efficiently as this will create employment opportunities for people. Dhaka is already overcrowded and the people of the entire country depend on Dhaka one way or the other. //////This is a reply to a letter published in The Daily Star entitled "Cricket over-publicised" which appeared on 23 June. I cannot acquiesce in the opinion of Mr. Sohel because I feel he has just made his statements rather sententiously. Immature players overburdened with expectations from the media and fans are according to him the main reasons for the poor performance of the Tigers. But he has overlooked that young Tigers have taken Bangladesh in the Super Eight stage of last year's 50-over World Cup where Bangladesh defeated India and South Africa while one of the most senior members of the side Habibul Bashar failed to deliver. Not giving debut to young cricketers would be like giving indemnity to senior cricketers despite their poor performance. The selectors are given the responsibility to choose the best team and not the "oldest team" for the country. //////The tree is still alive. Though it has lost some branches and leaves, it is still luxuriant with leaves. And there is no dearth of people who sprinkle water on its roots, put fertilisers and make sure that it remains in good shape. In all probability, the tree will grow taller day by day and continue to bear poisonous fruits.//////At the beginning of the 20th century it was very difficult for women to obtain university education. In 1870 Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon helped to set up Girton College, the first university for women. But nowadays every country has a special university for women. But in our country, we have no such university even after 37 years of independence. In Japan, there are at least ten women's universities, among them Nara, Mukogawa, Kochi, Bunka, Showa and Jissen universities are mentionable. In Korea, there are five universities for women. //////We don't really know how we find our leaders, we never asked ourselves where they were born, where they come from etc. But we all support someone as our leader, and we blindly follow him/her, and even sometimes sacrifice our lives on their calls. We voted them to power believing their hollow promises before election. We do not even mind fighting among our fellow brothers. We make them political hero without questioning his/her identity or past records. Banking on our, I mean the people's unstinting support, these leaders sit on the dais of power. Then they totally forget us and start doing whatever they need to do, to change their own fortune unless and until he/she is in trouble created by opponents. //////As a microbiologist I feel it is my responsibility to write after reading the report Fatal Bacteria Found in Drinking Water in Rajshahi Div as the report(published on 21 June 2008) has wrong information and misinterpretation. //////Closure of BDR low price shops is a poor decision on the government's part. When the poverty-stricken people are struggling to manage one meal a day due to sky rocketing of prices of essentials, this decision was not expected. It is the government's responsibility to fulfil the basic needs of the people.//////We became independent after a nine-month long struggle against the Pakistanis. Though we got independence after nine months but our struggle for it had begun during the British regime. During the Pakistani regime, we were exploited in many ways.//////After her release from the sub-jail, our former prime minister Sheikh Hasina travelled by a BA flight to London, on her way to the USA for treatment, but not by Biman , the National Flag Carrier. This is just normal for the former prime minister. It is on record that she never travelled by Biman while travelling abroad privately at her own cost. But in contrast to this, during her tenure as the prime minister she travelled throughout by Biman, since it used to be at state cost and with very special arrangements organised by the national airline.//////Gulshan Model Town was the forerunner which was conceived to be an ideal township & a showpiece designed for planned urbanisation of a very progressive cosmopolitan Dhaka. Alas! It was not to be thanks to Rajuk. //////It's commendable that Hillary would campaign for Obama, despite being defeated by him. How is it possible for a political leader? Yes, this is only possible in a true democracy. //////Your editorial on 22 June is an excellent balanced exposition of the situation. All sane people must urge the disgruntled parties to take part in democratic polls whenever and wherever it is held and thus act in a positive manner for the furtherance of democracy and the country. The days of negative attitudes and actions like boycott and hartal due to immature emotional sullenness, or some legal technicalities in the Constitution (which obviously and of necessity is in temporary abeyance) must be banished. However, it remains a holy obligation for the government to ensure that all the polls are fair and credible to the nation and are adjudged as such by the foreign observers.//////The CTG has done a commendable job in implementing the long overdue separation of judiciary from the executive branch of the government. This has already been yielding excellent results. Disposal of cases has been expedited and the volume of transacted business has gone up substantially. The Supreme Court has asked the government to provide the judicial magistrates with all facilities. The immediate need of judicial magistrates is residential accommodation. Hence, I would request the caretaker government to provide funds and arrange residential accommodation for them urgently in all district headquarters to enable the magistrates to discharge their functions smoothly. //////In the last fifteen days, I talked to about fifty of my friends and relations who are not blind supporters of any political party about election in local bodies. All of them supported the move of the present govt. to hold election of local bodies before the national assembly election. I asked for their reasons to support such a move and the interesting answers are: //////We Bangladeshis are one- track-minded people. We have put all our eggs into one basket in Dhaka which now has become an unmanageable city. We have developed only one port to meet all our trading needs. The country is now in an economic take off stage. I am sure that if our politicians do not mess it up, then we will surely be a middle income country in the next five to ten years, and during this period our trade will increase manifold. Under political government, our port is unable to perform satisfactorily and cannot meet the trading needs of the country. If the situation remains as is common during political government, we will not be able to handle our trading needs and the country's trade will come to a standstill.//////Arsenic is a poison that can take our lives. At present it is found in most of the tubewells in Jhenidah district. The arsenic contaminated tubewell water must be avoided for the safety of our lives. Arsenic causes a disease called arsenicosis. The person affected by it suffers from various complications. The patient loses stamina, the skin becomes rough. Soars are also found and bleeding is common. It causes stomach disorders and even cancer. //////Pakistan's foreign minister said Friday his government was eager to find a solution at next month's peace talks to the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which has been at the heart of the bitter rivalry between his country and India. //////The Taliban has regrouped after its initial fall from power in Afghanistan and the pace of its attacks is likely to increase this year, according to a Pentagon report that offers a dim view of progress in the nearly seven-year-old war. //////Describing as "solvable" the Kashmir issue with India, Pakistan's ruling PPP chief Asif Ali Zardari has said the two countries should not allow slow progress on it to be an obstacle to work in other cooperative matters.//////The Pentagon is preparing to order roughly 30,000 troops to Iraq early next year in a move that would allow the US to maintain 15 combat brigades in the country through 2009, The Associated Press has learned. //////The chief of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards has issued a new warning against Israel not to attack it, saying the Jewish state is well within range of its missiles, a newspaper reported yesterday.//////Roaming bands of government supporters heckled, harassed or threatened people into voting in a runoff election Friday in which President Robert Mugabe was the only candidate, ensuring he will remain in power despite international condemnation of the balloting as a sham. //////It took years of talks, coddling and concessions to prod North Korea to step back from its decades-long effort to make atomic weapons, leading to Friday's dramatic destruction of its nuclear reactor cooling tower. //////Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton sought Friday to turn the page on their bitter, history-making fight for the Democratic presidential nomination, declaring the next chapter is about beating Republican John McCain. //////US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pressed North Korea Saturday to take the next step and give up its atomic weaponry after it disclosed some nuclear secrets and demolished part of its reactor.//////There could briefly be no ice at the North Pole this summer, a US scientist said Friday, an event that would mark a new stage in the melting of the Arctic ice sheets due to global warming.//////The US Senate has approved a bill to remove former South African president Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress from the US terror watch list, lawmakers said Friday.//////Guatemala's Interior Minister Vinicio Gomez and deputy minister Edgar Hernandez were among four people killed Friday in a helicopter crash, a presidential spokesperson said.//////Tens of thousands of demonstrators paralysed cities in Indian-controlled Kashmir yesterday with protests against what they charge is a government plan to build Hindu settlements to change the religious balance in the Muslim-majority region. //////Syrian archaeologists have unearthed a hieroglyph close to Damascus which dates back to the pharaonic period around 1,300 years BC, the official SANA news agency reported on Saturday.//////Rescuers recovered all 18 bodies yesterday from the wreckage of an Indonesian military plane that crashed into a jungle-clad mountain, a military official said. //////Islamist militants kidnapped two Swedes working for the United Nations and a Somali aid worker when the fighters seized control of a town Saturday, several sources told AFP.//////Cultural organisation Swanan arranged a programme, featuring recitation and award giving, at the Shawkat Osman Auditorium, Central Public Library on June 27.

This was at a typical Dhaka dinner party. As soon as I explained my views on the issue, he dismissed them summarily. He argued that transparency required ministers/advisers to interact with the media regularly because people have a right to know about government policy from the horse's mouth. He further argued that for the CTG, the importance of advisers talking to the media is indispensable because the parliament has been abrogated.//////THE then British rulers introduced local government in India through the Bengal Chowkidari Act 1870. On the recommendation of the Famine Commission (1880) it was strengthened and extended. In 1882 the then governor general introduced a responsible and democratic local government system. //////THE role of trade organisations in a country pursuing private sector-led economic growth cannot be ignored if the government really means business. It's the bounden responsibility of the trade bodies to put forward their suggestions to the government on matters relating to formulation of various policies affecting the overall growth and development of the national economy. //////IN this age of technological advancement, a new kind of rationalisation has been introduced in the public sector. The key role in this connection is related to the use of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs). There is no doubt that governments all over the world are fully cognisant of this potential, and thereby employ it to support the activities being carried out to serve its customers. //////Visitors swarming the Dhaka Zoo at Mirpur to have a look at 29 new inmates from South Africa that arrived Thursday after a long wait. //////A divisive policy to enforce the use of electronic cash registers at small and medium retail businesses in the city has been postponed until January next year.//////Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has only 13 run-down tow trucks for handling any trouble with about 10 lakh vehicles in the capital city. //////
