The hottest new spoils in the game of zero-sum political competition are appointments and control of criminal judicial power. The game is ostensibly democratic but the niyaat is not. British colonial rule bequeathed to us the principle of neutral bureaucracy. But progressively we have moved away from this towards a principle of spoils. In itself this would not have been a worry because there are perfectly functioning systems built on the spoils principle. Look at the American system where upper levels of appointments are considered the spoils of political victory. But the move towards the spoils system has come with a fatal twist in contemporary Bangladesh. In functioning spoils systems, I can appoint my supporters but they must pass quality tests. The leadership is thus careful to promote supporters who have standards. In contrast, our political contenders seem to have embraced the worst possible hybrid -- a spoils system without standards. The only test required is of blind loyalty. In such a milieu, Gresham's law operates with a vengeance -- good supporters are sidelined by the most unprincipled among the supporters.

The more blatant the sycophancy, greater are the chances to rise to the top. //////Our state machinery revved into quick action last week to denounce the hearings on Balochistan conducted by the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.//////Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced.

That world is the field of nanotechnology, the realm of atoms and nanostructures. Nanotechnology refers broadly to a technology whose unifying theme is the control of matter on the scale, generally 100 nanometers or smaller, and the fabrication of devices with critical dimensions that lie within that size range (Lakhtakia 2004). Materials reduced to the nanoscale can suddenly show very different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale; for example, opaque substances become transparent (copper), inert materials become catalysts (platinum, gold), stable materials turn combustible (aluminum), solids turn into liquids at room temperature (gold), insulators become conductors (silicon) that means that the behavior of substances at the nanoscale can sometimes contradict common sense by behaving erratically. //////Diaries and writings from ninth-century Baghdad provide a glimpse of the weird weather from the era, findings that could help researchers reconstruct past climate.//////The technological world of the 21st century owes a tremendous amount to advances in electrical engineering, specifically, the ability to finely control the flow of electrical charges using increasingly small and complicated circuits.
