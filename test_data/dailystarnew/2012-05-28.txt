Our government had given assurance to the registered non-govt. primary school teachers to regularise their jobs before the last election. But after coming to power, they forgot the matter. //////No need to explain why people consider present politics as 'sick politics.' People are frustrated over the politics of confrontation. Every sector like education, health, police, judiciary and civil administration are on the verge of ruin because of partisan appointments. Presently, forced disappearances have become a grave concern among people. It has also become an issue of political confrontation between the ruling party and the opposition. The opposition blames the government for the disappearances of their leaders. On the other hand, the ruling alliances blame the opposition for intentionally making it a political issue. Recently Rashed Khan Menon and Hasanul Haque Inu, two lawmakers of the ruling alliance, made a valuable comment that Jamaat-e-Islami had started the politics of killing and disappearance during the Liberation War, which later got institutionalised by the law enforcers under different governments. No doubt, people want to get rid of this sick politics, but how? //////Heartiest congratulations on your consecutive 4 half centuries during the Asia Cup.

This recruitment should not be like the previous one where millions of taka were taken as bribes from dishonest job seekers. I hope this time only the qualified and honest people will be selected for the job. I would request the railway ministry to conduct the whole process of recruitment online so that everything remains transparent. All the high officials of the railway department including the general manager should be vigilant so that no one can take a single taka from the job seekers. It is known to all that railway is the most corrupt sector in Bangladesh. If this corruption cannot be curbed, then the day is not far when railway communication will not exist in Bangladesh.//////The Hon. High Court's decision published in all dailies on 22nd. May endorsed the notification of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that sponsor directors must have minimum specified shareholding in the company they endorse.

At our age such farewells are becoming more frequent. Muzaffer had been seriously unwell for nearly a decade. But he managed to lead a full and committed life which even those of lesser age and more robust health would have found hard to maintain. His last ten years were a triumph of the spirit over the physical deterioration of the body. Upto the last hours of his life his opinion was being sought by the media on some issue of public significance. Muzaffer never sought such publicity. But his integrity, non-partisan standing, along with his wisdom and commonsense made him an iconic figure whose opinions were sought on a variety of subjects of public importance. //////
