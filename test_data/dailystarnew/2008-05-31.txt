Brigadier Asim Bajwa has been commander of the 111 Brigade, a unit that has been instrumental in enforcing coups, especially in 1977 and 1999, launched by the army. His departure leaves General Musharraf, in the opinion of many, in a lonely state. Indeed, rumours are said to be floating around about the president finally deciding to call it a day. Such rumours have been fuelled by a meeting the president has had with the new army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, at army headquarters in Rawalpindi. //////ONE had hoped that the normal sequel to the talks between the caretaker government and the political parties would have been the parliamentary elections.

I know the Old Trafford pitch eased up on the fourth day, but there was still something in it for the bowlers, so to get 294 was a huge effort.

A draft proposal in this connection , it is learnt through reports carried by some Bangla dailies on May 25 last, has been sent to the Chief Adviser's office for final approval. It is worth mentioning that out of 11 lakh officers and employees in the government sector 8 lakh officers and employees are covered by 29 cadres but there exists no such cadres in the country to bring about effective management, in still efficiency, enhance quality of education and improve working condition for more than 3 lakh teachers and officers working in 83 thousand government and non-government schools.//////Yesterday May 30 was President Ziaur Rahman's 27th anniversary of death.

Even if I have seen him sometime, I don't remember where.//////Penguin India's third book of new writing from India showcases some impressive young fictional talent, namely Kishore Valicha, whose short story, 'Strawberries', is a darkly explosive fantasy of sensuality wherein a man wishes to file a complaint against a strawberry-vendor at a police station, who has tricked him into buying fake fruit. He captivates the incompetent police officer with his luxurious tale of strawberries larger and juicier and redder than life that little by little become interchangeable within his unfolding description of the vendor's alleged seduction.//////All revolutions produce counter-revolutions, a dialectic that is played out over the long term in an inexorable cycle. In the case of Bangladesh, sadly enough, the counter revolution of 1975 came shockingly early, and in a bloody manner. In these collected letters (mostly translated from Bengali) of Dr Sajjad Husain, one can glimpse its mindset. It is not a pretty sight. On December 16, 1971 Dr. Sajjad Husan, professor of English literature and ardent Pakistani regime man, was the serving vice chancellor of Dhaka University. He was arrested and jailed, and after his release left for Saudi Arabia. There he stayed (on a Bangladeshi passport!) teaching English till 1985, until his return to Dhaka on the back of changed political circumstances and stayed here till his death in 1995.//////He leans on the blade to scrape the fat//////from the chopping board; then he sharpens//////the knives, puts on display choice cuts//////of lamb legs; shoulders and necks, plump pink//////chickens, liver and kidneys and some masala//////fish; whispers bismillah and turns on the till.//////Tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death in the world. It is the only legal consumer product that kills one third to one half of those who use it as intended by its manufacturers, with its victims dying on average 15 years prematurely.//////Today tobacco is considered to be the greatest single health hazard for mankind. It is the only legal consumer product that kills one-third to one-half of those who use it as intended by its manufacturers, with its victims dying 15 years prematurely on an average.//////* Among young people, the short-term health consequences of smoking include respiratory and non respiratory effects, addiction to nicotine, and the associated risk of other drug use. Long-term health consequences of youth smoking are reinforced by the fact that most young people who smoke regularly continue to smoke throughout adulthood. Cigarette smokers have a lower level of lung function than those persons who have never smoked. Smoking reduces the rate of lung growth.//////* Require by law a comprehensive ban on all forms of advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products. Be aware that voluntary policies do not work and are not an acceptable response to protecting the public, especially youth, from tobacco industry marketing tactics;//////Quite apart from the health impacts of smoking or chewing tobacco are the health hazards of working with tobacco. The nicotine inhaled from smoking or absorbed from chewing tobacco is also rapidly absorbed through the skin when harvesting tobacco, leading to a condition called green tobacco sickness (GTS). GTS has been reported to occur in 1-10% of US tobacco workers and younger workers are at higher risk, which means that the prevalence may be even higher in developing economies where children play a substantial role in harvesting and processing tobacco.//////There are some 4000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke; more than 50 of them are known to cause cancer in humans. Tobacco smoke in enclosed spaces is breathed in by everyone, exposing smokers and non-smokers alike to its harmful effects.//////The vast majority of smokers begin using tobacco products well before the age of 18 years. It was predicted that if the pattern seen nowadays continued, a lifetime of tobacco use would result in the deaths of 250 million children and young people alive today, most of them in developing countries.//////FOREIGN policy is an umbrella term and covers the entire gamut of foreign relations in such areas as, security, trade, manpower export, foreign direct investment, foreign aid, monetary management, cultural matters, curbing terrorism, humanitarian, and environmental issues. //////THESE days we are talking of reforms in governance and institutions of governance and very rightly so. We hear of reform of the Public Service Commission, the Election Commission, Police administration, etc. Yet one office at the nerve centre of governance that attained a great deal of notoriety under elected governments and added significantly to the deterioration of governance, the Prime Minister's Office, or the PMO, has so far escaped attention. To bring the point home, this is what happened to the top PMO officials under Khaleda Zia's premiership. She sent her own secretary to jail. At present her principal secretary is accused for corruption; another secretary is in jail for corruption; one of her political advisers is also in jail while another has been convicted and at present a fugitive from justice. //////The text of a landmark international convention to ban cluster bombs was agreed May 28 by delegates from more than 100 countries meeting in Dublin, an Irish foreign ministry spokeswoman told AFP.//////South Korea is considering a US offer to sell secondhand attack helicopters as part of its drive to upgrade military equipment, officials said May 27.//////A European Satellite Communication (SATCOM) procurement cell may be up and running by 2010, European Defence Agency (EDA) officials said May 26. The idea is to harmonize military requirements and aggregate the growing defence demand for third-party SATCOM capacity through a single European point.//////The largest defence and security dialogue among Asian nations is set to begin this week in Singapore.//////Nehal Karim does a good job of presenting Bangladesh's history in a nutshell here. Well, it is not exactly a nutshell in that he stays away from the temptation of providing readers with a dry enumeration of events and personalities. On second thought, it is a good deal more, seeing that he offers up a background to the incidents and happenings which were to pave the way to the growth of nationalism in Bangladesh. There is an absence of pontification here, which is why the work acquires a charm all its own. In socio-political conditions where the tendency, or call it trend, is toward an esoteric analysis of history, Karim avoids the pitfalls of seeing his book turn into just another tome to be displayed on the shelf.//////While reading ////// I felt as if it was a sequel to Shahidullah Kaiser's ////// Both the books are marvellous works on the socio-cultural history of Muslim Bengal, skillfully crafted prose in beautifully blended fact and fiction.

After his novel ////// which won the Booker Prize in 1999, he has written three novels: ////// and now //////. South African literature has now come to mean more than ////// and the white South African writers //////. But not everybody realises this truth. I was rather surprised when a senior journalist in Dhaka, who is now with an English language daily newspaper, was asking about the background of JM Coetzee after he had won the Nobel Prize as this journalist had not, till then, read any of his novels. Coetzee is an exception rather than a typical representative of Black South African fiction writing. His fiction does not exploit the readymade plots of racial violence, social apartheid and interracial love affairs doomed from the beginning.//////
