While the theme of the mission - Building a Sustainable ICT-based Information and Knowledge System for the Poor and Marginalised is encouraging, the aim to set up 40,000 telecentres all over Bangladesh by 2011, raising the number from present 800 only, is no doubt spirit-lifting. What remains to be seen is timely implementation of the mission objective. //////The campaign that the Anti-Corruption Commission plans to undertake soon against institutional as well as institutionalised corruption is one the nation will certainly welcome, for obvious reasons. In these past many years, graft has eaten away at the vitals of society with the result that citizens have always found themselves at the receiving end of manifest injustice. Indeed, corruption across many tiers, notably in the public sector bodies, has been synonymous with harassment of the general public. If now the ACC can truly get into the business of ferreting out the corrupt elements in the utility services, one can be reasonably sure that a semblance of normality will come to life.//////A joint publication undertaken by the Stockholm International Water Institute, the Water Integrity Network and the Swedish Water House has focused on a vital area of our daily life -- clean water. In this context conservative estimates have indicated that the lack of access to clean water causes the death of five million people worldwide every year.

That adds up to about 12,500 planes annually. This is indeed a frightening scenario.//////Gujarat and Punjab are the two states in India, which are ill at ease most of the time. Their problem is not economic but narrow thinking. Most of the blame lies on the governments because they do not allow people to rise above their limited and personal agenda dinned constantly into their ears. The fallout is that the two states are often absorbed in non-issues and suffer the consequences of mixing religion with politics. //////The Chief Adviser of the caretaker government was very right when he extolled the people of southern districts of Bangladesh as very brave being used to live with the unpredictable nature. The ultimate cost of such bravery, however, has been so very heavy as would blunt our imagination. Surnamed 'Sidr' the cyclone created havoc in the southern districts mostly razing every things on its way. Trees were uprooted, crops in the field awaiting harvest were damaged beyond salvation. Every homestead was ruthlessly battered. The death toll of human being was about 4000 till the last report came in. This didn't include innumerable missing. Many fishermen who went out the day before to the sea to catch fish were yet to return home. Perhaps they would never come back. The onslaught of the cyclone reaching a velocity of about 250 kilometer per hour with the sea waters rising 20-25 feet high ransacked the Sundarbans. Many deer and a number of other wild animals were washed out to the Bay. A big part of the mangrove forest was rendered barren.//////Guest goalkeeper Aminul Haque saved two penalties as Mohammedan Sporting Club produced another tiebreaker win against Abahani yesterday to lift the Teletalk Best of Three charity series 2-1.//////Even if Rajshahi completes the formality of an easy win over Barisal today, Khulna have a great opportunity to keep their top position intact as they fought back against Chittagong on the third day of their National Cricket League match at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium yesterday.//////The Eden Gardens pitch was severely criticised during the second Test between India and Pakistan.

The moon then lies in the same direction (longitude) as the sun when viewed from the earth. At this time, the illuminated half of the moon faces directly towards the sun, and the dark or unilluminated portion faces directly towards the earth, so the moon is invisible as seen from the earth. Full moon occurs as the moon comes into conjunction with the sun when it passes behind the earth. //////Westminster model, widely called British parliamentary system of government, is, in fact, a result of compromise between the traditional monarchy and the then rising class who pioneered the 'great revolution' of 1668 that caused the fall of absolute monarchy.

Koshkin, that is Andrei Pavlovich Koshkin, is a young diplomat at Dhaka's Russian Embassy. I had met him in Moscow where I once lived as a university student. I have returned home some five years now. These past years I have had no contact with him, until last year when we unexpectedly met at an international conference in Dhaka. I learned that he had been reassigned here from New Delhi only the previous month. We soon renewed our old friendship and spiced it up with Vodka.

Subsequently, the influx of South Asian students in western universities boosted the demand for courses in South Asian culture as well as politics.
