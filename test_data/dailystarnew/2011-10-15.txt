Our grandparents' stories are laden with mentions of matir kolshi or matir hari. Sadly, however, the people involved in this mainly folk art form are moving away from their ancestral profession due to lack of demand for and meagre or no profit from their products.

They have their own agenda and their own way of thinking. And, above all, they are competing for the same elusive goal, a majority in parliament. They are bound to jostle one another for that spot. But should they be hurting the system by doing so is the question. Should the race to beat the opponents be with no holds barred? I trust that the question has now become more relevant than before because the people have little faith in what the political parties say or do. They have lost respect and their leaders evoke disappointment and cynicism. In fact, the word, politician, has become a term of contempt.//////Today is "World Rural Women's Day." The day is being observed to highlight the role played by rural women in food production and food security.

It was suggested that October 15 would be celebrated as World Rural Women's Day. The first International Day of Rural Women was observed in New York on October 15, 2008.//////When the anxious citizens are waiting to see some peace prevail after a peaceful election in which the Al-led alliance won, they are witnessing an upsurge of violence, a steady worsening of the economy and polarisation of the society. //////From time immemorial rivers have had a powerful hold over mankind and humans have always been drawn towards rivers. Especially in the urban context, rivers are important to us not only for they can facilitate trade and transportation, but they can also provide a much needed breathing space. An attractive riverfront is a quality natural space where people can relax, slow down, unwind and come to close contact with the nature. Besides, it can be a place of social gathering as well. People coming here get the chance to be acquainted with each other and mutual interaction. This interaction can foster a sense of community and enhance social cohesion. In fact, psychological and social well being of inhabitants is an important determinant of the quality of urban life and rivers can play a crucial role in this context.//////Climate Change is 'increasingly recognized as a public health priority' according to WHO (2009) and Lancet (2011). Lancet, mentioned that climate change will have its greatest impact on those who already are the poorest in the world, and it will deepen inequities, and the effects of global warming will shape the future of health among all peoples. Nevertheless this message has failed to penetrate most public discussions on about the climate change. According to the International Panel for Climate Change (2007), an increase in the average global temperature will lead to changes in precipitation, and atmospheric moisture due to the changes in atmospheric circulation, and increases in evaporation, and water vapor. These changes are believed to link to diseases as well.//////In //////, Octavio Paz enlightens us thus, Although Rabindranath has influenced some of our Hispanic-American poets, none of our poets have had any kind of influence on him.

So after these many years spending a night with her just me and her under the same roof, leaving my wife alone in Gulshan was only a distant probability, a long shot the bookies would say. But fortuitous circumstances have a curious way of making their appearance at the most unlikely times. This happened the other day when my sister and her family who share separate apartments in the same house were going off on a short trip to Sylhet. Our mother would be all alone in the old house and her blood pressure was acting up lately so my sister rang me at the office and in a beseeching tone urged me to spend the following two nights with my mother while she and her family were away. Well, the wife and I were invited to our Beyain's the following night and the evening after we were planning to get ourselves invited to a friend's house an Eid reunion of sorts but I thought my sister needed a break and I could rearrange the socialization to spend some quality time with my Mom. My mind was made up but I told my sister I would get back to her in an hour. I needed the time to plead with my wife and my Beyain. Shortly, to my sister's delight, I confirmed all was okay and she could be off then called my Mom to tell her that I would be staying two nights only nights as the days would be occupied at the office and the evenings with the wife. So actually all I would be doing was go to her place late in the evening sleep and leave very early in the mornings. But my Mom was delighted. I could hear it in her voice. She wanted me to have dinner with her, but I begged off saying I'd be dining with the wife.//////Living in my thought-//////Where-//////My face is made of glass//////I throw stones at me//////And that heals//////Mirror myself in a glass full of water//////The reflection is not perfect-//////Tried hard to make your hand//////Strong enough to hammer on me//////For giving this self a little good shape--//////A room full of fire//////A room full of worms//////A room full of dry blood//////A room full of demon//////One in four people will require mental healthcare at some point in their lives, but in many countries  only two per cent of all health sector resources are invested in mental health services. About 80 percent of people with serious mental disorders living in low and middle income countries like Bangladesh do not receive mental health services they need.//////Childhood blindness is still a significant problem for a developing country like Bangladesh.

However, we can avoid or manage the conditions by following simple guideline.//////British scientists have developed a new stem cell technique for growing working liver cells which could eventually avoid the need for costly and risky liver transplants. A team of researchers led by the Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge used cutting-edge methods to correct a genetic mutation in stem cells derived from a patient's skin biopsy, and then grew them into fresh liver cells.//////People who are genetically susceptible to heart diseases can lower their risk by eating plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, a study published in Plos Medicine journal suggests.//////When it comes to vitamins, it appears you could have too much of a good thing, say researchers who report a link between their use and higher death rates among older women in Archives of Internal Medicine.

Bangladesh shares 1879 km border with the Northeastern States (NES) of India- Tripura 856 km; Meghalaya 443 km, Mizoram 318 km, and Assam 262 km. Internal developments and upsurges on either side of the border have a tendency to spill over into Bangladesh and India, especially in the bordering states of West Bengal and NES. This geographical location and proximity not only open up opportunities for mutual development, it also creates many stumbling blocks in the bilateral relationship. The porous nature of the border between Bangladesh and NES of India has proved to be conducive for drug trafficking, arms smuggling, illegal trade, and migration, which negatively impact on bilateral relations. These security concerns have prevented bilateral relations from realizing their full potentials. //////In the international system no change is possible without its agents. Matsya Nyaya or law of fishes is the defining feature of this system which means in this anarchic world 'big fishes eat up the small fishes'. It is in the power game of big and powerful states; small states seek alliance with other states to survive. Likewise, the war-torn Afghanistan is not exception in that case. It now becomes the epicenter of global powers conflict. As the United States and China located at the core of the game, India and Pakistan are playing the semi-peripheral role making Afghanistan a chessboard in the periphery. It is much like the 'great game'the geopolitical struggle fought between the British and the Russian.//////The year 2011 marks a new beginning for India and Bangladesh, which signed a series of agreements to manage their common border. The March 2011 Agreement on the non-use of lethal weapons by the Border Security Force (BSF), the Coordinated Border management Plan signed in July 2011, and the Protocol to the Agreement concerning the Demarcation of Land Boundary signed in September 2011 are some such accords that are expected to transform the India-Bangladesh border from a border management nightmare to a zone of peace and prosperity. //////Away in the south, there lies a vast area -- 5,770 square kilometers to be exact -- of a mangrove forest -- the Sundarbans.

The first of these novels was published three years ago and brings together a disparate cast of characters who eventually find themselves on a converted slave ship, but this time the voyage is to take indentured workers from Calcutta to Mauritius. There are also several felons who are being sent into exile to the same destination, including a Raja who has been accused of forgery under rather dubious circumstances and an American mulatto who has quickly risen up the ship's hierarchy because of an earlier voyage which wiped out much of the ////// senior crew. ////// mesmerizing narrative is compulsive reading because of Ghosh's historic details about raising opium in India (a British monopoly at the center of the East India Company's phenomenal success), the hazards of shipping (whether to transport opium, slaves, or indentured servants), a plethora of information about the environs of Calcutta in the early part of the nineteenth century and, of course, the lives of people associated with the opium trade. Ghosh's incredible array of characters and assure a winning novel in every way.//////Eighty-three-year old Eddie is in the last phase of his life. He has been working on the maintenance of the Ruby Pier, an amusement park, for as long as he can remember.

It has been published by Samhati Prokashan. It is important to have Bengali language books on various branches of academic knowledge. Economics is a complex subject with many mathematical expressions, theories and hard-to-crack terms. But it can be imparted to almost anyone in fairly easily understandable terms and language. This is lacking in our literature. Therefore Anu Muhammad's initiative in writing an introductory book on economics in Bangla should be an appreciable step in that direction. //////
