With a very poor public transport system, most parents including myself are compelled to use private vehicles as the only option for sending the kids to school. //////Dragon fruit, a new type of fruit has now entered into city's leading shopping malls. Dragon fruit (Hylocereous undatus) is a member of Cacti or Cactaceae family native to Central America, now grown in many parts of the world including Bangladesh. The fruit is tasty and has nutritious values. It contains a good amount of vitamin C, B, minerals such as Calcium, etc. Dragon fruit is a rich source of antioxidant which prevents cancer. The fruit also helps in reducing blood cholesterol and blood sugar. Among many other qualities Dragon fruit helps in reducing body weight. //////The fifth population census has been conducted after ten years in 2011. It is impossible to deny the significance of population census in the development of a country. The researchers, planners, businessmen, learners, even the politicians of home and abroad are using the data and information of the census as the tools or raw materials for their research. If there is any discrepancy in the data and information, the entire work plan will be challenged. According to the preliminary findings of the population and housing census 2011, Bangladesh's population now stands at 14.23 crore which has created debates among the experts and is not in line with the UNICEF, UNDP and other reports. Other reports showed that our population is more than 16 crore. Due to the negligence of the field workers in visiting every house, the reliability of the report is being questioned. Needless to say that the information of the census is vital in preparing ADP or other economic plans. The controversy about the population census is unexpected.//////Israel's policy of treating Palestinians as sub-humans, condemning them to live in slum-like settlements and separating them from the rest of the world is criminal. Israel has not left any stone unturned in deterring the people from around the world from reaching out to the Palestinians. //////Now-a-days, parents are not satisfied with the lesson rendered by the teachers at schools to their children. Regardless of the quality and reputation of the institution, almost every guardian as well as student takes coaching as a must for gaining higher grades! Some of the unscrupulous teachers use this coaching tool as a money-making tree. Sometimes they even threaten the students of giving poor marks in exams if they do not intend to go to those teachers for coaching. Why is coaching essential when students are attentively participating in the classes? Only commercial minded teachers are not to be blamed. The mindset of both students and parents is also the reason behind this nuisance. The school authorities as well as the education ministry must take proper initiatives and make regulations in prohibiting private coaching.//////Rehab (Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh) fair at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, Dhaka, was well organised and attractive. But it is a fair for the affluent people. Can the middle class and poor people afford to purchase Rehab land and apartments? Why does not Rehab make arrangements and sell land and flats for the poor and middle class people with a view to mitigating their untold sufferings. //////After almost about a year we came back to Houston, Texas in order to retain our residency in the United States. In order to begin living once again in our host country, we had to do a lot of shopping. While staying in Bangladesh for the last one year we experienced a great price spiral of essential commodities. The regime in power blamed the price hike on the international market. To my utter dismay, I found most of the things selling at the price that I found a year ago. Only the gasoline price has doubled, yet it is cheaper compared to Bangladesh. Apart from this, the price hike is very nominal, for example, the bread that we used to buy from Walmart for 80 cents now sells for a dollar. In general, the price hike of essential commodities here in Texas is like this.//////There is no doubt that for a secular country the constitution is a scared document. As such, perhaps various oaths of office may be administered by the copy of the constitution rather than a religious scripture, as the office bearers come from various faiths. //////I have noticed that the habit of smoking is increasing substantially. It is not that the adults only smoke, the young boys, especially the teenagers are also smoking significantly. Whenever I go to Gulshan I see that the young boys are smoking in groups on roadsides and in restaurants, even though 'no smoking' is written in those places, creating disturbance to the general people. It is so shocking that 10-12 year-old boys smoke freely in front of elders. So, I would suggest the parents to keep an eye on their children so that they do not smoke and keep themselves away from harmful habits. I also request the government to ban advertisements of cigarettes in public places.//////There exists a bad practice in our politics, whenever any political leader or a minister or an MP visits any place, to give a show off the school kids are forced to stand on both sides of the streets, with flags and flowers. Instead of attending classes they are obliged to welcome the 'special' people, standing in sun, rain, cold and storm. It is mandatory for the school kids. It is inhumane and medieval. //////If the root of a tree is cut off, the possibility of blooming flower will nip in the bud. Similarly, if our young generation goes astray, then our future will be uncertain. Youths are involving themselves in many illegal activities like addiction, eve-teasing, hijacking, stealing, etc. The reasons behind their addiction are bad company, poverty, bad parenting, availability of drugs etc. In order to save them from this path, parents as well as government should take required steps. //////Mirakkel 6 is now being telecast by Zee Bangla, I watch this programme regularly because it is very entertaining and also because there are participants from Bangladesh. I am really happy noticing that Bangladeshi participants are doing very well but at the same time disappointed noticing that they are not getting due recognition.//////The arrival of India's Congress party president Sonia Gandhi in Bangladesh was an auspicious sign for bilateral relationship between the two neighbouring countries. She attended a conference on autistic and disabled children as chief guest and also received Bangladesh Freedom Honour" award from the government on behalf of her late mother-in-law Indira Gandhi. I hope that this visit will play a significant role in boosting our political and economic relation with India. But it is regretful that Indian border security force BSF has killed one Bangladeshi on the day of her arrival. Any problem can be solved through negotiation. I urge the authorities concerned to reach an agreement and implement that properly so that no such border killing occurs in future.//////At least 42 people have died in violence near Yemen's southern city of Zinjibar, most of which has fallen under the control of suspected al-Qaeda militants, military and local sources said yesterday.//////The chief minister of a southern Indian state who is accused of being at the centre of a $3.6-billion mining fraud will resign on Sunday, he said yesterday.//////US President Barack Obama Friday called for an "international response" to the devastating famine in the Horn of Africa after meeting with the leaders of four French-speaking African nations.//////Libyan rebels say the gunmen who shot dead their military chief were members of an Islamist-linked militia that is allied to their struggle to overthrow veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.//////Weight gain can be more dangerous for South Asians than for Caucasians because the fat clings to organs like the liver instead of the skin, said a study published Thursday.//////Turkey faced turmoil within its military yesterday after the country's four most senior commanders quit, offering Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan an opportunity to extend his authority over the once dominant armed forces.//////The United Nations on Friday slapped sanctions on the Pakistani Taliban -- thought to be behind last year's failed bombing attempt on New York's Times Square -- for having links with al-Qaeda.//////Syrian forces shot dead at least 20 civilians in attacks on pro-democracy demonstrations across the country Friday, the Syrian human rights organisation Sawasiah said.//////The royal palace and the headquarters of the governing Labour Party were on self-confessed Norwegian killer Anders Behring Breivik's list of targets, the tabloid Verdens Gang (VG) reported yesterday.//////Ten Shia Muslims and another man were killed yesterday when gunmen opened fire in an apparent sectarian attack in southwestern Pakistan, police said.//////Marvel has won a legal battle to retain copyright of its lucrative comic book characters including Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk.//////London police probing phone hacking at Rupert Murdoch's defunct News of the World tabloid are broadening their investigation to allegations of computer hacking, they said yesterday.//////Seventeen factory workers were killed and 21 seriously injured after they became trapped in a burning Vietnamese shoe workshop that did not have a fire escape, local police said yesterday.//////A plane crashed and broken in two on landing at Guyana's main airport in the capital, Georgetown, yesterday causing injuries but no deaths.//////Iraq is a less safe place than it was one year ago and security is continuing to deteriorate, an American watchdog warned yesterday, just months ahead of a US withdrawal from the country.//////Unidentified gunmen yesterday attacked a terminal on the gas pipeline to Israel for the fifth time since February, a security official said.//////Nepal's Maoist party yesterday vowed to pull out of the government if the premier fails to appoint its lawmakers as cabinet ministers, threatening fresh political turmoil in the Himalayan nation.//////Morocco's King Mohammed VI said yesterday he was in favour of reopening the country's border with Algeria, closed since 1994 amid tensions between the north African neighbours.//////Two Indian soldiers were killed yesterday in a fierce clash with rebels along the de facto border that splits Kashmir between India and Pakistan, the army said.//////Fans adorably refer to them as ABC -- Artcell, Black and Cryptic Fate.

Death is inevitable, but it wasn't his time to go. He was a genuinely nice guy. He had this inherent ability to get close to people, said former Closeup 1 champion Nolok Babu.//////Monsoon in Bengal is anything but subtle: the gloomy sky often weeps away reminding us of the unforgettable moments of life, at times the rhythm of raindrops rejuvenates the passion, heavy shower amplifies that passion, nature wakes up and flowers blossom. These images and impressions of monsoon dominated this month's instalment of 'Praner Khela', a regular musical programme arranged by Bengal Foundation. The soiree was held on July 28 at the Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, Dhanmondi in Dhaka.//////Directed and compiled by the Founder Chairperson of Scholastica, Yasmeen Murshed and Wajed Al Rahman, Scholastica Alumni Association's production titled Who's Afraid of William Shakespeare? opened with the three witches of Macbeth resurrecting the Bard of Avon. The bard, awoken from his eternal slumber, found himself confronted by a couple of teenage students whining about his endless iambic pentameter that these students have to stomach to get through their exams. The hour-long production was characterised by fascinatingly dramatic, startling and above all, hilarious elements.//////The evening descends. The rays of a tired sun play havoc with the cheeks of the woman you love to distraction. And you hum the old Mohammad Rafi song, Hui shaam un ka khayal aa gaya / wohi zindagi ka sawaal aa gaya. And there you have it. In the 31 years since July 1980, life without Rafi has been a time of declining, indeed increasingly mediocre music. He was a maestro, in that true sense of the meaning. Think of Radhike tu ne bansri churai; or dwell on Hue hum jin ke liye barbaad. There was that command in him of the various elements of music. Was that voice a gift from God? Never mind the answer. But what we do know is that Mohammad Rafi was an artiste whose presence in Indian music overshadowed every other presence in his time.//////A three-day programme marking the 87th birth anniversary of one of Bangladesh's pioneering painters, SM Sultan began at Sultan Moncho, Narail on July 29. Jointly organised by the SM Sultan Shishu Charu-O-Karukala Foundation, Bengal Foundation and Sultan Foundation, with Banglalink as the sponsor, the celebration will conclude today. //////An electrifying drama is being played out now at the UN Headquarters in New York. On one end is a state called Palestine. On the other end is a Zionist entity which has the trappings of a state called Israel. The entity is nervous. //////In this regard, let me turn the clock back to the period of September-October 1977. I was then living in England. I had taken a sabbatical from my work as a journalist and took up a place up at Cambridge University to pursue graduate work in economics. In the autumn of 1977 Amnesty International approached me for my views on a developing crisis in Bangladesh. At the time Amnesty was receiving a flood of confidential reports describing mass executions that were taking place in Bangladesh following an apparent revolt in the armed forces. //////National constitutions contain the broad principles of the supreme policy of a state. Other policies, contained in documents other than in constitutions, are policies of governments. The latter policies constantly change, unlike the former. Therefore, disadvantaged sections of citizens, seek to protect their rights by having express safeguard provisions included in their national constitutions. This is no exception in Bangladesh. //////The growing availability of English medium education in Bangladesh attests to the increasing demand for the global language, both domestically and internationally. Even traditional, national-curriculum following Bangla medium schools, such as Viqarunnisa Noon School or St. Josephs have established English medium sections. These sections teach the basic national curriculum as translated in English, and usually have only one Bangla class, for at most 45 minutes per day. In the O'level exams in English medium schools, the Bangla section is easily passable, as discussed by several alums of such schools for this article. Since Bangla is taught as a second language, the section is fairly easy, and almost everyone will score an A, explained a graduate from Sunbeams. This trend, along with the rise in British-curriculum English medium schools in the country, attests to the language's continued prestige in the region. //////Typically we in Bangladesh are used to seeing our people migrate to other countries in search of work, a better living, or simply to escape harsh economic conditions. We are used to emigration from our country, and not immigration. That perception was changed abruptly when we faced a large-scale influx of people in our eastern border, from the state of Arakan -- a large swath of land in Burma, now Myanmar, in April 1978.//////Dateline Dhaka, 1 July 2011. The leading Bengali daily Prothom Alo reports: 'Indian film enters the country [Bangladesh]' (Entertainment Reporter 2011: 20). The report elaborates that three Indian-Bengali films were released from the airport upon a court order and are now awaiting the clearance of Bangladesh film censor board for being shown in local theatres. Within two weeks, it reports again with a heading: 'the Film Fraternity fights back the Indian films [in Bangladesh]' (Kamruzzaman 2011: 20). It outlines how the five different associations of film professionals working at Dhaka Film Industry promise to oppose 'the exhibition of Indian films till the last' and urged the government to intervene. On the other hand, the film exhibitors' association wishes to bring more Indian films as '[local] film production is dwindling, the audiences are not watching these films like before and the producers are also losing money'. (Kamruzzaman 2011: 20). //////
