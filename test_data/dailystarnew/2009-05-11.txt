In his death, the country has lost not only a man of remarkable integrity but also a scientist of national as well as international repute. It is these two attributes which in his lifetime created for him the good reputation that in his death endures. Noted for his academic and intellectual brilliance, Wazed Mia perhaps could have gone further than he did as a scientist. But the kind of man he was, maybe he did not quite feel that way about himself. The self-effacing about him was all. //////BANGLADESH was born poor and, today, after almost four decades of its sovereign existence, poverty lashes at the vast multitude of our population with full fury. It is not that the people at the helm have, at any point of time, been oblivious of the problem.

He was admitted to Patuakhali General Hospital at about 8pm where he died at about 9pm.//////Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan's team Kolkata Knight Riders was undoubtedly the hugely promoted team of this year's IPL. After the drubbing of the last year, some people thought that this year Kolkata Knight Riders would be perish the same way,  because even before the start of the tournament, the team engaged itself in a big controversy as coach John Buchanon wanted to introduce the multi-captain theory in cricket. Moreover, the unfair treatment meted out to Saurav Ganguly raised many eyebrows and there was no team unity and team spirit visible under the captaincy of Macculum. Nevertheless, the hype and support for Kolkata Knight Riders is understandable and people of Bangladesh also joined in the Knight Riders (KKR)  because of the inclusion of Mashrafee Mortaza. But all  our hopes and expectations were  simply shattered because even after losing match after match, the team management of KKR didn't bother to include Mashrafee in the final eleven. They bought Mashrafee at an unbelievable price of 6 million dollars and Mashrafee is also at the pick of his form. So the reason why they are not including Mashrafee in the playing eleven is indeed unclear.  The bad treatment which our players like Ashraful and Mashrafee got from this year's IPL was unexpected and disappointing, to say the least.//////Trafficking is a serious crime and embodies many facets of human rights abuses. Thousands of women and children are caught up in these criminal activities every year, causing them great harm. Over recent years much has been written about the dynamics of trafficking, and many ambitious and well-intentioned statements of commitment to combating  trafficking have been made in the international forums. But there is still a  big  gap between the cup and the lip. Many countries are still lagging behind with regard to ensuring safety and security of their children and women. Bangladesh is not an exception to this. Criminals use Bangladesh as a source of women and child trafficking. As an over-populated country, with a lot of people living below  poverty line, it is easy for the human traffickers to lure poor, helpless child and women out of the country with the promise of better lives, work and future. But as we know,  the promises end up in gruelling torture and sub-human work environment and in some cases death. To stop the crime, the government of Bangladesh is committed to making a difference in the lives of women and children vulnerable to trafficking and this commitment is reflected in its various initiatives such as enacting laws suiting  the needs of time, setting up high powered one stop crisis centre and multi-level monitoring cell and special courts for trying cases of such offences. Vigilance has been reinforced in the international airports and seaports of the country. People have been sensitised through campaigns, seminars and symposium all over the country. Yet, much more  has to be done to ensure the safety of women and children.//////May 8 was the 148th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. Throughout the country, several cultural functions were held. This shows that Tagore has become a truly iconic figure in our national life. He is the symbol of humanity. His popularity is not confined within the boundaries of a country. He served humanity.//////Shortage of fresh water has made people of Gopalgonj vulnerable.  The Modhumoti river which has dried up and important canals like Panchuria, Bedgram, Khatra, Boiragi, Char Sonakur are full of water-hyacinths which threaten the livelihood of people.  People of the town are very much dependent on natural water,  but still the authorities could not start removing the water-hyacinths from the dead Modhumoti and the canals.//////This is an opportune moment to consider Proportional Representation (PR) for our voting system discarding the constituency based first- past-the-post system for parliament seats.  Voting would be so much easier as it would be only for a party rather than a constituency member for a particular constituency. It would also be easy to allow non-resident Bangladeshis to vote from abroad in the embassies.//////Recently, an interesting report published in the DS caught my attention. It was regarding the  Chhatra League's  installation of a sculpture of Bangabandhu by removing a 31-year old sculpture made by a freedom fighter at a hall of DU. I also found it disturbing that one of the Chhatra League activists has stated that Bangabandhu's sculpture deserves to be on that spot because Bangabandhu is a great leader, whereas the deposed sculpture of a former female student merely represented the emotion of the artist. Regrettably, these people don't understand that every great leader becomes 'distinguished' in people's heart by respecting the simple emotions and sentiments of the people. We the people make great leaders out of ordinary individuals by inspiring their visions and they in turn must give us enlightening directions. Bangabandhu couldn't become a great leader without the admiration of the valiant Bengalis.  As a result, great leaders and their followers should always be generous and self-sacrificing. Unlike greedy dictators, great leaders do not install gigantic sculptures of themselves throughout the country. Instead, they work for the people without any bias or self-interest. That's what makes them even greater. Great leaders respect general people's sentiments and their followers should also strive to uphold the luminous examples set by them. Lamentably, many people in our country fail to grasp these simple facts. In our country, when a political party comes to power it doesn't only politicise the entire administration but it also strives to restructure people's sentiments. In Bangladesh, the ruling political party is often keen to rename many central institutions. However, it usually does little to make them more efficient. Consequently, even though these institutions bear the name of an iconic leader, they fail to honour the greatness of the name. Similarly, the ruling party is generally more eager to hang photos of its eminent leaders in government offices than ensuring tangible changes for the general masses. The ruling party even endeavours to conquer our inner world by rewriting textbooks and by distorting the nation's history. These are certainly not the characteristics of a liberal democracy. These are rather the totalitarian traits that characterize our political parties and their activists. Our political parties must understand the fact that no one is greater in a democracy than the people themselves. Coming back to the sculpture issue, I believe that the CL activists should have been circumspect enough to respect the sentiment of the local residents and the freedom fighter artist of the deposed sculpture. People generally do not like drastic changes, especially if the changes are forcefully imposed upon them. Human heart is mysterious and often the simplest feeling can occupy a very special place in its realm. Every single emotion has its own space in human heart and it's not wise for political parties to disturb that order.//////The lead news 'Killer Pesticides' on the pages of your  daily on 5 May 09 had an enormous bearing on the readers  and needs to be viewed from a different perspective.//////In most countries, sex trade or exchanging money for sex is legal. Prostitution or sexual gratification for money is perhaps the world's oldest known trade. It is illegal in only a few countries in the world. The reason it is legal is the general attitude that prostitution does no harm, has no victims, and is sex among consenting adults. The changing face of the murky trade has now broadened to include street prostitution, residence sex work, brothel sex work, hotel sex work, call-girl, club sex dance, massage parlour, sex tourism, sex pornography and child sex.//////After a brief lull, the call for the total ban on rickshaws is once again being resurrected, this time in DS of 20 March by a resident of Uttara.

Some  parents  run after these schools to get their children admitted.//////As education is thought to be the yardstick of development, great importance should be given to this sector. And it should have been given in the past. But it wasn't. As a result, after 38 years of liberation our country is still backward in all aspects. And if it is not done in near future, our country will never reach the zenith of development. Besides, it is known to all that the more the nation is educated, the more it prospers. Each and every citizen of a country expects a prosperous life. So, if we want to stand upright among the nations of the world as a developed one, there is no alternative to education. But it is a matter of great regret that no specific education policy has been framed so far. //////Nowadays I laugh a lot when I see the activities of BNP leaders.
