Our embarrassment only gets deeper when we note that at the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology, students engaged in running battles with the police and bus workers and damaged some administrative offices of RUET. Indeed, incidents of students all too often and on the flimsiest of excuses taking the law in their hands appear to have become the norm, with the authorities clearly proving incapable of coming down on these unruly elements with a firm hand. Such inaction has sent out a very wrong message to people within and outside the country, which is that the unruly young can and do get away with their acts.

Moreover, expensive dredging in the Karnaphuli River had to be carried all round the year to keep the port running. Under the circumstances, consultants were engaged to study in detail and submit recommendations. Consultants studied in detail for a long time and termed the port dead. They recommended going for a deep seaport further down. I had an occasion to attend a meeting at the naval headquarters, Dhaka, to review the report and recommend action. The meeting was adjourned without decision. The Mongla port also needs massive investment to cater to freight from Nepal, Bhutan and India. //////The general elections are being held at regular intervals, but the political culture is not improving.

But as everything is transitory, with the passage of time those railway tracks now are in dilapidated condition and still we have to use them. //////The front-page picture of your daily of January 24 is shocking and devastating.//////Regarding the AP article Pope defends Pius against Jewish critics at Rome Synagogue, January 18, 2010.//////It is distressing that police seized, raiding different dormitories of a reputed college like Dhaka College, a revolver and a number of sharp weapons last week.

This simply means such a form of political culture which is very much antagonistic and instigative. Almost each and every political party of Bangladesh is not railed in the right path of development, rather each of them is derailed from the genuine direction of democratic polity. This unexpected and abominable political practices not only deter development initiatives but also cause a number of problems. Such a form of hostile and ill political motive seriously deprives the common people from the light of overall development. In our country, this sort of politics has been a crucial issue. Because of the absence of an appropriate democratic polity we do not see proper co-ordination and co-operation among the political parties. For example, our leading opposition party, the BNP is hardly concerned to play a constructive role in terms of participation in parliament. On the other hand, the AL-led grand alliance, current ruling party, is also a bit reluctant to listening to the grievances and demands of the BNP.//////From the January 26, 2010 issue of The Daily Star, we learned about RMG workers going on rampage after a road accident in which one of their fellow workers was killed and 14 others injured.
