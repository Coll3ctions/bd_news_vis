They did so in order for all of us to be free to speak in that language. It is thus that we pay tribute to Salam, Jabbar, Barkat, Rafiq and all those others who scaled the heights of martyrdom and in doing so left us all a legacy that we were to consistently build on.

It is the Language Martyrs' Day. It was fifty-six years ago that, among others, Barkat, Rafiq, Jabbar, Shafiur and Salam sacrificed their lives for the honour and preservation of our mother language, Bangla. //////CONSERVATIVES are a gloomy bunch at the moment. Many believe that their party -- the Republican Party -- has lost its way and that it has done so by abandoning its principles. Aside from his foreign policy and Supreme Court appointments, conservatives find little to love about George W. Bush. His signature domestic policies include a vast expansion of government-financed health care (prescription-drug benefits), and increased funding for education while halfheartedly promoting vouchers and school choice. Bush also signed into law campaign-finance reform and supported a proposed immigration bill that would have allowed illegal aliens a path to citizenship. The Republican Congress is even worse, having indulged in an orgy of irresponsible spending. And now the party is set to nominate John McCain as its presidential nominee, a man who on several key issues has broken with Republican orthodoxy and voted with Democrats.
