That is worrying, for both the returnees as well as the Bangladesh government. With employment a perennial problem for this resource-strapped country, one can surely understand the hurdles before the government where rehabilitating these workers is concerned. It is a situation which gravely taxes the imagination and calls for a clear, well thought out approach to the issue.//////WHEN the government envisages building a Digital Bangladesh, the news that computer studies at secondary and higher secondary levels are conducted without specialized teachers in the state-run educational institutions is indeed appalling. It is unbelievable that governments have not created any permanent post for teachers in this discipline at 570 schools and colleges since introducing the subject fifteen years ago. Classes are conducted by teachers of other subjects that too in makeshift arrangements. //////Had this 210-5 come sometime during Bangladesh's disastrous 47-match losing streak between 1999 and 2003, the batsmen would have been lauded for showing the patience to bat out 50 overs.//////Michael Clarke swung from his hips at a Mashrafe Bin Mortaza half-tracker in the final over of the Australian innings to reach his century.

The report showed involved institutes, individuals, SEC & government official's names. General investors expected that the report would be publicly declared. But finance minister said individual names which have been mentioned will be deleted before making it public within 15days. With due respect to FM I have two observations to add. Firstly, why did you make a committee whose report is not acceptable to you. Secondly, as FM you have the supremacy to re-investigate the report. To the general investors please think before investing. At least try to have some knowledge about price earnings ratio, earning per Share, authorized capital, paid up capital etc. These are very fundamental key words of share market. //////In the front page of The Daily Star, published on 1st April 2011, titled 'Killing of a river' tells us how Shitalakkhya, is polluted. In fact dumping of wastage from the nearby factories and mills to the river is the routine work. Without treating waste properly, these are exposed to the river bed that results in the contamination of water bodies at higher rates. Considering the projected future generation of Dhaka city, the Govt. should undertake a long-term plan to save our surrounding rivers. Above all, we all want to live in our capital city where pollution free environment should be ensured by the authority concerned. //////Needless to mention, it has become very common practice of city people adopting offence by flouting common etiquettes. However, what changes I merely notice in the city nowadays are-- increased number of vehicles creating unbearable traffic congestion, increased intensity of stench produced from rubbish carelessly littered all over road sides, increased odour of human urine as people urinate here and there and massive decrease in void lands owing to the briskness of real estate companies. Apart from all these a group of unscrupulous people are illegally occupying national assets. Women and girls are the common victims of eve-teasers even in the city, let alone in village areas. Other high degree crimes likeextortion, racketeering, molestation, ravishment, slaying and bribery are seen very often even in broad day light. It seems like a city of misdemeanour, going to aggravate more, signalling a bleak future in the coming days. //////In the Business Page of The Daily Star Rafique Sarker's article A quiet change in Rangpur(30.03.11) offers a new dimension to the young entrepreneurs of Bangladesh. The writer tells the story of a NRB who returned home for providing the poor of Rangpur an opportunity to earn a livelihood through non-traditional farming activity. He described how power shortage and interest rate hampered the production. Despite the problems Shanta Islam did not loose her hope. We congratulate the lady who dared to defy the problems generally faced by many young businessmen. She is an inspiration to us all. We hope that she will have more success in the coming days.//////The 'stupid and uncivilized' pastor Terry Jones; an illiterate and medieval bigot, needs harshest punishment, for unnecessarily provoking violence in many countries. That 'ignorant pastor' should be sent to life long 'pasture' in a prison; for expressing his private belief through a public nuisance act; beyond the norms of civilized behaviour. Is this person sane? This is an uncivil and wild man whose behaviour exceeds all bounds of decorum and respect for other religious sentiments! This brainless person is responsible for events resulting to violence and death and injury of many persons. The madman needs to be sent to a lunatic asylum permanently by US authorities; before he causes more harm to other people in other countries. //////From the very beginning of the birth of our country, the compensation system for the government employees is extremely poor. We see that government employees get very low salary although at the time of retirement a healthy amount they get. However, we all think about the present at first and then secondly the future. So, when the government employees see that they are surviving with their low salary, they immediately get involved in corruption. Therefore, I think, the government and other concerned parties should be aware about this problem. A healthy salary scale and proper motivation can reduce the corruption from government sector.//////A colored photograph was published by local English daily on 3rd April which was titled 'Dangerous Crossing'. It described the 'truck' in the photograph as 'A pick up van'; when actually it is a truck!//////The trends of changing colours by the politicians have been prominent in the two major parties in Bangladesh. When they are in power, they leave no stone unturned to make the best use of their supremacy. As a result, the long term development of our country remains a far cry. The last tide of change has been seen in the system of the caretaker government. We have observed that the national election was successfully held several times under this system. So the question of abolishing this system does not bear the sign of sagacity. Finally, we appreciate the decision taken by the government to bring several changes in the process. In this regards, they can consult with the professional lawyers to reach a solution to the issue. Otherwise, absence of this system will pave the way for another military supremacy.//////I am a graduate from a private university looking for a decent job for a long time. Everyday I start searching for jobs through online recruitment companies like BDJOBS.com, PROTHOM-ALOJOBS.com and STAR-EJOBS.com, and get phone calls from a few companies but all ends up with no result.//////According to media reports, the International Cricket Council has decided to cut down the number of teams from 14 to 10 for the next ICC ODI World Cup. This will not help promote cricket in other countries. Compared to other sports, only very few countries are playing cricket. Despite lack of experience and fewer opportunities, junior teams performed very well in recent World Cup and they need more experience and opportunities to play and enhance their experience with big teams.//////Being a student of Jagannath University I realized once again that how the whole nation is suffering under the grip of two political parties. All of you know that the JnU halls are illegally occupied by some influential people. Two of these halls are- Tibbat Hall in Ahsan Monzil area and another one in Bongshal. The sad thing is that these two halls are now estate of two influential personalities from both giant parties of the country. In one place, Hazi Selim sets up a big market after the name of his wife Gulshan Ara while Sadek Hossen Khoka sets up a school named 'Shahid Ziaur Rahman School' in another place. My question is- how much love do they really have for the students? And I really don't know- why are the students in the universities run after these persons under the name of politics? //////The recent protests against the 'National Women Development Policy' apparently put emphasis on the sick and distorted value system that characterizes some members of our society. These people are endeavouring to exploit our religious sentiment and their explanation of the so-called anti-religious elements of the NWDP is absolutely illogical, baseless and misleading. By calling for equal rights of men and women NWDP doesn't anyhow contradict the commandments of Islam because as a modern religion Islam itself is based upon the enlightening principle of parity among all human beings irrespective of gender, race and class. These people must understand that the world has moved forward and it will terribly hinder our socioeconomic development if we still remain engrossed in the bleak beliefs of The Middle Ages.//////Currently Zee Bangla is airing a song competition program of little Children under the program head Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li'l Champs 2011 in which some children singers from Bangladesh are also participating. But the performance of Bangladesh artistes appears not up to the mark. I don't know how these participants were selected but I am sorry to say that they are not the replicas of our huge talented children singers at least those produced by different Bangladeshi TV channels during their yearly child artistes competitions. //////"Prof. Muhammad Yunus is not in peace because he had won the Nobel Peace Prize and made Bangladesh proud. His Grameen Bank is also similarly blessed. I propose that a viable and effective campaign be mulled nationally and internationally, to put forward the name of our illustrious Prof. Muhammed Yunus, for the next Secretary Generalship of the United Nations. It is likely that he might even be elected unopposed, because of his credentials and known universal appeal. I hope and pray Dr. Yunus reads this letter and visualizes his global role in the offing that would be of even wider scale. I invite opinions to my view and support from those who care. Let us all start thinking and working for same.//////Who we are? What is our identity? What is our language and what is our culture? We are going to forget all of these. One of the reasons hidden behind it is the Indian TV Serials. These serials are full of impractical family conflicts. We are the only nation in the world who fought for its language. But many of today's children prefer to speak in Hindi more than Bangla. Not only that, if one is used to watch these serials regularly there must be a malicious attitude in her/his mind and it will surely affect her/his family life also. To save our language, culture, nationality and morality these harmful and damaging Indian serials should be banned immediately.//////A buoyant Muammar Gaddafi made his first television appearance for five days on Saturday and his troops engaged rebels in new fighting on the eastern front in Libya's civil war.//////Syrian security forces used live ammunition in the early hours of Saturday to disperse a pro-democracy protest by hundreds of people in a Sunni district of Latakia, causing scores of injuries and possible deaths, residents said.//////New York is a major loser and Reykjavik a winner from new forecasts of sea level rise in different regions.//////Grief-stricken relatives threw themselves upon caskets and wept to exhaustion as Rio buried most of the 12 children killed in a school shooting.

It is largely expected that this document of the supreme laws of the land will undergo the formal 15th Amendment sooner or later during the tenure of the present parliament. //////LAURENT Gbagbo refuses to let go of power. So does Muammar Gaddafi. So does Ali Abdallah Saleh. So does the ruler of Bahrain. There is always something about power which convinces those clinging to it that they can defy public opinion, can ignore the ridicule of their people and hang on. Right till the end, Hosni Mubarak thought he could trick Egyptians into staying on and making the future safe for his son. His indignant nation proved to be a step ahead of him. //////NINE-eleven (9/11) changed the world in more ways than one. Perhaps the most significant impact is felt in the sphere of air travel. Excruciating security standards have transformed pre-departure arrangements into a nerve-wracking experience. Once on board, one feels an absence of bonhomie since most co-travelers tend to be aloof, edgy and suspicious at the slightest deviant behaviour! Finally, on reaching the destination passengers are subjected to a virtual inquisition by over-cautious customs and immigration staff. //////The Titanic leaves port in Southampton, England for her first and only voyage//////
