The prioritisation of the issues--prices of essentials, inflation, poverty, energy, good governance and terrorism --pretty much reflects public concern. //////During the Eid holidays 41 lives were lost to highway and road accidents, making a daily average of ten fatalities. One simply loses count of the numbers of injured and maimed. The pressure of mobility mounting prior to and following festivals, commandeering of dilapidated transports, overloading, speeding, overtaking, putting novices on the driver's seat et all make a lethal combination with accidents just waiting to happen. All of these factors are more or less present at other times, but these make a reappearance during festive occasions with vengeance.//////The nomination seeking process of prospective members of parliament have exposed the shady past of the new rich of our society and have also disconcertingly brought to the fore the not-so-hidden culture of disobedience of law by the high and mighty. While this may not be surprising to the informed, it is without doubt, a very disappointing sight to the optimists as it lends credence to the cynical view that politics belittle greatness and corrupt goodness; and that while good people are engaged in introspection, the burly sinners continue to run our public affairs.//////The yellow clad mass supporters from the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) have rolled up their mats and sleeping bags and vacated Bangkok's two international airports -- Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi.

For the uninitiated, Emo is actually short for emotional and essentially a punk style. Those who do not conform to any particular norms and are known for their own trends are seen sporting this hairstyle. The most typical characteristic of Emo hairstyle is the attitude it reflects. Asymmetrical bangs, partially covering the face and often dyed in bright colours are what make Emo hairstyle absolutely distinct.//////A number of outstanding painters trace their roots to Philippines. Manila's promising painters are now engaged in experimentation and frequently apply unusual techniques in their works. Installation, videography and collage are important features in their works. Some works are rich conceptually and convey diverse messages to art lovers. Conceptual art, sometimes called "Idea Art," is where ideas or concepts are the most important aspect. //////The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. (HFPA) did not get "Milk." It barely acknowledged "The Dark Knight." And though in past years it loved "Sex and the City" the TV series, it ignored "Sex and the City" the movie.//////Single episode TV play "Alpo Dekhar Golpo" will be aired on Banglavision tonight at 8:15 pm.

People are questioning how these people would spend lakhs of taka for election without having the minimum annual taxable income. People feel that although the present EC rules do not require a person to have TIN, it is imperative that EC should frame a law that becomes mandatory in future for persons seeking election to have a TIN and a minimum educational attainment. That the parliament that will usher in through this much-awaited national election take a leaf out of all these happenings and discharge responsibilities according to the Constitution and the laws.//////Pran Nath Haksar, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Principal Secretary, told me soon after assuming office that he would see to it that the state election was held separately from that of the Lok Sabha. Till then, both were held simultaneously. A voter was given one ballot paper for the Lok Sabha poll and the other for the particular state at the same polling booth.//////The PRSP 2008, Moving Ahead: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction 11(NSAPR) has recently been approved.

Continuing from generation to generation this manual process of production had been facing some constraints of late viz. lack of equal interest of all members of family, gradual decrease of investible capital, etc. //////World Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO's) recent projections to 2030 suggest that globally the share of food in average household expenditure will continue to decline. However, recent trends, at least for some commodities, appear to be showing the reverse, with food prices increasing faster than incomes. Growing scarcities of water, land and fuel are likely to put increasing pressure on food prices, even without climate change. Additional pressures on these resources due to climate change, the introduction of mitigation practices that have the potential to create land use competition, and the attribution of market value to environmental services to mitigate climate change, also have the potential to cause significant changes in relative prices for different food items and an overall increase in the cost of an average food basket for the consumer.//////In the hilly hamlet of Hoaikong in southeastern Bangladesh, villagers are used to welcoming new residents on a weekly basis. //////Weeks ago I went through the article 'Blazing Dhaka: An urban heat island' written by one of my departmental fellows in The Daily Star. It should undoubtedly be a great concern for the urban experts. The UHI is the worse outcome of urban metabolism process (exchange and transformation of material and energy flow) and is very much explicit in most of the densely built urban environments. But most of the economically developed countries are totally dependent on artificial air cooling system to get rid of the uncomfortable local climatic situation which again discharges waste energy in the atmosphere attributing to the global warming. Dhaka, unless address and takes proper initiatives to attenuate the impact of UHI, the city life will be really very much miserable and not unlikely that the city becomes abandoned while also facing other environmental issues as majority of city dwellers are not so rich to own AC and AC in every house in congested localities simply unbearable environmentally. //////(Excerpted from 'Dacca Diary,' by Peter R. Kaan, ////// 14 December 1971)//////This collection of Western reporting and journalism published by Viking/Penguin India was timed to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the Foreign Correspondents' Association of South Asia (FCA), later re-named the Foreign Correspondents' Club. The FCC entrusted the job to three senior 'India hands': Simon Denyer (the Reuters' India and Nepal bureau chief since 2004), John Elliot (currently reporting for//////), and Bernard Imhasly (ex-Swiss diplomat who was the overseas correspondent for the ////// from 1991-2007). That the club was founded and is located in New Delhi seems right. Historically Western, or to be more precise, British reporting on India began in Calcutta in the early nineteenth century. In those days, it took four months for news from Calcutta to reach the English port of Falmouth. Word of the 1857 Sepoy Revolt, which began on 9 May, did not reach England till a full month later. The first full-time British correspondent in India was Reuters' twenty-two-year-old Henry Collins, who arrived in Calcutta along with the first telegraph line between Europe and India in 1865. //////I am still on my feet, and this is my kind of pride//////Venturing at last to go out//////I blink at the guilt in the eye//////And fumble with the throat//////As if there were a tie//////I shall nationalize all the roses for children,//////otherwise they won't get a single flower//////I shall, likewise, nationalize land for the peasants//////or they too like the children won't be assured////// of food.//////Nayana (means eye) is the name of a unique mobile eye care initiative for diabetic patients Supported by the World Diabetes Foundation  run by Dr Krishna R Murthy, Dr Praveen R Murthy, Dr K R Murthy and Subbakrishna Rao and a Joint Project of The Vittala International Institute of Ophthalmology, Prabha Eye Clinic and Research Center and The National Association for the Blind of Karnataka state of Bangalore in India. In fact, this is a great boon for the rural people living with diabetes retinopathy and its complications.//////A leading specialist and senior consultant in gastroenterology, liver diseases from Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore Dr Yap Chin Kong recently visited Bangladesh. During his visit he shared his views on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of different gastrointestinal diseases.//////Women who breathed in secondhand smoke as children or young adults were later more likely to have trouble getting pregnant and suffer more miscarriages than women not exposed to smoke, U.S. researchers reported.//////Doctors in St. Louis said they have successfully transplanted a full ovary from a volunteer, allowing her infertile twin sister to give birth to a healthy baby girl on November 11, 2008.//////Brittle bones are a known consequence of alcoholism, and now new findings suggest that even young men are at risk of developing low bone mass. Surprisingly, a similar risk was not seen in their female counterparts.//////Regionally it seems that everyone expects a lot from President-Elect Barak Obama, mainly in terms of changing the strategic environment in favor of each party. What Israel wants from Obama is to continue his verbal commitment to the security of the state made during his campaign. Israel also expects to get the same political, strategic and financial support of the US for its policy. Israel's main concerns are that due to domestic economic reasons, the US might reduce its financial, security and civilian aid in the amount of 3 billion US dollars. Israel also wants the US to continue with its agenda of containing Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah. If Obama continues that policy, Israel will continue its policy as well.//////There is a new hope and expectation that US-Russia relations that plummeted during the Bush administration will be improved. The US Secretary of State Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who earned a Ph-D on her study on Communist Russia, could not shed the Cold War mentality and as a result the Bush administration provoked Russia at every possible opportunity. //////Ninety-three countries have signed a landmark treaty banning cluster bombs, seen as one of the biggest international humanitarian agreements clinched in the past decade, host country Norway said December 4.//////Nato's biggest nations reached an agreement Dec. 2 that would allow the alliance to deepen cooperation with Georgia and Ukraine, without prejudice to the way they would eventually join the alliance.//////The sri lanka army recaptured Pooneryn on 15 november, after the northern coastal village had for years been a staging area for artillery attacks on the government held Jaffna peninsula by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).//////Both men were obsessed with ambitions of coming by power and using it to the full. Both were arrogant and looked down on the world around them in huge disdain. And both, in the end, were recipients of less than admiration in the world of geopolitics. That is the core message which springs from Robert Dallek's analysis of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in ////// If there are people who still think Nixon and Kissinger were meant for each other, in that political sense of the meaning, they must brace themselves for some very hard truths. One of those truths is the degree of dislike the 37th President of the United States had for his secretary of state-cum-national security advisor. And Kissinger returned the favour in equal measure.//////Everything that happened in August 2007 at Dhaka University, and around it, promises to remain a dark chapter in the history of this country. Of course, the university has seen some terribly bad, difficult days in the past. Take the 1960s, when the Ayub-Monem regime unleashed the corruption that would in subsequent times give student politics a bad name. The National Students Federation, with the support and encouragement of the Pakistani establishment, went cheerfully into the business of clubbing anyone and everyone promoting or upholding the Bengali secular democratic cause into silence. And then there was the scandal of the Hamoodur Rahman Commission report on education. Finally, in the last phase of the Pakistan state in these parts, the frenzy with which Pakistan's soldiers went into murdering teachers and students alike at Dhaka University in 1971 remains a blot on civilization.//////The formation of the Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh on April 17, 1971 remains a pivotal event in the history of this country. By and large known as the Mujibnagar government, it sketched the bare outlines of a nascent war of national liberation; and as the months wore on, those outlines were to be fleshed out in finer detail, to a point where the international community steadily began to acknowledge the gravity of the Bengali struggle.//////The work emerged from Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy quite a while ago. Art aficionados have enjoyed Murtaja Baseer's painting from 1950 and all the way up to 2003. Baseer's major specialty is painting and drawing and it is this inclination which has helped him to hold his position in the forefront of the Bangladeshi art scene. But his profound grasp and expression regarding other mediums are equally praiseworthy. He is exceedingly fond of experimenting and trying out new forms and techniques. To search for fresh themes and present them with a novel approach is one of his characteristics. //////
