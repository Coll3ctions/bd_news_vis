The emphasis is on the needful to overpower the descendants of the local collaborators and quislings who once killed and helped to kill three million Bangalees in 1971. The reality on ground is that those descendants, more appropriately the new generation of collaborating bigots, displayed their ugly fangs as early as 1980's when they started the process of cutting off veins and slicing away tendons of those they considered their enemies.//////Last Friday, Xi Jinping marked his first 100 days in power as China's supremo since taking over the Communist Party's top positions in November 15 last year.//////The spectre of militancy with an overtone of religious extremism has again raised its head in some areas of Bangladesh. Reports published in the national dailies indicate that so-called Islamist militants under the aegis of Jamaat-e-Islami party have resorted to unprecedented violence in different parts of Bangladesh to foil the war crimes trial, although the issue does not relate to their present party set up and future course of action. The so-called Islamist parties are propagating jihad through distributing books and leaflets among gullible villagers and school and madrasa students. The reign of terror let loose by radical cadres magnified a terrifying truth: men driven by extremist ideas and actions seem to be out to set the civil society on fire. They are guilty of redefining the concept of Islam which ideologically stands for non-violence and love for all. Prophet Muhammad (SM) had to fight a deadly war in order to survive but as soon as he felt his people were safe, he devoted his attention to building a peaceful coalition of tribes and achieved victory by an ingenious and inspiring campaign of non-violence. These radical scholars of Islamic theocracy must not lose sight of Prophet Muhammad's (SM) example of moderation and tolerance in talking about the treaty of "Hudaibia." The significant part of the treaty that impresses us all regardless of religious conviction is the Prophet's (SM) great magnanimity, tolerance and self-restraint. Article (4) of the treaty reads: Prophet of Islam and his party were not to enter Mecca that year, but they could enter unarmed the following year. Prophet Muhammad (SM) went back to Medina that year. This underscores that Islam, since the days of Prophet Muhammad (SM), has demonstrated tolerance in the face of severest of provocations. But these days some extremist groups and fanatics masquerading as devout Muslims are brandishing weapons and resorting to violence and hate campaigns. More so, some fanatic groups in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world are eager to profit from a surge of sympathy by invoking the slogan, "Islam is in danger." But let it be made explicitly clear to these protagonists of religion that never was Islam in danger, and never will be. What is beyond doubt is that religious extremism has very little to do with theology and is a purely political tool. Jamaat-e-Islami party with many outfits has possibly spawned groups like Hizbut Tauhid, Hijbut Tahrir, etc. with the intention of imposing their writ on the state by violent means. As it appears, the ideology of terror is being disseminated, acts of terror are being planned and efforts are made to carry them out. Their leaflets and books contain articles and messages that run counter to the state law and the constitution of the country.//////The government of Bangladesh has reached an agreement with Russia to build the country's first ever nuclear power plant (NPP) in Rooppur, Pabna. Given the momentous nature of the venture, this commentary lays out some major issues to facilitate and inspire public debates on the matter. //////Why have you come here today? asked a young woman at Shahbagh. What do you think of it all," she added. I replied, "I came to absorb the atmosphere here and I think that this is an important part of the history of Bangladesh." //////Renewable energy is now a burning issue in both developed and developing countries vis-a-vis energy security, climate change and emission mitigation as well as sustainable development. Energy demand and environmental concerns have significantly constrained sustainable development. Biofuels in particular, as an energy source have attracted great attention in the USA, European countries, China, Japan and even India for significant advantages over fossil diesel as biofuel consumption generates less environmental pollutants such as SOx and NOx and mitigates CO2 emission. Bangladesh, however, has been detached from this issue till recent times.//////Highly polluting brickfields are still operating unabated across the country including on the outskirts of Dhaka posing serious health risks in this dry season, harming the nature and damaging arable land. Most of these conventional chimneys are baking bricks round the clock burning wood, tyres and low-quality coal. Replacing the chimneys with improved modern ones can relieve the situation to a considerable extent. But this issue has never been taken seriously by any government in the past two decades of rapid urbanisation. //////It is that time of year when this city has a pleasant ambiance with winter's cool touch, marigold's vibrant colours, bhapa peetha's sweet flavor, ideas of planning a vacation perhaps, all that gives a sense of recreation to the city dweller's mind. It's mostly school holidays, parents are not running around taking their children to schools or any tuition for that matter. Just a little break for catching their breath seems like a very well sought after time once in a year. It is also a time to pause in the madness of maneuvering, from domestic political activity to world trade matters. Even mother nature also stays calm --- flood, storm, heat --- everything puts up an untold hold as if just to invite me to embrace my long lost love. With such a gentle cool breeze in the dry seasons that brings a bit of dust which all can do without, makes very little difference in indulging in a nice livelihood. Victory Day, New Years Day celebrations and various cultural and sporting programs stretch to the preparations for the Ekushey Boi Mela, a season of festivity that includes everyone unconstrained by any chauvinism. The chants and chimes call upon me to come home. And I can't stay away but fly in to look for my long lost treasure.//////The most heartening aspect of the just-concluded Jaipur Literature festival was, perhaps, the surging crowds there. And it included not just the well-heeled literati from Delhi and even far off Mumbai but also ordinary folks from the Pink City and beyond. The JLF has now become an intrinsic part of Jaipur's cultural fabric, perhaps the city's most awaited annual event. The crowds testified to that and so did the massive police bandobast. And what's an event without its share of controversy? If last year it was Salman Rushdie this year's man of the festival was our very own Bangali Ashish Nandy. When I saw him rush past I had no clue he was just returning from a police station! It was only later that my local friend from Jaipur informed me that he was all over the news for his 'anti-dalit' comment.//////A discussion on Unfettered, the English translation of Kazi Nazrul Islam's Bandhonhara, was held at Indira Gandhi Cultural Center on 16 February.

Starting from Tunisia, the uprising animated the polities of Egypt, Syria, Libya, Bahrain, Yemen and Algeria. The protests were border-transcending, tech savvy youth-centric, non-violent and often, leaderless. The regimes were caught by surprise by the enthusiastic participation of people from all segments of society. The tide of protests that swept through the Middle East and North Africa highlighted the discrete role of new media, or internet based social networks and new Information Communication Technologies. //////In 1971, many deaths were violent and heart rendering. Pakistan Army and their collaborators employed many techniques for annihilation and elimination of the people of this country. They adopted new ideas for killing, starting from guns and bullets to primitive methods. Those were episodes of men's inhumanity to men. The people involved in the genocide were savage animals in human form. Sanctity of human lives were violated in extreme ways. Many victims faced those violent times with courage, fortitude and in the process perished. Each incident is a tale of pain and sorrow. Such an episode of extreme cruelty took place in the northern town of Thakurgaon. //////(In this first segment of a two-part article, the writer reflects briefly on some books that have had a seminal influence on the shaping of the modern Bengali mind, here in Bangladesh)//////Kazi Anis Ahmed's debut book, //////, is a collection of short stories, Chameli, The Poetry Audition, Losing Ayesha, The Happiest Day of His Life, Good Night, Mr. Kissinger, The Year of Return, Ramkamal's Gift, Elephant Road and All My Enemies.
