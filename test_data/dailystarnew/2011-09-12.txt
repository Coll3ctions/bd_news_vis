While it is understandable that donations of kidneys to save the lives of those whose own kidneys have deteriorated is accepted practice, it is beyond comprehension how organized groups can tempt vulnerable people into selling such an important organ in the body. What makes matters worse is the new discovery that in certain instances, it is not only kidneys that people are divested of but also portions of the liver. Obviously, with little guarantee that these poor who sell these organs will receive proper post-operative care, the question of how the authorities mean to handle the issue comes up.//////Facing two-match points against a beloved player whose name is already in the history books, Novak Djokovic clenched his jaw, nodded his head and flashed an ever-so-slight glimpse of a smile.//////Three-time champion Serena Williams stormed past world number one Carolie Wozniacki on Saturday to set up a showdown with Samantha Stosur in what promises to be an emotional US Open women's final.//////West Indies will arrive on October 4 for a month-long tour.

This was perhaps the most amazing match ever held in Bangabandhu National Stadium. Never in the history of Bangladesh a football team of this stature (Argentina) visited Bangladesh and played such a magnificent friendly match. It is surely an experience of a lifetime for all the 24,000 spectators who watched the match live. No words can describe their feelings.//////With all the soul searching and looking for answers that is going on now in the political field and in the media, one sees no dearth of self-proclaimed experts. We cannot comment on Indian government's management of affairs, but our government kept all the dealings close to the chest and built up quite a hype on the visit and raised the expectations to great heights. I cannot find fault with the stand of CM of Pashchim Banga - as she, like any leader, is unwilling to yield an inch. The visit and failure of Indian PM to deliver showed how the centre is being undercut by Mamata Bannerjee and Anna Hazare. The current government must be congratulated for not going, as a diplomatic snub, for the transit deal during this visit given that our basic infrastructure is in a dilapidated condition. However, what needs to be done now is to bring these matters of Teesta, Tipaimukh, and Farakka dams for international mediation rather than bilateral discussions, as India insists. It took almost 40 years to get a 'closure' on enclave and therefore we must bring up the matters of rightful share of waters before international forums.//////Employees are more productive when they are satisfied and salary is the most important thing to most employees. But it will be a mistake to presume that higher salary alone will create higher job satisfaction and increase productivity. A complex set of financial and non-financial benefits along with many work-related factors determine the level of satisfaction and loyalty. If the employees are not motivated to serve the clients with the best products or service, the company can't grow or survive in this competitive world. In Japanese management system, companies offer benefit packages to earn lifetime commitment and often employees work for the same company for generations. Employees serve the companies and in return get various economic and non-economic benefits. Salary and other financial benefits are important determinants of employee satisfaction. Besides financial benefits, status, position and recognition are important. Bangladeshi companies should also consider this.//////Bangladesh should thank Mamata Banerjee for her stingy attitude towards Bangladesh because if it were not for her objection to Teesta water sharing agreement that she thought to be advantageous to Bangladesh, our government would have signed the dangerous transit agreement. Those who show childish alacrity for transit should read this statement that Jawaharlal Nehru made in response to the then Pakistan's request for road transit through India for easy communication between the two branches of Pakistan: It is a strange demand from a peculiar country. A passage to go to their country through a foreign country. It is unprecedented. Have India given us only 'Teen Bigha,' though we gave them a huge area of Berubari far back in 1974 to get that small strip of land? India grudged us only 16 miles road transit to Nepal but wants 600 miles transit from Bangladesh in the name of connectivity. Why blame them? Are not some of our intellectuals and ministers dancing to Indian schemer's tune? Can anybody harm us without our consent? //////On the 3rd July, my wife and I embarked on a 6-week trip to celebrate our only son's marriage in Dehra Dun, India and hold reception in Mombasa, Kenya. To defray the expenses, we carried our full entitlement of $ 10,000. Standard Chartered Bank and as per Bangladesh Bank instructions issued TCs ($5,400) and rest in cash.//////Every government in the world has some successes and some failures. No government succeeds in fulfilling 100 per cent of its election pledges. Even President of USA Barack Obama is facing congressional oppositions because he could not deliver up to his election pledges. Bangladesh's present government of Sheikh Hasina also has many successes and failures. I believe many of her failures are due to the corrupt and inefficient administration. But if one reads Bangladeshi newspapers, watches private TV channels and listens to talks shows where civil society members discuss various issues, one will lose all hopes. The talk show participants see only failures and mismanagement. I suggest that they should review their past deeds. The members of civil society have the responsibility to raise hope in the people's minds and not create panic. All efforts of this government are not bad; there are some good work also, which should be told to the people.//////The anarchy at Gabtoli, where road transport workers kidnapped a magistrate and compelled him to release those punishable under law, was totally unacceptable. It has now become a matter of utmost importance that the government gives a signal that it is still able to maintain the law and order in the country. By taking action against the guilty the shipping minister will be able to show that he respects the rule of law. This will show that no errant bus driver or any transport worker can do whatever they want. This will win the honourable minister much respect and bring the necessary discipline in the road transport sector. //////On 30th August 2011, a horrific news was published in The Daily Star entitled "3 arrested for 'trade in kidney'."
