Since the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, certain moves by the government of President Mahinda Rajapakse have given rise to concerns in the international community about whether the administration is really building a structure of peace. The government has won the war. When it vanquished Velupillai Prabhakaran and his LTTE, it was expected that it would move fast and decisively to build a society based on reconciliation between the majority Sinhala and the minority Tamils. That clearly has not happened. As many as 280,000 Tamils, all of them inhabiting areas earlier controlled by the Tamil Tigers, have remained in camps or behind barbed wire in unhygienic, threadbare conditions. All questions of the human rights they are entitled to have been brusquely rejected by the Colombo authorities.//////PROTECTION of the citizens is a basic function of the government. The main task of the law enforcers is, therefore, to maintain law and order so that the citizens of the state may live in peace. So, it is hardly surprising that the lawmen are forever after the criminals and various other types of anti-social elements and not the peaceful citizens. Or at least, that should ideally be the role of the law-enforcing agencies in a modern state.//////DOUBTS can be expressed that Bangladesh has been freed from the scourge of religious extremism. The execution of Bangla Bhai and a few others, and the banning of Laskare-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad etc. has not deterred the terrorists from using Bangladesh as a transit point for terrorists fleeing Indian authorities and, additionally, training recruits for al-Qaeda offshoots for terrorism in the country and beyond. //////AS was once noted by a garrulous, if not very innovative, politician, India has, just now, a Hindu president, a Muslim vice-president, a Sikh prime minister and a Christian president of the ruling Indian National Congress.

The dollar hovered close to its lowest in almost a year against a basket of major currencies on Thursday as firmer share and commodity prices undermined flows into the lower-yielding US currency. Investors booked gains in the Australian and New Zealand dollars, driving them down from this week's one-year highs but the dollar still looked fragile as benchmark world stocks hit a fresh 11-month high. The dollar has suffered as investors bet on economic recovery through commodity-linked and higher-yielding currencies but some in the market said the risk rally was starting to look stretched which could see a rebound in the greenback.

The neighbours took him to Kawkhali upazila health complex at about 3 am. He is now undergoing treatment there.//////The recent demand of BGMEA seems very illogical and unethical to me. I am not a businessman, nor an expert on the economy. But the way the demands have been put forward to the govt. is ill motivated. We've noticed how the finance minister talked to this largest business community time and again to mitigate their sufferings due to economic recession all over the world. We've also come to know from the media and other different sources that the garment industry is not doing so bad as it was feared by many. Once we were alarmed at the news that lots of girls would be unemployed. Thank God, that has not happened yet. The present govt. is undoubtedly considerate to the demands of the garment owners. The govt. has initiated a programme of allotting rice to the garment workers. There is also a plan to form a special force for law and order in this sector. A special fund has been kept in the budget to support this sector. All these prove the good intention of this govt. But this sudden demand to allot Tk 3,000 crore to pay Eid bonus and salary to garment workers is illogical. I'll live comfortably in a luxurious house having a luxury car and I'll not pay monthly dues to the workers! This can not be the ethics of this largest foreign currency earning business sector. We've heard that a German buyer has stopped buying garments from Bangladesh due to a report about atrocities on female workers. This is not at all acceptable. There are many painful stories related to harassment in the factories. Your newspaper has carried out a lot of stories about what is happening in this sector. I remember once you printed picture of bare footed girls going to have food during break. //////The National Education Policy Formulation Committee has submitted the final report on the education policy. The committee Chairman National Professor Kabir Chowdhury and Co-chairman Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad submitted the report to the education minister at around 12:00 noon at the secretariat on 2 September.//////All, who took shelter under the ensign of Islam, are to carry out several specified religious duties assigned to them by the religion. Zakat, which denotes one of those religious duties, is a matter of great importance. It is the third pillar of Islam. In accordance with the teachings of Islam, the word Zakat stands for the regular and mandatory charity, which is given in Allah's name to the poor and the needy by an organized Muslim community. //////A very interesting report on the matter, was published on 29th. August, in a local English daily about the matter of high medical costs in USA. It stated, and I quote: "Get doctors to quit ordering unnecessary procedures and tests"! This was based on an article from the US Business//////A beautiful and thought provoking letter written by Mr. Sikandar Ahmed has humorously delineated the reality on the ground for the useless expenditures of our police forces (DMP's High Tech Toy: September 2, 2009). Lot of public money is mindlessly misused while we could have provided that huge money for some other important purposes. While the police force is decrying the shortage of their transports, their officers are enjoying the most luxurious and expensive Jeeps. Have a look at the SPs of the district level who are merely a Senior Assistant Secretary level civil servant. They all are riding latest and most expensive Pajero Jeeps. The DIGs are Deputy Secretary level officers. They are enjoying the 4200 CC Nissan or Jeeps of other makes, which are very much dissimilar to other field level officers. //////University of Dhaka is the best educational institution here. //////Recently Bangladesh has decided to join with the Asian Highway system. The network of Asian Highway, known as the Great Asian Highway is a set-up of 141,000 km of standardized road ways crossing 32 Asian countries. The Ministry of Communications of Bangladesh has finalized three proposed routes crossing Bangladesh. These are AH1, AH2 & AH41. The 495 km AH1 from India would go through Benapole Jessore Dhaka Sylhet Tamabil. The 805 km AH2 from India would join Hati Kumrul Dhaka Kachpur Sylhet Tamabil. The 752 km AH41, also from India, will link Mongla Jessore Hati kumrul Dhaka Kachpur Chittagong Cox's Bazar Teknaf with Myanmar. The international sea ports, Chittagong & Mongla, will be connected to AH1 & AH2 by AH4, so that the ports can serve the regional needs if required. It is expected that the sophisticated highway system would ensure greater trade & social exchange between Asian countries. The AH will open up huge economic opportunities through providing shorter routes for movement of goods & passengers leading to huge savings in transport costs. However, it would be native to think that the AH would bring huge turnover for our country, rather it can be ominous, if we fail to make right decisions & choose right routes in the highway system. It is like allowing transit and corridor in the name of Asian Highway.//////MPs are elected for discharging certain duties in parliament. Endless boycotts affect such duties. Hence, there should be a limit to boycotting parliament. While boycotting parliament MPs should refrain from getting benefits from it. //////Words fail to condemn the brutal, unprovoked police action against the peaceful demonstrators protesting the government's decision to award three offshore blocks to international oil companies allowing them to export up to 80 per cent of gas which will surely harm our interest. From the very inception of this government, such incidents are happening one after another. After the BDR incident, the government blindly sought India's expertise to reconstitute BDR, and then came the decision of withdrawing army from the Chittagong Hill Tracts.//////Nowadays people are attracted by the charms of Dhaka city life. Because in this city there are many sources of earning. //////Load-shedding has always been part of our life. The situation does not change much even during the month of Ramadan.

Moreover, they don't have the equipment and expertise to perform such a major operation. Our mothers and sisters are in great distress because of the situation in which they find themselves and we submit our nearest and dearest ones to those so called doctors and try to relieve our anxiety. //////It seems many of us do not know how to maintain the sanctity of a mosque through behaving in a dignified way.//////The leading news media in the world BBC made the joke by this news headline "One giant slip in Bangladesh news". It is because two popular newspapers of Bangladesh slipped their sense of journalism by publishing news claiming the first successful human mission on Moon was a drama. A website named www.theonion.com, which is a fake news website indeed, published the news that the Moon mission was fake. If anyone searches the Internet with the word 'onion', the result comes at the top of the page from the famous Wikipedia as "The Onion is an American fake news organization." But the dailies didn't check the truth behind the news and just copied it without further justification. Later they apologized for this. We say our newspapers and journalism are independent and responsible, but this sort of activities not only harms the reputation of the media but also the image of the whole country. Newspapers and journalists should be aware of these issues and must publish news with proper justification.//////Some days ago it was reported that some Chhatra League and Jubo League activists prevented contractors from submitting tenders at the food department. They even beat up genuine contractors to drive them away! //////It was interesting to watch on TV channel the parliament debate on the war of liberation. I must thank Mohiuddin Khan Badal MP for his role in setting right the record of history and proceedings of the day. In this regard I have nothing to add except to repeat the famous saying of the former Secretary of State of the USA Mr Casper Weinberger. He said, "War is too serious a thing that can be left to the general". I think the message is clear and unambiguous. The minister for "Mukti Juddha " ministry might have felt embarrassed for his unclear presentation which had generated the debate. Thanks to him for realizing how the war of liberation of 1971 is defined by history. The role of the army has never been underestimated and will never be undermined, but give them due credit not above the political force, the principal source for mobilization, sustenance and ultimate win in record time. The army is inclusive and not a separate entity of a nation. //////Kudos are deserved by the diplomat's wife for her caustic but true comments (DS 09-09-09) on the letter from Mr. Shabbir Bashar. //////The news item in Bangladesh media regarding Prime Minister Hasina's visit to Geneva has drawn my attention. She was in Switzerland with a 44-member Bangladesh delegation to attend a conference on climate. Very nice, but why she needs to have such a huge delegation for such a conference is a question Bangladesh people need to ask. And who were the members of this delegation? What are their credentials as climate experts? //////Many big shopping malls have sprung up in Dhaka with modern facilities like lifts, escalators, food court etc that are places of necessities and attraction particularly for women shoppers. But there are no good facilities like restrooms for lactating mothers. With increasing health consciousness and there is no substitute nutrient to mother's milk for infants, these days most of the babies from new born up to about 2 years are fed on mother's milk. In western countries big shopping malls have places for feeding mothers. //////Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki renewed yesterday Iran's readiness for negotiations over its nuclear proposals but made no direct response to calls from the major powers for urgent talks.//////Incumbent President Hamid Karzai held a firm lead in controversial Afghan elections, taking 54.3 percent of the vote, according to partial results announced yesterday.//////Speakers at a roundtable yesterday underscored the need for developing the railway communication system to ease traffic congestion.//////Riot police arrested 10 people Friday as they intervened to quell clashes between Muslims and anti-Islamic protesters outside a London mosque on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.//////Border Security Force (BSF) troopers fired from machine-guns into Pakistan after rockets were fired into Indian territory in the Amritsar sector from across the border Friday night.//////Pakistan is looking to rake up the Kashmir issue at the United Nations General Assembly, which is scheduled to be held later this month.//////Following the confirmation of the arrest of five of its important Shura members including the spokesperson Muslim Khan, Swat Taliban chief Maulana Fazlullah has admitted that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has been weakened in the region.//////Amid rising tensions with neighbouring Colombia, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced late Friday that his country would soon take delivery of Russian-made missiles with a range of 300km. //////The Discovery astronauts found sunny skies in California on Friday as they descended to a weather-delayed landing at Edwards Air Force Base to end a demanding two-week mission to the International Space Station.//////A massive car bomb exploded close to a major army base and the Iraqi health ministry in Baghdad killing at least three people and wounding dozens on Saturday, security and health officials told AFP.//////Flooding and landslides triggered by a tropical storm killed 11 people and displaced over 360,000 in five provinces in the Philippines, the government said yesterday.//////Former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf said Friday he has not decided whether he will return to his homeland to face trial over his 2007 detention of judges as he attempted to cling to power.//////The United Nations has strongly warned Sri Lanka that the world body cannot continue funding indefinitely the huge refugee camps in the north of the country, and asked the authorities to allow the hundreds of Tamil civilians to leave.//////Opposition parties are calling for central rule in Manipur, saying the situation in the state is alarming and accusing both state and non-state actors of unleashing terror.//////Cassava - the staple of 750 million impoverished people in Africa, Asia and Latin America - is turning more toxic with much smaller yields, thanks to global warming and carbon levels.//////In yet another evidence of Pakistan's flip-flops, Islamabad, for the first time has admitted that it has not handed any dossier regarding Baluch insurgency to India.//////Known nationwide as 'Baul Samrat,' mystic bard Shah Abdul Karim died of age related ailments at a Sylhet hospital yesterday morning.
