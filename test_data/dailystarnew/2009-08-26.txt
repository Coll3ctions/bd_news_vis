The Muslims fast from dawn to dusk to please Allah the Merciful, and to obey his commands. But Islam does not ask children, sick persons and very old people to fast. Moreover, the musafir who travels very long distances may also not fast. Fasting basically is an ancient form of prayer recognised by all previous religions. But Islam introduced a new vision, a new spirit into the fasting system. For the first time in history, fasting was blessed with a systematic regulation, a scientific method, a noble justification. In the days before the holy prophet (Pbuh) of Islam fasting meant privation in the hours of mourning and sorrow. //////Bangladesh has the highest frequency of acid violence.

He led our nation to victory during the liberation war in 1971. A war that claimed many lives in apocalyptical proportions. It was a war that left the world silenced by the brutal atrocities committed by the Pakistani military. It was also a war that gave birth to a nation under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The nation was called Bangladesh.//////Bangladesh is a country in which trial and error approach is widely used in designing and implementing policies. It is true in case of national economic plans or even educational policies. Our political governments are likely to materialize their own political agenda while they are in power. That's why we observe the frequent change of national policies with handing over of power from one party to another. Political parties may argue for changing national policies with the logic that the landscape of modern world is frequently changing. So they have to develop new policies and strategies to meet the challenge of the twenty-first century. We do accept their logic in this regard. But, we observe, in case of Bangladesh, that our political governments are introducing new policies without making any comprehensive cost-benefit analysis.//////On 6 August, 2009 Ekattorer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee of UK in a round table conference opined that people with vested interests have raised the issue of "Resisting Tipaimukh Dam" with the ill motive of foiling the Bangladesh government's programme for trying the war-criminals of 1971. I fully endorse their opinion.//////True, with a view to ending all hostilities and to establishing lasting peace, the present government has decided to withdraw army camps from the districts of the CHT region. A good step indeed! But there remain some questions - whether the indigenous people are fully prepared to enjoy a non-military but civilian control. Have all the anti-state elements living in and around surrendered to the law enforcing authorities with a pledge to living peacefully as bona fide citizens of Bangladesh without getting involved in any subversive activity? //////My attention has been drawn to the news on the above subject published in your daily on August 16.//////The first question that I want to ask is, how much do we know about global warming and how much conscious we are about this. According to the report from experts, one-third of Bangladesh will be under water within 50 years. Already we are suffering from over population and the seasonal floods that we experience every year. The reason for all this destruction is global warming. The only way to stop global warming is to plant trees. Trees are also called producers in scientific terms because plants are the only living thing that make their own food and also provide others with foods. //////Those who know the ancient Indian history are definitely aware of the famous Indian king- Raja Bikramadditya.
