Among the dead were the prominent AL politician Ivy Rahman. It was a tragedy which left the nation in a state of the deepest shock. It was expected that the government of the day, led by the BNP, would move swiftly and professionally to unmask those responsible for the grenade blasts. Unfortunately, nothing of the sort was done. What was done, as was clear at the time, was a despicable attempt to cover up the whole conspiracy through measures that left no one convinced the government was sincere in its actions.//////We are alarmed at the news item that scientists have discovered high concentration of toxic chemicals like cadmium, lead and chromium in fertilisers that are being used by our farmers for better yield of agricultural produce.

Productivity is suffering, as workers with once-short commuting distances now make glacial progress in gridlocked daytime traffic that averages barely five miles an hour. Crowded into dilapidated, steamy, fume-belching private buses, they arrive to work tired, perspiring, short of breath and tainted by dust. Those with cars inch along, tapping their horns their cell phone out and A/C blasting, getting atrocious fuel efficiency.

The dollar edged up against the yen on Thursday with investors reluctant to chase the yen higher as they waited to see if the Bank of Japan or the government will take new steps to rein in the yen's rise. Earlier, rumours had circulated in the market that the BOJ would hold an emergency policy meeting at 2 p.m. That followed a media report that the central bank had started considering additional monetary easing steps. The dollar briefly pared its gains against the yen after sources familiar with the matter said the Bank of Japan is highly unlikely to hold an emergency meeting on Thursday. But the dollar remained firm against the yen due to short-covering, traders said. Investors are watching to see if the Japanese central bank or the government will take new steps to rein in the yen's export-sapping rise ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected next Monday. The Sankei newspaper said on Thursday that the BOJ has started considering additional monetary easing steps in line with government efforts to support the country's economy. The most likely option under consideration is expanding the BOJ's fund-supply tool put in place in December, the Sankei said without citing sources. //////Bangladesh will face severe water crisis within next couple of decades due to random contamination of surface and ground water, absence of comprehensive water sharing with neighbouring countries and mismanagement in preserving rain water. //////None of the accused in the killing of police constable Manjurul Islam is yet to be arrested, said police.//////At least seven people were killed and 40 others injured in separate road accidents in Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gopalganj and Dinajpur yesterday.//////Rival groups of ruling Awami League clashed over collection of tolls from river vessels at Sreepur Bazar in Tahirpur upazila yesterday afternoon, leaving 30 people injured.//////Terming the month of August a period of 'sorrow and pain' in the country's history, speakers at a roundtable yesterday said there was a certain link between the August 15, 1975 and August 21, 2005 carnage aimed to undermine the forces that had brought the nation independence in 1971.//////Bangladesh Upazila Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen Oikya Parishad yesterday blamed the Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNOs) for non-cooperation in upazila activities.//////Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid yesterday said the perpetrators of the August 21 grenade attack on the Awami League rally will face the trial as soon as possible as the nation is eargerly waiting for it. //////Hundreds of students of Dhaka University's business faculty demonstrated yesterday demanding a new grading system formulated by the University Grants Commission (UGC).//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Awami League and its different wings and victims of the August 21 grenade attack pay respect to the dead in the incident placing wreaths at a memorial at Bangabandhu Avenue in the city yesterday.

Although water has been identified on several planets, none has as much water as Earth, of which 70 percent is covered with water. Approximately 97.4 percent of the water on Earth is found in oceans and is too salty for human consumption. An additional 2.6 percent is freshwater found in underground bodies of water called aquifers or frozen in glaciers or polar ice caps. Less than 0.02 percent of Earth's water is present in lakes, rivers, or the atmosphere. The water itself provides the environment for fish, plants and animals. There are several sources of water pollution which work together to reduce overall river water quality. Industries and agriculture discharge liquid waste products. Rain as it falls through the air, or drains from urban areas and farmland, absorb contaminants.//////Blessed are those who have once again been granted the advantage of observing the holy month of Ramadan.//////Bengalees are famous for their hospitality. Hospitality is the indicator of aristocracy and nobility. Betel leaf is part of that hospitality. In some cases, without this attachment the satisfaction of consumption often remains incomplete. Moreover, people also entertain the guests only with 'khili paan' which is known as 'entertaining in brief' in rural areas. Not only in the rural areas but also after the ending of sumptuous session in urban areas the application of betel leaf is worth mentioning. The enthusiasts of betel leaf use not only the traditional betel nut but also many spicy ingredients in taking betel leaf. //////The government hurriedly enacted the Detailed Area Plan for greater Dhaka City; when already considerable damage had been inflicted on the environmental conditions. Billions of taka had already been invested by the land and building developers over the decades. Thus the market condition has been changed; and there would be a migratory tendency from the affected areas; and the pricing conditions would mark sharp rise and fall.//////The prime minister as head of the government seems to retain the exclusive right or absolute power to choose her cabinet colleagues and the state ministers to run the state, of course in a better, if not best, way and so did our PM Sheikh Hasina. She inducted new faces, and there was not an iota of doubt about her sincerity that her first and foremost concern was how the well being of the people through good governance could be ensured. But it was and is still generally believed that the novices who had never walked down near the corridor of ministerial realm and were even unaware of the A B Cs of ministerial stints could hardly be able to steer the nation, bursting with sea of problems, to fulfil Sheikh Hasina's 'great expectation'. The old guards of her party have been left out in the cold for, people guess, Sheikh Hasina while behind the bar, smelt a rat in the activities of the party stalwarts that were purported to be the machinations to minus her. It is true they had caved in to the invisible threats, but they are still obsequiously loyal to her and depriving them of cabinet berth was not a good omen as observed by the countrymen. Political acumen and experience with sagacity and maturity and above all wit and diplomacy with eloquence are the prerequisites for one to hold the reins of the statecraft. The persons chosen to head our Home and Foreign Affairs direly lack the above and their performance as of today in no way goes to give them any kudos. Law and order remains as worse as ever. //////When we're kids we make a lot of friends whether they are friends at parties or school friends, but we all make friends. This is a lot easier when we are young. As we get older this is harder. But we still make friends! //////White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was defending the Obama administration's record and his comments on the so-called professional left. On a range of issues including accountability for torture, detention of terrorism suspects, and use of lethal force against civilians, there is a very real danger that the Obama administration will enshrine permanently within the law policies and practices that were widely considered extreme and unlawful during the Bush administration. And, in fact, in some cases, you see this administration going even further than the last administration did. Some of what was going on under the last administration was going on in spite of federal law that prohibited it. That was true, for example, with the warrant-less wiretapping programme. And then Congress authorized the warrant-less wiretapping that President Bush had authorized in violation of statute. So now you have a statute that authorizes precisely what President Bush was doing illegally between 2001 and 2006. But what we had hoped was that the constitutionality of that statute would be tested in the courts. //////There was a Paradise where Adam and Eve were living in peace and harmony. There was abundance and plenty of everything, there was no scarcity, water was as good as pure honey, air was pristine, no poisonous chemicals in food, people could sleep at night with their doors open, children had vast open fields to play games after school and so on. //////One of the major indicators of development or industrialization of any nation is the level of her per capita commercial energy use. The three most important commercial energy used in present world are natural gas, oil and coal. Natural gas is Bangladesh's only significant source of commercial energy, with 2002 production of 384.9 billion cubic feet (bcf). Bangladeshi natural gas production began in 1960 from the Chattak field. There is much uncertainty and debate about the level of natural gas reserves in Bangladesh. Estimates from Petrobangla put net proven reserves at 15.3 tcf as of mid-2004. The US Geological Survey has estimated that Bangladesh contains an additional 32.1 tcf in additional "undiscovered reserves.//////The disadvantage of being one of the LDCs is that no one cares if you exist or not. During COP (Conference of Parties) 15 that took place in Copenhagen last year, the following was supposed to happen: 1) Developed countries would take responsibility for their actions and compensate accordingly. 2) The Most Vulnerable Countries (MVCs) would get enough financial and technical support to enhance and develop their adaptation processes, 3) A legally binding accord would be created which would limit the carbon emission amount for the developed countries and the G77+China group, 4) The accord would also ensure that the MVCs would get continuous support in the future to battle the climate change impacts. Unfortunately, we all know what really happened, very disappointing indeed but that is the current reality. Bangladesh, for example, is ground zero for a Global Warming induced calamity. Funding is necessary for Bangladesh to tackle the adverse climate change effects; necessary embankment building, infrastructure development, and a lot of researches need to be done. It is forecast that a 1m sea level rise will inundate one third of the land in Bangladesh! The entire Sundarbans will be underwater! If developed countries do not provide these funds, Bangladesh will face frightening consequences. Among the most startling are agricultural devastation, deterioration of health and increasing number of deadly diseases, millions of climate refugees, economic downfall, and even national security issues. Imagine a situation where millions of people lose everything they own and are forced to move towards the cities for a better life. These people are farmers or fishermen; skills which are useless in urban settings. Would these people become beggars or muggers? If even 1% of those millions of helpless people decide to commit crimes, imagine the effects! //////I totally agree with Humayun Hyder that if we use the public transport, it will be better in all respects. But I will also like to remind my brother of the condition of public transport. The condition is so bad that one cannot travel by public transport. Of course, people are economically weak and they need to travel by local bus, yet this does not mean that they will travel like non-humans. Perhaps this is the reason why poor people are affected by air borne diseases and the problem is not just with public transport, the public hospitals are in deteriorating condition as well. But still the solution lies in improving public transport maintaining the security of the passengers and their assets. //////While the BNP has alleged through their senior leader Mr M.K. Anwar, that 1.75 percent interest rate for the $1 billion loan and 20 years repayment period which includes grace period of 5 [five Years] from India is very high, but in reality facts and findings about loans taken by different governments including that of the BNP for projects show that this interest rate is not high but in fact lowest so far taken on these grounds from different governments which includes Japan, China, Korea and even the USA and the UK. I am not going to dissect the deals and the agreements signed but trying to pass my concern that the view that Mr Anwar has expressed is just another of BNPs so called bluff & Anti India stunt on which they do stand & do politics. //////The authorities introduced the system of keeping the factories closed on different days in different areas for electricity load management.
