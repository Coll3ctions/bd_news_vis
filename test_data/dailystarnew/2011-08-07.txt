It is not just that she is the country's first woman prime minister but also that she takes office with so many expectations of her from her supporters. A particular reason why Ms. Yingluck's rise to power is remarkable is that she does not have a history of active politics behind her and that she takes centre stage only five years after her populist sibling Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown by the military. In a country where 18 coups and attempted coups have undermined democracy since 1932, the new prime minister cannot but tread carefully.//////Young goalkeeper Shahedul Alam Sohel repeated his semifinal heroics to save two shots from the spot to guide Abahani to a 3-2 tie-break win and the crore taka Grameenphone Super Cup triumph at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday. The regulation time of the marquee final against archrivals Mohammedan had ended with the score on 2-2, and thirty minutes of extra time failed to yield any result, leading to the shoot-out which was eventually won by the Sky Blues.//////As soon as the final whistle was blown, a few thousand spectators from the western stands came sprawling over the barbed wires and stormed onto the pitch. It was a sweet reprieve for the Sky Blues faithful who had witnessed their bitter rivals Mohammedan seize an early grip on the final. The crore-taka title, which was the only domestic trophy to have eluded the vaunted Sky Blues' cabinet, was grabbed at the second attempt after the 2009 disappointment against Mohammedan. This time, however, it was Abahani's turn to pocket the 1-crore purse while Mohammedan were left licking their wounds with Tk 20 lakh. //////Four late Zimbabwe wickets swung the game into balance after the Tigers' batsmen gave themselves little chance, playing poor shots on the third day of the Test match yesterday.//////Left-arm spinner Sohrawardi Shuvo will leave Dhaka tomorrow morning to join the national team in Zimbabwe. //////From the moment it was certain that Brian Vitori will make his Test debut, the curiousity was about his speed.//////Stuart Law had a long talk with Mohammad Ashraful after the Tigers' highest scorer of the first innings got out to a poorly thought out shot.//////A fleeting ambition of taking a phenomenal 1,000 Test wickets led Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidaran to think about postponing his retirement last year but injury concerns and an ageing body prompted him to drop the idea.//////Asafa Powell, the fastest man in the world this year, withdrew from the London Diamond League meeting just hours before he was due to run in the 100 metres at Crystal Palace on Friday.//////Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson lit the fuse ahead of an explosive Community Shield clash with Manchester City by warning his bitter rivals that even their financial muscle can't guarantee success in the Premier League.//////Defending German champions Borussia Dortmund opened the new season with an impressive 3-1 win over Hamburg on Friday thanks to goals from two of Germany's rising stars.//////Real Madrid thrashed Tianjin Teda 6-0 in a pre-season friendly Saturday as Los Blancos wrapped up their China tour with a display of the skills they will be deploying against Barcelona next week.//////Rahul Dravid on Saturday was recalled to the Indian squad for next month's one-day series against England, while injured Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh were left out.//////Batsman Jonathan Trott has been left out of the England squad for the third Test against India after failing to recover from a shoulder injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Saturday.//////A captain's blitzkrieg from Tillakaratne Dilshan, who hit a maiden Twenty20 century, and a three-wicket spell from pacer Dilruwan Perera resigned Australia to a convincing 35-run defeat in the first Twenty20 against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Stadium.yesterday. //////Former Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldinho is hoping his recent purple patch with Flamengo adds impetus to his bid to resurrect his career with the five-time World Cup winners.//////Paul Scholes was on the scoresheet as he marked his Manchester United farewell with a goal in a 6-0 win over New York Cosmos as the former England midfielder waved goodbye to a packed Old Trafford on Friday.//////The government will constitute a taskforce to tackle three major risks to the economy: a price hike, stress on balance of payments and slow growth in foreign direct investment, said Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday. //////Analysts see no major negative impacts on the Bangladesh economy, as Standard & Poor's has downgraded the United States' AAA rating for the first time ever.//////Internet users in Bangladesh may face difficulty communicating with the rest of the world until August 11, due to submarine cable repairs in Singapore, service providers in Dhaka said yesterday.//////The government has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to take steps to offload shares of listed state enterprises in a couple of weeks in a bid to increase supply to the stockmarket.//////Dhaka stocks declined 4.98 percent last week, triggered by panic sell-offs.

They struck deals with TCB that they would supply essentials during the month of Ramadan and made a back track with their promised deal with the alibi that the prices they had quoted in their bids were much lower than the existing price currently in effect in the market. Eleven importers have signed agreement with the TCB to supply one lakh twelve thousand tons of sugar from which six companies have expressed their inability to supply the sugar. In addition to that, four companies, signed contracts with TCB to supply nineteen thousand six hundred tons of soybean oil, has also conveyed their inability of supplying the oil. They even have told the TCB that it can forfeit their performance guarantee money due to breach in contract. It is learnt from the reliable sources that the importers can yield hefty profits even after the deduction of guarantee money. This shows how prices of essentials are increasing in an unabated manner. Our ministry of commerce seems totally handicapped to either contain or control the prices or these influential importers' syndicate. This is just the two examples of how these importers monopolize the market defying government directives. Though it may sound ludicrous but the bare fact is that who will bell the cat?//////The story carried in The Daily Star not only rekindles the divine spirit in humankind it also inspires the decadent world. //////Government is constructing flyovers at different points of Dhaka city and has restricted movement of rickshaws in some areas for improving the traffic jam. I am doubtful whether this will reduce the traffic jam. Main reasons of traffic jam are: grabbing of footpaths by hawkers, road side parking and evading of traffic rules. //////Ahead of each general election, the major political parties give us the assurance through their manifestos that if voted to power, they will ensure the autonomy of Bangladesh Betar (BB) and Bangladesh Television (BTV). But it is regrettable that all major political parties seem to be oblivious of the issue after they are voted to power.//////Bangladesh political culture could not get out of the bottomless basket even after four decades. Political leaders do not pay much attention to the long-term development of politics remaining busy in subjective politics. The role for the society leaders is to debate the plus and minus points of dynasty politics because the two dynastic parties are not interested in raising this topic. This tendency to live in the past is having a negative and harmful effect on the new emerging young leadership which is not getting all the right inputs for future thinking. The future of this young nation looks bleak. Examples of self-sacrifice are not evident in the mass media. //////The 'Focus Bangla' picture of a cyclone shelter in Kalapara upazila in Patuakhali, published in the pages of a local English daily on 8th July, is on the point of collapse, as it was built with cheap and poor materials. //////The rate in which the public is taking law into their hands gives rise to this fear that time will come when they will lift the cudgel to beat the corrupt officials and politicians. However, public justice is prone to be excess as it is seen in the recent Aminbazar incident. The proverb goes, while the cat's away, the mice will play. In the absence of law and order, criminals rule the roost in every sphere of life. Once unknown uneducated 'Zhantu' becomes unopposed leader and run roughshod over the area with immunity, thanks to party affiliation and police inaction. A chain of corruption and camaraderie complete the circuit and continue to electrocute the public. Incapacitated, thus the public is waiting for brave ones to break the circuit of corruption. Who will be that brave one to usher in a brave new world? //////When gas supply is not available, people solely depend on LP gas (Liquefied Petroleum) for household use. But regardless of the concession in import duty, the price of LP gas is very high. The international market of the raw material of LP gas is quite stable. So what might be the cause for such kind of illogical price hike? The govt. must solve the matter urgently.//////We have heard that Khaleda Zia, the leader of the opposition, was not present in the highest state honour conferring ceremony. President Zillur Rahman handed over the "Bangladesh Freedom Honour" award to Sonia Gandhi on behalf of her late mother-in-law Indira Gandhi. It may be mentioned that Indira Gandhi has been honoured by Bangladesh after long 40 years of its independence for her outstanding contribution to the country's Liberation War in 1971. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, cabinet members, MPs, foreign diplomats, delegation members of Sonia Gandhi and distinguished personalities attended the function. But the leader of the opposition of Bangladesh did not attend the programme. Analysis may unearth many unknown reasons behind Khaleda's absence. But the image of the country has been damaged already. It also did not boost the ruling party's image. In fact, nobody was benefited by this. How can this nation get rid of these unhealthy gestures of the politicians? We do not know, to what destination our politicians will lead us.//////The government has announced the leave schedule for students to enjoy holidays during Ramadan. As per the announcement, secondary schools remained close from August 4 and madrasas from August 2 while colleges and technical institutions will remain close from August 14, and primary schools from August 17. Because of the different leave schedules the parents are suffering the most and the city dwellers cannot get rid of the terrible traffic jam. A mother will have to wait till August 17 to go to her village home because her one kid got vacation from August 4 and another will get it from August 17. I earnestly request the govt. to reconsider this fact and declare a common leave schedule. //////A photo of illegal land and footpath grabbing in Karwan Bazar area was published in your daily a few days ago. This type of illegal shops, eateries, seasonal fruit shops, and league offices can be seen in Dhaka's many areas including Khilkhet, Nikunja, Mogbazar, Khilgaon etc. They build tin shed structures in public places and on footpaths and do business using the party's name and the leaders' photos. Nowadays you may find mobile fish markets too on foot bridges!//////Allah forgives us in this month of Ramadan. Hajrat Jibrail(as) came to prophet Hazrat Muhammad (sm) with the holy Quran in this month. There is a special night in this month when Allah shows unlimited kindness towards mankind. This night is called 'Lailatul Qadr'. Our prophet Muhammad (sm) devoted himself to prayer in this month. So, we should honour this month and involve ourselves in prayers. We should be sincere in acquiring knowledge from the holy Quran and try our best to establish the rules of the holy Quran in the society. A man should fast to get the kindness of Allah. If one fasts sincerely and follow the teachings of Ramadan, a special door to the heaven named 'Raihan ' will be opened for him/her forever.//////China said yesterday that it had evacuated nearly 500,000 people as Typhoon Muifa approached but the storm was likely to miss the commercial capital Shanghai.//////The global community has failed to create a politically stable and economically viable Afghanistan despite pouring billions of dollars into the South Asian nation during a decade-long war against the Taliban, says the International Crisis Group.//////The US, French and German leaders pledged to consider new steps to punish Syria after security forces shot dead at least 22 people as tens of thousands staged anti-regime protests on the first Friday of Ramadan.//////Somalia's al-Shabab Islamist rebels left all positions in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, government and rebel spokesmen said yesterday.//////Libyan rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil issued a plea for rebel unity yesterday, as the cohesion of a five-month-long revolution wobbled under the weight of a high profile assassination.//////A ceremony yesterday to mark the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing was dominated by national soul-searching on atomic power as Japan's prime minister pledged a nuclear-free future.//////A bomb destroyed at least 16 tankers on Saturday carrying fuel for Nato troops in neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan police said, the latest in a string of attempts to disrupt supplies.//////While many experts say there is no link between mobile phone use and cancer in adults there is still widespread uncertainty about the risks children face.//////The leader of India's ruling Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, was out of intensive care yesterday after undergoing successful surgery for an undisclosed ailment in the United States, a spokesman said.//////The Commerce Ministers of Pakistan and India will reportedly meet in New Delhi next month, after a gap of over three years, to discuss issues related to trade expansion and proposals to remove non-tariff barriers that hinder smooth trade between the two countries.//////Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday ruled out calling early elections to stem market panic that has pounded Italian assets and forced his government to bring forward austerity measures.//////Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said yesterday that elections to a new parliament will be held by year's end, as Syria's regime faces international pressure over its deadly crackdown on protests.//////US officials and their counterparts in Bahrain, which crushed month-long protests in mid-March, have renewed a defense pact, officials said Friday.//////Newly independent South Sudan swore in its MPs yesterday, two days ahead of parliament's opening session, with the speaker calling for cooperation regardless of background or political affiliation.//////Afghan civilians may have been caught up in a NATO air strike against suspected Taliban insurgents, a foreign military spokesman said yesterday, amid claims up to eight civilians died.//////Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh will soon leave the Saudi hospital where he has been recuperating from wounds suffered in an attack on his palace, but will remain in Riyadh for the time being, a Yemeni government source said on Saturday.//////Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth will not join the board of directors at her father's scandal-hit media empire as planned, News Corporation has said.//////Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi hopes that the trial of two US citizens detained in the Islamic republic on espionage charges will lead to their freedom, local media reported yesterday.//////Chinese and Indian citizens dominated Australia's border control blacklist, secret documents showed yesterday, with the majority of people singled out for national security reasons.//////A bus plunged into the lagoon in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan Friday morning, killing 37 of its 47 passengers, a government spokeswoman said.//////Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) paid homage to Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore by arranging a musical- cum- recitation programme at its Music and Dance Centre auditorium yesterday.//////A weeklong solo exhibition featuring the works of Japanese artist Junko Okamoto is on at Zainul Gallery, Faculty of Fine Arts (FFA),University of Dhaka.
