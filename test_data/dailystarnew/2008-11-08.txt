But, the way cities, both at home and abroad, are growing is not at all sustainable.

NATO has added new members six times since first forming in 1949 and now NATO comprises twenty-six members. The United States is taking another step today toward getting Albania and Croatia folded into the NATO alliance. Both countries had been isolated behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. NATO leaders agreed at a summit earlier this year in Romania to invite Albania and Croatia into the alliance. However, the alliance rebuffed US attempts to begin the process of inviting Ukraine and Georgia.
