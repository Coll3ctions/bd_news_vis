And this inquisitive aspect of Dr. Albert Einstein's theories of relativity (which by-the-way, single handedly altered the notion that time runs at the same rate for everyone, everywhere in the Universe) has been previously proven by comparing clocks on the earth's surface and a high-flying rocket back in 1976, by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. And again, physicists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of USA have measured this very effect at a more down-to-earth scale of 33 centimeters or about 1 foot very recently! And the result of the experiment was obvious, the further away is a person from the surface of Earth, the faster the time passes for her/him on a human scale. To put it more simply, a person ages faster even when she/he stands a couple of steps higher from our planetary surface! Published in the Sept.24th issue of Science, scientists from NIST, however, explain that the difference (given that distance) is much too small for humans to perceive directly. And the research have found out that a height of that particular difference (one foot or 33 centimeters) actually resulted in a time variance of roughly a billionth of a second per year. Another aspect of the relativity that was observed by the NIST researchers was time also passes more slowly when one moves faster. //////A puzzling knot of atoms at the edge of the solar system is fading, leaving space physicists with an even gnarlier mystery to unravel about the outer boundary of the heliosphere, where the vast bubble in which the solar system resides meets up with interstellar space.//////Some dinosaurs may have been at least 10 percent taller than previously thought, US paleontologists said in a study that found the creatures had large amounts of cartilage.//////At an unusual press conference recently held in Washington, D.C., a UFO author and a half-dozen or so former U.S. military airmen asserted that "The U.S. Air Force is lying about the national security implications of unidentified aerial objects at nuclear bases and we can prove it."
