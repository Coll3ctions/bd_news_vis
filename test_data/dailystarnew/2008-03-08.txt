Its importance also lies in that it will give the needed legal cover to national ID card and voter registration project already undertaken by the Election Commission (EC). //////WHAT could be a more ringing endorsement of the International Women's Day theme 'Investing in women and girls' than the one reverberating from a discussion meet organised by ActionAid to mark the day on Wednesday. That women make better and more responsible use of money than their male counterparts and are proficient in jobs requiring attention to detail and finesse are established facts. Little wonder, therefore, that they are such success stories in two sectors -- microcredit and garment industry. Their efficient utilisation of microcredits, both in self-employed and group projects have led to a degree of poverty alleviation in a significant number of households. The replication of such projects on a larger scale is only desirable but that needs a greater allocation of resources.//////A sort of national consensus has developed recently for bringing the war criminals of the liberation war to justice.

Their close contest has been carefully watched within the United States and analysed by others in the rest of the world. That has been so because in any US Presidential election, the electorate consists not only of US citizens but also those in other countries who might be directly or indirectly affected by the outcome.//////DEMOCRATIC presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton made the American media turn on a dime. In their last debate in Ohio on February 26, from the outset an aggressive Clinton employed the "kitchen sink" strategy of throwing everything at Obama. She complained that she always gets the first question, lending credence to the skit on NBC's Saturday Night Live comedy on February 23 that made fun of media's fawning over Obama. She asked sarcastically: "Perhaps we should ask Barack whether he needs another pillow!"//////Mohammad Ashraful and co may take some encouragement two days ahead of the first one-dayer from the outcome of the BCB XI match against a full-strength South African team yesterday that saw a thrilling last-ball encounter ending in a tie, in front of a jubilant home crowd at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium.//////The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) yesterday paved way for the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) election by allowing the football governing body in Bangladesh to hold the polls according to the current statutes with minor adjustments.//////BCB XI skipper Shakib Al Hasan was all smiles at the post-match briefing with reporters near the rope of Chittagong Divisional Stadium yesterday afternoon.

England creaked along at a rate of 2.14 an over, gas mark 1 by the standards of the modern game, but New Zealand kept stirring the pot gently with wickets at opportune moments, to leave their opponents in an undeniable stew. There have been all manners of remarks about the turgid nature of this pitch, but they've been completely at odds with the hand-grenade mentality that has gripped England's batsmen. If they are this anxious on day three of the contest, imagine how they'll cope if asked to bat time on a final-day minefield?//////His habit of being openly critical about teammates has raised quite a few eyebrows, but Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni insists there is nothing wrong in being "transparent" if it ends up getting good results for the side.//////Jose Mourinho has warned Chelsea he is out to "kill" them when he returns to club management.//////Pakistan are concerned that there will be long-term implications if, as expected, Australia pull out of their scheduled tour there due to security issues.

By that time Samuel P. Huntington had his article, The Clash of Civilizations? published in ////// (Summer 1983), followed shortly by the book ////// (1996). Nowhere, however, in her book, has Durdana even a passing reference to either of Huntington's works. Not that there was any reason for her to have cited him. Yet, her own words, as well as the general theme of the book indicate that she views the depiction of Muslim India in Anglo-Indian fiction from a clash of culture perspective. I am of the opinion that focused critical attention is called for to examine the implications of the West's particular defamation of Islam, Durdana writes. This cannot be explained as just one among many examples of colonial reductionism; it is the inevitable outcome of long-standing open, latent and anticipatory political rivalry between the two cultures, one which has contributed to the systematic evolvement of an Other in Western literature that is more other than all the other Others.//////Human nature is a complex phenomenon. It varies from individual to individual. In fact, it is said that we cannot really grasp how differently human beings react under different situations. We cannot really understand how we feel until we are in the same shoes. In ////// Stephanie Gertler plumbs the mysteries of the people we can truly never know. It is the author's testament to showing the passion and power of the human heart. //////Storytellers wonder as to what actually their readers or listeners want to read or hear. In fact, writers over the centuries have spent time thinking about this when they sat at their desks to write. Many who realised that readers do want to hear about their own lives in the story have succeeded as good writers. Writers who like to deal with people's dreams, aspirations and certain intricacies of human existence are set to be remembered for a long time to come.//////It is a great pleasure introducing Dr Enamul Haque's latest comprehensive publication on Bengal art. This excellent voluminous empirical treatise indeed is a new plume on his crown. This rather costly publication comprises 408 pages of text (including bibliography and index) and 536 plates, mostly in colour. According to the author, it was initially planned for ordinary readers on a broad spectrum of the art heritage of Bangladesh. On second thought, however, he modified its scope to make it useful to scholars as well, as a handbook representing the noteworthy facets of the arts of all ages (albeit the handbook is too heavy to carry). It is an ambitious work and certainly a commendable attempt to sweep across a vast vista of over two and a half millennia of history and development of our creative art heritage.//////This certainly is a work with a difference. It combines fiction and art in the sense that the realities of life are explained in terms of the images that have shaped the human imagination over the centuries. Think here of Ellora and Ajanta. Think back on all the creativity the world has been subjected to. And then go looking for the dark princess.//////
