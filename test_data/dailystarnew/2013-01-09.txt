This amounts to a 16.43 percent growth over that of previous year. In 2011, too, the remittance registered 10 percent growth over what it was in 2010. And this year's remittance figure is considered by the experts a new benchmark. However, a study of the World Bank reveals that remittance inflow goes up by $1,000 to up to $11,000 per year with every new expatriate. So if Bangladesh can uphold the trend of manpower export, certainly the growth in this regard will continue. It is a fact that in last fiscal year, manpower export increased 57 percent and the total number of workers who went abroad was 691,402, the second highest in Bangladesh history. It may be mentioned that in 2007-08, around 981,102 went abroad for job, according to the central bank statistics. //////Hatirjheel project is a new addition to the beauty of Dhaka city which would help check the traffic jam of the city. There are a few places in the city where people can go to have some fresh air. Hatirjheel project can be looked upon as a gift to the city dwellers. From the pictures published in several newspapers it seems that it is a little heaven in Dhaka city. Now, as city dwellers it is our duty to keep this place beautiful. We should not throw garbage anywhere near the place but in the dustbins. The place should also be declared a no-smoking zone. The government should take appropriate measures for maintaining its beauty. //////Our LL.B final examinations were held recently under the national university.

Objectification means considering a person as an object, a tool for entertainment. These advertisements degrade the moral standard of young people and definitely carry the wrong message. Treating women as mere sex objects is so demeaning and threatening to women. So, this culture of objectification should stop immediately.//////I am glad that finally five perpetrators of Tangail gang rape are now behind bars. The question is, were there only these five perpetrators who have been behind the girl's abysmal physical and psychological condition? The victim's condition wouldn't have gone this worse if she had been given proper medical care the moment she was rescued. Her family was afraid to give her medical care and emotional support she needed because of social stigma. We have created a society that is way more hostile to the rape victim than to the rapist. We make rules, traditions and decide the standard of right and wrong for society which teaches us to develop a negative attitude towards the rape victim. So it is not just those rapists who are to blame, we all are liable for every rape case. Traditional social norms instil the concept into us that there is no coming back from rape. Even if the victim wants to come back to her regular life, even if the schoolgirl recovers from the physical trauma, her circumstance might not let her recover from the psychological trauma. This society will never let her forget those gnawing memories. I learned from the news update that the girl's condition is improving and like all other rational human beings, I too hope that she will recover completely. But I think it is society which needs to be cured of its illness in the first place. //////I may not support the hartal programme itself on January 6, but I definitely support the issue behind it. I am one of the thousands of nobodies of this country who are struggling to keep their body and soul together with the monthly salary they get. I have no social life. I have run out of decent excuses to skip invitations to marriage ceremonies, birthday parties, etc., of my relatives. Moreover, I cannot afford the 'proper' kind of dress for my family to 'fit in' with those programmes. I hardly invite friends and relatives to my house. The shabby house I have rented does not help much to glorify my position. //////Japan will raise military spending this year for the first time in over a decade under a ruling party plan, an official said yesterday, as Tokyo summoned Beijing's envoy in a territorial row.//////At least eight militants were killed and four others wounded yesterday when US drones fired missiles at militant compounds in a lawless Pakistani tribal area, security officials said.//////The eastern Indian state of Jharkhand headed for fresh elections to legislature after the BJP-led coalition government's alliance a tribal party withdrew their support.//////US President Barack Obama named Chuck Hagel on Monday to lead the Pentagon, setting up an ugly confirmation battle as Republican opponents said he was too hard on Israel and too soft on Iran.//////Three of the five men accused of the abduction, gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi will plead not guilty to all charges against them, their lawyer said yesterday.//////British Prime Minister David Cameron and his deputy Nick Clegg insisted Monday their coalition would serve its full five years as they pledged fresh reforms to mark the midway point of their government.//////A member of the Afghan army shot dead a British soldier, officials said yesterday, in the latest "insider attack" to undermine the US-led mission training Afghans to take over from Nato troops next year.//////The World Food Program yesterday said it is unable to help 1 million Syrians who are going hungry. //////Indian Maoist rebels have shot dead seven policemen in the eastern state of Jharkhand, a hotbed of left-wing extremism, police said yesterday.//////A Dutch artist has failed in his bid to trademark the name of Allah in an attempt to push the boundaries of the free market, the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property said Monday.//////Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's medical condition has not changed since the government reported four days ago that he was suffering from complications from surgery, the government said Monday.//////A second inquest into the death of troubled British singer Amy Winehouse confirmed yesterday that she died of accidental alcohol poisoning.//////Central African Republic rivals yesterday prepared for talks aimed at ending the latest conflict in their volatile country, which has seen rebels seize a string of key towns over the past month.//////A subway train derailed yesterday in a test run on a new line in southwestern China, killing one driver and injuring another, state media reported.//////Congolese rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire yesterday ahead of a second round of peace talks with the government, boosting hopes for a negotiated end to their nine-month-old revolt.//////Mexico City police rounded up stray dogs in an ecological reserve on Monday after a pack of them apparently killed four people, including a mother and her baby, in recent days, authorities said.//////A Dutch artist has failed in his bid to trademark the name of Allah in an attempt to push the boundaries of the free market, the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property said Monday.//////Police in Northern Ireland fired plastic bullets and water cannon at protesters in the capital Belfast late Monday after coming under a hail of petrol bombs, bricks and stones for a fifth night.//////The Turkish army killed 14 rebels from the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) during an operation near the Iraqi border that also left one soldier dead, an official statement said Tuesday.//////Pandit Kumar Bose was born in Kolkata in a distinguished family of musicians.

The musical adaptation of Les Miserables, the 1862 novel by Victor Hugo and the subsequent international theatre sensation, has become the first film ever to go past the $100 million mark at the US Box Office in under 14 days. //////It is always healthy reflecting on stories of men who have in their diverse ways made an impact on our lives. And the reason we do that is plain history, that very special part of life, of scholasticism we tend to ignore in these times of banalities aplenty. The problem with globalisation, with material prosperity, is that it deprives people of their sense of inquiry as also their understanding of the world they are part of. //////Nothing quite grips human ambition as forcefully as the allure of luck. Even Napoleon wanted lucky generals in preference to merely brilliant ones. Logic is not an impediment; superstition leaps across paradox. In Bangkok, Thais pray at the Tree of 100 Corpses for a number that will win the lottery. Many Chinese gamblers believe in the glorious tradition that red underpants bring fortune in a casino. They also avoid the main entrance, and postpone their date with the table if they encounter a monk or a nun on the way. This last bit makes sense. God wants us to lose money paying taxes, not rolling dice.//////During the tenure of the Sheikh Hasina government, two documents were signed that encapsulated the framework of comprehensive cooperation between Bangladesh and India, including at the sub-regional level.

A response on the issues raised by Mr. Haque based on legal position of the Law of the Sea is needed. //////
