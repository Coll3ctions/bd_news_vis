The statistics have been collected by the communications minister Syed Abul Hossain from the Bangladesh Road Transport Authorities (BRTA) and placed before parliament on Wednesday. The minister has revealed that BRTA has two mobile courts led by two executive magistrates taking action against vehicles running without fitness certificates. But the reality is that there is clear lack of coordination between BRTA and the authorities responsible for traffic management. Therefore, if the relevant government agencies cannot rise above their petty differences and vested interests, and if magisterial actions are not effectively supported by strict imposition of rules, no qualitative change can come about on the roads.//////IT was painful watching the photograph of a Pahari woman gathering burnt rice from the ground where her house used to be in Sathaiyapara, Khagrachari before inter-community violence made her homeless.

While internationally the sport is quite high-profile, it is still very much at it's infancy in Bangladesh and lags far behind cricket and football in the popularity rankings.

It arrives without warning, as it did at Garib and Garib sweater factory at Bhogra under Gazipur district on February 25. 21 workers, 15 of them female, died and several others were injured.

The industrial administrators are subject to variety of organizational, political and social constraints.

It is now widely accepted in the country that Bangladesh faces grave challenges from impacts associated with climate change. According to the World Development Report 2010, about 18% of Bangladesh's land will be submerged if the sea level rises by one meter. Should this occur, it will result in the displacement of almost 30 million people. Bangladesh government has few available resources to deal with this huge number of displaced people, or the so-called climate refugees. Not surprisingly the government has been seeking the cooperation of wealthy nations in relocation planning for those likely to be displaced.//////Of course energy deficiency is one of the biggest problems and challenges for Bangladesh. About 90% of our power plants are natural gas fueled. As we have limited natural resources to generate electricity in conventional ways, we have to look for the alternatives. It will not be a wise decision to plan and install any more natural gas based thermal unit at this stage. So a few other alternatives that come in view are coal or oil based plants, nuclear power plants, hydro units and renewable energy sources i.e. solar, wind, biomass, etc. //////Much has been written and told about climate change impact, mitigation and adaptation over more than a couple of months since COP15 held in December, 09 in Copenhagen. But not much about the role of youth in the efforts. //////Ayat stood motionless on the balcony to feel the time and space of a fresh day. The quiet dawn still held on to the remnants of night. The cool air caressed her face, the pleasure made her shiver slightly. She closed her eyes while listening to the Azan; one note but unsynchronized, the timing was a bit off for each call, yet together it formed a single whole - one message. That is what she loved about this city too, always chaotic, yet life fell in a rhythm. Today she heard another tune, Raag Bhairav. Somewhere close someone was greeting the God of Dawn on a different note! However much she tried to separate the two she could not. It was an amazing blend. She opened her eyes. The mist over the lake just hung there.//////1955 was a memorable year. It was the year of the Great Flood. Our home was one of the few dwellings in the entire village which did not go under water. Our 'bangla-bari' --- an outer house detached from the main complex and used for a variety of purposes, including accommodation of a live-in school teacher --- was brimming with people who were given refuge. The temporary residents were villagers whose association with our family was forged over several generations. The communal camaraderie helped to alleviate their suffering. They waited patiently for nature to run its course; their homes lay submerged under water, with perhaps just the rooftops sticking out their heads in a show of determined defiance.//////I stared at the sunset scene through my water-logged eyes. The breeze was calm and soothing. It brushed my cheeks, diverting the path of my salty tears. Yet the dynamic platform did not make much of a difference to me. I knew for a fact that the mistake I had committed was unforgivable.//////I sit on a tree twittering to my friends,//////Watching the bright blue summer sky.//////I dream with the bracing air, I wake//////To the sound of a big lorry.//////I am a blackbird.//////Many a time, surgery is the only option to save lives and prevent disabilities, especially in case of emergencies. Often surgery cannot be safely postponed to allow their transfer to a secondary or tertiary-level hospital. But the emergency surgical services is the commonly missing component of primary healthcare in Bangladesh. Most of the rural areas, patients have no access to even simpler procedure and trauma care at primary level (Upazilla health complex and union sub-centres).//////Upon moving to Dhaka City, nearly two years ago, the first intention I had on my list of agendas was to join a gym in order to continue the fitness regime which I had taken up the previous years. But my intention did not quite lead to adequate action, until I realised my favourite outfits had shrunk, well, actually, truth be told, I had somewhat expanded. Eventually I did join a gym. I want to share my things what I considered before choosing the gym which was right for me.//////A hand-held device that delivers a magnetic pulse to the head may offer relief for some migraine sufferers, researchers report.//////Baldness affects millions of man worldwide.

Nobel Laureate and former Chief of the IAEA, Dr. Mohammad ElBaradei, who is the most well known Egyptian internationally in contemporary times, was given a rousing welcome when he arrived in Cairo recently; a reception that was motivated by politics as many Egyptians are beginning to see him as their man of destiny. He is viewed as one who could transform Egypt into a working democracy based no doubt upon his fame for winning the Nobel Peace Prize and handling the crisis in Iraq over presence of WMD as Chief of IAEA and his impeccable record on corruption, a rare commodity in the politics of Egypt.//////BANGLADESH, lying between the Himalayas in the north and the Bay of Bengal in the south, offers the only land route connecting South and Southeast Asia. Any invasion into South Asia from the East must pass through Bangladesh; the Japanese tried to do just that in the World War II. The British colonization of India also started from Bengal when the Bay of Bengal became the point of ingress. Bangladesh's close proximity to both India and China, two rising power in the 21st century, adds to its geographic importance.//////PRESIDENT Obama plans "dramatic reductions" in the country's nuclear arsenal, a senior U.S. official said Monday, but it remains unclear if he will opt for a radical break from past policy.//////US officials hope a series of reforms envisioned for the 28-country NATO alliance will be available for review by member nations when they convene later this year, a senior defence official said February 26.//////Julius Caesar disregarded warnings about the Ides of March. He believed, as Shakespeare would have us know, that he was more dangerous than danger itself. That precisely is what he told his wife Calpurnia when she tried to dissuade him from going to the senate because of the nightmares she had gone through during the preceding night. As he approached the senate, he came across the man who had warned him of the Ides of March. 'The Ides of March are come', said Caesar, almost in a triumphant vein. 'Aye, Caesar, but not gone', replied the soothsayer. On his way to the senate, Caesar was handed a scroll by the scholar Artemidorus, who apparently had some inkling of the plot against him. The dictator did not deign to read it. Moments later, he was dead at the foot of Pompey's statue inside the senate building. There were twenty three stab marks on his body. The last one, made by Brutus, was in his groin.//////The debut novel by social psychologist Shazia Omar is a brave depiction of drug addiction in Bangladesh. She approaches the taboo subject with all the rigour you would expect of someone who has spent a month in a rehab centre studying dependence. She seemingly omits nothing from this gritty work of fiction. //////Discrimination against women is not limited to a particular geographical area. It is rather a serious problem, appearing with different faces in different societies, says a press release of Goethe-Institut. The book, 'A Tale of Golden Girls', dwells on five exploited girls in Bangladesh who broke out of their cage and caused laughter to permeate their lives through success brought on by will power and determination. It will be launched at the Institut on 8 March. //////
