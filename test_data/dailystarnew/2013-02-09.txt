The nation yesterday saw the biggest gathering in recent memory as tens of thousands thronged the capital's Shahbagh intersection to call for death penalty for the war criminals, including Abdul Quader Mollah, of 1971.//////The ongoing mass protest at Shahbagh since Tuesday afternoon sets a unique example of a peaceful as well as colourful demonstration to voice demands and express views.//////The capital's Shahbagh took a different look yesterday.

As the founder of Pakistan, in the view of many Bangalees, Jinnah ought to have been more receptive to the popular grievance where the language question was concerned. That Jinnah was not ready to give an inch baffled many. His combative meeting with student representatives after his Curzon Hall appearance did not go down well with people. The governor general was inclined to think that a strong handling of what he considered misguided young people was necessary. Among the students, a subtle rebellious streak began to manifest itself.//////Both the government and the defence are working to file appeals with the Supreme Court contesting the recent verdict against Jamaat-e-Islami leader Abdul Quader Mollah in the crimes against humanity case.//////Beaming with pride, 30 lakh martyrs are looking at you from heaven, and so is Shaheed Janani Jahanara Imam.//////Jute, instead of wood, can be used in the country to make eco-friendly products such as boats, said Director General of Bangladesh Jute Research Institute Dr Md Kamal Uddin yesterday. //////A member of MN Larma faction of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) was shot dead allegedly by pro-peace supporters at Marishya union in Rangamati yesterday. //////The BNP-Jamaat-led 18-party opposition alliance last night postponed their rally scheduled for today demanding restoration of the caretaker government system.//////Gunmen on motorbikes shot dead nine health workers who were administering polio vaccinations in two separate attacks in Nigeria's main northern city of Kano yesterday, police said.//////A Malaysian state minister yesterday said the government would not push ahead with plans to build 12 dams on Borneo island, acknowledging they have caused outrage from local tribes and environmentalists.//////Pakistan's main opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has demanded immediate talks with the Taliban and called on the government to take seriously a conditional peace offer from the insurgents.//////Riot police yesterday fired water cannon at hundreds of protestors in the Indian state of Kerala demanding the resignation of a lawmaker over allegations he raped a schoolgirl 17 years ago.//////Eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded when a bomb exploded near a shop selling DVDs and mobile phones in Pakistan's northwestern tribal belt yesterday, officials said.//////US drones yesterday fired two missiles into a compound in Pakistan's northwestern tribal belt, killing at least four militants, local security officials said.//////The atmosphere is electric. It is spontaneous. That is the feeling one gets pushing through the crowds on all roads leading to Shahbagh. This is a protest led by the youth of the country who do not march under any political banner. They are united in their calls for justice to be served. The anger of the youth is mingled with joy and anticipation as ordinary folk come to the congregation with their children and with the elderly. The young are carried by their parents; the old come on crutches undaunted by the distance that must be traveled on foot.//////From what data is available, the number of economic migrants entering international labour markets jumped a marked 56.82 percent in 2011-12 over the previous fiscal year. This is good news indeed. The latest government move to explore alternate arrangements, i.e. state-to-state deals with counterpart governments like Malaysia is a step in the right direction. Should the government-level deal work out smoothly, Bangladesh could potentially look forward to increasing its inward foreign exchange remittance manifold in the coming years.//////A rollicking half-century from Shahriar Nafees led the Khulna Royal Bengals to a seven-wicket victory over Duronto Rajshahi in their Bangladesh Premier League match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday. //////Chittagong Kings raced to a record win after they crushed a weakened-Sylhet Royals by 119 runsthe largest margin in the BPL at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday. //////* Rajshahi foreigners threatened boycott over non-payment//////* BPL says Rajshahi made payment, but delays are from bank//////* Kapugedera threatens similar action if payment is not made before next game//////Nathan Lyon, the Australia off-spinner, believes Australia should field two spinners in the Test series against India, which begins in two weeks' time.

The paved village road soon turned into a dusty path as it snaked through the sparsely inhabited winter-dry Haor area. I could see great distances in all directions. After several kilometres, looking ahead past wide-open fields that were green with rice seedlings, I noticed a tall structure. This turned out to be the watchtower for Baikka Beel, a wetland in the middle of the haor that was set up as a wildlife sanctuary in 2003.//////Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai will arrive in

Maine as well as densely populated inland areas.//////Since the sit-in demanding death penalty for war criminal Abdul Quader Mollah has begun at the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka on February 5, alongside hardcore protest, cultural performances prove to be a key element in motivating thousands of demonstrators each day. Cultural activists as well as amateur and professional artistes have been gathering at the venue -- raising their voices with inspirational songs, street plays, installations, street paintings, graffiti and more. A group of artists erected an installation, titled E Khancha Bhangbo Ami Kemon Korey in front of Shahbagh Police Station. A cage-like wooden structure, the installation is a symbol of protest, urging all to break free. Among theatre troupes, Prachyanat, Natyadhara and Tirandaj held improvised performances. Members of Bloggers and Activist Network initiated the protest by organising a human chain in front of the National Museum.//////After a slight delay in beginning the Odyssey Complex at the main auditorium of the Shilpakala Academy, organised by the Goethe-Institut Dhaka on February 7, a young German apologised to the audience, saying there will be further delay as Felix Mathias Ott, the performer, was a little under the weather. He then went on to give an introduction to the play that he said is usually done by Felix. Only when he sat down at the lone table on the stage and the innocuous third-person narration turned into a dramatic monologue did the audience realise that the play had already been underway. //////Music aficionados in the Port City attended a solo musical performance by Shantanu Biswas at the premises of Shilpakala Academy here on Thursday evening.

I talked to some old friends and made some new ones; my mind went back to early December 1990 when, at midnight, I had joined young and old on Mirpur Road, Dhanmondi, and we hugged each other on the occasion of the "return of democracy" in Bangladesh. //////Shahbagh Square! It has caught the imagination of Bangla youth in a way not seen since the end of Cairo's Tahrir Square. Dhaka may be close to ushering in what is now romantically referred to as Bangla Spring. //////The other day in Narayangonj a frenzied mob in its desire to vent its anger on authority found its mark when it spotted a lone policeman separated from other men on duty. They beat the unarmed policeman mercilessly till he collapsed on the ground, torn and bleeding. This was clearly a situation in which one could sink into a deep morass of self-pity and self-recrimination. //////For long it has not been easy to realise that Bangladesh is an independent country from the talks and conducts of its rulers. It is becoming clearer day by day that the leaders of the country have become alienated from the people. The issues they debate about on national and international media are matters of gossip in their private meetings. They request foreigners for support in their feuds, vent out their personal grudges, make a mountain out of a mole-hill and downgrade a mountain into next to nothing. The latest proof of this is Khaleda Zia's article entitled The thankless role in saving democracy in Bangladesh, first published in ////// and then in ////// of February 1. //////I had two classmates in my hometown college; we were activist of the same student party (no Islamic Chattra Shangha at that time). Over the years, they changed their political belief and in 1971, we were on the opposite sides. As leaders of the infamous Badar-Bahini, they assisted the occupation forces in carrying out genocide on our people. One of them became a cabinet minister during the last BNP-led alliance government and flew the hard-earned green-red flag of my country whose creation he opposed tooth and nail. Had I been in Bangladesh, I would probably be bound by protocol to salute him. Would I be able to do that? This query is because he was instrumental in torturing and killing our people, while I was risking my life to save them at the most critical juncture of our nation. //////It is energy availability that would shape the fate of civilization in 21st century. At present the world is faced with two severe problems: energy crisis and environmental degradation. But the trend of increasing energy consumption will be continuing in future. Energy and environment are highly intertwined. The use of fossil fuels is now considered unsustainable for its green house gas (GHG) effects on environment. Exploitation of renewable and sustainable energy is one of the effective solutions to this problem. At present Bangladesh is facing a high power shortage that almost stops our development activities. //////In the global village, 'environment' is the basic pillar for economic development and social well-being today. Unbridled consumption and extraction to force growth damaging the natural capital upon which all life on the world depends is no more desirable. However, the global dichotomy between economic development and environment protection is still lodged in the outlook of individuals, policy makers, and governments. Besides sustainable development, the paradigm for understanding the relationship between economic development and environmental protection has largely failed to reform economic decision making in the way originally intended. //////We were in the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, waiting for a table at a popular restaurant. There were only two benches and a chair arranged in an L-shaped pattern in the beautiful backyard which served as a holding area, and we could see that most of the adjacent patio was set up as a dining area with tables and umbrellas to accommodate the overflow crowd or to provide an outdoor star-lit dining experience for the more adventurous ones. It was a nice summer night and we had shown up rather late, without reservation, hoping to spend some time together in a nice cozy environment. My children had decided to give us a treat for our Wedding Anniversary.//////Sitting on a chair by the window of the eighth-floor apartment, I could see the Eiffel Tower glowing like a yellow-hot sculpture, as if held admiringly by its sculptor against the pitch-dark Paris sky. In front of me on the dining table, I could see and savour the smell of the sumptuous dishes prepared by Anna Islam, my Paris-based artist friend Shahabuddin's wife. The aroma from the food was surpassed by her innate desire to make her Calgary guests (my wife and me) enjoy the Bengali meal and the Paris moment. I was physically spent from running through the Paris streets earlier. But there at the dining table, I could not be happier with a Paris Marathon medal audaciously hanging around my neck, exuding Eiffel-Tower-high pride. That was April 15, 2012. In the evening of the marathon in the city of lights and love and art.//////Born the noon, before the glorious Victory Day of Bangladesh//////You became for all, the Platinum Princess.....

This means, currently many of these countries do not have a functional cancer control plan that includes prevention, early detection, treatment and care. There is an urgent need to help countries to reduce cancer deaths and provide appropriate long-term treatment and care to avoid human suffering and protect countries social and economic development.//////The disadvantaged children living in the slums encounter physical, psychological and sexual abuse and grow up in negligence. Considering the unhealthy and dangerous situation of the slum areas, they are more prone to fall in situations like sexual exploitation, trafficking and drug addictions which inevitably lead to psychological problems.//////The worlds first drug eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) has won accolades from cardiologists worldwide as an invention that is hoped to revolutionise heart disease management. With BVS which is launched under the brand name Absorb by pharmaceutical Major Abbott, patients with coronary heart disease (CAD) can now have broad and better treatment options, reduced need of long term medicines and extremely reduced risk of stent induced side effects, according to a press release.//////With a view to improve skills and enhance knowledge to fight heart diseases better, interventional cardiologists around the world congregated in 3rd International BIT Congress held at Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel, Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 8-9, 2013.//////Dieters who ate early lunches tended to lose more weight than those who had their midday meal on the later side, in a new Spanish study. The finding doesn't prove bumping up your lunch hour will help you shed those extra pounds. But it's possible eating times play a role in how the body regulates its weight, researchers said.//////A chemical that sickened and killed babies in China when it tainted baby formula can also leach off of tableware and into food, a new small study suggests. However, researchers said, that does not prove the compound, called melamine, is harmful to kids and adults in the amounts detected when study participants ate hot soup from melamine bowls. In high enough quantities, melamine can cause kidney stones and other kidney problems in adults as well.//////Dear readers,//////You can now find us on the social network websites by following twitter.com/StarHealthBd (@StarHealthBd) and liking our page facebook.com/StarHealthBd.

There are a number of socio-political and cultural factors that might facilitate or hinder the democratisation process in the region. This article aims to highlight some of these issues, especially two important factors -- the long-nurtured patron-clientelistic networks developed by the dictators of Middle East and the tribal culture of these societies, that might affect, jeopardise or endanger the democratisation effort and could pose significant challenge to its process. //////Iran's nuclear puzzle game is at a crossroad. Despite the exchange of threats and counter-threats of annihilation by the Iranian and Israeli politicians, for the first time, the stakeholders of this issue have sought for dialogues and multilateral-based solutions. //////Every newspaper, flared -up with news of 'Band' of three girls, who took part in singing and formed a 'Band' Pragaash to give vent to their expressions through singing, but, unfortunately it took an ugly turn and became a controversial for them, which later got a decree from a grand cleric of Kashmir. In fact, music is a powerful tool of expressing one's feelings, and highlight the sufferings of people. The Band of teenaged girls who came to limelight in late December last year after their scintillating performance at the annual 'Battle of the Bands' competition have received online threats and absurd comments on facebook, although, as per the reports suggest they have decided to quit but Omar Abdullah assured them his full support. Also, the Indian media highlighted and debated the issue with full coverage and proper follow up, urged the girls to shun the decree and continue their Band Pragaash. //////Ashim Choudhury is set to take many of his readers back to their childhood. If you are part of the lower middle class or plain middle class and if you went to school in the 1960s in this part of the world, you cannot but marvel at the discovery of how much it is that your family shares with the Biswases in this tale, or in these tales, of familial bonding. More to the point, Choudhury speaks of a Bengali family from West Bengal, one whose head, Samar Biswas by name, holding a mediocre position in the Indian air force, is at intervals subjected to transfers from one spot to another, wife and children in tow. That again is a reminder for readers of all the parents, fathers in particular, whose occupations saw them move from one place to another through their careers, compelling or inducing spouses and offspring to relocate more or less constantly and build life anew over and over again. But, mark you, these are men who do not aspire any more, at a point, to higher perches in their professions. They are individuals in whom aspirations are condemned to die a slow death. But all too often ambition is transferred from them to their children, especially the brighter ones among them. The expectation is simple: where the fathers have come up against a dead end, the sons and daughters just might make the walls come tumbling down.//////a novel by the acclaimed Indian writer Rohington Mistry is, in my perception, a product of genuine empathy. It deals with difficult familial issues (while bringing out the various ways in which family members are important), with sensitivity and acumen.//////Essays are a difficult genre to master. It requires the deep understanding of a scholar, but the light touch of a journalist. Adnan Morshed has emerged as an accomplished essayist, and his current collection of elegant and enlightened pieces is a pleasure to read. They had been published earlier in various newspapers and journals (many in the Daily Star or BDnews, some elsewhere) and it is clear that the author has gradually created an oeuvre of work that demands attention and appreciation.//////Mansur Ali Khan to millions of cricket fans. Or 'Tiger Pataudi' to his close friends. The very name had conjured up a legend on the cricket field in the 1950s and 1960s and the image of a stylish cricketer who was a man of few words letting his batting and electrifying fielding do the talking. //////
