Bangladesh is getting stronger in every department of the game--fielding, bowling and batting. Actually, this happens when a nation forges ahead with a vision and dream. It seems we are once again waking up with our sprit of the Liberation War. Very confident after securing maritime areas, the government is dealing with India like our present cricket team who are measuring up to people's expectation. Consecutive comprehensive win is no fluke; rather playing their hearts out has become our team's habit. What we have to do now is apply this spirit in eradicating corruption from every sector of our country. Only then nation will prosper and the people of the world will look at us with respect. //////The little master hit his 100th century and Bangladesh is playing mind-blowing cricket which is exactly what we were waiting to watch for so long. We are amazed at the performance of our brave boys. Shakib is a great player. People used to say that Sachin has done the impossible possible and no one will be able to break his record. But this is not true anymore. Shakib is only 22. He will go a long way. I hope he will hit his 200th century in his long career. Shakib has regained his position of number one all-rounder in the ODI cricket. All-rounder means great at bowling, batting and fielding. On the other hand, Sachin is only good at batting and he is called the Batting Master. We all pray for Shakib.//////This refers to the recent political trends and dreams of major political parties in Bangladesh. The ruling party and sycophancy will forever remain inseparable. Sadly, the grand old party of Bangladesh seems to be stripped of ideas, ideals and ideology and all that it can offer to the nation is just another member of the Sheikh dynasty, who appears to be a product of excessive hype and grand publicity. This party is like an elephant that does not know its strength. Now that it has realised its strength, it can be confident of winning the general elections on its own. This party's leader waxes eloquent on meritocracy without realising that it cannot be brought about by an individual anywhere, however powerful and influential s/he is. //////On 14th March, Mr. Aminur Rahim wrote about how Mashrafe had let his team down by bowling poorly. I respect his feelings and to be honest, I also felt dejected and disappointed when Bangladesh squandered away a chance to defeat a giant in world cricket. However, blaming only Mashrafe for the debacle is not right. First of all, Mashrafe was not the only one who bowled poorly. Shafiul Islam was more expensive and did not also get a wicket. Not only that, Mashrafe has said it again and again that he does not want to bowl in the slog overs. In the matches, Mr. Aminur Rahim mentioned, Mashrafe bowled well upfront with the new ball but was taken apart in the slog overs. Was it not the captain's duty to let Mashrafe bowl in the initial overs and someone else in the final overs? In addition, Mashrafe came back after a one-year layoff due to injury. And a bit nervousness is not unexpected from a player coming back after such a long-time injury. Mashrafe is a strong player and he has proved it time and again. He still has got a lot to offer.//////Our home minister had pledged to arrest the killers of journalist couple Sagar and Runi within 48 hours. This time limit is now steadily approaching 48 days, but the police failed miserably to trace out the criminals! It appears that heinous crimes like burglary, mugging, robbery, murder etc are suddenly on the rise. Situation is so grave that even a foreign diplomat has been killed in the capital's diplomatic zone recently!//////Why did Mushfiq choose Shahadat to bowl the last over? Everybody knows what an expensive bowler he is. Even if Mahmudullah had bowled the last over, it would not have yielded 19 runs in the Asia Cup final. What a waste! I believe the Asia Cup was lost due to Shahadat's poor bowling. He must improve his bowling if he wants to remain in the team!//////A few years ago, I wrote two open letters to Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia that were published in The Daily Star. Now I again feel the urge to write a common letter to these two leaders who have been dictating the destiny of 16 million people of this country. My questions to the two most powerful ladies are://////The article by Ali and Rahman related to this subject and published by you on March 17 is informative and interesting for the readers. The presentation of the Clean Development Mechanism's (CDM) scope and its present status in Bangladesh was appreciated.//////It is a regular event for us to enjoy all unparliamentarily activities by our MPs in the Sangsad. The recurring actions of our MPs on whom we bestow our trust fail us. After a series of rallies on the street, which brought forth a wave of tension all over the country, we welcome the Opposition's decision of joining the parliament. But instead of fulfilling our expectation of a fruitful JS session they wallow in trivial scuffle. So it becomes predictable for us what is coming next. The frustration rises high when we find they (MPs) don't bother that we are watching.//////Parliament is not a place for abusing and dishonouring the members of other parties. As a concerned citizen, I think actions should be taken against those MPs for their inappropriate acts, from the highest authorities. Lack of actions may only add fuel to such hostility in the future.//////I am deeply shocked to see a picture in The Daily Star of March 23, 2012 with the following caption: Premises of this mosque at Gobinda village in Pabna town witnessed the most unimaginable barbarity on March 26 in 1971 when the Pakistan occupation army opened fire at the people taking part in janaza prayers as part of a deceased villager's funeral. //////Syria has accepted a proposal crafted by Kofi Annan that aims to end bloodshed in the strife-hit country, but the United Nations-Arab League envoy has cautioned implementation is key to peace.//////US President Barack Obama and Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani vowed yesterday to rescue a troubled anti-terror alliance, which almost ruptured over 10 months of mistrust and recriminations.//////The number of executions carried out worldwide surged in 2011, mainly centred in the Middle East, Amnesty International's said yesterday in it's annual report on the death penalty.//////Former International Monetary Fund boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been charged over alleged involvement in a prostitution ring.//////World leaders yesterday called for strong action to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism, including minimising civilian use of highly enriched uranium (HEU), which can be turned into bombs.//////Clashes have broken out in oil-rich border areas between Sudan and South Sudan in what has been called the biggest confrontation since the countries split last July.//////People who eat chocolate regularly tend to be thinner, a new research published in Archives of Internal Medicine suggests.//////At least 11 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed and 29 others injured in a landmine blast yesterday set off by Maoists in Gadchiroli district of western state of Maharashtra.//////North Korea insisted yesterday it would go ahead with its satellite launch, snubbing a call from US President Barack Obama to drop the plan and accusing him of a "confrontational mindset".//////The United States is seeking to build regional shields against ballistic missiles in both Asia and the Middle East akin to a controversial defence system in Europe, a senior Pentagon official disclosed on Monday.//////Officials from the largest party in Tunisia's governing coalition said they will not support moves to enshrine Islamic law in the new constitution.//////Historians and fiction (in particular historical fiction) writers are strange bedfellows. Where does one draw the line? According to author Selina Hossain, "When you want hardcore facts, you should go for history or news reports. The purpose of historical fiction is to provide the reader with a feel of being present at a particular event through the perspective of characters. This is essentially an art of recreating the past, entirely dependent on the literary prowess of a writer."//////On the occasion of Independence Day, in cooperation with Gallery Chitrak, Channel i and Liberation War Museum jointly organised a daylong painting event titled Rong Tulite Muktijuddha. The event was held on March 26 at the Liberation War Museum premises, Segunbagicha. Renowned painters of the country took part in the art camp.

The prominent actor has also been elected as the president of the Cholochitro Shilpi Shamitee. Shakib Khan recently talked to The Daily Star about his winning streak.//////March is a good month to remember history. //////Dr. Henry Kissinger had just become America's Secretary of State when Egypt's President Anwar Sadat surprised the world and stunned his Arab world by launching a successful war against Israel on October 6, 1973, the day of Yom Kippur. Within 24 hours Egyptian troops had crossed the Red Sea and raced across the Sinai desert to recover territory lost in 1967. At the end of that fateful day, Kissinger sent a simple but powerful private message to Sadat through a non-official channel: "You have begun the war with Soviet weapons, but you will need the power of American diplomacy to establish a peace."//////Now that the maritime boundary has been settled amicably with Myanmar through International Tribunal for Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Bangladesh has to resolve the maritime boundary with India. The process started in the Arbitral Tribunal in 2009.//////When two running ships collide head to head, there is no doubt that severe structural damage will occur. Even after such collision the vessel should not have sunk and so many passengers should not have died if it had been designed to the required standard and appropriate safety rules were followed. I do not know how many life-jackets the vessel was carrying, when every passenger must have one.//////Asians have no sense of humour. Their idea of comedy is slapstick. Irony doesn't exist in Asian discourse. There are no comedians in Asia.//////
