If democracy is about people's right to say and the government is to respect it, then the government has miserably failed in that respect. Ignoring the people's opposition to splitting of Dhaka City as reports on and views of the public carried by the print and electronic media go, the government has gone for pushing through the bill in the Jatiya Sangsad and by force of brute majority the bill was enacted within minutes. This is an instance of trampling public opinions. The AL-led government has in fact shown a dictatorial attitude by dividing the historical Dhaka (of 400 years) and hurting the people's sentiment. The government has hardly delivered for the betterment of the people, though it has been successful in creating chaos and unrest resulting into downslide in its popularity. The country is reeling from the shock of the scrapping the CTG system as well as splitting of Dhaka city. The irony is that the AL is failing to read the pulse of the people or take stock of things.//////Corruption exists in every country including Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, we see corruption mostly in the government offices. According to Human Resource Management (HRM), an attractive compensation package is very important for any employee. Corruption mostly occurs due to very low wages and benefits given to the employees. Some employees cannot manage their living expenses with their poor salary. To maintain a minimum standard of living, many government officials get involved in corruption and make money by illegal means. Reasonable compensation package is very vital to curb this kind of corruption. So, the government needs to make a new compensation structure based on the country's economy. It should also regularly review the pay structures. This will motivate people and help them live peacefully. The employees should at the same time be duly warned of punishment they will have if they are found indulging in corruption. //////All the dailies on November 3 reported on the Indian PM's statement that: "India will not take any steps on Tipaimukhi Project that may adversely affect Bangladesh." Given India's past record, there is reason for concern. They will build the dam and the hydroelectric power plant, and irrigate their land by diverting river water as they have been doing all along, despite their assurances. Mamata from Calcutta knows it all, hence she did not come to Bangladesh with the Indian PM. The fact is that the dam, power plant and irrigation works are all under progress in stages; with the irrigation works as the last work to be done; while Bangladesh is lulled into silence. After all, Indian hegemony is not unknown in the sub-continent. Now after patching up with USA, they are the western powers' official representative for all matters in this sub-continent!//////A few days ago I went to a private bank to deposit some money. But the person at the cash counter refused to accept three torn one hundred taka notes among other banknotes that I placed at the counter. She asked me to replace those with good notes. I was surprised and said that they could easily exchange those notes with Bangladesh Bank and I also showed them a poster circulated by Bangladesh Bank, near the cash counter, where it was written that the bank would accept torn notes. After much argument when I understood that it was futile to argue with her, I just changed those notes. //////The other day I was watching President Obama and his two daughters in a bookstore on the eve of Thanksgiving Day on a local television channel.

Neither did it refrain from using EVM, nor could it deploy the army. As a result, BNP had to withdraw its mayoral candidate at the last moment, much to the frustration of its activists and supporters. //////Incidents of insulting high-ranking and even elderly personalities in the name of protest are increasing.

Born in one, we are going to die in two cities! //////America's relations with Pakistan have been steadily deteriorating ever since a Navy Seals team killed Osama bin Laden near Islamabad in May. Matters became still worse in September, when Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accused Pakistan's intelligence agency of supporting an attack on the American Embassy in Kabul. And on Saturday, the relationship hit a new low when a Nato air strike mistakenly killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers, and Pakistan retaliated by shutting down supply routes to Afghanistan that crossed its territory.//////I am keeping out of the PM's adverse criticism of the civil society and the press at the inaugural of the International Congress of Social Philosophy (ICSP) last Friday. For, this is a beaten track. It is noteworthy though, the PM's uncharitable remarks came on the heels of the formation of a platform called Citizens' Movement for Democracy and Human Rights (CMDHR). Never mind her premature combativeness against the new move, I am latching on the positive vibe in the assurance she held out to the press and perhaps even to the civil society that she would be open to "constructive" criticism or suggestion from them. That encourages me to put in a word of advice to her, if I may. //////Acquisition is a basic human instinct. People acquire material resources for consumption, investment and bequeathing purpose. Consumption is broadly defined in this write up: it not only includes consumption of goods and services of tangible nature, it also includes sensual pleasures and utility derived from charity and emotional fulfillment. The essential requirement is that one has to consciously feel that he is getting perceptible utility from such activities. //////The death of Dr. Jalal Alamgir, a young Bangladeshi academic, was a real shocker.

In Bangladesh, Dr. Alamgir was affiliated with the Institute of Governance Studies (IGS), Brac University. //////There is an ancient Chinese proverb that says, May you live in interesting times, may you find what you are looking for. Ancient though, the proverb surely is a fit for today's time, where things keep getting more and more interesting.
