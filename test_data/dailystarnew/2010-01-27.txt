There can be two ways of looking at her exhortative flourish. First, she is probably having to repeat her directives simply to hammer home the hard truth that just as a vigilant electorate enthusiastically enthrones a party in power it can with vengeance unseat it if it delivers mis-governance. There is an element of sagacity here. Secondly, her repeated recital of warnings may have been prompted by a self-realisation that her exhortation are yet to have the desired effect. If that is true, it's all the more welcome because of an implied connotation of self-criticism. //////The annual report submitted to Parliament by the University Grants Commission for the year 2008 is a clear wake up call that needs to be heeded. The UGC informs us that the objectives of higher education are not being met by the nation's public and private universities, barring we would add, some notable exceptions. There is something of the ironic here. When private universities began to be set up in the early 1990s, it was expected that they would not only widen the sphere of education but would also, in a proper spirit of competition, help enhance the quality of it. While some of them may well have met the expectations, the majority have not.//////WE keep talking about democracy, about building it and strengthening it at the grassroots. That is a fine thing to do, a manifestation of sharpened political sensibilities. Every now and then we go back to the anodyne thought of how liberal we as a people have always been, of how democratic aspirations have regularly been an underpinning of our collective societal thought. And while we have been busy with all this, we have seen a whole caravan of undemocratic elements run riot over the years and come to commandeer the state in ways that have outraged the civilised and the sophisticated. Beginning with the early years of Pakistan and going up to the Ershad coup of the early 1980s, we have seen our much vaunted democratic aspirations take a bad mauling, and repeatedly, at the crossroads of time.//////THE Japanese Prime Minister, Dr. Yukio Hatoyama (62), paid a three-day visit to India from December 27.

The reason behind my scare was some photos that automatically came with the web result. I again tried many times with the same key word and always found the same web result with same terrible photos. You can also try and I am sure you will be frightened to see the photos if you are a patriotic citizen of this country. No, the photos do not contain any horror content or ghostly things. One photo shows a cop beating a journalist and another depicts a military parade and contains the caption Bangladeshi BDR Massacre. These photos portray a negative image of the country to the world. So these are really painful for any Bangladeshi. Today, in the age of information technology, if anybody outside Bangladesh needs to know about the country at first he or she will go to internet and will find a negative impression of Bangladesh. Bangladesh might have many problems but certainly this country is a model of communal and religious harmony. We have a glorious past and we are also an example of rising democracy. So why this country is being portrayed in such a negative way. Please describe Bangladesh in a constructive way. I think Google does not show these photos intentionally as it works automatically by using some programming formulas. The authorities of websites containing these pictures are responsible for this fault. They should immediately delete these pictures.//////On 17th January 2010, at around 11.15 am, I witnessed an MP, belonging to the JP, beat up a taxi driver on Gulshan Avenue in full view of the public.

The headlights of the ramshackle taxi broke on impact while the SUV suffered nothing more than a few scratches. Both cars stopped in the middle of the road. I then saw the MP come out of the SUV and attack the taxi driver with a sickening volley of slaps and kicks, with scores of people watching the incident. The attack only stopped when another passenger in his car came out and restrained him and coaxed him back into the car.//////I know you from 1985 when I used to listen to your lecture as a BEA Member.

The state minister for housing requested the members of REHAB to boycott the land grabbers. It sounds very heartening that the land grabbers are now known to the minister even. Actually, it is the big developers who indiscriminately grab the poor and `powerless' people's land. But there were none to resist them as because they have money, goons and liaison with the powerful coterie. Sometimes we hear a few emotive utterances from the high -ups but for reasons unknown, the situation does not change. //////The recent visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India scooped a small news in most of the Delhi based news media.

But most of the people are unable to reach these facilities in Dhaka. //////On 15 January The Daily Star welcomed "expressed willingness" of the BNP to join parliament calling it as an auspicious piece of news.

The reports and the photograph were published in your pages on January 17. It is a sad yardstick of hooliganism of irresponsible AL party men who should be dealt with iron hands by the law keepers, if the AL seriously believes in the rule of law! Or is all this the result of connivance and indirect understanding among the party high-ups!//////Last month the climate conference held in Copenhagen ended without any binding treaty. Simply put, the developed and the developing countries failed to reach any consensus on the issue --namely, the reduction of carbon emission to slow down the alarming increase of the planet's temperature. //////Our Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent visit to India will undoubtedly improve our relations with our neighbouring giant.
