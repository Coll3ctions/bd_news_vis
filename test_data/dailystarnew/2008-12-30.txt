The Awami League-led grand alliance has swept back to power after seven years out of office with a stunning landslide victory in an environment of free and fair elections that clearly showed the people's verdict for a change and has consigned the BNP-led four-party alliance to the political wilderness.//////The BNP has complained that there were irregularities, ballot rigging and forgery in 220 poll centres in 72 constituencies across the country during the just concluded ninth parliamentary election.//////As we celebrate the majesty of public will and try to understand the stunning results of the national election 2008, the real question that needs to be asked is not why Awami League won so comprehensively, but why BNP got the thrashing that it did. Given our anti-incumbency history and the pattern so far followed since 1991, it can be considered somewhat natural that Awami League should get a turn to run the country in 2008, after BNP did so in 2001. //////It is a shock-and-awe rout for the BNP, once a mighty party.//////It was a quick trial in people's court and the verdict was simple and clear with a message attached to it. It said it is the masses that hold the ultimate power in a republic. And it is they who break down the doors of Bastille again and again whenever tyrant rulers and their henchmen make feeble attempts to hide inside. History tells us that the despots have never been forgiven by the people. //////It was an election of heartbreak and humiliation for many bigwigs. An election that clearly brought home that big names do not matter, it is the deeds that count at the end of the day.//////Once again, the Bangladeshi voters have demonstrated that it is best to never underestimate them. Once again they have delivered a verdict as clinical as it has been mature, and shown that when they are able to exercise their franchise without fear for their safety they are able to render decisive and critical judgments.//////Corruption and high price of essentials were the major deciding factors for voters while casting ballots in the just concluded ninth parliamentary election.//////Highest 18 women have won 22 parliamentary seats in Monday's battle of ballots, meaning the new parliament will have the highest number of at least 63 female lawmakers, including 45 to be elected to reserve seats, in the history of Bangladesh.//////The contrast couldn't get more startling. As the BNP media centre at the chairperson's Gulshan office lay forlorn, roars of joy and pinching to make sure it wasn't all a dream reflected the mood of Awami League-led grand alliance camp.//////The turnout in ninth parliamentary election is the highest ever in the history of Bangladesh with little possibility of fake votes having been cast due to the new system with a voter roll that had photographs to confirm one's identity.//////Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) ATM Shamsul Huda has said there would be no scope for any quarter to reject the results of the ninth parliamentary election.//////Awami League (AL) President Sheikh Hasina last night urged her party men to stay calm and not to bring out any victory processions until the polls results are announced officially. //////The anti-liberation forces have been defeated once again, this time through peoples' verdict. While it is a sweet revenge for Bangladeshis against the war criminals, the verdict will make stronger the demand for their trial.//////Chief Adviser (CA) Fakhruddin Ahmed yesterday expressed the hope that the political parties would gracefully accept the results of the ninth parliamentary polls.//////Fired with enthusiasm, the first time voters representing almost one-fourth of around 81 millions on the electoral roll exercised their franchise with the hope of a positive attitude in leaders of the ninth parliament.//////Minority voters in different areas in Chittagong received threats from workers of the four-party alliance despite huge preparations and safety measures for a free and fair election.//////Thousands of voters in the capital could not vote yesterday despite repeated frantic attempts, due to an apparent mismanagement of the much ballyhooed successful voter list by the Election Commission (EC). //////A year-long nationwide campaign to try war criminals culminated in an overwhelming vote of confidence for the Sector Commanders' Forum yesterday, as their chief AK Khandakar and Rafiqul Islam swept to victory last night as part of the AL-led grand electoral alliance.//////At least eight workers of Jamaat-e-Islami including a former personal secretary of its Ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami were arrested in Pabna while 15 workers of BNP and Jatiya Party were held in three other districts for distributing money among voters yesterday.//////It was a watershed day yesterday for the Biharis in Bangladesh as for the first time since independence they cast votes in a general election here.//////One person was killed and over 50 others were injured in election-related violence across the country during yesterday's ninth parliamentary elections. //////Two seasoned political figures -- Awami League (AL) presidium member Amir Hossain Amu and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) chief Hasanul Haq Inu -- yesterday won in a parliamentary election for the first time.//////EU chief election observer Alexander Lambsdorff yesterday said political parties should accept the elections if results are credible.//////Half way into the election results, the AL-led grand alliance has taken a clear lead in the race, keeping ahead of its archrival BNP-led four-party in most constituencies. The grand alliance has already won in 19 seats and the four-party in five.//////Army Chief General Moeen U Ahmed yesterday expected that the election winners and the losers would work together for taking the country forward.//////Her face flushed with triumph, an eight-month pregnant Shefali Begum Moina finally cast her vote at about 4:30 pm after struggling to keep standing in an overcrowded line for about three hours.//////Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan yesterday said he would join the government party if he is elected from Narsingdi-3 constituency.//////Even though campaigning ended Saturday midnight, female Jamaat-e-Islami activists working for BNP candidate Sardar Sharfuddin Ahmed Santu in Barisal-2 yesterday whispered to female voters that "voting for sheaf of paddy will ensure their heaven".//////Police early yesterday arrested four suspected Islamist militants at a house only 20 feet away from the house of actor Asaduzzaman Noor, grand alliance candidate of Nilphamari-2 constituency.//////The queue was long at the Lobonchora primary school centre in Khulna. Jalal Talukder, 80, who was standing in the queue, decided to take breakfast in a roadside shop before going back to the center. He had come all the way from Dhaka from his son's house to vote for his candidate. //////Sudipta Shaheen, a fresh voter, was very enthusiastic about the polls because he thinks his single vote is no less important for victory of an honest and competent candidate.//////Armed cadres of the United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF) drove out polling agents of other candidates from at least 31 polling centres in the hill district during polling hours yesterday.//////Donning a humanitarian role, the Indian Navy and Coast Guard have rescued about 100 Bangladeshis, who were illegally taken to Thailand for fishing, and were drifting in the Indian Ocean for 12 days, an official in New Delhi said.//////Israel bombed Gaza for a third day yesterday in an "all-out war" on Hamas, as tanks massed on the border and the Islamists fired deadly rockets in retaliation for the blitz that has killed at least 345 people.//////Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh warned of "vicious and dangerous" attempts to convert political and economic problems in Iraq to an Arab-Kurdish conflict.//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the higher than expected turnout in elections in disputed Kashmir a "vote for democracy" Sunday, as results showed no one party dominated the polls.//////Attackers wielding machetes hacked to death dozens of people at a church in remote eastern Congo, witnesses said Monday, and the Ugandan army accused the Lord's Resistance Army rebels of the massacre.//////Indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria have been halted due to the Jewish state's "aggression" in Gaza, a senior Syrian official said on Sunday.//////Not since the mandate given to Bangabandhu in the 1973 election has the AL been handed such a resounding victory by the people of Bangladesh. We congratulate Sheikh Hasina and her grand alliance on their exceptional success. Massive victory imposes massive responsibility, and needless to say, the colossal victory has imposed a huge burden of responsibility on the victors, particularly Sheikh Hasina. //////The Awami League-led grand alliance has swept back to power in a stunning landslide victory that is as much a rejection of the BNP-led four-party alliance as it is an endorsement of the winners. The voters seized their day and made their voices ring out all over the land, loud and clear. Once again, the Bangladeshi electorate has demonstrated its maturity by discarding party loyalty and turning against a party in massive numbers for its failure in office and lack of vision for the future.//////On January 11, 2007 we embarked on a journey to nowhere and were beset with speculations and conjectures about where we were heading. Amid a good deal of drama and experimentations with regard to our reformed political process, we only half believed, if at all, an election to be held before the year 2008 was out. //////Surpassing all suspicions and speculations, the country now inexorably moves towards an elected government through the December 29 balloting. This election is particularly significant as the voting takes place in a different background with a variety of changes that happened after 1/11 with a rallying cry to cleanse politics.//////Standing at many intersections. What were the arguments in favour of secularism? In the 1960s, a push-back against West Pakistani colonisation. In 1971, it was simply and joyfully, a decisive rejection of the Pakistan model. Later in the 1980s, it was also expanded to explain that religion was for private space, inner life, spiritual healing; but not for politics. Now in this decade, we also insistently emphasise that religion is to be respected (because secularism's critics falsely accuse it of being anti-religion), but it should not be involved in the running of the state. //////The voting for the general election over, the proceedings of the first Test between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka resume today at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur after a rest day. //////South Africa need another 153 runs on the fifth and final day today at the MCG to overturn two decades of Australian dominance at home after Dale Steyn continued his heroics by earning 10 wickets for the game on the penultimate day of the second Test Monday.
