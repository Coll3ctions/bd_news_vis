It is but a glaring example of an accused kept in custody for one and a half decades without his guilt being proven in a court of law. The man's tryst with law began when he was picked up by the law enforcing agencies in connection with a murder case along with some other accused. But since his arrest in 1992, he did not face any trial with the case having stayed for last 12 years following a High Court order. //////IN 1970, Jordan's infamous black September was enacted by Pakistan's Colonel Ziaul Huq (later the country's president) while on a tour of duty to the Hashemite Kingdom.

For a small country in South Asia that is only 144,470 square kilometres, there is definitely a lot to see, enjoy and do here. //////Over the past couple of years, Bangladesh cricket team has shown a great deal of promise after the spectacular performances in both the 50 overs and 20 overs World Cup in the Caribbean and South Africa. However, all our hopes were shattered after their dismal performance recently against the Kiwis in New Zealand. Even though they won the T-20 match against the Kiwis, they however proved their inconsistency in the other formats of the game. I think we all know that this young Bangladeshi team is extremely talented, after seeing their amazing performance against great teams like Australia and South Africa, but they are not making the best use of this talent and the reason behind this, according to me, is their lack of confidence and self-belief. The T-20 format of the game is more suited for teams like Bangladesh, as they are used to collapsing suddenly after scoring some quick runs, but this habit of them certainly won't help them in the other versions of the game and we have seen a lot of disasters occurring due to this.//////Bird flu has not only created health hazards but also made a very unfavourable impact on the rural economy, where thousands of affected chickens have been culled to prevent possible transmission of the decease to humans.//////I would like to draw attention to the news item titled 'Freedom fighter Lt. Col. Qadir's grave traced after 36 years' published in the last column of page 16 in The Daily Star of 19 January 2008. In 1971, I was about 13 years old and lived with my parents in Chittagong and had near similar experience as Nadeem Qadir. Now I am working at the Directorate General of Health Services, Dhaka. //////I commend the efforts of the CTG to put out of circulation the corrupt politicians of Bangladesh through the legal process. I also commend their courage to take on the two autocratic ladies who thought they were beyond the reach of the law. When Sheikh Hasina says that if voted to power she would continue the current anti-corruption drive and reform process, its credibility to me is a big zero.//////Bangla and Ekushey Boi Mela are integral part of our national identity and pride. //////I refer to the news published on page 22 of the Daily Star on 16 Jan. 2008 regarding the present "Postal Service in Bangladesh".//////The lawyers' uniform opinion that, "trial of a crime, which had been committed before the promulgation of the Emergency Power Act, cannot be held under the ambit of Emergency Power Rules", defies all common sense and appears against all moral precepts. //////It is great to see that the Bangladeshi youth is taking steps to promote two of the greatest natural resorts in the world. Enhancing the publicity that these destinations receive is an important step towards promoting tourism in Bangladesh. //////Nowadays many people say that they like advertisements, rather than movies. I appreciate it. But my point of writing this letter is that after watching these advertisements, I could guess, that they cannot even remember the name of the product which has been advertised. So, I think the advertisers should concentrate on publicising the qualities of the product or on the theme they want to uphold.//////The demand of the political parties to start a dialogue without any condition sounds good but there should be a guideline and well-defined agenda for discussion. The political parties must realise that there is no scope in future to run any government driven by the whims and caprices of the party in power. //////As a local resident, I have been visiting the annual International Trade Fair in Dhaka since its inception. This year I visited the site around noon on 6 January for about two hours; and came back rather disappointed.//////Chief Adviser Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed and Army chief Gen. Moeen U Ahmed have called upon the NGOs to write off the loans or to put off the collection of payment of loan instalments from the cyclone affected people for a period of four months on humanitarian grounds. //////I myself am an educator, and once taught at the University of Dhaka. I know from my experience, many of the university teachers in Bangladesh waste much of their valuable time doing dysfunctional politics. I believe time has come for the government and the people of the country to clean up the mess on the campus, bring academic law and order back to the campus, and ensure that the universities can never be used as the centres of dirty politics by the politicians in the future. //////Many smokers argue that cigarette smoking is a gift of modern times, and it is a fashion nowadays. Some of them claim that it increases the concentration to work. But their arguments are indeed baseless. Medical studies have confirmed that there is a direct link between nicotine, which is present in tobacco, and high incidence of heart attack and cancer in smokers. These are dreadful diseases, and even the innocent non-smoking people around the smokers can be harmed by them. So, we have no moral right to smoke in public places. //////A picture was published in your daily on January 16: some young boys are pushing an electric pole to block the street.

This step was taken by ICE Technologies to promote Bangladeshi music internationally and to take an active stand against music piracy. Habib and Balam were present, along with Joshua Wayes Ahmed, head of operations and Abu Raihan, manager of IT, of ICE Technologies, at the programme.//////THE sudden surge in rice price in Bangladesh has created tremendous uproar all over the country. It certainly has made it difficult for low-income urban families to make ends meet, and given an opportunity for many politicians to capitalise on this issue and blame the government for its failure in maintaining rice prices at pre-9/11 levels. //////A Public Services Act to bring about a substantial reformation in the public services is under preparation. This act is meant to make the public services responsive, action oriented, accountable and free from political influence. //////AS a destination for eco-tourism, Bangladesh is truly hard to beat. For a small country in South Asia, that is only 144,470 square kilometers, there is definitely a lot to see, enjoy and do here. Bangladesh means "country of Bonga (ancient name of Bangladesh)" in English, whose language and independence had been gained after enormous bloodshed in 1952 and 1971. Located between India to the north and the west and Myanmar to a small part of the southeast, Bangladesh is one of the most beautiful countries in South Asia, with tremendous economic potentials. Its tropical beach resorts on the Bay of Bengal should be paradise for the sun vacationers. But the main attraction of Bangladesh should be its opportunities for eco-tourism, with its variety of animals, birds, forests, hills and hillocks and aquatic life.//////THE recent reminders by the Pakistani authorities that the media should stay "within limits" reflect the mindset of an authoritarian regime. As the legitimacy of the regime erodes further in the eyes of Pakistanis and the international community, the more its henchmen are likely to question the patriotism of those criticising it. //////Taslima Alam (not real name), 32, and her three children live in a two-room flat at East Badda, said she is facing eviction as she cannot afford to pay the monthly rent that her landlord had suddenly increased -- from Tk 4,000 to Tk 6,500.//////Language Martyr Abdul Jabbar's son, M Nurul Islam Badal, has lamented that till date little has been done to remember and respect the memories of his father. //////The LGRD ministry's project to build a bridge across Gulshan-Banani Lake may face a legal battle as environmentalist groups and locals are planning to file a writ petition against the project for not having environmental clearance and impact assessment. //////
