The reiteration of such an intent by General Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury points to the purposefulness of the campaign against overall wrongdoing the ACC is engaged in. It is certainly a commendable move, one that citizens in general and the armed forces in particular should welcome in the larger national interest. One reason why such a step is to be appreciated is the fact that it promises to add substance to the on-going drive against corruption in government, indeed in all areas that relate to the public weal.//////WE observe with a degree of dismay that despite the oft-repeated commitments by top functionaries of the government and chief of the Election Commission to holding national election by December this year, some political parties keep casting doubt in the EC's staging polls on schedule.

But I am from that British generation that still sees the policeman as a friend and protector so much so, that, when I see one, even today, my hand goes up in an automatic wave. I have had some startled looks from policemen here!//////What is the future of Iraq? What is the future of the Iraqi young people who are growing up in an environment that offers only violence and bloodshed everywhere?

When the world community raises their voice against war and injustice and try hard to make peace and love, these people are trying to spread poison. //////It is time that all the former power players of our country took stock of how much they have contributed to the well-being of the people of this country.//////The front page report (Feb: 16) in an English daily on the tariff competition being faced by BTTB states that their land line call charges are likely to be cut further! BTTB had the monopoly for long, with a carefree and complacent attitude. Now they are waking up to the reality of competitive and rapidly growing private mobile phone companies. Their age long passivity can no longer carry on. Possibly the fact of life has come alive for BTTB. Even their mobile venture, for lack of expansion and the red tape involved in getting it, has not helped them! Action and aggressive marketing cannot be the "cup of tea" for the static monopoly, that is BTTB. BTTB's well established multi-layered bureaucracy can not just be wished away overnight. They will overshadow and stall matters; meanwhile the private sector multidirectional competition is racing along, changing day by day as the market and situation demands. This may well usher in the downfall of landline telephony of BTTB; while their revenues from this sector will go on declining! The same situation may be faced by the postal wing of BTTB, as more and more courier services are proliferating .//////Although many may argue about the necessity of torture in extreme situation when life of innocent victims are on the line (i.e. in case one needs to find out the location or plan of any imminent mass-destructive effort like bomb or terror plots), just being a suspect does not warrant wholesale torture. Only the criminal should fear Rab, others should see them as a resource, a symbol of benevolent power. Power calls for responsibility. I urge the government of Bangladesh to take two basic steps as a supplement to existing training programme for the Rab members, both for ranks and files. It's absolutely necessary that they go through a continuous briefing on ethics and compassion. Rab members should understand that they are not the power as individuals; rather, they are the medium through which power is projected.//////Some Asian women leaders make themselves refreshingly different and attractive with their clothes, hair styles, shoes, ornaments and also manners. Their fashions not only work as a very powerful force in society but reflect change, development, prosperity and advancement of women. For example, Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan, was regarded as one of the fashion icons for her sartorial features-- black coat on shalwar-kamiz and black shoes. She gained huge popularity among young women in the subcontinent. //////Bravo! Mr. Badrul Ahsan for your well thought out editorial piece (6 Feb wed) on Bangla. It's about time somebody had a go at it. I totally concur with all your points. In fact you might also like to read my piece on the same subject in The Daily Star monthly Forum (June 2007). It's a national, cultural and intellectual disgrace that we are a nation quick to shed tears and blood, quick to lament on the language issue (like no other nation), and equally quick to forget all that and embrace some foreign colloquialisms, and quick to demolish what little Bangla there is. To watch some reporters (or indeed some high profile personalities) on TV wrestling with the pronunciation of some words, is to wonder why on earth did we have Ekushey at all. //////Sugary drinks have been blamed for a surge in cases of the painful joint disease gout. Men who consume two or more sugary soft drinks a day have an 85 per cent higher risk of gout compared with those who drink less than one a month, a study suggests. Cases in the U.S. have doubled in recent decades and it seems fructose, a type of sugar, is to blame, the British Medical Journal study reports. UK experts said those with gout would be advised to cut out sugary drinks. The symptoms of painful, swollen joints, mainly in the lower limbs, are caused when uric acid crystallises out of the blood into the joints.//////Sometimes I need to drop my daughter at Brac University at Mohakhali and every time I gain bitter experience while parking the vehicle, and at times parking has to be made far away from the university building. Not only this, my driver's experience is more shocking as he faces a terrible situation in the morning while several students of the university arrive at a given time. Moreover, fear of possible police harassment is also there for wrong parking. The front parking place always remains congested due to heavy traffic and pedestrian movement as well as haphazard parking on the other side of the road. //////Of late The Daily Telegraph in Britain suggested not to count Al Gore completely out of the presidential picture of the United States. Obviously, more recently the momentum has shifted to Barack Obama after a string of primary and caucus victories. However, the Clinton camp purportedly believes that if Obama doesn't deliver a knock-out blow before the March 4 primaries in Texas and Ohio, Hillary could win those races and regain the momentum, with many super delegates uniting behind her to preserve party unity.//////All these years after independence the people have been leading a life against their expectation of living in a country free from all sorts of corruption, where the rule of law is established, no one is deprived of fundamental rights and security of life is fully ensured.//////Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert vowed yesterday he would push for a comprehensive peace settlement with the Palestinians but cast doubt on meeting a US-backed goal of sealing it this year. //////Hardcore militants who seized Pakistan's most scenic valley are still holed up in its snowy heights, three months after President Pervez Musharraf sent in the army to show his resolve against spreading Islamic extremism. //////The United States Monday pressed for a prompt UN Security Council vote on a new set of sanctions against Iran over its disputed nuclear programme, which Tehran warned would harm the credibility of the UN nuclear watchdog. //////The Iraqi government yesterday denounced a recent Turkish incursion and demanded an immediate withdrawal of the troops from northern Iraq. //////Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice won a verbal assurance Tuesday from China to use its influence to jump-start the stalled process of dismantling North Korea's nuclear programmes.

It was immediately recognised by the United States, Britain and a number of other countries. But Russia, following Serbia's lead, has ostentatiously advertised its anger at the move. //////HOW inevitable is the ascendancy of Asia, and how should the West respond? That is the question that Kishore Mahbubani wrestles with in The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East. In the book, he makes an impassioned plea for big changes in what he sees as the West's arrogant and ignorant approach to Asia.//////THE negotiations on North Korea's nuclear programs are stuck in the familiar territory of a standoff between the United States and North Korea over the existence of a uranium-enrichment program. North Korea had promised to end all its nuclear activities in return for shipments of aid and diplomatic concessions. Though it has closed its reactor at Yongbyong, US officials say it has failed to comply with the second phase of the process -- providing a complete accounting of all of its nuclear programs by December 31, 2007.//////Inclusion of photo ID cards in the process of voter listing was one of the main reasons people were enthusiastic about the project but now many are not happy with their photographs taken for the ID cards.//////Investigation of the cases filed with the 33 police stations under Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) is being hampered due to lack of adequate manpower as the officers available now for the job are unable to accomplish the uphill task effectively.//////A division bench of the High Court (HC) Monday asked the government to explain within ten days as to why construction of the Gulshan-Banani link bridge across the Gulshan Lake should not be declared illegal. //////
