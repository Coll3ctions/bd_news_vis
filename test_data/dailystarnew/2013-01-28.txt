The trial of the heinous war criminals of '71 is essential for the establishment of rule of law. It will do justice to the victims of the War of Independence. It can be said that the impartiality and credibility of the proceedings have maintained international standard. This is because the trials held by the Tribunals give the accused the right to defend himself in the court, right to appeal etc. //////The recent initiative of food minister to set up Bangladesh Food Safety Authority (BFSA) with a view to preventing food adulteration and ensuring food safety is a very positive move. The widespread use of formalin and chemical preservatives in all types of food stuffs has been posing serious health hazards. Producers and marketers apply this harmful substance to preserve and forcibly ripen fruits. Food adulteration causes cancer, kidney disorder, skin disease and birth defects, etc. We know from newspapers that BFSA will have five divisions such as Surveillance & Enforcement Division, Food Safety Laboratory Division, Quality Assurance (CODEX) Division, Risk Assessment & Communication Division, and Resources and Support Division. We do hope that these divisions will work very sincerely and ensure adulteration-free food stuff right from the production to consumption. Regular meetings and dialogues with the producers and marketers and mass people could be very useful as their involvement in the entire process is really important to make it a success. Finally, I would like to thank the food minister for taking such noble steps to save the people of Bangladesh from this menace.//////I am a resident of Chittagong. In Chittagong city not a single seating service bus exists. The buses which are now plying the roads are very old. At office time it becomes very difficult to get on a bus because all of them remain overcrowded. If a bus has the capacity of carrying maximum 60 passengers, it often carries 100 passengers and stops frequently at any point of the road for taking more passengers. This often leads to quarrel between passengers and the driver and the helper, but to no avail. As a result, it becomes difficult to attend office in time. I draw the attention of the authorities concerned to take necessary action regarding the issue.//////It is indeed great news that BRAC, a Bangladeshi NGO has been nominated as top NGO among 450 such organisations around the world. //////I live in Pallabi Extension, Mirpur.

We urge the authorities to free the footpath and the road for pedestrians' use.//////Several months back, the draft National Agriculture Policy was finalised by the Ministry of Agriculture and it was supposed to be made public after due approval of the cabinet and passage in parliament long ago. Unfortunately, the National Agriculture Policy is yet to get through different channels for final approval and release. //////Such astonishing claims for ICT were made by the article 'Smart schools and globalisation' (Jan 20) that one wonders how Shakespeare, Goethe and Tagore managed without it! It may help in gaining 'knowledge' but there was no mention of 'wisdom'. To make a country which people want to live in rather than flee, education has to do more than teach pupils to be 'smart' and ignore the greater calling to be 'a good human being'? Of course, every student needs to learn how to 'face the challenge of globalisation' but it may not help to know how to access the good stuff which can lead to friendship and understanding but also what is idiotic, corrupting and destructive and can lead to vicious enmity and prejudice.//////It is said that teachers are the conscience of a nation. But this great saying doesn't match with the behaviour of some university teachers. It is only normal that students will go to teachers if they face any problem about their studies. Teachers should listen to their problems and come forward to solve those. To my utter surprise, at present many teachers are not at all ready to render their noble service, rather they misbehave with students very often. How will we learn to respect our teachers if we do not get help from them in the time of our need?//////The flow of foreign fighters into Syria, flood of arms across North Africa, war in Mali and terror attacks highlight the jihadists' return in a region rocked by the Arab Spring, diplomats and analysts say.//////French and Malian troops were restoring government control over the fabled Saharan trading town of Timbuktu yesterday, the latest gain in a fast-moving French-led offensive against al-Qaeda-allied fighters occupying northern Mali.//////Hackers claiming to be from the activist group Anonymous have hacked a US government website in response to the death of Aaron Swartz.//////Six people were killed and more than 400 injured in Egypt's Port Said yesterday as rioting sparked by death sentences passed on fans of a local football team rocked the canal city for a second straight day.//////Insurgents killed a total of 23 policemen across Afghanistan within 24 hours, officials said yesterday, reflecting the increasing police role in the war before the withdrawal of Nato troops.//////John Kerry is the son of a US diplomat, who grew up among the rubble of Berlin, criss-crossed Europe as a child, fought in Vietnam, has met many world leaders and negotiated tough deals for America.//////Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday said she is still "fond" of her country's army, even though it kept her under house arrest for 15 years.//////After days of high tensions along the Kashmir border, trade relations between the rivals would likely be resumed today, said an official source yesterday.//////Thousands of people marched in Washington carrying white placards marked with the names and pictures of gun crime victims on Saturday to demand stronger gun control legislation.//////Riot police squads yesterday worked to establish full control over a prison in northwestern Venezuela, where a riot has left at least 61 inmates dead and twice as many wounded.//////President Hugo Chavez has beaten a severe respiratory infection that occurred after his latest cancer surgery in Cuba, Venezuelan Communications Minister Ernesto Villegas said Saturday in Santiago.//////Two people were missing and the body of a third person was recovered from raging floodwaters as severe storms pounded northeastern Australia yesterday, forcing more than 1,000 to flee their homes.//////Two landslides triggered by heavy rains killed at least 11 people and left 19 others missing on Indonesia's Sumatra island, officials said yesterday.//////This is a good year for Bangladesh, on the cultural front, and the year has just begun.

It is time to review its performance, particularly in governance, to see how far it has accomplished our hopes and aspirations.

There had been interruptions in the political development when it was stifled by coups d'etat. //////Have you noticed them?
