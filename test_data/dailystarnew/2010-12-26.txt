Besides, even when significant public opinion surveys point to the many things which are going wrong in the country, the authorities have quickly adopted a posture that is truly disappointing for the nation. Last week, the government in general and the police administration in particular came down heavily on Transparency International Bangladesh over its findings that the police in the country conveyed an extremely corrupt image before the public. Where introspection and careful analysis of the TIB report was called for, the government simply went for a knee-jerk response and questioned the modalities upon which the report had been prepared. It left broad sections of society wondering why the government was displaying such thin skin when it came to a revelation of some harsh truths.//////Passenger traffic and operators of lorries with cargo on the Dhaka-Aricha highway set to use ferries at Paturia-Daulatdia to cross the Padma are hard done by. Given the volumes of passenger and goods on this route 14 ferries are required. As against this pressing need, only eight ferries are said to be operating, that too virtually on paper. Since the conditions of these ferries are deplorable one or the other would be found out of order at any given time. In fact some of them have outlived their utility thanks to poor maintenance or sloppy repair work.//////The good news for Bangladesh and the country's cricket lovers is that pace bowler Mashrafe Bin Mortaza may return to the sport as early as three weeks.

After having hit all time lows against the Swiss franc, the euro recovered on Wednesday, boosted by a news report that China was ready to buy significant amounts of Portuguese sovereign debt. The Jornal de Negocios daily reported China is looking to buy between 4 billion euros ($5.26 billion) and 5 billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt to help the country ward off pressure in debt markets, though it gave no details of its sources. China's central bank declined to comment on the report which said the deal reached between the two governments will lead to China buying Portuguese debt in auctions or in the secondary markets during the first quarter of 2011. Despite the bounce, investors are nervous about the single currency's prospects given the euro zone's debt problems.

They don't have the extra money to buy presents for their children, family, and friends. Many are saddened at Christmas time when they think of their loved ones who will not be able to come home for various reasons. Turkey dinners may be only a wish and not a reality for some. //////Unfortunate but true, some people in our society believe that Asthma is a contagious disease! They usually prevents the little children of the family to come in contact with the elderly family members (e.g. grandpa, grandma, etc.) having Asthma for fear that the former might get infected by the latter as Asthma being a contagious disease, of course according to their assessment. In fact, Asthma is neither a contagious (infectious) nor a communicable (transmitted by the patient to healthy person either by direct or by indirect contact) disease. Asthma is actually a disorder of the respiratory air-passage. Many people around the world suffer from Asthma. The actual cause of Asthma is yet to be identified but several factors which include allergies, hereditary connection, environmental elements, etc., are responsible for triggering asthma. For instance, the present changing of weather in our country is triggering asthma in the patients.//////Valerie Ann Taylor, the founder and coordinator of Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP), received an honorary doctorate degree in Health Sciences from York St John University, UK.

'Coalition for the Urban Poor', an organisation working for this people, provides this information. These people sleep on the pavements, islands and park benches. They can hardly find any abandoned building for passing the night nowadays, though even a decade back, many homeless people could live in the deserted govt. buildings. Now corridors of the market and community centre also remain closed at night with tight security.//////Your back page photograph published on December 21st showed a number of makeshift thatched bamboo matted tin-roofed shops. However, the description of the photograph opined that these makeshift shops are 'damaging the coral'! The latter part of the description, that it is 'ruining the beauty of the tourist attraction' is well justified. The reason for the damage to the underlying coral structure covered under the beach sand, is, however, not clear. I will request the concerned 'Star' personnel to kindly explain this phenomenon. //////Jingle bells, Jingle bells, jingle all the way- Christmas has returned once again in the midst of heavy snowfall in Europe and chilly, wintry weather in Asia, the day commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ.

Our Foreign Office (and curiously our Prime Minister's Office) is working out the dates and other details with the South Block in Delhi. There is anticipation in Dhaka that this visit could be seminal and put our bilateral relationship on a new trajectory. Many think that the last visit of our Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Delhi had broken new ground. In that context, the visit to Dhaka by the Indian prime minister will allow the growing relationship to now take hold.//////New words are an annual media byproduct without a balance sheet. The profit is not immediately visible, and loss not worth the count. The New York Times has produced a thirty-plus list that seems more obligatory than essential. Most words show the strains of artifice. Fortunately, terms like "sofalize" (socialising from home, through the net) will die a natural death after their fifteen seconds of fame. The hideous "mansplainer" just might get fifteen minutes of life, since it denotes a compulsive male opinion-giver and is therefore perfectly suited for TV pundits, but it is really too weak to survive.//////In their well circulated book, ////// (1953), Robert Dahl and Charls Lindblom have argued that the critical question is not how to plan but (a) who shall plan (b) for what purpose (c) in what condition and (d) with what devices? Many other economists of the world have endorsed this argument. //////The United Nations Mission to Nepal, UNMIN, is to be thanked profusely for its efforts with the peace process and graciously shown the door when its term expires on January 15. In the meantime, Nepali political actors, including the Maoists, must concentrate on making successful a unique process that was designed by Nepali stakeholders, starting with the 12-point understanding of 2005.//////World Aids Day 2010 was recently observed. To create awareness, our government also observed the day in collaboration with the NGOs. But do we think really about the situation of the HIV positive persons in our country? They are often discriminated against and stigmatised in different ways. An HIV positive person is considered polygamous, even if he/she is not, in Bangladesh where polygamy is treated negatively by the society. He/she faces hatred, and is often shunned by his/her own friends and family. //////
