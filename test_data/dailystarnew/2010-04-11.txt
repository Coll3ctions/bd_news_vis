Chidamabaram's offer of resignation in the face of the massacre of 76 security personnel in an ambush by Maoist guerrillas brings two important points to the fore. The first is of course an image of democracy as it should be working. By offering to quit and by taking full responsibility for the tragedy, Chidambaram has only underscored the vitality along which Indian democracy, warts and all, continues to function. At a time when not many men and women in powerful positions around the world are willing to admit failure or acknowledge responsibility for things that go wrong, Chidambaram's act truly reflects the spirit in which a democratic system of government should work. A fundamental principle of such a system is the readiness of the individual at the top to be fully accountable for everything done in and by his organization. That his resignation has not been accepted is of course another matter.//////The opening evening of the National Cricket League T20s will see the finalists of the tournament's first-class version take on each other at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium today.

The condition of the animals shocked me very much.//////Dhaka, the core city of Bangladesh, is becoming simply unliveable! Its gigantic pulling power is the main reason behind such an intolerable situation. Decentralization is an urgent need of the hour. But how? Thousands of people are coming to this city every day, thousands of causes are there! Employment, education, treatment, amusement..! A major portion of them are environmental refugees affected by river erosion, cyclones, floods! Other cities are unable to fulfil their demands.//////This issue was reported in all dailies on March 31. However, it raises an interesting fundamental question. Who and how will the ban be manned for enforcement? Without strict and effective follow-up on compliance and enforcement, the measure is bound to fail!//////It may sound weird, but it is a reality. It takes almost 2 hours to travel from Kalabagan to Banani and vice verse on all days except on holidays by a motorized vehicle. In the sixties we could go to Banani within half an hour on a rickshaw from Kalabagan and within 10 to 15 minutes by a car.//////I refer to the article entitled 'Salary Hike for the High-ups' published in the editorial page of your daily of March 10, 2010. While I agree in principle with Mr Latif Mondol about the unjustified hike in salaries and privileges of persons holding public offices, I differ with his comment that a large number of the current MPs are otherwise very rich. MPs are not supposed to receive salaries like public servants. They can at best claim some compensation for the time they devote to betterment of their respective constituencies. I know about some of the MPs who did not have legal earnings of more than Taka 10,000.00 a month before they became MPs. Compensation amounting to approximately Taka 100,000.00 a month including proposed salary, benefits of housing, transport, telephone, attendance of sessions, medical, insurance, travelling etc cannot be justified. Nobody will be able to monitor how much of the discretionary allowance of Taka 300,000.00 will be spent for the constituents. //////The news entitled "10 minutes shock at JS" published in The Daily Star (04th March 2010) is not only shocking for the people of the country but also it has thrown the nation into deep, dark shadows of shame. Lawmakers of both the ruling party and the opposition rushed towards each other gesturing aggressively. They exchanged extremely indecent and vulgar words on the floor, most of which are 'unprintable'. We are really astounded at such 'unparliamentary' behaviour of our parliament members. The national assembly is not a place for cock-fight and emitting filthy jargons and to create a mayhem-like ambience, rather it is a place for taking and making decisions and plans to run the country and to build up the nation. Obviously, JS is supposed to play a representative role and it is likely to reflect the dreams and hopes of the nation. But what happened during the parliamentary sessions seriously hurt the image of the nation. //////People say, or the saying goes, 'Don't speak ill of the dead'. But it is our ill luck that our MPs get themselves locked in debates over the two dead leaders calling them 'murderers' and that too in the sacred House of the Nation defying the ethical convention to be observed there and skipping over the burning issues of the nation that are pushing us behind in almost every sector. It I was too bad for an AL lawmaker to raise the issue of late President Ziaur Rahman that it was not his corpse that was buried in the Chandrima or Zia Uddayn and he reiterated his claim. His claim and insistence on that is simply unscrupulous and a futile attempt that brewed up trouble in the House leading to the opposition's walk-outs. He should have reckoned with the sentiment of a greater majority of the people who heartily love and respect Zia, and that the people have been visiting the place and praying for him since he was killed and buried there in 1981. You cannot destroy the people's belief and detract them from what is deeply entrenched in them and from the established fact. //////Biotechnology, as the word suggests, is the "fusion of biology and technology" using biological techniques for product research and development. The question is: is biotechnology a friend or foe of the environment? While there are no doubts that biotechnology has some downsides, I feel that biotechnology is definitely a friend of the environment. Biotechnology is largely involved in energy production. We all know that the demand of energy in the modern world is increasing drastically. Biotechnology may be a good source. Biotechnology, in Phytoremediation, can be used to clean up the environment. One example is the use of microbes to clean up wastewater. Besides, it has a great role in reducing pesticides use. Naturally, some pesticides are recalcitrant in nature and not easily digestible. Biotechnology can help the environment considerably in an effective way. Another important task of it is to produce maximum yield with limited land resource and thus conserve biodiversity. These techniques are environmentally safe.//////Bangladesh is passing through a crucial time with its energy crisis. The energy security is threatened here. With power gas and water crisis people are suffering most. Load shedding is very much regular. In 24 hours of time, electricity/power is available for 7-9 hours and it also varies from place to place. The newspapers have published detailed reports on load shedding. This Energy security has obstructed our agriculture and industrial production. On 30 March, a newspaper reported that due to the energy crisis our industrial production has declined by 30 percent. It has also reduced national investment.//////Don't ask me to eradicate corruption because without it we will see a surge of the good who will ultimately drive us away from the scene. Don't you know it is the Chhatra League that helped us do anarchy all over the country prior to our coming to power and don't you know the police will support our marauding activists as long as we let them to be steeped in corruption? Before pointing finger to us do some soul searching and discover how deluded you were in electing us to power again and again, knowing full well that we were always for one party rule and that famine followed our misrule. //////Nowadays a burning question is why under Islamic law women's share of the inherited wealth is only half that of a man. And various initiatives are being taken to enact a law that will ensure women's equal rights to their parents' property. But we should understand logically the reasons behind the Islamic law. A brief explanation is given below in this regard.//////We all know what the benefits of smoking are. But the smokers will never listen to any advice.

Let them do it. //////The United States and Afghanistan yesterday sought to draw a line under a recent diplomatic row, downplaying talk of a damaging rift and stressing their commitment to work together.//////At least 48 militants were killed in a gunfight and an air strike in Pakistan's north-western tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, officials said yesterday.//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh left for the United States yesterday to attend a two-day security summit, saying he hoped the event would focus on issues such as "nuclear terrorism."//////Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapakse, whose party cemented his political dominance by winning a majority in parliamentary elections, promised yesterday to bring peace and prosperity to a nation battered by decades of civil war.//////At least six people have been killed and almost 500 injured after violent clashes in Bangkok between security forces and anti-government protesters, emergency services said yesterday.//////The need for a new global climate deal is "greater than ever", according to developing country delegates speaking at the opening of UN climate talks.//////Funeral ceremonies are being held in Kyrgyzstan for some of the at least 78 people killed during a violent uprising that ousted the president.//////Japan's former finance minister Kaoru Yosano and four other political veterans yesterday launched a new party ahead of July polls as their conservative opposition camp struggles to regain power.//////More than half a million Filipinos living overseas, who help pump billions of dollars into the Philippines' economy, yesterday began voting for a new president.//////Poland's acting head of state declared a week of mourning after the crash yesterday in Russia of a Polish government plane which killed president Lech Kaczynski and scores of other officials.//////Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said yesterday that no meeting had been scheduled with his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the Nuclear Safety Summit in Washington.//////Noted troupe Theatre Art Unit brings a new production to the stage.

The director along with Krishnagati Chattopadhyay played the central characters in the play that depicts a young Indian entrepreneur's sudden crisis in New York.//////THE current electricity, water and gas crises, coupled with high prices of daily consumption goods for the middle and the poor classes, and compounded with low prices received by agricultural product growers, have put the present government on the defensive. //////EMPOWERED by his recent success in reforming the US healthcare system and in reaching an arms control treaty with Russia, President Barack Hussein Obama has finally told Israel "enough is enough." What is interesting is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the great defender of the concept of Greater Israel, unwittingly provided him with the opportunity to do so. //////BANGLADESH has made impressive progress towards achieving primary education for all over the last two decades. Yet, development of primary education poses a daunting challenge because of inaccessibility and resource constraint. //////P. Chidambaram first tried out the resignation route to heroism when he was in P.V. Narasimha Rao's Cabinet. Rao, a bit like his protg Dr Manmohan Singh, was a Prime Minister wrought by fate; he had, in fact, retired because of a heart condition and sent his impressive library to Hyderabad, where he intended to spend his time. He did not contest the elections for the 1991 Parliament that made him prime minister. The younger Congress leaders, consequently, tended to underestimate him. Rao surprised the political class, and shocked the victim, by accepting Chidambaram's resignation. The scar never quite healed; Chidambaram eventually started his own party, and was brought back into the Congress mainstream only by Mrs Sonia Gandhi.//////EVERY year at about this time, city dwellers should show their gratitude to the man who gave us our skylines.
