If there ever was any hope that remedial measures would be taken to deal with the problem, it now seems that hope was belied. That much becomes clear through a front-page report in this newspaper yesterday. Pollution in the rivers has reached such an alarming point that now even the groundwater system is getting contaminated. That is most distressing, given that aquifers are recharged from the riverbeds and the water is then made available to the population. Our report, based on the findings of a survey carried out jointly by the World Bank and the Institute of Water Modelling (IWM), points up the dilemma we have before us. We either let the pollution take wider swathes of our rivers or we take decisive action against all those individuals and elements responsible for the degradation of the rivers.//////WE express our deep concern over the deaths of some BDR personnel in the custody of the various law enforcing agencies. The issue is important on two counts: one, we are talking about human life; two, we are talking about the image of the country. Bangladesh has an empowered and functional judicial system that can take care of such crimes. Therefore, in no way, extra-judicial measures can be given a blank cheque by anybody. To be candid, unusual deaths of suspects in custody is an endemic problem in this country. Therefore, the explanation of the deaths of BDR men given by representatives of the security forces do not always sound credible enough. Such deaths remind us of the old issue of custodial deaths under the past governments, which have been widely criticised by the people of this country, including this daily. Despite repeated urging, no government launched a vigorous investigation to unearth the truth behind such unwarranted deaths in police custody.   //////LAW and order in Bangladesh has seldom been good. But never before has it been so bad as now. On earlier occasions, we could at least indulge in wishful thinking that things would improve, our law enforcing agencies would come of age, and, above all, the people at the helm would mature enough to rid us of the menace. //////ONCE upon a time Islamic civilisation was a bastion of intellectual debate and freedom of thought.

Due to the inability of PDB to provide the required amount of electricity to the people, the load shedding is a familiar phenomenon for all of us for quite a long time now and we are used to it by some extent as well! But the manner in which the load shedding is happening these days has broken all the records of the past. The PDB has to cut the electricity in almost each alternate hour digitally in every locality due to the huge shortfall of power. They are blaming the previous governments and many other factors like shortfall of gas and illegal electricity connections for this present horrible condition. But this blame game will not ease the woes of the sufferers. Once there was a time when we used to tackle the load shedding by using generators and IPS. But those days are gone by now. Since the IPS does not get the required time to recharge due to regular power cuts, so how could it supply electricity every hour? And generators are also running out of oil due to frequent power cuts. //////During and much before the 1960's Dhaka was a  quiet  city or  town where people used to know more or less everyone and the city had separate areas for living, working and entertainment!//////It is  strange and a cause for dismay to note  that our  neighbour, India, is holding the Indian Premier League (IPL) in far away South Africa, instead of  their own country, where it indeed should be held.  With India having the fourth largest army in the world and a strong para-military force to boot, it is rather  inexplicable.//////The good news  is  that our neighbouring state of Tripura in India is going to get bricks  from Bangladesh worth  Taka 200 crore as quoted by the President of India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce & Industries (IBCCI).

To get  extra benefits,  students try to be  part of politics. So,  they follow a political party of their own choice and become  members of the student front of that particular party. When  that  political party is in power, the student activists  create anarchy  on the  campus to dominate over other students or to harass the followers of opposition  parties. ////// Indian Premier League is one of the most enjoyable cricket tournaments in the world. This T20 format has become immensely popular since its  introduction  in 2008 and it took the attention of the whole world.  Finally, it's here. The moment we all  have been waiting for. The stadiums are packed, the television is set, and billions of fans wait expectantly for the South African curtains to rise.  The masses go hysterical; unfortunately it is a different scenario in Bangladesh. Despite people's great interest we are unable to watch the games due to the recently added agony of the citizens-- 'Load shedding',  it has broken all  records and we are plunged into darkness when these games are being played. It is  so painful that you do not even feel like watching the rest when the electricity is back. We are becoming so used to this poor electricity supply that we hardly talk against it these days. //////Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) is a centre of creating good doctors and it is also a healing centre.

Though it is not  a new practice in our country,  but people hardly know the actual purpose.

The government claims that the changes in civil service are necessary. Who is benefited through this practice?  //////The present Awami League led government's main mandate in the election was to make Bangladesh a prosperous nation by the year 2021.

But sassy finally seems too small for Arthur, who died on April 25 of cancer at age 86. It connotes perkiness and feistiness; Arthur, on the other hand, exuded too much stature and presence to possess sassiness -- even to need it, really. Physically (at 59), in her husky voice and in her imperious stature, she was a daunting presence, and even her nimblest one-liners seemed to vibrate up from deep in the earth. Sassy? She ate sassy for breakfast. //////
