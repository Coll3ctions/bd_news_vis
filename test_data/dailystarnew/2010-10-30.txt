The diesel engine stops with a harsh sound. Exhaust fumes are winding into dark clouds. It is a routine picture with this bus. There is plenty of room for controversy as to whether it can be called a bus. It is little bigger than a minibus and much smaller than an ordinary one. It has a turtle neck. This grotesque shape is made by a local carpenterDilu Mistry. His name is so strikingly inscribed on its body that it must tickle your fancy on sight. But this optical attraction flees through the window when you get on it through the narrow door in huddles.

Smoking already causes millions of deaths each year from cancer and heart disease.//////Human behaviour is too complex to deal the patient as a whole by a single professional. Rather treatment of the patients with mental illness needs a psychiatric team comprising of psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker and psychiatric nurse. Clinical psychology is a heath profession that involves specialised knowledge of psychological functioning and psychological methods, which provides particular expertise in carrying out psychological assessments e.g. psychometric tests, formulating problems psychologically, psychological treatments and psychological methods of research and evaluation. Their work can range from prevention and early intervention of minor problems of adjustment to dealing with the adjustment and maladjustment of individuals whose disturbance requires then to be institutionalised.//////The whole world is sick with security fever. The etiology of the ailment has multi-faceted strings of comprehension. Ever since human beings started their roller-coaster of existence on this planet they have been concerned with it for their proliferation, perpetuation and further extension of lives. At first this war was against the inhospitable nature, when this was tamed a bit and rudimentary specialization emerged and competition for the available resources intensified along with the accompanying increase in population, the question of security was redirected against human beings. Mutual collaboration of homo sapiens got circumscribed within a narrower field of amiability. In course of time one human group was subjected to abject condition by another i.e. the blacks by the whites usurping their rights of humane existence. The system of literal slavery gave Aristotle, Plato and other philosophers the security and comfort of leading a rarefied life and pontificating on anything including the slaves on whose blood they were celebrating their knowledge and argumentation. The security of the privileged class was guaranteed snatching the rights of the people who were treated as mere chattels. The feudal system of attached slavery of the peasants to land was deposed through the inauguration of reign of terror during French revolution. Guillotine worked as the judge of restoring security for the exploited millions. Dickens' 'A tale of two cities' recounts the mass-frenzy partially with powerful imagery of description and profound analysis of plot. It is always the so-called powerful interest-groups who exploit the teeming millions and devise and design the security system to safeguard their accumulated wealth through policing mechanism. //////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paid a three-day visit to Japan from October 24th, 2010.to exchange views with Japanese leaders.

If you come to know her, you have to admire her. //////Poetry nourishes and refreshes the soul. And Sabahat Jahan's collection of poetry, Rough Edges, does just that. It is like a gust of fresh air to the reader. Her poems are thought provoking and reflective of a young mind of this generation. Through concise words and phrases she expresses her rich imaginative self. Simple in approach, yet the poems touch the reader's mind and make him or her delve into deeper meanings.//////Namita Devidayal addressed her gentle, nurturing Brahmin music teacher Dhondutai as 'baiji,' whose whisper sounded like, 'You will be my little goddess my Bhairavi,' an early morning raga, the wife of cosmic dance destroyer Shiva. She is like the moody mythical goddess, sometimes a pining lover, and a seductress---always the mysterious female force which overpowers evil. This work, Devidayal's first, is dedicated to Dhondutai Kulkarni, whose ancestors were from Kolhapur. The music teacher moved to Bombay in 1978-79, lived in a small apartment with Ayi, her mother, in the neighborhood of Kennedy Bridge which was only ten minutes away from Namita's home in Cumballa Hills. Reading this autobiographical reportage, that it 'was a lifetime of learning---and not just of music,' tracing the legacy of the Jaipur Gharana, an intellectual school, and one of the pillars of Indian classical music, is sheer delight. The cover design by Rachana, photo by Ishika represents Dhondutai 50, five feet tall, 'remarkably youthful attributed to never having married' protg of the Jaipur Gharana, at a concert. Kesarbai recalls, ' you were in a white silk nine yard sari with a gold border, and wore your hair in a long plait walked onto the stage with great confidence started with a perfect sa you sang raga Bhoop' ////// --- Samuel Johnson//////
