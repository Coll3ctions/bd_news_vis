To my utter disbelief and horror, history repeated itself, and this time with even more brutality. The history of the subcontinent is full of bloodshed and assassination of cult figures: MK Gandhi, Sheikh Mujib, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Senior Bhutto, and now his daughter Benazir Bhutto. One common pattern visible through all these assassinations and bloodsheds is that the targets are obvious, the comparatively secular leaders. In Bangladesh we have seen life threatening attempts on Hasina, who though has compromised with the secular identity of her party, still remains the strongest semi-secular leader in the country. Gandhis were believed to be the epitome of secularism despite their consequent denigration. The causes of these murders are arguably different but the outcomes are strikingly similar: the assassination of Gandhis emboldened the strength of BJP, the death of Mujib paved the way for fundamental and anti liberation elements within the country, and the hanging of senior Bhutto terminated any possibility of secular and democratic resurgence in Pakistan compounded by the unceremonious role of military leaders. //////As the US presidential race for 2008 is shaping up, domestic issues are now dominating the political debate. Even Iraq war, which earlier dominated the debate, is now down in the list of priorities.

War on terrorism, which was the hallmark of the Bush administration, is no longer the major public concern.//////We have been watching the pictures of Sidr victims of South Bangladesh in cable TVs. It is obvious that the people of those areas are so poor that they cannot afford to construct strong shelters, which can sustain a cyclone like Sidr. The governments in the past constructed shelters to save people from cyclone and tsunami. But those are not enough in number to accommodate all the people. The present government is preparing projects with its own funds as well as with the help of donors to build more shelters. It sounds nice. The experts also support this idea as a short-term measure to save human lives. To supplement the short-term measure additional long-term measures are also needed to reduce future sufferings of the people in the costal belt. The following projects may be considered://////Today we mourn the sudden and tragic death of the former prime minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto. This is a tragic loss not only for the people of Pakistan but also for the people who loved and respected her dearly. //////The report that Paris-bound statues were stolen from Dhaka airport was very surprising.

We were a team of Bagerhat Red Crescent volunteers, IFRC Bangladesh employees and Danish Red Cross delegates. Our purpose was to assess the need for psychosocial support. We went to the south most village of Sarankhola called Bogi, adjacent to Sundarbans. We conducted different focus group discussions with women, adolescents, young children and men.//////Energy saving bulb or less power consuming electric bulb that is Fluorescent or incandescent bulb has been marketed in Bangladesh and is being used in most of the places --from hospitals, industrial units to homes. Fluorescent lamp uses 1/4th energy of incandescent lamp and lasts as much as 10 times longer. Fluorescent bulb contains toxic materials like mercury. Improper disposal of it releases mercury into air, soil, water, thus endangering human health. It needs H2E( www.h2e-online.org) recommended 10 steps disposal. Approximately 95% of the power consumed by an incandescent bulb is emitted as heat, rather than as visible light. An incandescent light bulb, with this 5% efficiency, is about one quarter as efficient as a fluorescent lamp (about 20% efficiency), and produces about six times as much heat with the same amount of light from both sources. Both fluorescents and incandescent bulbs are hazardous for human health as well as for the environment. //////I am writing after reading a shocking piece of news that I just went through in newspapers (Dec 26, 2007), that two endangered Olive Ridley Sea Turtle have been sold in front of the Shib Mandir near Tanti Bazar in Dhaka city.//////Kenya's main opposition party postponed a "million-man" rally here yesterday after police used tear gas and water cannon to disrupt the planned protest against last week's presidential poll results. //////President Pervez Musharraf must quit if Pakistan is to regain stability in the wake of the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, a think-tank said Thursday. //////US President George W Bush believes an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal will be reached this year, according to excerpts of an interview published on Thursday ahead of his visit to the region. //////India has asked Myanmar to speed up the process of political reforms and national reconciliation, amidst growing international pressure on New Delhi to nudge Yangon to end suppression of pro-democracy activists in that country.//////Even if Pakistan had held elections on time instead of delaying them in the wake of the chaos unleashed by Benazir Bhutto's killing, President Pervez Musharraf was set to lose, analysts say. //////An Indian engineer and six Afghan policemen were killed Thursday when a suicide bomber blew himself amid security forces investigating an earlier explosion in western Afghanistan, an official said. //////High waves lashed hundreds of homes in eastern Indonesia Thursday, forcing about 1,000 people to flee but causing no casualties, an official said yesterday. //////Popular Internet site Facebook on Thursday said two purported profiles of slain Pakistan politician Benazir Bhutto's son Bilawal were not authentic, and that the company had taken them down. //////Presidential hopefuls urged their partisans to brave the cold and rally fellow Iowans to the caucuses Thursday, a massive test of organisation that held the key to victory in the first contests of the 2008 election season.

Glaciers and ice caps will melt at faster rates. Occurrence of extreme floods and droughts will increase. Water stress will increase globally while water quality will deteriorate. //////Carbon trading is a market mechanism intended to tackle global warming. Though it dates back to 1989 it only took off as a market after the Kyoto Protocol was signed by some 180 countries in December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan. The Protocol calls for 38 industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions between the years 2008 and 2012 to levels that are 5.2 percent lower than those of 1990. Carbon is an element stored in fossil fuels such as coal and oil. When these fuels are burned, carbon dioxide is released and acts as what we term a "greenhouse gas". Carbon is the common denominator in all polluting gases that cause global warming. Under Kyoto, each participating government has its own national target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. This was an important issue discussed in recent Bali conference. US Senate has recently discussed a climate change bill promoting carbon trading.//////According to United Nations World Commission of Environment and Development, sustainable development means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.//////
