At least initially. For many, however, first impression is their last impression, even if facts change. In an unfortunate manifestation of our lingering colonial mentality, this proclivity to believe takes a quantum leap if the message is packaged and delivered by a Westerner.//////In 2001, the median age of Bangladesh population was about 18 years. From 1951, the death rate started declining but with little effect on birth rate. The population increased from 40.21 million in 1951, 89.9 million in 1981,109.9 million in 1991and 130.5 million in 2001. As the second phase of the theory of demographic transition has been passing through the composition of census data of 1974, 1981, 1991 and 2001 respectively, show the baby boom generation and slight edge of the population in the old ages. //////If the migrant population worldwide formed a state of their own, with more than 215 million people, or 3% of the world population, it would be the fifth largest country of the world.

Except labour (mainly unskilled), we are seriously short of the other two. Without adequate development of infrastructural facilities like power and communication modern industry cannot flourish. These need huge investment and time. For a country like Bangladesh, acquisition of adequate fund for building infrastructural facilities is extremely difficult. In addition, there are technical problems.

This delicate shell, photographed by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, seems to float serenely in space, but the apparent calm hides inner turmoil. Called SNR B0509-67.5 (or SNR 0509 for short), the bubble of gas is the remnant of a colossal explosion of a star, or supernova, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy about 160,000 light-years away. Ripples in the shell's surface may be caused either by subtle variations in the density of the gaseous environment, or possibly be driven from the interior by fragments from the initial explosion, astronomers say. The reddish shroud of gas is 23 light-years across and is expanding at more than 18 million km (11 million miles) per hour.//////A small area deep in the brain called the perirhinal cortex is critical for forming unconscious conceptual memories, researchers at the UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain have found.//////The possibility that a hornet might be harvesting sunlight for energy has researchers abuzz. Scientists have constructed an electricity-generating solar cell using a pigment from the oriental hornet, a team reports in the December Naturwissenschaften but much more evidence would be needed to link solar input to power output in the living beast. Oriental hornets (Vespa orientalis) spend their days clearing soil from their underground nests to make room for nest expansion. While many wasps would go about such business in the cooler morning hours, previous research led by the late Jacob Ishay of Tel Aviv University noted that the nest-expanding activity peaks in sweltering midday. Experiments also showed that shining a light on the hornets generated voltage differences across their hard exoskeletons. These and other finds suggested that the hornets were maximizing exposure to sunlight. So Ishay's doctoral student, Marian Plotkin, decided to further investigate the brown and yellow pigments on the insect's cuticle. Examination of the striped patch on the hornet's backside revealed a microstructure that traps incoming light, preventing reflection. And when the researchers extracted a yellow pigment called xanthopterin from the hornet's outer shell and plopped it into a solar cell that uses dyes to absorb light, the solar cell squeaked out some electricity. The find is interesting but not surprising, says Andrew Parker of the Natural History Museum in London. The skins and shells of organisms from butterflies to diatoms can have complex microstructures that manipulate light. In some instances, such as a weevil with an opaline exoskeleton, this microstructure creates a brilliant color. Similar structures in other insects, such as the textured eyes of certain flies and moths that are active at dawn and dusk and need every available photon of light, may serve to maximize absorption. The researchers have a long way to go to demonstrate that the oriental wasp is solar-powered, says Parker. The team hasn't shown that xanthopterin is linked to production of ATP, the energy-storing molecule of cells. And any number of pigments might eke out some electricity if stuck in a dye-sensitized solar cell. Even if it turns out that this wasp uses the sun in a more ordinary manner, the idea that insects might get an energy buzz from sunlight isn't so farfetched. Virtually everything that's been engineered in the physics world, Parker says, turns up in nature. //////A vegivore is a person who craves or has a special fondness for vegetables.
