We understand that the president exercised similar authority when in September last year he pardoned as many as 20 convicted individuals and thereby allowed them to return to life as usual. //////BNP has condemned the presidential clemency granted to convicted killer AHM Biplob, son of Laxmipur Awami League leader Abu Taher, and termed it an "immature decision".//////In the nine years Mark Stroman has been on death row in Texas, he says he has watched 208 people walk past him on the way to be executed.//////The government should survey the disappearances during mass executions in Bangladesh military in 1977 and '78, said renowned US journalist Lawrence Lifschultz yesterday.//////Heads of top city schools and colleges yesterday demanded the government take action to stop private tuition and coaching, holding these responsible for various unethical practices in educational institutions. //////The CNG filling stations across the country will remain closed between 3:00pm and 9:00pm for nearly a month starting from the first day of Ramadan as part of a government initiative to improve gas supply to power stations and tackle power crisis.//////The High Court yesterday once again extended till October 12 its order allowing conditional import and dismantling of toxic ships, mentioning the importers and ship-breakers must ensure workers' and environmental safety. //////The government yesterday announced names of the recipients of the National Film Award-2009.//////The Ministry of Food and Disaster Management has decided to launch open market sale (OMS) of rice ahead of Ramadan in seven divisional headquarters and in some industrial districts from Sunday.//////The High Court yesterday directed the government to stop use of tannery waste in poultry and fish feed production in the capital within 30 days.//////A businessman was shot dead by unidentified assailants at Sutrapur in the capital last night.//////Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) ATM Shamsul Huda yesterday rejected the main opposition BNP's labelling the Election Commission (EC) as partisan and biased. //////In the run up to Indian prime minister's visit to Bangladesh in September, the Indo-Bangladesh Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) will meet in Dhaka to finalise a framework agreement of a 15-year treaty for sharing the waters of Teesta and Feni rivers.//////We are deeply concerned at the grant of presidential pardon to an individual sentenced to death on charges of murder. Exercising his authority under Article 49 of the constitution, President Zillur Rahman has granted clemency to A.H.M. Biplob, son of Laxmipur Awami League leader and pourashava chairman Abu Taher. It is chillingly shocking that the convict, who had been a fugitive from justice for a decade and only surrendered to the law in April this year, is now about to return to normal life thanks to presidential clemency. We feel that the power of pardon given to the President of the Republic is a prerogative that should be exercised so judiciously as not to lower the dignity of the office or the reputation of the individual occupying it.//////In Bangladesh the problem of combating the older and emerging types of crime is getting tougher. That is due to multiple reasons, which include the fewer police men and women compared to population size, inadequate logistic supports available to them, anachronistic laws that governing them and so on.//////India spearhead Zaheer Khan left the field injured as England fought back on the first day of the first Test at Lord's on Thursday.//////Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan went AWOL for a second successive day in an event that evoked a strong reaction in the cricket community and has apparently forced his employer Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to think of disciplinary measures.//////The up-gradation works of the dressing rooms of the Bangabandhu National Stadium, ahead of the Argentina-Nigeria match in September, may not be finished within a one-month time frame, said a National Sports Council official yesterday.//////Ace Bangladesh golfer Siddikur Rahman continued his solid form in the second round of the Worldwide Holdings Selangor Masters, moving up one spot to joint sixth position after hitting a two-under-par 70 at the Kota Permai Golf and Country Club in Malaysia yesterday.

The dollar itself has been depreciating against other major global currencies. For example, between June 2010 and mid-July 2011, the dollar depreciated by 14 percent against the euro and 10 percent against the yen. So, the fall in the value of the Bangladeshi currency at a time when the dollar is weakening against the major global currencies and many other Asian currencies are appreciating against the dollar is viewed with a great deal of concern. //////Iceland's volcanoes gained notoriety last year for their ash-spewing ability to ground airlines and make a mess.

However, the illegal fish traders managed to escape, he added.//////I am greatly shocked at the appalling incident that happened in the institution where I enjoyed working till my retirement in 2007.//////It is appalling and disgraceful that children in school still suffer the inhumane horrors of corporal punishment. I carry a physical scar on the back of my left leg as a constant reminder of how brutal and cruel teachers and corporal punishment can be. In those days corporal punishment was accepted as 'normal', something that we all experienced and lived through. My 'crime' was that I had a slightly longer hair than most of the students, not as a protest or fashion but simply because my family could not spend for the barber at that time. No one paid much attention to the horrors of corporal punishment until Sir Frank Peters spoke out in a loud voice, brought the subject with all its ugliness to the surface. But rogue 'teachers' continue this repulsive practice. Corporal punishment needs to be recognised for what it is: a scourge on society and a violation of human rights; and it must not be tolerated even in the mildest form. My heart bleeds every time I read a news report about any child being beaten by a teacher. //////Last year in the month of October, we witnessed the Turag tragedy. This year, we have witnessed the Mirsarai tragedy that claimed more than forty lives. Some of them might have wanted to be doctors, some engineers. Now all the brains went down the drain! Only Almighty knows what we are going to see next! Beside most of the roads we find ditches, why? Can't these ditches be filled up? If not, why don't we make iron walls beside the roads? Moreover, there was no divider on the road where the accident occurred. //////The pictures show how the Banani-Karial lake is being unlawfully occupied by slums. These are gradually grabbing the whole lake inch by inch. Please report in your newspaper about it to protect the lake. We have been living next to the lake for the last 4 decades and never has the lake been occupied like this before. //////It is a waste of time and effort if wealth statements of ministers are not made public for transparency and accountability. The procedure of submitting such statements to the PM, says nothing about PM's own wealth statement (or for that matter that of the President). Do the PM and President remain exempt from such statements? Who will guard the guardians? If wealth statements are not made public how would the citizens be assured that the incumbent in high posts are good persons to vote for in subsequent elections. Failure of such evaluation is not democracy at all, unless there is some other clear mechanism for assessment of their honesty.//////Very recently six innocent students were beaten to death in Aminbazar area of Dhaka in the holy night of Shab-e- Barat, 44 students died in a horrible road accident in Mirsarai, Chittagong; a teacher of a renowned school in Dhaka raped his student; and a husband pushed his fingers into his wife's eyes, making her completely blind. The list of such incidents will be long. Our experience tells us that none of the accused will be punished for their crimes. We know very well that no crime is punished in this country. The law enforcing agencies are being used by the people in power, whoever they are. And the common people are getting no justice. We do not know every day how many girls are being harassed and raped in this country, how many people are dying in road crashes, how many women are beaten, tortured, and burned to death, and how many persons die by mob beating. As the perpetrators get away with impunity, others are encouraged to commit the same crimes again. The Aminbazar incident is an indicator how frustrated people are with the law enforcing agencies that they are now taking the law in their own hands. The overall situation of the country is getting from bad to worse. We go to sleep every day fearing what would happen the next day.//////It is great news that Bangladesh Nazrul Sangeet Sangstha (BNSS) was formed through the initiatives of some acclaimed exponents of Nazrul Sangeet like Sudhin Das, Khaled Hossain and Khairul Anam Shakil. As a fan of Nazrul Sangeet I think that the main challenges before BNSS are three: 1) to give attention that nobody can distort Nazrul's original compositions and lyrics, 2) to groom the young artistes so that they get exposure and can take the lead and break the old coterie who has monopolized the arena of Nazrul Sangeet for so long and 3) to resist any attempt to modernize those songs to make them popular which are already popular among the people. //////Our main opposition BNP will probably gain nothing by imposing frequent hartals on the people. Actually, the general people of the country abhor hartal as it brings immense sufferings to their daily existence. It causes serious harm to our fragile economy by disrupting the communications and dislocating day-to-day transactions in trade and commerce. A poor country like Bangladesh can not, therefore, afford such an anarchic and costly method of demonstrating public protest against political decisions. Opposition parties should now seek effective alternatives to hartal for pressurizing the govt. to fulfill their demands. //////Paramount leader Hussein Shahid Suhrawardy once remarked that the army and the police are the two arms of the bureaucracy and the political party and alliances should face the bureaucracy with a whip which is the people's mandate. So, the opposition bench in the Jatiya Sangsad should never remain vacant.//////Biman, the national carrier of Bangladesh is as usually reeling in acute financial crisis. Compounded by lack of proper planning, incompetence, mismanagement, rampant corruption in all levels, excessive manpower and a dearth of transparency in all kinds of purchasing, maintenance costs followed by the lack of viable commercial route planning etc. Biman initially was salvaged by the government before going to bankruptcy when it was turned to a public company. And a ray of hope was glistening when Biman made profit during the first and second year of its becoming a company. We all became happy that finally Biman would get rid of the stigma of a loss making concern. But unfortunately, after two years of operation, Biman again went back to its same old fold as a loss making company. It seems that Biman and loss have become synonymous. A comparison has been highlighted by some leading newspapers which show a colossal difference between debit and credit of Biman. We feel that it is about time that government should appoint a qualified foreign audit company who will audit Biman thoroughly and impartially and submit the report to the concerned ministry in order to alleviate Biman from the brink of disaster.//////It is shocking that the controversial headmistress of Viquarunnisa Noon School is back in her old position. What more, police force has been deployed at the school premises to 'pacify' the outraged students. What is happening? No word is left to condemn. If people like Porimol Joydhor the controversial headmistress are not punished, then those perverts, child abusers, and sex offenders will do this same crime again. Incidents like this show clearly how vulnerable women are in our country.//////Villagers in Aminbazar, police claim them to be robbers; they found to be fun-loving students; families barricade roads//////Climate change is generating an "unholy brew" of extreme weather events that threaten global security, the UN chief said Wednesday as the Security Council recognised the issue's potential effect on world peace.//////Police have expanded their hacking inquiry beyond Rupert Murdoch's empire, asking for files from an earlier probe into the use of investigators by other British papers, regulators said yesterday.//////A US Congress panel yesterday rejected a proposal to cut off all aid to Pakistan due to concerns over the country's relationship with Islamic militants after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived on the Indonesian resort island of Bali yesterday to attend Asian security talks and prepare a visit by President Barack Obama in November.//////Four elderly Kenyans won court approval yesterday to sue the British government over the brutality they claim they suffered at the hands of the British army during the 1950s Mau Mau uprising.//////The United Nations has called an emergency meeting on July 25 to discuss mobilising aid for drought-stricken east Africa.//////An animated children's film aimed at inspiring them to take up armed struggle with the militant group is on the making, said a group of al-Qaeda supporters yesterday.//////New ministers in a sweeping reshuffle of Egypt's cabinet took their oaths in front of the country's military ruler yesterday, the official MENA news agency reported.//////China yesterday sought to reassure Southeast Asian countries that it was a friendly neighbour, as all sides worked to ease tensions that spiked over a maritime territorial dispute.//////War crimes suspect Goran Hadzic, the former Croatian Serb rebel leader, could be on his way to the UN war crimes court in The Hague as early as today, his lawyer said yesterday.//////Malawi President Bingu wa Mutharika refused to step down yesterday amid deadly riots in which a local rights group said twelve anti-government protesters had been shot dead by police.//////The remains of Adolf Hitler's one-time deputy Rudolf Hess have been exhumed with permission of his remaining family members in Germany and his grave destroyed after it became a shrine for neo-Nazis, authorities said yesterday.//////Israel will not "take responsibility" for the deaths of nine Turkish nationals by apologising to Ankara over its botched 2010 raid on a ferry heading for Gaza, a senior cabinet minister said yesterday.//////A Cairo appeals court overturned yesterday a ruling removing ex-president Hosni Mubarak's name from government buildings, leading to scuffles outside the court house, judicial sources said.//////Eager architecture students are thronging the exhibition, titled 'ARCASIA Heritage', at the Nalini Kanta Bhattasalli Gallery, National Museum in Dhaka.

Last Saturday, the planning minister announced the findings of the 5th population census, claiming that Bangladesh has a population of 142.3 million. In October 2010, the United Nations Population Fund had arrived at a figure of 164.4 million. More than 22 million people evaporated in the gas chambers of conflicting figures in roughly six months.//////On July 9, the Republic of South Sudan joined the community of nations. Foreign dignitaries converged on its capital, Juba, to watch the new country raise its flag and inaugurate its first president, Salva Kiir Mayardit. //////After Begum Zia's announcement of a lull in hartal for whatever reasons, activism on BNP's part for realigning with political forces, large or small, takes on a feverish pitch. It is breathing some fresh air into politics gone surreal. One wouldn't be too wrong either to even look at it as a quieter prelude to an impending storm given; for, the seeds of discord have been sown deeper into the very heart of national polity which is the Constitution of the country. //////Bangladesh has developed a transport network that includes roads, railways, inland waterways, two maritime ports and civil airports catering to both domestic and international traffic. Road transport has traditionally been the centre of the government's attention in this sector. //////The government has been requesting foreign investors for Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) for quite some time, but has failed to win them over mainly because there is lack of suitable infrastructure as well as acceptable law and order situation prevailing in the country.//////We all know the ancient history of the Battle of Marathon where Pheidippides, the messenger who ran from the battle field of Marathon to Athens to announce the defeat of the Persians in the battle. In today's world of Wi-Fi and cell phones, where communication needs no running feet, this historic anecdote surely sounds like a fib. //////Just another Galaxy model from Samsung, that's what we honestly thought when we first heard about the Galaxy S II.

As nowadays students are more interested in chatting on social networking sites or playing online games rather than going through the agonies of memorising a number of tedious textbooks, the internet has often been accused of distracting students from their studies. //////
