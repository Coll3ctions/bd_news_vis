And it is because it hints at the many possibilities which in time could be opened up in trade and by extension through greater cooperation in other areas between the two countries. It is in such a perspective that we observe the decision to open the two border haats or markets in Sunamganj and Kurigram. An important point about the opening of these haats is that the agreements do away with the difficulties which have traditionally been part of border trade. Now, with trucks from both countries entering each other's territory with goods and going all the way up to the warehouses on each side of the frontier, the problem of frequent and irksome loading and unloading at the border has been removed. The two haats are thus to be considered a necessary first step in a further liberalising of trade, through an inauguration of similar haats, along the long border that Bangladesh and India happen to share.//////As is customary for us, we welcome every new entrant to the print media world.
