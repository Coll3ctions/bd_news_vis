In the past, Dhaka and New Delhi signed several treaties and agreements on various issues. But in most of the cases, we saw that India took from us whatever she wanted and we got nothing in return. Share of Teesta water and transit are two separate issues.

Most of the teachers are not well paid. With the little salary they get, they have to struggle to survive. //////We, the young people, are said to be the 'future' of the country, but I wonder how we will guide our country when we lack proper guidance. The adults say that we are now very modern and that we all have a Facebook account, but my question is what is the need of a Facebook account when we don't know the basics of life? We, especially the urban children, do not know how to swim, how to climb a tree, and some of us even don't know how to fold a cloth! 'Our children are our future' - that's what most of the politicians say but what are they doing to enlighten us with knowledge? We don't have a ground to play or a useful TV channel to watch. Hence, we are forced to watch Hindi serials. And so, our talent as well as our interest to know is confined to the fast food shop and the internet. Only studying in schools cannot make us perfect human beings. The elders need to guide us properly, if they want us to guide the nation in the future. Otherwise, we will be nothing but a burden to the nation!//////The country's economists at a seminar organised by The Daily Star have made lengthy recommendations about Bangladesh economy but these are all subjective analyses from their 'ivory towers'. It is astonishing that they never cite the phenomenal example of China where economic liberalisation made them number 2 in the world. If Bangladesh follows their economic path, free all entry barriers to competition and liberalise trade, it could well become the number 2 economy in Asia. //////We are frustrated about the future of our country; we do not know what is going to happen in the political arena , which seems to be very volatile.//////I have read many letters in your columns about hartal. Everyone writes about the bad impacts of hartal and suggest that the BNP should refrain from calling hartals, as it has detrimental effects on our economy. Of course, I agree with all their arguments. But what surprises me is that nobody says a single word about the hartals which were called by the AL in the past. The AL called more hartals than the BNP did, although Sheikh Hasina declared that she would not call any hartal when her party would be in the Opposition. But soon after that she forgot what she had said and called hartals in a row, when she was the opposition leader. Did she think then that her party would never be in the opposition again? What was on her mind when she said that?//////We have carefully read the article by Syed Fattahul Alim published in the Daily Star in October 3, 2011. The article dealt with leakage of question papers in public examinations of Bangladesh. There is, however, some factual inadequacy in this write up. Bangladesh Public Service Commission has conducted more than 300 written examinations in last four years. No complaint was heard about leakage of questions in any of these examinations. Bangladesh Public Service Commission has come up with some innovative methods in order to guard the secrecy and integrity of question papers. The commission makes sets of question papers for a particular examination. The commission selects one set of question paper through lottery just 25 minutes before examination and informs hall authorities by using all modern means of communication. In this method there is no scope for leakage of questions. The commission has succeeded in effectively arresting the pernicious trend of leakage of question papers. //////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas yesterday said he was willing to restart peace negotiations with Israel "at any moment."//////Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu has capitulated to heavy pressure from the settler lobby to find ways of legalising settlement outposts built on private Palestinian land, Haaretz newspaper said yesterday.//////Myanmar announced a mass prisoner amnesty yesterday, raising hope for the imminent release of hundreds of political detainees in what would be a major sign of change in the authoritarian state.//////India's 84-year-old opposition leader LK Advani set off on a five-week road trip across the country on Tuesday in a protest he said would put pressure on the government to tackle corruption.//////A Ukrainian judge yesterday sentenced former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko to seven years in jail for abusing her powers in a 2009 gas deal with Russia, a verdict that is set to harm ties with the European Union.//////China urged Syria yesterday to move faster to implement reforms, a week after Beijing infuriated the West by blocking a UN resolution against President Bashar al-Assad's deadly crackdown on protests.//////Actress Marzieh Vafamehr has been sentenced to a year in jail and 90 lashes by an Iranian court for her role in an Australian film on the limits imposed on artists in the Islamic republic. //////The UN human rights office yesterday expressed distress at Saudi Arabia's execution of ten men, including eight Bangladeshis, and urged the kingdom to place a moratorium on the death penalty.//////A virus found in the sea off Chile is the biggest in the world, harbouring more than 1,000 genes, surprised scientists reported on Monday.//////Opium production in Afghanistan rose by 61% this year compared with 2010, according to a UN report.//////Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Hazem al-Beblawi resigned yesterday following deadly clashes in the capital that left 25 people dead, the official MENA news agency reported.//////Fighters from Libya's new regime seized the police headquarters in the centre of Muammar Gaddafi's hometown Sirte yesterday as they moved in for the kill against the strongman's remaining diehards.//////A cholera epidemic sweeping through west and Central Africa, one of the biggest in the vast region's history, has infected more than 85,000 people, killing at least 2,466 so far this year, United Nations aid agencies said yesterday.//////Liberians began voting yesterday in the second election since the end of a 14-year civil war, which is being closely watched as a litmus test of the west African nation's fragile democracy.//////Former Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic, detained by a UN court pending trial for genocide and war crimes, has been hospitalised with pneumonia, a lawyer said yesterday.//////Akbar Ali's exhibit at Dhaka Art Centre, (October 11-14) was inaugurated by eminent artists Qayyum Chowdury, Hashem Khan and Rafiqun Nabi.//////The newly built Government Public Library was thrown open to the public when Information Minister Abul Kalam Azad inaugurated the library at Loshkarpur village in Pabna on Saturday afternoon.//////Theatre troupe Prangane Mor staged its latest production-- an adaptation of the classic Tagore novel Shesher Kobita-- at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, on October 10.

Happy Akhand's "Abar Elo Je Shondha" is a milestone and probably one of the most poignant songs ever produced. His premature death on December 28, 1987 was a big blow to all musicians who were influenced by Happy's passion for music and had now lost a pioneering figure in Bangla pop music.//////A season based cultural programme celebrating autumn was held at historic Ambika Maidan of Faridpur town on Saturday evening.

It sought to explain to the nation why it thought the network would benefit citizens if the route went by way of the khamarbari area. That was a fine expression of sentiment. But the surprise for us is in the fact that a defence force suddenly thought it wise to acquaint citizens with news of all the good that could accrue from a project undertaken in the public interest. Interestingly, the air force said not a word about the uproar caused by its reservations about the original plan of the metro's following a path around Bijoynagar. Air force flight operations, it was said at the time the reservations of the air force came to be known, would be at risk if the original metro plan was followed through.//////Ten years after invading Afghanistan, on Oct. 7, 2001, the obvious question is whether or not the United States has won the war.

The main motive is to involve the young generation in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) initiatives so that they can have a long-term effect. The Bangladesh government and NGOs have taken up programmes to raise awareness throughout the country. //////Education is a precondition for economic and social development. We have professed the importance of minimum education for the masses but have done very little in translating those pronouncements into action. We want democracy to function in the country, but how can democracy work in a nation where a vast number of the people are illiterate? We also want to implement such vital national programmes as family planning, increased food production, improved health and sanitary conditions, etc. But can any of those make any headway unless the people are able and willing to participate? The answer is obvious. //////
