The wicket was devoid of any grass with very slow, low bounce and provided lots of assistance to the spinners, but the hosts could not take advantage of that due to some irresponsible batting and dropped chances.//////Those displaced during last Tuesday's clashes between Bangalee settlers and indigenous people have come out of hiding and have begun reconstructing their homes in the hill town of Khagrachhari in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said the government would bring culprits to justice for killing 57 army officers and others during last year's BDR mutiny.//////Police seized over 5,000 'jihadi' (pro-Islamist uprising) books from a Shibir-controlled room at Shaheed Shamsuzzoha Hall of the university yesterday.//////Police arrested six operatives of Islamist outfit Hizbut Tawhid including a female one Saturday night after they beat up at least 20 locals of Kushtia town. //////The Inter Services Public Relations has dismissed the report by a section of the media, including TV channels, that Sergeant Rezaul Karim of the Army was without uniform when he received injuries at Baghaichhari on February 20 terming it false and baseless.//////A fire gutted at least 65 shanties and 12 shops at a camp of Urdu-speaking people in the city's Pallabi area on Saturday.//////Bangladesh Rifles and Border Security Force (BSF) of India again traded gunshots along the troubled Jaintapur border in Sylhet yesterday following a dispute over ownership of a swamp near the border.//////Rescue teams hunted for survivors yesterday after one of the largest earthquakes on record killed at least 300 people in Chile and sent giant waves roaring across the Pacific Ocean.//////India and Myanmar will conduct a "coordinated operation" against northeast separatist outfits taking shelter and setting up base camps in the neighbouring country, Union Home Secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai said here.//////About 38 years into the country's independence, the government has introduced food rationing for war-maimed freedom fighters and the family members of martyrs in the Liberation War.//////A contempt of court petition against Commerce Minister Faruk Khan was filed with the High Court yesterday on charge of obstructing implementation of its order for demolishing jetties set up by City Group of Industries on the bank of the Shitalakhya. //////THE proof of good governance comes through the difficult and yet necessary actions a political administration takes in the larger interest of citizens. Where such decisions are absent, indeed where only a platitudinous mouthing of intent becomes the pattern, it is governance that suffers. In the present instance, we certainly appreciate the candour with which Local Government and Rural Development Minister Syed Ashraful Islam has spoken of a few bad elements of the Chhatra League undermining the image of the government. We also note that the minister, also general secretary of the ruling Awami League, has spoken of punishment for these trouble makers. The problem here, however, is that over the past many months a number of leading figures in the government have said precisely what Mr. Islam has been saying. The constant refrain that these unruly elements of the Chhatra League will have to pay for their bad activities has come so often, without any concrete action on the ground, that nowadays people are tempted to respond to such statements with cynicism.//////THE situation of the public health service and the picture of health centres as a result, as revealed in a recent report in this newspaper reads rather dismal. The situation has been compounded mainly by shortage of almost 20 percent of the authorised manpower.

Tamim, the 22-year-old left-hander from Chittagong, treated the English attack with some brutally beautiful shots as he accumulated 125 runs off 120 deliveries, but still ended up on the losing side as the tourists chalked up a six-wicket victory at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.//////It is rare to see sports practitioners in the country receive a warm welcome on their return from a successful foreign sojourn, unless of course you are a cricketer or a footballer.

They drink Wasa water, cook with Wasa water, take bath in Wasa water, do household work and even perform construction work with WASA water in metropolitan Dhaka.

Am I to understand that the PM and the competent people planning her itinerary in advance are not cognizant of these big events and the conflicts that may take place? If they are, that should have been communicated to organisers and if not, the PM should not have set an example by coming in late, deliberately, to a meeting and keep the people waiting. Or, the PM just decided to make a symbolic gesture at the expense of time of attendees? //////RE: Request for re-starting BCS exam centre in London, UK.//////As a developing country Bangladesh is beset with many problems. And it is better understood when we flip over the pages of dailies. Here being the educated citizens of the country if the young students make the headlines of dailies for their criminal activities, then we can only bemoan our fate. Learnt much earlier that a good citizen should have three qualities namely intelligence, self-control and conscience. Our students are grazing in the highest field of knowledge without being bestowed with the true faculties of an ideal human being. //////It is very difficult to absorb the news. Within a week two students of two renowned universities have been murdered viciously. It seems that we live in a society where no rules and regulations exist, particularly on the campuses.

This is because the democratic governments must consult their people before going to war and people are unlikely to opt for war against another democratic country because consultation always leads to compromise. This is why when France became a democracy after Napoleonic war, Britain and France -- historical enemies - became friends. The same happened after the second World War when Germany became a democracy and a nation based on rule of law.//////I was watching the Opening Ceremony of Winter Olympics on ESPN and I was quite amazed to see some nations participating in the competition for the first time. I always had the belief that Winter Olympics belong to the athletes from European and North American Nations. But I was wrong to think like that. In this year's Winter Olympics there are participants from Ethiopia, Pakistan, Iran, India, Nepal, Senegal, Ghana and even Mongolia. I was really amazed to see the participants from these nations. I was only asking myself, if athletes from conservative nations like Pakistan and Iran could participate then why can't athletes from our country participate in Winter Olympics?//////Shahrukh Khan's latest movie, "My name is Khan" has become the talk of the sub-continent as Shiv Sena threatened the superstar.//////First it was Toyota, and now it is Mazda, as reported by APP from Tokyo, published by you on 11th.

And I used to gather the information of latest numbers of Top chart of UK and USA from radio and tried to find the cassettes in music markets. There was a rush among friends who could get the latest ones. With the advent of Satellite TV arguably provides very useful enlightenment in certain fields of development of mind which radio could not impart with the same efficacy and multiplicity. The significance of radio among common people has been decreasing . A year before or so, listening to the radio became antiquated. But Radio Today transmitting 89.6 FM has rekindled the seized glory of radio by presenting thrilling music of home and abroad. Consequently, being Stranded in the monotonous traffic jam or liberated from the worries of work, Radio Today now gives free rein to one's imaginations. And the way Radio jockeys cast themselves gracefully is really entertaining.//////I was attracted to a news heading in your 13th June On line edition " Many things to be done to make Bangladesh Middle income economy -Gul" I eagerly read the whole news item to find the Turkish President's comments on what Bangladesh needed to reach the status of a middle income country. To my utter surprise and disappointment, not a single word or phrase I could find directly about this matter. Only reference was that " infrastructure and legal issues" were discussed. //////My hats off to the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The Committee has rightly identified the physicians who flouted all norms and regulations with the blessings of the then BMA leaders. The report calls for immediate demotion and expulsion of abnormally rewarded physicians. Would be delighted to see the immediate execution of the report. Similar irregularities also prevail in the govt. medical colleges and hospitals. We urge upon the Parliamentary Standing Committee to probe alleged irregularities in the govt. medical colleges immediately and give exemplary punishment to the offenders, so that this is not repeated in future. //////The principle aim of conservation is to ensure the survival of life in all its forms and variety, and to make certain that natural resources are not used beyond their capacity for renewal but continue for the benefit of future generations. Conservation requires an understanding of ecology and the interrelationships of the different plants and animals (including our own species)with each other and with their environment. //////Dhaka needs a mass transit system like other modern cities.

Now the day is not only observed, but also it is celebrated with great significance throughout the world. But to achieve this day, we had to move gradually. In 1948, the then West Pakistani rulers declared that Urdu would be the state language of Pakistan. But the people of East Pakistan strongly reacted to the unilateral decision. On 21 February in 1952, many students brought out a procession to get their demand fulfilled. Suddenly, police fired on this procession and some valiant students were killed. Since then, 21st February is observed as a "Shaheed Dibas". //////Traffic jam is a monstrous problem in Dhaka city. I think the problem is more technical than administrative. However, so far we have not seen any methodical approach being taken by the government to proceed in the direction of easing this problem. Police are thinking it is their matter and they are continuously issuing orders, guidelines, and rules assuming that it would reduce traffic jam. We do not know if they have any scientific data in support of issuing such orders or guidelines. All seem to be assumptive. //////The tsunami from Chile's deadly earthquake hit Japan's main islands and the shores of Russia on Sunday, but the smaller-than-expected waves prompted the lifting of a Pacific-wide alert.
