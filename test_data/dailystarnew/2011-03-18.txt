Hundreds of lives were snapped up, houses washed away, properties destroyed in Japan. We were helpless, in spite of having the latest technology. This shows how vulnerable our lives are. What is most surprising is that we hardly think about life itself such as who created us, where do we come from and why. According to the Holy Quran, Allah created us to test whether we do good or bad. We have done injustice to both people and the earth. The Mother Earth has been over-exploited to feed the greed of the rich people depriving the overwhelming millions. So, it is natural the Mother Nature retaliate in the form of natural disasters. The Tsunami of people's anger is raging in the Middle East which is engulfing regime after regime there. I think the Mother Nature has started to correct the wrongs the godless, unjust and cruel people have done on earth. So, beware! Wrong doers! //////In a breathtaking thriller Tigers snatched the do or die game from the formidable Lions, three times World Cup finalist, England. It was an incredible performance of our cricketers and all the kudos goes to our bowlers Nayeem and Muhammadullah, the tail-enders whose coherent understanding and display of great batting accomplished the most improbable feat. We all are proud of our boys for their wonderful victory and hope they will make it to the quarter finals. //////This refers to Dr. Yunus related news. Historically, (a large number of) Bangalees always like to enjoy by humiliating their great sons. One of the 20th century's greatest poet-philosophers and 1913 Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore was bitterly opposed by the contemporary Bangalee writers and pundits of old school. On the contrary, Rabindranath was admired and adored by the educated British in the British India, much before his international recognition. Bangladesh national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam in his time was humiliated by the two Bangalee (orthodox) communities and was abused physically. Now, the inventor of microfinance, the social business concept and 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus is facing the same Bangalee tradition.//////I am rather encouraged to write the following a column under the caption "Smoking festival at Dhanmondi." Not to speak of a ban on smoking in public, the young kids smoke ganja in broad daylight in front of the law enforcers rather appearing to be their accomplices. This alarming situation is perhaps prevailing all over the town. The indifference of the law enforcers rather encourages these kids to indulge in addiction more.//////According to the media reports, our Nobel laureate's counsels expressed no confidence in a High Court bench during a hearing of his writ petition challenging the legality of the Bangladesh Bank order that removed him from the post of managing director. The expression of no confidence was prompted by the court's delay to issue a rule upon the government and Bangladesh Bank to explain why their decision to remove the Nobel laureate should not be declared illegal. His learned counsels apprehend that their client will not get justice from the court, since the court were holding hearing on his petition for so long without issuing any rule. Moreover, they have apprehended that the petition will be rejected. //////The write up of Mohammad Ali Sattar titled ' A spitting Nation are we?' in the post-editorial of The Daily Star, has exposed the bad practice that we have as a nation. Seldom had we thought that this practice not only vilifies the environment but also denigrates our image as a nation. It is not only disparaging but also mind boggling how the railway station, launch terminal, the pavements ,the stairs of institutions or banks are spitted by the pan chewers. And add with this, the throwing of cigarette butts. In places, there are boxes with USE ME written on it, but who cares? First, laws have to be enacted that people spitting openly on the public places would be rebuked and fined. Second, a nation wide campaign stop spitting everywhere" like washing hands on the particular day of the year may be launched, highlighting the significance and usefulness of not spitting everywhere. For this, the media can play a role. People have to be made conscious whether there is any usefulness of chewing the betel leaves all the times. //////Syed Maqsud Jamil's article published in The Daily Star on February 18th was great, but he could not do justice to this issue. He highlighted the status of fatwa in secular states. Being a Bangladeshi and Muslim, we should benefit the entire humanity. Therefore, I must point out that such heinous crimes are not acceptable even in Islamic states. Honouring killings and arbitrary local judges are not part of Islam. According to Islam, punishments are to be carried out by the ruler or by someone appointed by the ruler. There will be a thorough investigation even if four witnesses are available. Unlike the Bush era when Muslims were guilty until proven, no one can be punished until proven guilty under the Islamic law. //////Overcrowded Dhaka city is expanding exponentially through the decades. Hence it is necessary to shift some of the old installations from the DCC zone. The old BDR camp was located outside the municipal area during the British period; as also the old Tejgaon airport. Now that the international airport is located outside the city; the old runway could be dismantled; lessening the huge traffic jams; instead of boring a tunnel beneath the old airship. The Peelkhana site could be relocated to some greater Dhaka area, outside the DCC zone. Also, the PMO's office could be relocated in the Sher-e-Bangla area (long-term plan). The Suhrawardy Park (old racecourse site) could be letter utilized, as the new expanded city now extends up to Mirpur. Hundreds of RMG and other factories have to be shifted from the municipal zones in the big cities. What are the purposes of the specialised economic zones? But the main hurdle is the political centralisation in Dhaka metropolis. People have to come to Dhaka to get their work done. The divisional and district headquarters should be given more administrative freedom. Digital conveniences are not enough. The political mindset has to change. //////Shidhu is a critic in the field of cricket. His analysis, evaluation and criticism have proved his passion for this game. But recently, he has been consistently discriminating Bangladesh Cricket Team. He has gone to the extent of making rude and insulting comments about our team after BAN VS WI match. He said, "What they have played for last ten years, their performance makes me laugh. Even after the prestigious victory against England, he said it would be very bad if Bangladesh qualified for quarter-finals. He remarked that Bangladesh could not chase if England made a score of 250-260.//////The front page coverage of Fossa predatory cat-like animal which appeared in your newspaper dated 5th February, caught our attention. The description of Fossa that The Daily Star reported is almost the same like the one our aunt in Kolkata had seen recently. Your coverage on Fossa made it easier for us, as we were working through internet to know about the animal. The neighbourhood of Elliot road, Kolkata was terrified by a cat-like animal with round face and big tail which used to eat up chicken, pigeons and other pets. A few people of the area even saw the animal climbing trees, walls and houses. According to the neighbourhood of Elliot road, the Fossa or Iguana might have lived inside a big dark tunnel behind the ancient old mosque built by our maternal ancestors. The point is if the animal seen in Elliot road, Kolkata is really a Fossa or an Iguana, it needs attention to prove its existence in India apart from Madagaskar alone.//////PM Sheikh Hasina has said that Bangladesh has already prepared a rescue team along with a medical wing to send to Japan. Madam PM, please send it immediately. Please don't delay. The whole world must stand by the people of Japan as they stand by other people in their dire need. Certainly, they will soon get through the present situation caused by the natural disasters. But in the wake of the disasters of such a great magnitude, a small help will be a great help to them.//////Our heartiest congratulations to the Bangladesh Cricket Team for their victory over England, it was unbelievable and full of surprises. When people lost all hope of winning the game, the miracle happened.Our best wishes are with Bangladesh Cricket Team and hope that in the future they will also make us happy with their performance.//////There is a proverb in Bangla, "Ain er chokhe shobai shoman" meaning "all are equal in the eyes of law". May be many years ago this proverb was true, may be in those days rich and poor, weak and strong used to get equal treatment in the courts and the above proverb was created at that time. The situation has now changed with the change of time. Also the gap between the rich and poor has widened a lot. In 21st century, the theory of justice is changed and law is for powerful and rich and not equal for all". //////The official number of dead and missing after a devastating earthquake and tsunami that flattened Japan's northeast coast is approaching 15,000, police said yesterday.//////Thick snow covered the wreckage littering quake-hit Japan yesterday, all but extinguishing hopes of finding anyone alive in the debris and deepening danger and misery for survivors.//////Taiwan authorities have detected radioactive particles on 26 passengers arriving on planes from Japan as the quake-hit country battles an escalating nuclear crisis, officials said yesterday.//////Bahrain arrested at least six opposition leaders yesterday, a day after its crackdown on protests among the Shi'ite Muslim majority drew rare US criticism and raised fears of a regional conflict.//////Libyan government soldiers battled rebels on the road to the insurgent stronghold of Benghazi yesterday as the United States raised the possibility of air strikes to stop Muammar Gaddafi's forces.//////The US embassy in Islamabad will close its doors and shut its consulates in Pakistan today (Friday) because of ongoing protests after the release of a CIA contractor accused of double murder.//////The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned Japan two years ago that a strong earthquake could pose a "serious problem" for its nuclear power stations, Britain's Daily Telegraph reported.//////South Sudan's army said it fought heavy battles with militia in the oil-producing Unity state yesterday, the latest clashes in an upsurge of violence in the region soon to become the world's newest nation.//////The Dalai Lama rejected yesterday calls from the Tibetan parliament in exile urging him to reconsider his decision to retire as political head of the movement.//////Civilians and police were among 35 people killed when US missiles ploughed into a militant training compound in Pakistan's Taliban and Al Qaeda-hit northwest yesterday, officials said.//////A blood money deal to secure the release of a CIA contractor accused of murder in Pakistan has ended a damaging spy row but eroded a thin veneer of trust between the suspicious allies, analysts say.//////Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Tunisia yesterday to carry out economic and political reform as it emerges from authoritarian rule and praised the country for aiding refugees from fighting in Libya.//////Nepal has jailed a former government minister for corruption while in office, a court spokesman said yesterday, //////Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in an interview Wednesday she would not seek another term as the top US diplomat if President Barack Obama is re-elected in 2012.//////Two Yemeni policemen and three members of Al-Qaeda were killed in clashes yesterday in the eastern province of Marib, one of the network's strongholds in the country, a security official told AFP.//////Sri Lanka held its first local elections yesterday since the end of its long ethnic war two years ago, in a test for the all-powerful government of President Mahinda Rajapakse.//////Eighteen people were killed in post-election violence in the Ivory Coast in the past week, bringing to 410 the death toll since the end of 2010, the UN mission (UNOCI) in Abidjan said yesterday.//////An unusually large group of 30 to 50 Somali pirates seized an Indonesian vessel and used it in a failed bid to hijack a second ship yesterday, the EU naval mission said.//////As a tribute to eminent cultural activist and Tagore exponent Waheedul Haque, a driving force behind the nationalist cultural movement for decades, Chhayanat arranged a nightlong musical programme titled "Desh Ghar-er Gaan 1417" on March 16.

He died in a faraway country where he was undergoing treatment. From there he moved further away to another world where he may not have memories of contentious politics of which he was a leading force. Many people would disagree and argue that he was rather a spent force, his grip on the party slipping away with growing signs of aging and diminished influence. //////Spontaneous revolutions in the Middle East (ME) and North Africa have once again brought to the fore the fact that when nations are pushed to the wall by repression and poor governance, they bounce back fearlessly for a face-off. Many countries across the globe are in a pot-boiling situation and are waiting for a spark. One wonders how a man can handle intricate state affairs for years in a row. Dictators and monarchs start their regimes with high sounding pledges of redemption and reform and in most instances end up vilified and vulnerable,//////The AL held a conference of Mohajote inter-parliamentary bodies last week, its first ever in two years. That by itself was news, but there was infinitely more -- sycophantic, spiced, bitter-sweet and strident flavour of it all.
