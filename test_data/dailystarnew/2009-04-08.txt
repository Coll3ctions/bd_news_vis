The election that we have been so proud of and which earned wide international acclaim for being a massive demonstration of a people's right to franchise was not without a blemish after all. A TIB survey covering 88 candidates for 29 December parliamentary election pronounces the message loud and clear: 87 percent spent on average Tk 44 lakh to come out winner as against the stipulated ceiling of Tk 15 lakh.

By the way, you do not use "the" when you refer to the legislature in this particular sense.

At the initial stage the debate centred on whether Bangladesh was insulated from the crisis. Many argued that Bangladesh was safe, as it did not have any connection with the toxic assets that caused the turmoil. This was rather naive because in the modern inter-connected world economies are inter-dependent in a variety of ways including through trade, capital flows, tourism, and remittances. Thankfully this debate is now over as evidence of slowdown in growth of export earnings and remittances along with further evidence that these trends will likely become worse in 2009 have convinced all that the adverse effects are real and may last for sometime. At the least 2009 will be a very difficult year for all countries including Bangladesh and this may even spill over into much of 2010.

Well, here is a financially viable, easily enforceable and the most accurate answer in the universe: to completely end all this violence, our political parties must dissolve all their student wings. Or, we can beat around the bush and come up with all sorts of condemnations, suggestions, analyses and fancy articles. But that would all be pointless. We would simply be fooling ourselves, yet again. //////Being allured with the slogan "din bodoler sonod" we the young generation voted for this present government. After coming to power our prime minister announced that terrorism would be wiped out from our country. Hearing this the nation became very optimistic but the prevailing hazardous situation, especially on the campuses , makes the nation pessimistic. What's going on on our campuses in the name of so-called student politics? On 31 March, we lost Rajib in Dhaka Medical College. The nation has lost a doctor. We have seen clashes between two groups in Shamsunnahar Hall of DU. It is a very awkward situation for the nation to see its female students engaged in political turmoil. If such a situation continues, very soon the nation will be in dire trouble. //////Thanks are due to Mr. Muffazel Hossain who wrote an article of substance describing the ills of Dhaka's traffic in DS of 26 March 2009.

Not only the business houses, non-trading organisations also need to maintain accounts. But as the world of business and organisation is expanding and involving more and more complicated situations, the academic accountants (B.com, M.com) cannot cope with it. //////Lots of talks are going around about building a nuclear power plant. Several countries are interested, as I understand from the news. Our bureaucrats are running fast with this prestigious project and as usual I'm afraid they are going to make a deal which will be a losing one for us. There are experts and professors who are dealing with it, but do they have any professional experience? I don't think so. You can't run a nuclear power plant theoretically (none of other industries either). A simple example is the placing of the power plant. What I know from the news, they are talking about the old proposal of Ruppur. But the basic rule for a nuclear power plant is its safety and that can't be located in a place where surroundings are densely populated. The second thing is the cooling system and availability of water supply. I don't think Ruppur fulfils any of them. These are only a few examples and there are many more. //////The Doha press report, published in most dailies on March 29, was an empty talk show of Arab leaders without any substance.

I hope the PM was quite aware of the political reaction from different quarters, especially from the well-wishers of Begum Zia and the BNP. We heard a university professor giving his view point from legal perspective and human emotion attached to it. I think it is also necessary to analyse the statement of the PM in parliament. She has raised a question about the legal process adopted in giving the house to the BNP chairperson by the then government of president Ershad. The PM has made an appeal to the chairperson to handover the house to the cantonment board, not necessarily any counter legal action to force her to leave the place. //////The United States' military commander and regional troubleshooter Tuesday held key talks in Pakistan, where President Asif Ali Zardari told them his country was fighting terror for its survival.//////Rescuers worked frantically in this central Italian city early yesterday, scooping through piles of rubble with their hands in the search for survivors after the country's deadliest earthquake in nearly three decades.//////The United Nations on Tuesday expressed "deep concern" for the safety of 100,000 civilians trapped in Sri Lanka's war zone as troops prepared for a final offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels.//////Attracting legendary actors such as Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, India politics have long been irresistible to Bollywood stars, who bring with them star quality -- and a touch of intrigue.//////India's ruling Congress Party trumpeted its anti-terrorism credentials Tuesday ahead of general elections, with Home Minister P.

This major event continues to reverberate as a defining moment in the difficult relationship between China and its Tibetan region. The Tibetans in exile with the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government marked the occasion in greatly contrasting styles; the Buddhist leader issued a statement recalling Tibet's suffering and struggle, his hopes for the future and his renewed wish for a negotiated settlement acceptable to both parties, while China promised stern action against separatism and declared a public holiday to celebrate the end of serfdom in Tibet.//////
