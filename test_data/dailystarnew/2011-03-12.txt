As Muhammad Habibur Rahman notes in his diary of events he calls Bangladesher Tarikh, on this day in 1971 the regime announced the arrest of what it called Indians from among the protestors in East Pakistan. The motive was not lost on anyone: the regime had hit upon the idea that giving the Bangalee nationalist movement the taint of being inspired by a hostile India or, more specifically, by the Hindu community that had never accepted the reality of partition in 1947, would be an effective way of discrediting Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his politics. Predictably, the propaganda did not wash with the Bangalees, who continued to pour out on to the streets of Dhaka and elsewhere in the province to swear fealty to their elected leader.//////The 26 Bangladeshis held hostage aboard the hijacked ship MV Jahan Moni are set to be freed in three to four days. //////At least 3,092 Bangladeshis, who have fled to Egypt from strife-torn Libya, will be repatriated in a couple of days, Foreign Secretary Mijarul Quayes said yesterday.//////The Supreme Court authorities have taken an initiative to interpret the existing rules of its Appellate Division in Bengali in an effort to show respect to the mother tongue and the language heroes and also for making it easy to understand.//////Japan warned there could be a small radiation leak from a nuclear reactor whose cooling system was knocked by yesterday's massive earthquake, but thousands of residents in the area had been moved out of harm's way .//////Seven people including four of a family were killed and 35 others injured in a bus-truck collision on the Dhaka-Aricha highway at Nayadingi in Saturia upazila of Manikganj yesterday.//////It is none other than the chairman of troubled Grameen Bank who is spreading by email a damning article on the organisation he is meant to hold together. //////An alleged criminal was killed in a 'shootout' between his accomplices and Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) in the old part of the capital, early yesterday.//////At least 17 Bangladeshis were injured in an attack by Indian Border Security Force (BSF) along Khanpur border in Poba upazila yesterday.//////Azerbaijani police yesterday arrested activists seeking to hold a protest in Baku, thwarting the first attempt by the opposition in the tightly controlled state to latch on to the Arab revolts.//////A Thai appeal court yesterday acquitted a police officer accused of involvement in the disappearance of a prominent Muslim human rights lawyer in 2004.//////President Barack Obama led the United States in offering "condolences" yesterday to the people of Japan and said his country stood ready to help them after a massive earthquake and tsunami.//////Dhaka and a few other districts of the country went through the season's first nor'wester last night.

They accused them of unsatisfactory performance and their 'attitude' to MPs adding that if these should continue popular expectations would remain unfulfilled. The MPs' criticism was practically reduced to complaints of behaviour rather than any objective assessment of ministerial performances. //////Deputy Speaker Col (retd) Shawkat Ali has brought into sharp focus a matter of vital importance so far as effective functioning of the chairmen and vice-chairmen of the upazila parishads goes. Regrettably, their role has been substantially stifled through a delegation of authority to the upazila nirbahi officers. This is in addition to the preponderance of the MPs at that level in an advisory capacity which is but of a binding nature.//////Under the captaincy of Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh have won a number of close matches, but nothing could have compared to the thrilling two-wicket victory over England at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in the port city yesterday.//////Shafiul Islam and Mahmudullah Riyad don't go back a long way, they have very few things in common and they would probably have been expected to do things according to the script. But there was no script on the night of March 11, 2011, and this unlikely pair gifted Bangladesh a thrilling win at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.//////Although Shakib Al Hasan could afford to have a big smile on his face, the great escape of Chittagong bringing the country together for a second time in the past 14 days, there was a lot of lessons for the Tigers that remained unlearned.//////You can fathom the sound that a 25,000-strong crowd would make at a ground like the beautifully decked Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. It sounds like waves crashing on the Patenga shores nearby and it's unending when the Tigers are on a roll both with bat and ball. But what we, at the ground, don't hear is the roar from thousands of miles away.//////Tillakaratne Dilshan hopes Sri Lanka's record-breaking surge into the World Cup quarterfinals will provide the spark for a second world title to add to the country's 1996 triumph.//////Sri Lanka's record-setting batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan insisted on Friday he is the victim of a smear campaign after he was wrongly accused of having failed a dope test.//////Vice-captain Misbahul Haq Friday vowed Pakistan would support Kamran Akmal after his horror show against New Zealand, saying the fumbling wicketkeeper was mentally tough.//////Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara praised "magic" team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and "champion" Muttiah Muralidaran for firing his team into the World Cup quarterfinals.//////Michael Hussey is planning to use the hurt he felt at being left out of Australia's World Cup squad to good use now he finds himself back with the champions in the subcontinent.//////Injured New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said he is targeting a return against Sri Lanka in the Black Caps' final World Cup group match on March 18 after seeing specialists Thursday.//////Tickets of the ICC CWC 2011 match between Bangladesh and Netherlands scheduled for 14 March 2011 at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong, will be available for collection at AK Khan Textile Gate on Alankar junction, from 12 March 2011.

I could read its sign from behind: On Emergency Export Duty. Good, I thought, they are helping the economy.

Udichi's 'Rabindra Abriti Shondha' held at Shawkat Osman Memorial Auditorium, Public Library, in Dhaka on March 10, however, was very well attended. Members of the organisation's central section and guest artistes recited familiar poems of Tagore at the nearly two-hour event.//////A two-day festival, titled 'Kemoney Bhulibo Ami', on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the Baul icon Shah Abdul Karim began at his native village Ujon Dhol, under Sunamganj district, yesterday afternoon.//////Padma Vibhushan Pandit Jasraj has been an outstanding exponent of Hindustani classical music for decades.

Consequently, Bangladeshis are suffering and enduring in patience without the perception of their innate strength.//////One sounds ancient while discussing the resumption of any dialogue between India and Pakistan. Not many people can even recall when the two sat across the table. And when was there any serious effort for rapprochement?

Policy responses for mitigation intend to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHGs) in order to avoid the anthropogenic causes of climate change. On the other hand, adaptation policies are necessary to cope with the adverse impacts, which will occur despite the best efforts to mitigate the causes. The very nature of climate change exacerbates the inequities in terms of contribution to the causes and the sufferings from the consequences. Causal liability shifts the burden to the industrialised countries to take entire responsibility for mitigation and adaptation. //////As I embark on narrating the tale of a dictionary, a mixed feeling gathers up in me. It is a useful and precious book but little known to most of us. It in an old book that was first given approval by the authorities way back in 1958. The copy that I possess was published in January 1980, which was its twenty-fourth edition. In terms of time, it is undoubtedly on old book and the saying, 'Old is gold', is apt testimony to its merits in a most comprehensive way. And this characterisation makes it not only a book but much more than a book. I am, of course, talking about Ashu Tosh Dev's --- or commonly known as AT Dev's -- Students' Favourite Dictionary which is from English to Bengali and then back to English. Hardly any dictionary provides us with two categories of meanings from word entries. Dictionaries that have done so, say in Bangladesh, have definitely followed the precedent although there might not be any acknowledgement thereof.//////Good afternoon to you, friends from Kolkata. It is good to be here, in this historic city, and an honour to be at the famous Kolkata Book Fair. From our childhood we have heard so much about this city, so many of our parents grew up in this city, or studied here, we feel very familiar here. //////Whilst I was casting and re-casting the speech I was to make, posturing in the presence of my closet friend in my rooms, two circumstances made my task easier. Firstly, we heard that the Poet had already been invited by Manchester College to come and address a gathering there and that he had consented. So I had only to request him to divide his time between them and us when he came over. Secondly, the Poet's son and daughter-in-law were visiting Oxford and some of us were asked by 'Mullickda' to luncheon to meet them. //////Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is now considered as an independent and substantial risk factor for developing heart diseases. So, taking measures to prevent kidney damage can help both ways to protect us from kidney disease and its precarious consequences like heart diseases and stroke. A simple urine test to detect protein which is a sign of kidney disease can save our kidneys from damage and in turn our hearts. But a significant number of people are simply unaware of it.//////Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the nerve involved in vision (called optic nerve) and progresses from visual disturbance to permanent loss of vision if left untreated. It is called the silent thief of sight and the person with glaucoma is usually unaware of it until serious loss of vision has occurred. It is often, but not always, associated with increased pressure of the fluid in the eye (aqueous humour). However, it is completely treatable if detected early.//////Accessibility to food is a problem for many. Common wisdom dictates that food on the table is meant to be eaten, hungry or not. Keeping it out of sight keeps you from eating more. The same is true of cupboards and refrigerators. Tempting treats should not be stored in the front where is jumps out at you every time you open a door, begging to be eaten. Try keeping healthier snacks in the front of cabinets, and fresh fruit, cut up veggies, or string cheese at the front of the refrigerator. Adding a fruit bowl to the counter is perfect, perfuming your kitchen with the smells of peaches, bananas, plums.//////Garlic is a versatile herb being used as spices, vegetables, medicine and beatifying agent. It is a naturally powerful antibiotic which is effective against toxic bacteria, viruses, and fungus. Garlic is one of the most popular healthy herbs all over the world.//////Sometimes, children might have certain problems that may create embarrassing situation to the parents. They do not like to share the problem with relatives and friends even. Few days back, a mother came to me with a boy of eight years old having apparently no problem. Her mother told me that her child wet bed every night. She was tired of cleaning beds and linens every day. She sought help from doctor before and showed me the prescription along with laboratory investigation reports. All of them were normal. This type of story is not very uncommon. We diagnose the problem as Enuresis.//////Fruits and vegetables from all color families provide our body with a rainbow of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, substances from natural source. Aim for at least three different colors at each meal to obtain maximum health benefits. //////If the WWIII, as it has already been predicted, would befall for the paucity of 'potable water', then it may be considered as possible that the WWIV would take place for acquiring 'information'. This may seem imminent eventually as concealed and classified 'facts' unveiled by the WikiLeaks have become a matter of headache for the big powers along with the Superpower. Julian Assange, the internet's freedom fighter's endeavor to shift regime behavior and to reveal 'unjust systems' has unleashed diplomatic cables consist of embarrassing 'confidentials' that did concern the related regimes and the entire diplomatic world. In conjunction with this, the expos includes the 'tale of woe' for Bangladesh as well, and disclosed secrets that would question the statecraft, political posture, intelligence, security issues, human rights situation, and predominantly, the sovereignty of the country. //////A historic opportunity awaits India in the next few months to address its fundamental security, cooperation in the region and its larger 'Look East Policy'. All of which can be enhanced through a strong partnership with our neighbour in the East, Bangladesh, overcoming years of suspicion. The time has come for a new approach, bold measures and out-of-the-box thinking. //////Forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi launched air strikes on rebel positions as the United States said that any no-fly zone over the country would need to have full UN backing.//////While reading Syed Manzoorul Islam's short stories, the first thing that strikes one is the role played by the self-conscious narrator, who is sometimes a part of the story, makes sarcastic remarks about other characters, and remains somewhat unaffected by the major changes and shifts in the plot. More interestingly, Islam's narrator assumes both first and third person points of view. At times his narrator, one is apt to notice, is highly critical of assuming any knowledge of a character's unspoken thoughts as in most of the stories in the book ////// But then in many of his impeccable stories in ////// and ////// he adopts a third person narrator and intrudes into the characters' psyche and yet retains the role otherwise played by a self-conscious narrator. However, in his latest volume titled ////// published at this year's Ekushey Book Fair, readers will find him at the height of his post-modern experimentation with his craftsmanship in both narratorial modes reaching an apotheosis.//////Nicholas Sparks has done it again! He holds the reader captive from the first page to the last in ////// The book is a real page turner. This is the moving story of Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner caught together in emotional upheavals and their discovery of love when they least expected it. //////This year a very young novelist has come forth with a novel at the Ekushey Book Fair. The title of the book is ////// which could be translated into English as 'The Year was of JSC'. The young author is Brotee Das Datta, who is only fourteen years old, a class nine student of Viqarunnisa Noon School. //////It is the ego we are talking about here. You might as well make a correction and say that the ego is what we have always been talking about, indeed have been nurturing throughout the course of human civilisation. And proof of that is what comes through in this gripping little book wherein you once more have cause to meet the famous and the illustrious, but this time with a difference though. //////
