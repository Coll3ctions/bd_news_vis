If passed into law, it will mean the adoption of stern measures against errant telecom operators charged with a violation of the law or are suspected of violating the law. Now, of course there is always the need for laws to protect and preserve the public interest. The telecom bill ought to have been part of the process of protecting the public interest, through ensuring a promotion and flourishing of the telecom sector. The very fact that the proposed law leaves no scope for appeal and indeed empowers the authorities to impose fines and arrest anyone they consider to be in the wrong (and without a warrant!) is as illogical as it is unfair. Let us be brutally frank about it: a law in the real sense of the term is not a law when it leaves individuals and institutions unable to file appeals against its application. No law can ignore such a basic right which citizens are entitled to. If it does, it dwindles into ham-fisted behaviour on the part of the state.//////Within nine weeks of a bilateral decision reached during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's trip to China, on exchange of high level visits between Beijing and Dhaka, Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinpeng has paid us a visit.

I wrote because I was amazed to see the stream of patients from Bangladesh. Are we to take it for granted that our medical care is getting worse? I met Bangladeshi patients daily with wrong treatment or failed treatment they had at Dhaka or elsewhere in Bangladesh. I also went there accompanying a patient who was told by Dhaka specialists that his disease was incurable. But my patient, a boy of 26 yeas, returned with assurance that he does not suffer from what the Dhaka specialists treated him for. It is Valore Christian Medical College where I met many who suffered from varied nature of diseases, patients of neurological, renal and gastric related diseases being in large number. One patient had wrong sided brain surgery by a reputed Neurosurgeon of Dhaka and CMC righted it by another surgery. Another neuro patient and his parents, disappointed by the suggestions of Neuro Medicine department of BSMMU that the treatment would incur a huge amount of money went there and got treated. To their bewilderment, the cost was minimal. A patient was wrongly treated for TB by a renowned medicine specialist (retired) and as a result he developed pleural effusion and I saw him getting treated there, showing hope of recovery. A child was said to have his both kidneys damaged at RMCH, but CMC found both kidneys fully OK and after carrying out a number of investigations gave the required treatment. The child and its parents had a great sigh of relief and left Valore happy. //////Bangladesh is a football loving nation. Though our team could not qualify in the World Cup, we are still excited to see our favourite team's performance. Bangladeshi football fans are traditionally divided into two groups - Either they support Brazil or they support Argentina. //////The high rate of fatal accidents in Bangladesh is cause for alarm and is unacceptable. The adoption of Road Safety Strategic Action Plans is a welcome move towards improving road safety. On the other hand, 90 percent of the driving licenses in Dhaka city are fake. Traffic management and law enforcement agencies are most visible in the streets of metropolitan areas. While much of it can be attributed to dereliction on the part of the traffic police, it is also true that vehicle derivers as well as pedestrians contribute in no small measure to road accidents. Most vehicles do not obey traffic signals or wish to be regulated.//////Thanks to Wasa that they have taken up the pilot project for recharging the under groundwater. The groundwater level of Dhaka goes lower by about 4 meter every year. The causes are://////Mohila madrasas, and religious educational institutions, are very new in Bangladesh. If one travels from Dhaka to any direction through the highways he will find roadside signboards of mohila madrasas at almost every 5/10 minutes' intervals. This proves that suddenly hundreds of such madrasas have been established in the country. //////Dr. Saadat Husain (Chairman, PSC) has provided a tutorial to the political pundits and the bureaucracy, in his in-depth article 'The devil is in the details' (DS of 4/5/10).//////Securities and Exchange commission (SEC) continue to advise the public in respect of stock market investments in secondary shares during abnormal behaviour of markets. Unfortunately, SEC is the sole authority to allow Public Limited Companies (PLC) to raise share capital through IPO--initial public offering after proper checking of the documents and probable return on investments. Thus investors are not required to verify the probable performances while investing through IPO as SEC is the wizard in this respect. But thousands of investors in primary shares in PLC's have lost significantly. Thus what is the role of SEC when corruption is to be regulated? Let SEC do something in prosecuting the fraudulent PLC's, while recession compensation package money entitlement to IPO holders need be considered, I believe.//////Our leaders ignore their moral responsibility so nakedly that their sense of civility can be questioned. //////The US President is losing some of his popularity, thanks to BP's oil mess in the Gulf of Mexico. The recently found oil well has been leaking oil all over the US south-eastern sea and shoreline, for well over a month; with no end in sight till today! BP has managed to unsettle the newly elected Democratic administration, to the secret delight of the Republicans, who are quietly watching the matter. They are forcefully joining in the rightly felt disgust and dismay of the people, directly or indirectly affected by the oil spill! The Republicans are playing their cards in this 'blame game'; and as rightly observed by Obama-- 'the buck stops here'; assuming the overall responsibility! This is a mature gesture from a confident President who does not prefer to "pass the buck on". His statement is the right and mature step on the issue.//////Last week(05-26-2010) , a curious article entitled "Veiled threat?" grabbed my attention. It's writer, Mr. Ilahi Choudhury, talked in length about a woman's right to expose herself and ridiculed the former Secretary General of Amnesty International Ms. Irene Khan's opinion that a woman's constitutional right consist of covering or uncovering whichever parts of her body she wishes, even her face. Mr. Choudhury insists that a woman should keep her face exposed, regardless of whether she wants to or not, and applauded several European nations for prohibiting wearing of the veil, calling for such measures on a global scale.//////At the end of the fourth day at Lord's, Bangladesh were 328 for five. On the fifth day they were bowled out for 382 before lunch. This is simply unbelievable. Leaving aside the two bowlers, the Bangladeshi recognized batsmen, who so easily tumbled to the average English bowling attack in less than two hours on the final day of the Test, are no less experienced and talented players. Each of them has played many Tests by now. Then what made them play like novices at a crucial time when draw was inevitable with only their being able to face the English bowling for two more hours? How will we explain their failure to do so? Did any or some of them capitulate to the English bookies? //////This has reference to the letter published on The Star Friday 28th May 2010 on a cover story of the same magazine 'The case for Coal,' and my letter in response to the article. I would like to thank the letter-writer for taking up this point. It's a positive sign that many wise people will come up with fascinating information, logic and ideas, but I think, extraction and burning of coal has a relationship with unsustainable development which is essentially a political problem, and the language of politics is here symbolic. Just because an act is symbolic doesn't mean it is empty. The only way to truly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to take the pressure off global warming, is an international regime that puts a cap and a price on climate pollution. And the only way that will happen is if the academics, development experts, scientists, economists, corporate leaders and politicians around the world, not here only in Bangladesh, become convinced that sustainable development is an issue that matters to people, one that will make them change the way they live, the way they 'buy' and 'sell' their lives, and vote. Opposing the idea will take us nowhere. //////Israelis have done it again. The commandos of the illegal state of Israel this time indiscriminately killed unarmed aid workers on international waters mostly from their friendly nation of Turkey. World conscience is shocked at this inhuman act. But their main mentor superpower USA will not stop their unconditional support to Israel. //////In India, in almost all parts of the country the main source of transportation is railway and a large portion of budget is spent in this sector. Recently, a massive train accident claimed over 80 lives and injured around 200.In Midnapore, a district of West Bengal, a train derailed as fish-plates were removed from the tracks causing the accident. A suspicion arose that the Maoist insurgents were involved in this carnage. It indicates that the sub-continent is used as 'transit' for terrorism. Last year, India experienced a deadly attack and such s major and minor offensive activities are happening round the year. //////A student, aged 20, of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, was crushed under the wheels of a bus on 27 May.

Our first and foremost duty is to involve the school goers in raising consciousness. They are the group who can create awareness among their parents, siblings and other family members.

I didn't miss the first match. I'm a die-hard supporter of the Argentine team -- for several reasons. First of all, they play remarkably well and have won the World Cup before. Hopefully, this year too, they'll win the trophy. Another reason why I like the team is that, Argentina is the land of Maradona. Billions of football aficionados around the world know Maradona. I'd be hugely disappointed if Argentina doesn't win the title at this year's World Cup. Many bet on matches during the tournament, some have already started but I haven't. I feel that if you believe in your team, betting in unnecessary. I intend to watch every match. However, I might miss one or two because of shooting but I won't miss any of Argentina's games. It doesn't matter who they play against, as long as Argentina is in the final, I'll be happy. I'd prefer Argentina facing any of the African teams. //////Popular ////// singer Suvro Dev has recently recorded a song titled Goal Goal.

Think of all the fears, all the apprehensions, all the doubts and suspicions that swirl around you at the time when the annual national budget is about to be announced. And once the finance minister has made his presentation, everyone seems to be getting caught in a frenzy of response and reaction. You can be sure the political opposition will decry the entire exercise as a plot against the poor; and, in the next breath, you can be certain that the ruling circles will suggest that the budget proves the nation has never had it so good. But if you wish to have an objective idea of post-budget conditions, ask the simple citizens of this country. More likely than not, you will find them in a spot.//////The two-day (June14-15) visit of Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinping to Bangladesh is significant for bilateral relations. It is noted that Xi Jinping has been anointed as the likely successor to President Hu Jintao as party chief in 2012. It is a coincidence that the Chinese leader will observe his 57th birthday on June 15 in Bangladesh.//////THE power sector reform program in South Asia missed the point that electricity is a secondary energy. It ignored the need for ensuring supply of primary fuel to generate electricity. In Bangladesh, since domestic gas reserve was considered plentiful, gas-based generation capacities were added without any thought that gas is an exhaustible resource. There are signs of gas shortage, which is going to become more acute by 2013. //////THE victims of the world's worst chemical disaster, at Union Carbide Corporation's (UCC) pesticides plant in Bhopal, abandoned all hope of securing real justice in 1989, when the Indian government reached an out-of-court settlement with Carbide for an atrociously inadequate $470 million.
