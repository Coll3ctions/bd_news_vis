This is like punishing Bangladeshis for something they had nothing to do with. Police vehicles were damaged and set on fire. These vehicles have been bought with the taxpayers' money.

By displaying violence Muslims are falling into the trap that has been set by the very people who show disrespect to our religion. Please realise that this is exactly what they want us to do.

This has made call costs significantly low. It was quite necessary because to make telecommunication accessible to all, the call cost must be low.

With lower costs and increased usage of such technologies, Bangladesh can improve its ranking in the ICT Development Index.//////Games and sports are for amusement and development of the body and mind.
