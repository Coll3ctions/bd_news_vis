But Bangladesh is such a country which falls victims to such calamities almost every year, even twice a year. A few months back floods hit the northwest areas of this country and, as a result, a lot of people became homeless, shelter-less and had to starve. A few days ago cyclone Sidr hit the southwest areas of Bangladesh. Through different TV channels and daily newspapers it has come to our notice that thousands of people died, a good number of them became homeless because of the cyclone. Many of them were admitted to different hospitals for treatment. Actually, the exact loss of human lives and properties is yet to be known to us. //////The present CTG came into power with overwhelming support from all segments of people. Some of their activities are being highly appreciated by the common people. It is the perception of the common people that the present government will complete all those works which were not done by the political governments over the last 36 years. For example, separation of the judiciary from the executive was one of the main commitments of all the previous governments, but they did not do that. Similarly, justice for the war criminals is one of the long outstanding demands of the people. People believe that justice will never be done by any political government in future. So, like war against corruption, they should take the initiative to bring the war criminals under the purview of law. Definitely, it is a gigantic task but the CTG cannot bypass their responsibility in this matter. If they avoid it by saying that their work volume will increase or their main task is holding the election, then their other works that are related to policy matters will be questioned. //////Quality of education at public universities compared to the international educational standard has fallen alarmingly. We are way behind in all fields of education compared to our next-door neighbour India. We do not have enough natural resources to sustain a growing population. Our only hope for the future is our bright, innovative and intelligent population resource.//////The prices of the daily commodities are increasing day by day. I am a general citizen. After obtaining the Masters' degree, I am working as an accountant in a company. My salary is very poor. How shall I pass my days with this limited income? When we go to market to buy the necessary things then we realise the price level. In Bangladesh, we the general citizens are helpless. //////Koraish Munshi Bazar under P.S Dagunbhuyan, Dist. Feni is in dire need of a bank for obvious reasons. The locality surrounding the markets has the following favourable points for opening a bank. //////A front page news item in an English daily (Nov: 10) reported on a heated debate on the sixth (?) draft coal policy at its (6X2) 12th meeting! Mathematically, we need (6X3) 18 meetings for the coal policy to be finally approved! The debate agreed that more experts were needed to monitor coal mining (open-cast?) and the environmental issues related to it! It also further recommended the forming of a high-powered committee for deciding on compensation payments and the rehabilitation of//////It's totally unethical that government officers have grabbed public land for their own benefits. Bangladesh is a country where the land-man ratio is the lowest in the world. So, every inch of land should be used here ensuring maximum benefit to the general public. Recently, a news report was published in a daily that government officers took permanent lease of public land in Cox's Bazar. We as ordinary citizens demand full investigation into the matter-- whether the land was given following the rules and regulations. If not, then the lease should be cancelled and the officers who worked illegally brought to book.//////Since the Dhaka Club requested 25 acres of land in the Suhrawardy Udyan for a golf course I have not seen anyone ask the common sense question: "How many acres as a minimum does it take to make a golf course?" I asked the Internet and got this answer: "If it's a par 36, nine hole course, you are going to be looking at at least 75 acres. If it's an "executive " par 3 course, you will be looking at at least 40-50 acres, depending on hole length." So the only kind of course that 25 acres would accommodate would be a "Pee-wee golf course," a common entertainment in the USA even for people who have never golfed before.//////Perpetual sabotage to disrupt marine cable connectivity leaves the country without any communication, resulting in loss of hundreds of millions an hour. Apparently, sabotaging the cable is a novel phenomenon and it poses a grave challenge to business and national security. One cannot expect business growth with such things going on. Further, it can serve as an impediment against attracting foreign direct investment. In addition to erratic power supply and labour unrest, should disruption of connectivity become a regular incident, then, Bangladesh can forget about receiving foreign investment.//////Following India in particular, Our electronic media has been arranging beauty parade every year. These contests are basically money-making mechanisms that are occasions for exposure of young girls that nourish upon the instincts of sex-hungry souls of the spectators. No coherent criteria are presented for judgment of the brains and beauty of the contestants. Young girls express themselves with different postures by walking on the stage putting on fashion clothes for public entertainment. The question and answer episodes are so hypocritical that do not get along with the spirit of these beauty shows. Fake events and coating of formality are presented in these contests. //////The trial of war criminals has come under spotlight once again. I am quite surprised to see the newspapers coming forward with great enthusiasm. What were they doing in the last 36 years? Why did Mir Showkat Ali join the cabinet of Khaleda Zia's government which was formed with the support of the Jamaat? To me, the whole issue has been used as a political weapon. When the caretaker government talks about any radical changes either of judiciary or of legislative, everyone stands up and voices their opposition saying that the purpose of the interim government should only be limited to the holding of a free and fair election. Now, it's absolutely ridiculous to see everyone asking the caretaker government to try the war criminals, an issue no previous governments could solve. That's one of the signs of decaying political norm in Bangladesh. The corruption issue has taken the centre-stage. We, the common people of Bangladesh, want that to be done and dusted first. The whole world has seen how the leading political figures of Bangladesh made enormous wealth out of people's misery. The general public no longer care what those politicians say. They have lost their credibility substantially.//////I would like to request you to publish a report on the Park at Gulshan-1 (opposite National Shooting Complex) inaugurated by Mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka in October 2006. Every morning hundreds of people come for a walk and face great difficulty due to the broken walkway. There is none for its maintenance and gradually vagabonds are occupying the park by constructing sheds. The quality of construction was quite bad as within one year's time, the newly constructed walkway is falling apart. A few months back, the bulldozer of the City Corporation suddenly demolished a portion of the walkway for earth filling and then they left! We don't know why they came and why they left. //////When will our media get over the fascination for all things Pakistani? Can't we realise that Pakistan is an unrealistic country whose philosophy is based on hatred. Pakistan will never become a country having any significance because of its attitude, system of government and philosophy. //////The DS editorial on Wednesday, November 14, 2007 entitled "Issue of 1971 war crimes: Time has come to deal with anti-liberation elements" includes "Matters were then carried to ludicrous heights by a retired civil servant, an unabashed Jamaat follower, when he stated that in 1971 it was a civil war and not a War of Liberation which took place in Bangladesh." //////Library is the core point of any institution/organisation for better study and research and a librarian is called the master of a master. A library can play a pivotal role, for the development of the nation in the context of education as well as better citizenship, by providing the state-of-the-art information. But in our country that is not happening. //////I am a resident of Iqbal Road, Mohammadpur. Many educational institutions have been set up in the locality over the years, from schools to universities. Since these are housed in residences meant for families, these institutions cannot provide all amenities necessary to organise various programmes and functions, not even a decent auditorium to host programmes and functions with a proper sound control system. On the 1st of November the residents of Iqbal Road witnessed one such celebration, hosted by a private university in the locality, celebrating its 5th founding anniversary. The local field was used to host this day-long programme. //////The role of judiciary in Pakistan politics is getting vital by every passing day.

Yes, as individuals we can make a dramatic change in our fortunes and the nation's as a whole. I can remember a saying: "If you win a heart, you win the world, because your love means the world to him." It is really shameful of our wealthy citizens not to have the minimum sense of responsibility to the nation they belong to, and which had nurtured them to be there at their zenith.//////The Labour Party has won an historic landslide in Australia's general election on Saturday, defeating incumbent Prime Minister John Howard's Liberal Party. Labour Party Leader Kevin Rudd is set to become Australia's 26th prime minister, succeeding Howard who led the country for almost eleven and half years since 1996. Howard was re-elected in 1998, 2001 and 2004 to become Australia's second-longest serving prime minister. This defeat marks the end of the Howard era.//////If any politician of this country is to be remembered for uncommon qualities of head and heart for nearly half a century of dedicated and selfless public service, the name of Yusuf Ali Chowdhury, known to most people as Mohan Mia, comes to the fore.
