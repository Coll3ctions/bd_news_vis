There are all the moments when the state of the country's politics has a disquieting effect on us all and for the right reasons. Even so, for all the confrontational nature of politics, for all our feeling that we may have been caught up in a morass, we do get to be encouraged when we are given a glimpse of the inner strength of our people which reports of a global nature sometimes hold up for us. The UNDP's Human Development Report 2010 is one of those instances that should be acting as a spur to our goals, to a fulfillment of them, for the future. In a wide-ranging survey of countries, the report places Bangladesh in third position among 95 countries in terms of an improvement in the quality of life. For good measure, the report shows that the Human Development Index in Bangladesh has gone up by as much as 81 per cent since 1981. Of course, one does not really require a report to know of the various areas where the country has made advances. In terms of the economy, such fields as garments have performed remarkably. In similar manner, the remittances that have made their way into the country from abroad, owing to the presence of a large body of Bangladeshi manpower in various countries, have brought about qualitative changes in life, particularly at the rural levels.//////As successful women entrepreneurs are leading the way, more and more women are being drawn to follow in their footsteps.

Further, shallow draft prevents having permanent ferry crossings and IWT launch terminals and wayside stations.

And it is the sacred duty of both the guardians and the teachers to guide them properly. //////Dhaka is the 9th most populated capital city in the world. Its all areas, localities, roads and streets, govt. offices and commercial places, markets and bazaars, schools, colleges and universities, bus terminals, river stations, railways stations, banks and hospitals and what not are over crowded and jam-packed.//////When there is acute shortage of gas supply for preparation of our meals the demand of the CNG stations for round the clock provision for supply to the private cars is just imprudent. For the last few months our women in the home have been facing dire odds to keep burners on and keep us fed in time. Gas, apart from household use, also caters for production of electricity, and to speak the truth, the power outage could never be so awful and miserable if priority for generation of power (electricity) was considered more imperative than granting the provision for random supply of gas to private cars. And making CNG available at a cheaper rate induced the haves to rush to buy cars and as a result Dhaka has witnessed the boom of private cars that has singly attributed to the present insoluble problem of traffic jam. However, public transport like three wheelers could get preference for obvious reason. //////Some time ago, anxious to buy a railway ticket for over Eid, I went to Banani Railway Station, as instructed by the friends I am visiting, to buy the ticket I needed for a journey on November 13th. I was told I could not book until 9 days before the journey i.e. November 4th, so, on that afternoon, I duly joined the queue. After a time, there was an electricity cut and we were informed that, as the ticket machine worked by electricity, we would have to wait an hour. I waited in my car for an hour but, when I returned and was kindly pushed to the front of the queue, I was taken to one side and informed that the ticket could not be given to me as I had to get it on my mobile. My mind boggled. I was told I had to go to the Grameen Centre. Now in a daze, my car faced the jams back to Gulshan 2 once more. //////Media reports frequently point out collapse of the approach roads to the bridges (especially small bridges). What is the solution?//////Perhaps the Hon'ble PM is kept well posted about what is happening across the country, or to say rightly, what majority of the activists belonging to different branch outfits of the AL are committing caring damn to what causes disrepute of the government. Their bullying, rowdiness, and muscle flexing, especially in the spheres of public works have been the talk of the country, and the nation is well taking note of them. Though she warned them of dire consequences, but people observe, they are still being dealt with kid gloves and so they could carry out the murder in Baraigram, Natore just after the sensational attack on the high-ranking public servants in Pabna.//////I am writing this letter to state the plight of millions who live under extreme poverty. Out of five basic needs food is something, which comes first. After around forty years of our independence, have we yet met the demand of 16.44 crore people? The simple answer is NO. //////Although Bangladesh is a developing country, still compared to the other countries the teaching methods are very old and hence monotonous. The students of our country are hardworking and serious. This is the reason why many Bangladeshi students are studying in many renowned educational institutions around the world. //////Traffic jam is everywhere around and you can't just avoid it. The long queue in front of the CNG filling stations is one of the reasons. Secondly, thousands of vehicles are being added to the streets of Dhaka every day. People park their vehicles in wrong places, drivers try to overtake each other, stop their cars in the middle of the road, and start arguing. These are some of the major reasons behind severe traffic jam. Nowadays it's really hard for me to get to my school in time. //////Good customer service is the lifeblood of any business. You can offer promotions and slash prices to bring in as many new customers as you want, but unless you can get some of those customers to come back, your business won't be profitable for long. In Bangladesh service providers hardly think that way. Good customer service is all about bringing customers back. And about sending them away happy happy enough to pass positive feedback about your business along to others, who may then try the product or service you offer for them and in their turn become repeat customers.//////US President Barack Obama has said India and the US are united against terrorism, as he visited the scene of deadly attacks in Mumbai in 2008.//////Books on US President Barack Obama and posters bearing his image are selling fast in New Delhi and Mumbai, the two cities he is visiting on a trip to India.//////Some of the bigger parties contesting Sunday's election in military-ruled Myanmar have raised fresh complaints of unfairness, including voters being threatened if they don't back the ruling junta's party.//////Canadian officials have detained a young Asian man who apparently boarded a flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver disguised as an elderly white male.//////Visiting US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle will not be visiting the Taj Mahal but will have a view of the Humayun's Tomb here, an artistic precursor to the 17th century monument of love in Agra, today.//////Scribbled notes from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar have surfaced in mosques all over Afghanistan's ethnic Pashtun heartland, threatening death to anyone who takes up a government offer to negotiate for peace, according to a long-time Taliban member.//////Airlines cancelled at least 36 flights to and from Jakarta yesterday, affecting international carriers from Europe to Asia, because of ash from the Mount Merapi volcano, an airport spokesman said.//////Thousands of mourners attended the funeral yesterday of a Pakistani politician who was stabbed in London in September in a slaying that set off rioting in his hometown of Karachi.//////Heavy rain from Hurricane Tomas has battered western Haiti, causing floods, which have killed at least four people.//////Western officials are crediting a Saudi intelligence tip they received in early October, nearly three weeks before terrorists in Yemen managed to smuggle mail bombs onto airplanes, with heading off what could have been a series of catastrophic explosions aboard jetliners.//////Pakistan has handed over to India its latest dossier on the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks and a formal request regarding its proposal to send a commission to interview key witnesses in India in connection with the trial of seven Pakistani suspects linked to the incident.//////The top Democrat in the US House of Representatives has said she wants to continue to lead her party in the chamber despite its big losses in the mid-term elections.//////Siddhartha Shankar Ray, former chief minister of West Bengal, died last night in Kolkata after a protracted illness.//////To mark the 150th birth anniversary of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore which falls next year, a cultural programme was held at Selaidah Kuthibari on Friday evening. //////Aminul Islam is one of the senior-most and acclaimed painters in our country.
