Mafia Don Michael Corleone when uttered these innocent words in Godfather movie, viewers were just mum and one more time they could feel that the importance of children was same to all. In that particular moment, all parents' hearts must have filled with love for their children. But in the practical world, we are perhaps ignoring this simple truth, especially in Bangladesh.//////I would like to begin by quoting Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Ford Presidency: "No country has influenced internationals as decisively and at the same time as ambivalently as the United States. No society has more firmly insisted on the admissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of other states, or more passionately asserted that its own values were universally applicable". That was precisely the foreign policy trend of the government of the United States. But disastrous foreign policy was presented by President George W. Bush when he invaded Afghanistan in 2001 without presenting evidential proof that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian, who was a guest resident of Afghan government, was responsible for launching attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York and without the authorization of the United Nations.//////BANGLADESH is considered highly vulnerable climate change and climate variability. Various predictions of sea level rise puts 55% of its population on the threat of inundation. It will affect infrastructures including water systems, housing and settlements, transport networks, utilities, and industry.

The prevalence of diseases will increase their vulnerability and constrain economic activities. //////WHEN I was a kid I used to see hundreds of vultures in my backyard but now a glimpse of these charismatic creatures has become extremely rare, utters Abdul Mia, the owner of a vulture turf in the plains of Nobiganj.//////THE term Industrial Ecology has been evolved as a outcome of thoughtfulness to carry on industrial activities without impairing the environmental quality.

In the story, we learned about the reaction of Siddhartha, who later came to be known as Gautam Buddha, when he had a face-to-face encounter with death in Kapilavastu. His father, King Sudhhodono, did not want his son to have to deal with death or human suffering. But Gautam witnessed both, in spite of the king and his courtiers. Since the time I read the story, it has stayed with me, and the manner in which Siddhartha went about on his now legendary quest for the meaning of life and death has always fascinated me. Later I realized that, amongst my friends, like many others growing up in the Indian sub-continent in the 60's and 70's, we had a shared feeling that real search for truth begins only after you witness death or experience love. //////I should not have spoken ill of winter in my earlier dispatch. Old man winter continues to wreck havoc - especially on the West coast. The Pacific coast, known for its balmy weather, was taken by surprise when they were dumped with snow of the amount many have never seen in their entire lives. Life literally halted. The most affected by this recalcitrant weather pattern were the holiday travelers as their travel plans went haywire with cancelled flights, delays and re-routings. Television news replayed pictures of sleep-deprived travelers anxiously waiting for a lucky break that would transport them from the no-man zone of the airport to their familiar abodes. Then there would be others, who would camp out in the waiting area, oblivious to the rest of the world. When I had booked a flight from Montreal to San Francisco five months ago, I had no idea I would be caught up in this travel frenzy myself. //////The rising outbreak of bird flu both in birds and humans has renewed fears of a pandemic that could kill millions of people. Highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu virus is gradually increasing its ability to spread efficiently and substantially among humans.//////One of the most basic tenets of weight loss is to burn more calories than you consume.

Are you trying to cram too many activities into too little time? If so, you may find stress relief by learning how to say no to others and yes to yourself. Don't make up reasons to get out of an obligation. The truth is always the best way to turn down a friend, family member or co-worker. But let them down gently. Compliment the person or group's effort while saying that you are unable to commit at this time. It will soften the blow and keep you in good graces.//////THE Gaza war planners have succeeded at most to mobilize Israeli public opinion in support of the military campaign against Gaza. Although the trio of leaders, Olmert, Livni and Ehud Barak, lack real support from the public to lead, they have succeeded to convince Israelis, getting 90% support, of the necessity of this campaign. Olmert, who has been questioned tens of times by the police, is suspected of receiving bribes and of other wrong doings, was forced to leave office early and to agree to early elections. He declared war on Gaza one and a half months before the elections as a transitional Prime Minister. Nobody knows how Prime Minister Olmert has succeeded to conduct a war given his current status as a Prime Minister under suspicion for taking bribes. Some argue that all the investigations against him were part of a grand deception to show that there is no Prime Minister functioning while at the same time planning the grand strategy of the war. Others argue that the military leadership decided to conduct a war exactly at this moment with a weak transitional Prime Minister. //////THE Indian Foreign Minister Mr. Pranab Mukherjee is going to be the first high profile foreign visitor to Bangladesh when he arrives in Dhaka as a Special Envoy of the Indian Prime Minister on February 8th. India has figured high in this government's priorities. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has spoken of the need for jointly tackling militancy and terrorism which, the Foreign Minister has resonated. The Minister for Water Resources has also spoken of the need to reactivate the Joint River Commission. The Indian High Commissioner is also making his Ministerial rounds harping upon the need for closer Bangladesh-India cooperation. Clearly, intent from both governments for improvement of bilateral relations is obvious.//////Geostrategy refers to the study of geographical and political factors that together shape the political and military planning of a nation. Based on geographical position of the state, it involves planning and assigning means for achieving national, political, and military objectives. It describes where a state concentrates its effort by projecting military power and diplomatic activities. Since the end of WW II, the subject of geostrategy has been of increasing interest to the politicians, diplomats, academics and the military leaders. A sound understanding of Bangladesh's geostrategy and the challenges and opportunities that it presents is important for future planning. The subject becomes all the more relevant as Bangladesh enters a new era of democratic administration that comes with a promise of change change for the better.//////
