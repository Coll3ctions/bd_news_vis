This is how one can define livelihoods in the hill tracts.//////Even though the electorate expect a clear stance on the militancy issue from the mayoral candidates of Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC), the candidates, however, avoided talking about it fearing it would affect their vote tally. //////The government plan of action for dealing with climate change will focus on building the country's capacity to meet the challenges from shifts in global weather patterns over the next 20-25 years. //////South Asian leaders yesterday demanded strong action to stop terrorism spreading like "wildfire" as a regional summit opened here dominated by heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.//////Another 118 deported Bangladeshi workers arrived in Dhaka yesterday from Kuwait, raising their total number to 464.//////The main fight in tomorrow's city corporation mayoral election in Khulna will be between Talukder Abdul Khaleque and Moniruzzaman Moni although there are four other candidates contesting the poll.//////Awami League (AL)-backed Shawkat Hossain Hiron and expelled BNP leader Ahsan Habib Kamal brace themselves for a close finish in the mayoral race in Barisal City Corporation (BCC).//////As the incumbent mayor of Sylhet City Corporation Badaruddin Ahmed Kamran languishes in jail, he well illustrates the caretaker government's reputation for detaining high-profile leaders on multiple charges of corruption. //////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday said his government would take necessary steps to ensure efficient management of duty-free access for Bangladeshi products to the Indian market. //////The holy Shab-e-Barat will be observed on the night of August 16 as the moon of the Arabic month of Saban was sighted yesterday. //////The Maldives will host the 16th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) in Male, diplomatic sources said.//////Shohag Hossain never studied at night in preparation for his SSC examination.//////A group of eminent citizens yesterday urged voters to use their best judgement while casting votes tomorrow at 13 constituencies so that honest and competent candidates without war crimes allegations can be elected as their representatives.//////The prime ministers of nuclear-armed India and Pakistan ended closed-door talks in Colombo yesterday with an agreement to keep alive their peace process despite escalating tensions, diplomats said.//////Sri Lankan government troops have entered the district housing the Tamil Tiger rebels' de facto capital for the first time in 11 years, the military said Saturday as a regional summit opened in the capital. //////Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman returned home in the early hours today after a three months' stay abroad. //////IT is obvious that the Election Commission is in a state of helplessness. That happens to be so because a number of candidates for the city corporation and municipal elections are taking part in the polls despite their non-compliance with mandatory provisions regarding furnishing some specific personal information to the EC. The non-compliance is of two sorts. The first relates to their submission of false information about themselves in the affidavit, while the second concerns incomplete information they have supplied to the EC. It is quite understandable, therefore, that as election day approaches (and that is tomorrow), the EC will be perturbed without in any way being able to do anything at this late stage to prevent such people from taking part in the elections.//////WE are concerned at the slow progress in containing the baby boom for which the Millennium Development Goal (MDG-5) is likely to be difficult to attain by 2015. MDG was set at reducing total fertility rate (TFR) to 2.2 percent by 2010. According to Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2007, the TFR in the period 1993-94 was 3.4 percent, which came down to 2.7 in 2007 but did not come down any further. Poor management of the programme is widely considered the main reason for the stagnancy in achieving the target. //////I had the privilege of participating in a very recent workshop on "Gas Sector Reform Roadmap and Gas Demand -- Supply Balance" of the Gas Sector Development Program, organised jointly by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Technoconsult International Limited (TCIL). Frankly speaking, "reform" and "roadmap" are the key words that drove me to this workshop. Usage of the terms reform and roadmap are so common nowadays that they cease to be nouns, but noises. What then are the roadmap and reforms regarding our gas sector -- the linchpin of growth and development?//////THE unwarranted violence and arrest of our migrant workers by the Kuwaiti police for staging strikes in demand of promised pay and other facilities, is an extremely shocking piece of news. This was front-page news on The Daily Star and other national dailies on July 31, accompanied by a picture of a deported worker in bandages and wearing a bloodstained T-shirt, who was reported to be dragged out of his residential camp and was mercilessly beaten up by the police though he did not take part in any protests.//////DESPITE President Bush's description of Pakistan as a "strong ally and vibrant democracy" during the recent visit to Washington by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, a suspected US missile attack inside Pakistan that reportedly killed a top Taliban biological and chemical weapons expert underscores US suspicion that Pakistan is not doing enough in the fight against extremists and terrorists and Afghan President Karzai's accusation that Pakistan military intelligence is not doing its best to prevent cross-border militancy by Afghan Talibans from their sanctuary in some areas of the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA). //////Mohammad Rafique

As I opened the talk I posed the question whether based on our day-to-day experience the phrase is a contradiction in terms. Of course with the Arthur Andersens, Enrons, Parmalats, and Bdfoods of the world fresh in our memory, it is hard to imagine that businesses can be anything but self-serving amoral institutions devoted to mindless profiteering.//////Oil prices jumped higher Friday on renewed jitters over Iran's disputed nuclear program, as Israel's deputy Prime Minister, Shaul Mofaz, said Tehran was playing for time.//////The three-day long Youth Brand Fair 2008 that began on Thursday ended at the city's Bashundhara Expo Centre yesterday with high response from the visitors, said a press release.//////Standard Bank Limited approved 12 percent dividend for its shareholders for the year 2007.//////Shares in building materials and cement group Lafarge fell heavily on Friday on a slip in first-half profits that came despite strong business activity in emerging markets.//////The US unemployment rate hit a four-year high in July as employers shed jobs for a seventh straight month amid economic uncertainty, a Labor Department survey showed Friday.//////Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer said Friday it plans to become the world leader in executive jets within the next decade by investing heavily to get a bigger slice of the rapidly expanding market.//////The German luxury car maker BMW joined rival Daimler on Friday in warning it would miss its 2008 targets, a sign that high-end manufacturers have been caught by the international financial crisis.//////The Total oil group raised its adjusted first-half net profit by 15 percent to 6.977 billion euros on high oil prices, but warned on Friday that world oil production capacity remained tight.//////This week, there was ample liquidity in the local market, and US dollar remained almost unchanged against the Bangladesh Taka.

People from all over the world would call this country the daughter of nature. But the matter of great regret is that over the years our country has lost its beauty. For example now if we go to Madhupur we will see that most of those Sal trees of this area have been demolished. Only a few Sal trees can be seen in the Madhupur forests. The same appalling situation can be seen in the CHT and in the greater Sylhet district. Unlawful encroachment, illicit trade in forest-produce, incompatible use of forest land, lack of conservation initiatives to protect the flora and fauna, increased salinity, lack of accountability of the forest officials, absence of people's involvement in forest managementall these are the main reasons behind deforestation. This deforestation has severely affected our economic and ecological stability, forest dwellers and wildlife. We know well that a country needs 25% forest on its total land mass. But we have only 8% or 9% forests. So from this we can easily realise that very soon our country will turn into a desert, unless we, the citizens, do something to protect our forests.//////The lead news in The Daily Star internet edition is that "5500 local and international observers to monitor polls". There might be lot of people in Bangladesh who would be delighted to see the news and at the same time disagree with my opinion on the question of observers monitoring the elections in Bangladesh. Firstly, I am totally against any foreign or local observer doing the work: and, secondly, I find it disgraceful to the nation. These events have so far successfully managed to demonise the role and authority of the Election Commission and grown as "orchid " bodies to deter the growth of the EC as an independent and neutral institution, fully capable of conducting and monitoring the entire electoral process.//////It is a sheer disappointment to see the water logging of Dhaka city after rain. It makes me wonder whether our engineers are aware of the fact that one of the most important design considerations of road construction is drainage. This is needed to remove water efficiently from the surface of the roads to provide a safe passage for all vehicles and pedestrians. Drainage of rainwater minimizes road maintenance cost and hence maximizes the operational lifetime of the roads. It is a simple math.//////I very much enjoyed the article by Abdul Bayes, Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, on poverty traps. We in the United States are watching the middle class consumers dropping into the poverty ranks.

It is my finding that missing child is a serious problem in Mirpur & Pallabi areas. It is for your information that on an average I have heard mike announcements for missing child every week in the last seven years. //////The government is holding the upazila elections before parliamentary elections. It is one of the good initiatives by the military backed caretaker government. But the political parties have opposed the plan. Their attitude is undemocratic. The local government is constitutionally non-partisan.//////One of your writers stated that it was not befitting for a party founded by a valiant freedom fighter like Ziaur Rahman to include Jamaat in its folds.//////After so-called 1/11, this government has taken different initiatives to reform some statutory bodies. EC, ACC, PSC, UGC etc. The motivation behind this venture was to strengthen the bodies, so that they can introduce and implement the rules for the welfare of mass people. We became very optimistic over their verbose expressions. They have arranged so many discussions, seminars, dialogues, campaigns or even finally 'Road show' to form public opinion in favour of them. But what is going on in their 'test case'? In city corporation & municipality elections, are they being successful? The answer is 'no'. Absolutely not.//////"To kill the devil you need an evil, I want to be the one"...this is what came out of the mouth of the renowned terrorist Khondokar Tanvir Islam (Joy). Most interestingly, while he was released from jail on bail and taking treatment from a Calcutta hospital under police surveillance, he spoke freely to the local media about some ground realities. There are a group of people namely opportunist groups of politicians, who are part of our society, same are a big group of bureaucrats and religion based fundamentalists, looting the country for long time...Joy wants to expose these groups of people. I think our government should welcome his return and facilitate his activity, so that he is able to perform those noble duties which the government could not! //////It is an unpleasant truth that the Muslims in this subcontinent (and in the Middle East as well) are generally 'taught' to hate the Jews. Dr. Syed Ashraf Ali, the renowned Islamic thinker, is perhaps the only Islamic scholar in the subcontinent who over and again reminds the Muslims that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Sm) always considered Islam to be the only Deen chosen by Allah, but he never hated the Jews or the Christians. Dr. Ali has cited a historic incident in numerous television discourses and write-ups. When a bier carrying a Jew's corpse was passing by, the Holy Prophet of Islam (Sm) stood up to show respect. He also urged his disciples to do the same. //////Bangladesh is a plain land of alluvial soil. We have canals and water reservoirs ( on the sides of roads and railway) owned by the govt. These water bodies/reservoirs can be developed to a high potential water resource for agricultural irrigation in dry season, fisheries etc. It will also contribute to environmental development to a great extent.//////Going through a daily newspaper on 02-07-08, I learned that the education ministry had asked the principals of established colleges at Dhaka to open second shift in their respective colleges, so that they can accommodate the surplus students who will not be able to take admission in those colleges for want of seats, though they have got A+ in the public exam. The chairman of the Dhaka Board has also urged them to introduce second shift. I disagree with them in this regard. At the same time I would like to request the government to turn the colleges at upazila headquarters into Model College. //////Under Tarique Zia's rule (2001-2006), there were illegal promotions/ postings and most undue favours.//////An ad appeared in your daily that Biman needed an MD to be recruited. This is for the first time that open invitation to fill in the post has been made. Traditionally appointment to the post used to be made by the government mostly by selecting a civil or military bureaucrat without any aviation background, airline operation knowledge and experience in business affairs. They ran Biman like a government office and naturally cut sorry figures. A cost accountant and an Infantry officer were the MD for a good number of years. Efficiency and commercial considerations were sacrificed at the altar of favouritism.//////Finally, the City Corporation is pleased to remove the historical environment polluting garbage container stationed at the entry point of College Gate on Mirpur road about which this correspondent and all the SAU reporters of different newspapers wrote a lot!//////BOESL Managing Director in an interview with a TV channel last week said that only 1 to 2 percent or ten to twelve thousand Bangladeshi workers are suffering abroad.

Nipa says that nature and her environment in Japan influenced her recent work, much of which she did in Japan, during her stay there.

It is the corruption of our political and social elites, the high and the mighty in the different strata of our society, which has made our country one of the poorest of the poor in the world. If we cannot combat this level of corruption effectively, no grandiose plan for poverty alleviation, no infusion of massive external aid and no elected government will be able to lift us from this abyss of poverty and make us the proud nation that we all want our Bangladesh to become.//////TERRORISTS have struck again in India. But this time it is in Gujarat, a state that had seen one of the worst communal carnages only a few years before. The Indian government has taken timely measures to prevent any communal reprisal because, as in many similar cases before, the suspected perpetrators are some Muslim fringe groups. And every time such accusations take place, Muslims in general take cover since they could become the targets of mob fury. //////MANMOHAN Singh's four-year term in office has been resurrected in the last few months of its existence. When his government this week defeated a no-confidence motion in parliament instigated by his former coalition partners, the communists, Indian television stations used a popular Bollywood song, "Singh Is King," as a backdrop. //////I have a friend who has a bracelet on his wrist. It says WWJD and reminds him that he should never make a decision without asking himself: "What Would Jesus Do?"//////Idris Ali never returns home from work without a pack of sweets. If it is amirti today, it would be ////// or ////// the next day. //////There is much debate about the oldest sweet shop in Dhaka. //////When the few hundreds of thousands of subscribers to the city's electricity supply authority received their electricity bill for the month of June, they may have noticed some major differences on the invoice.//////The road at 47/3/D Saatnagar, Jigatola, //////, is flooded with dirty water as its sewerage line is blocked with garbage. Besides, tannery effluents from nearby Hazaribagh mix with the water to make it stinky. Most pedestrians have to hire a rickshaw or a rickshaw-van to avoid dirt. In spite of informing the authorities several times no measures have been taken to fix the situation till now. The picture at right shows a road lies just 100 metres away from ward commissioner's office at Ward 27 near the busy Madartek Bazar. The road is riddled with stray pieces or uneven bricks for months. But the authorities turn a blind eye to the sufferings of the people.//////
