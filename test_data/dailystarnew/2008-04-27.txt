It happened because one of the workers had been run over by a speeding bus moments earlier. In the course of the uproar, no fewer than fifteen vehicles were damaged by the workers and the situation could only be brought under control after police, RAB and soldiers turned up on the scene. The menacing reality is that such incidents have regularly been taking place in the country. Buses and trucks have hit and left students, workers and others dead and have quickly made their exit from the spot. The consequences, for others using the same road, have been horrendous. Their vehicles have either come under frenzied attack or they have been left stranded on the road for hours because it has been occupied by the angry protesters.//////We congratulate the three Mro young men who have become the first in the community to enter Chittagong University (CU) to pursue higher studies.

I am intentionally avoiding the word 'Tigers' as the actual tigers may be ashamed or feel belittled when. Enough is enough. The entire team should be reshuffled and if necessary Bangladesh should opt out of ICC membership. It appeared to me that our batters have not learned even the alphabets of batting. So, what is the use of spending so much for them? //////The report on the subject published in your 21st.April issue is an extremely pertinent and important matter. However as usual there is the predictable bureaucratic twist in it! Why and what have officials to go and see about contract farming there? What are our embassy officials doing there? Sucking their thumbs? It is a topmost priority for Bangladesh! Officials should not meddle in matters that need a private sector approach; if officials have any wisdom!//////At the time of earthquake a huge amount of energy is released through shaking of the ground and things over it. We Bangladeshis are familiar with it, but we don't see the dangers associated with it.//////According to the business scholars, supermarkets and department stores are like a little oasis to the urban people because they provide the city dwellers a standard, noise free, hassle free shopping, but in Bangladesh, supermarkets and department stores not only fail to provide the standard shopping environment, but also cheat the customers.//////I read with deep interest in DS today (20th April) about leasing at least 50,000 acres of land from Myanmar in its Rakhine state for cultivation on contract. This is an excellent idea and the Bangladesh government should do its utmost to materialise the plan. Both Bangladesh and Myanmar would be highly benefited economically by such activities. //////I feel politicians of Bangladesh should not go abroad for treatment, since as public figures they are supposed to get service of the public health system. If this happens the health system may improve. They should remember how the people are suffering and how they are getting the treatment. In 2004, my brother was admitted in NICVD hospital, in one night I saw nearly 5 people dying, my brother survived the first night but passed away next day morning. He was a great freedom fighter and he never wanted any advantage from the government for being a freedom fighter. I felt sorry for myself and for my brother's family that includes three small children along with all the Bangladeshis, the victims of the bankrupt health system of Bangladesh. I cursed the politicians who are responsible for such condition of our healthcare system. Do we need these politicians who are not useful, who are nothing but looters? //////There is a group that is called Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh Supporters Forum. The administrator of the group claims that "Jamaat is doing the most difficult and most appropriate task of building a prosperous Bangladesh." This group also welcomes individuals to join the group in support of this political party. The Jamaat is a fundamentalist group which participated in war crimes against Bangladeshis in 1971. These individuals and parties have never acknowledged the atrocities and systematic murder they helped orchestrate.//////It was very disheartening to read about the plight of the workers of the re-rolling mills on your first page news  A Dangerous Livelihood. (DS April 21). The ones to be blamed are certainly the factory owners and successive governments. The factory owners, in not providing adequate safety measures, are violating the basic human rights of the workers. This unethical and immoral attitude on the part of the factory owners is reprehensible. Punitive measures must be taken against these ruthless owners immediately. And successive governments also share the blame. There are only 4 inspectors for 6,000 registered boilers! In addition, there are just 13 inspectors for more than 14,000 factories countrywide! The government immediately needs to expand the manpower of the department concerned. The government must also think about making it mandatory for the factories to have a standby doctor. And each factory must have adequate safety clothes and tools. Appropriate rules should be there to punish those owners who are violating the rules.//////This is in response to the letter of Ahmed Ferdous Bin Alam published in The Daily Star on 21 April. The writer got hugely disappointed with the Hindi song performance of the popular singer of our country James on Pahela Baishakh. He even went as far as saying that a singer like James should not have rendered a Hindi song on Pahela Baishakh in order to show his true patriotism!//////Even though the ex- prime ministers of Bangladesh are still behind bars, they should take some solace that they still receive exclusive facilities. A few are listed below://////Traffic jam is one of the most irritating problems in Bangladesh. Everyone feels it but none seems to think about the situation or a possible solution. Communication is an important aspect of our day to day life. And as such the negative effect of traffic jam can better be felt than described.//////We, the majority people in Bangladesh, live in rural areas and cannot construct RCC & brick based strong, comfortable and decent houses. We opt for building our houses with wood, bamboo and corrugated iron (CI) sheets, as those materials for constructing houses are less costly and more or less durable. But recently we have been observing with concern that prices of all these materials of house building have gone sky high. For example, a mature full-length bamboo that is suitable for house building costs Tk 180.00 per piece, which cost Tk 100.00 a few years back. In the retail market one cannot think of purchasing one cft garjan wood for less than Tk 1, 500.00, which was Tk 1,000.00 last year. The prices of CI sheets have gone too high. The retail price of a bundle of CI sheet of standard thickness to make roof is Tk.7, 500.00, whereas it was around Tk.2,800.00 three years back. We know that when an industrial product is produced in a country, people can enjoy the advantage of reduced prices. Two decades back CI sheets were imported from foreign counties, e.g. Australia, Japan etc. In the last and present decade a few large industrial factories have been set up in Dhaka and Chittagong to produce iron sheets and galvanizing those sheets, that is, CI sheets are produced in Bangladesh now. The country is self-sufficient in CI sheets. We do not have to import CI sheets from abroad anymore. So it is not understood why people are not benefited by it. //////I refer to your editorial on the above subject published on the first of April. I'm afraid I cannot agree with your conclusion that the solution lies in better law enforcement. Many years ago in a management school, I learnt that the solution to a problem is not necessarily one that is the best, or the ideal, but the solution that can be implemented. I believe that strict law enforcement such as speed control etc. will not solve the problem. It is just impossible to enforce. What is the speed limit on our national highways? Nobody knows, let alone enforce it. How does one enforce it, without radar speed detectors or similar equipment? And does the speed limit have any value when the roads are potted and rickshaws and pedestrians walk on the same road. I suggest instead that the only solution lies in the owners of such vehicles imposing proper driving habits on their drivers. This can only be done if the owners could be penalized for loss of life or injury caused by their vehicles, whatever the cause may be. //////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas warned yesterday of an "extremely difficult impasse" if a peace deal is not reached with Israel before US President George W.
