It was clear that they were coming down in droves from the high street on Farmgate or its vicinity. Just how they emerged in such force and with such seeming determination was a mystery.//////Hit with brick chips in the head, face and eyes and knocked down to the ground, he made a last-ditch effort to strike back.

What is shocking is the ferocity with which kidnappers shot and injured his mother, two sisters and the vehicle driver for resisting the incident. The boy was whisked away on motorcycles and hasn't been heard of since. It is not surprising to find that twenty or so bystanders did not intervene. What can a crowd of unarmed people do against criminals, particularly when the police were not at hand.//////Can anyone recall the first ball of a Test match disappearing for six? Even in these T20 times, it was a rare occurence when West Indies hitman Chris Gayle clobbered the offering from Bangladesh debutant off-spinner Shohag Gazi, who delivered the first over of the match, over long on for a maximum.

So we see so many resignations in the democratic countries of the world all the time. Recently the chiefs of two venerable institutions as the BBC and CIA 'walked' voluntarily. Like in cricket, just one mistake by a batsman is sufficient for the umpire to raise his finger.//////I commend the human rights society that urged that those guilty of the attack on the Bauls some months ago, at a major gathering, should be brought to justice.

The BTRC must supervise their policies for the greater convenience of the customers.//////This refers to the letter dated November 9th 2012 of Aminur Rahim of New DOHS, Mohakhali, Dhaka.

In fact all my friends there get to check everything on YouTube and post stuff from there on Facebook. //////Gone are the days when former President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched bold government programs to cover a country 27 times the size of Germany with a network of interstate highways. Gone are the years when former President Lyndon B.

Many Americans remain convinced that the divine benevolence Barack Hussein Obama enjoys is from a God called Allah, rather than the bearded old man of Christian iconography. Barack is not an English word, let alone an American one; it derives from the Arabic baraka, meaning blessing. Others, and Donald Trump comes to mind, accept that Obama was born, but wish he hadn't been, and certainly not in Hawai.//////The 4th Global Social Business Summit was held from November 8 to10 in Vienna.

Glucose is vital to human health because it is the main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and tissues. This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of urination, increased thirst and increased hunger. If anyone has diabetes, no matter what type, it means he has too much glucose in his blood -- although the reasons may differ -- which can lead to serious health problems. //////As the 18th Conference of Parties (COP18) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) approaches (it is to be held in Doha, Qatar from November 26 until December 7), preparations are being made to discuss a number of items on the agenda.//////The BBC begins radio service in the United Kingdom.//////
