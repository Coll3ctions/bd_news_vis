In what was clearly a carnival spirit, both in the American media and among American citizens, the question of which politicians will end up being the candidates for the White House at the November election was wrestled with. The Republicans have all but formally made it clear that John McCain, a respected senator and former POW in Vietnam, will be their standard bearer. He has clearly left all his rivals, including the high spending Mitt Romney, well behind.//////So what happens now? With the High Court having quashed the Tk.2.99 crore extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina as being outside the purview of emergency laws, it is now time for the powers that be to ponder the legality and constitutionality of many of the measures they have undertaken so far in respect to the prosecution of corruption charges against a whole class of individuals. //////Sri Lanka -- the embattled south Asian country -- has just celebrated its 60th anniversary of independence.

How to tackle the problem in a meaningful way is gradually becoming the focal point of attention in such discussions, though disagreements on what needs to be done abound. //////A late rally steered Arambagh Krira Sangha to end Badda Jagarani's impressive run in the Protiti Pharma Victory Day Club Cup football tournament and enter the final with a 2-0 win in the first semifinal yesterday.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club will look forward to rebuild a tarnished image following an 'unsporting' game against Arambagh in the group stage and the punishment they had received for it when they face archrivals Abahani in the second semifinal of the Protiti Pharma Victory Day Club Cup today.//////The executive committee of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Wednesday failed to make any headway over some serious issues.//////Fabio Capello oversaw a winning start to his tenure as England manager on Wednesday with a 2-1 victory over Switzerland while his Italian compatriots scored an impressive friendly success over Portugal which augurs well for the Azzurri's chances at Euro 2008. //////The last time Australia and Sri Lanka met in a one-day international the game's conclusion was ruined when the umpires forced play to continue as darkness fell on the World Cup final in Barbados.

And it has been a serious concern for the poor countries like ours. The most industrially developed nations are mainly responsible for global pollution. The Kyoto Protocol, an agreement on the environment and sustainable development, has not yet been ratified by the United States, the largest polluter of environment. //////In the BBC phone-in programme a few days ago, one gentleman raised a very pertinent question regarding the technical quality and distribution system of the ID card. If his observation is valid and extensive, one should be concerned about the future of this project which has received appreciation at home and abroad. I was very cynical about the success of this project right from the day one, because I apprehended the problems narrated by a gentleman in the phone-in programme. //////Recently, the Chinese government decided to ban the plastic shopping bags in their shopping malls because of extreme environmental problems. //////Every time I think of Iraq, I feel sorry for the country, which is called the cradle of civilisation. This land has been ruined utterly and violence is erupting every day. From my childhood days, I was fascinated by Iraq.

Many of us are apprehensive and even scared of the return to same old politics and misrule by the corrupt politicians. The last one year of emergency rule by the CTG brought relief and hope amongst most of us. The CTG performed admirably and coped well with natural disasters. //////Thank you for the write-up under the above title published in DS. //////I am 75 and still work 8-10 hours every day. I commute by rickshaw from my rented flat in Niketon to office in Banani via Mohakhali Road. I do not have a car or even a mobile. For the last few months rickshaws have been banned from Mohakhali Road, so twice every day I am summarily ejected from my rickshaw by the dozens of cops on duty (have they nothing better to do?) and forced to walk the 1 km portion of Mohakhali Road like thousands of men, women, children, old, infirm, disabled, sick, students, small traders etc. etc. I manage somehow during the day but returning home after dark poses a problem. I have also undergone bye-pass operation. At that rush hour it is impossible to get a CNG or taxi. Even if I can, they refuse the short distance fare and laugh in the face of the policemen who interceded on my behalf once or twice.//////A well-publicised conference of non-resident Bangladeshis (fancifully called NRBs) was held in Dhaka last month with the expressed view of projecting the potentials of the NRBs in 'alleviating' the miseries of the lesser mortals who live in this country. In fact, almost every year, such conferences are organised in Dhaka for NRBs in different formats. These routine meetings (or get-togethers) give the NRBs an opportunity to make holiday trips to this country in winter using tickets from conference organisers in the name of visiting Bangladesh for participating in an international (?) conference. Such visits also help them to enrich their curriculum vitae as well as meet their relatives/friends, and buy or sell properties here. Lesser mortals or 'resident Bangladeshis' do not need to object to all these until we hear the NRBs lecturing us in condescending tones on how we should live our lives. It is surely welcome if the NRBs come here with capital to invest in employment generating enterprises (like the United Airways), but, certainly, we do not need any advice on floods or mass transit or urban congestion etc. NRBs please note that in Bangladesh we have a large supply of resource persons who have more experience in development works than most of you. One NRB, participating in the recent conference, even had the temerity to demand that the expatriate Bangladeshis holding foreign passports be allowed to head some of the development organisations and corporations of Bangladesh as if the executives and academics of Bangladesh are all nincompoops! It is unfortunate that the media did not see through the charade of the so-called NRB 'guest birds', who I presume have by now returned to their cozy homes gloating over a make-believe contentment that he/she has their bit for their motherland, which they had voluntarily left!//////On January 12th, the KMT of Taiwan i.e. the nationalists, won the parliamentary elections as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party managed to win just 27 seats while the KMT grabbed 81 seats ( there were in total 113 seats). Their victory means that relations between Taiwan and China are likely to improve, given the fact that the DPP was more pro-independence and more willing to unease relations with the mainland, while the KMT looks forward to warming relations with China particularly in terms of maintaining strong economic ties.//////Real faces of the so-called politicians have been exposed, especially after the current CTG took over. //////Clear directives are needed from the NBR as to whether one person with different individuals, such as husband & wife, father & son, father & daughter, mother & son, mother & daughter, so on and so forth, can purchase three-monthly profit giving Savings Certificates in Joint Names. //////A good system of communication was introduced for the commuters of the capital city. That was the introduction of AC bus services from Uttara to Motijheel. Various types of buses were seen plying between different ends of the city and even to suburbs under the name of Premium, Nirapod etc. Commuters of all classes used to go to different places comfortably and safely. For sometime I used to stay at Uttara and visit different places in those buses. I saw lots of students studying in different institutions including Medical College & Engineering University travel in those buses . That system was serving so nicely that we used to feel like enjoying modern city life. Middle class people, particularly female travellers having no personal transport, were benefited so much because they could travel at any time in those buses freely and safely. It got popularity among the middle class people, a major part of taxpayers. We expected that the system would be expanded and more such buses would be added to serve more areas, but to our utter surprise we found two major transport companies soon going out of the business. //////I would like to mention a point in connection with your above captioned news item which often remains unmentioned.//////With deep regret, we would like to draw your kind attention to an article entitled Suharto, September 1965 and East Timor by Syed Badrul Ahsan, Editor, Current Affairs, published in your newspaper on 30 January 2008.

As the Boimela is held at the Bangla Academy premises, which is right next to the DU campus, the fair occupies a major share of the students' leisure. //////A local saying goes, Have no fear of the sea, it will bring you fruits. And this is how the people lived their modest lives in Shitolpur, an area on the coast of Chittagong in southern Bangladesh.//////With a view to provide a platform for the artists of the greater Mymensingh region, a 15-day Fine Arts and Handicrafts fair has begun at Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Shangrahoshala (Art gallery) located at the Shaheb Quarter Park in the district town.

The proposal for a national government has met with mixed reactions from various political parties, and there seems to be considerable confusion with regard to the concept and the process of formation of a national government. There are also doubts about its effectiveness and stability, especially when the political system remains adversarial or parochial.//////The annual meeting of the World's Economic Forum in Davos ended with some hopes, aspirations, promises and warnings. This year's event drew nearly 30 heads of states or governments, more than 110 cabinet ministers, and several hundred corporate titans. //////Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed (1932-2003) is best remembered by his admirers and jurists in Bangladesh and the rest of South Asia not only as a specialist in constitutional law but also as an eminent non-political activist who took special interest in trying to find a pragmatic solution to the existing problem of dysfunctional politics within our country. Concerned about the prevailing "closed shop trade union" syndrome that afflicts most political parties in Bangladesh, Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed (a former attorney-general of Bangladesh and an adviser to two successive caretaker governments) and a few others had the courage to try and find an effective method out of the madness. //////The ocean plays an important role in the climate system by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is generally accepted that more than 80 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will eventually be absorbed naturally by the oceans, primarily through a slow exchange between the atmosphere and the surface waters. This exchange process behaves like a clog in a sink's drain: drainage occurs too slowly to prevent a large build-up; in this case of CO2 in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide entering the deep waters of the ocean is removed from interaction with the atmosphere for periods of hundreds of years. A significant fraction of the excess carbon dioxide released by man's activities enters the deep waters of the ocean and plays no further part in global warming over century timescales.//////Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Albert Arnold (Al) Gore Jr. have been jointly declared for the Nobel Peace Prize-2007 for their research and effort to spread out the knowledge about man-made climate change and also the measures that are needed to counteract such change. Greenhouse gases that mainly absorb and emit heat to the atmosphere have the effect on global temperature and make habitable environment for earth. Continuous deforestation and extensive fossil fuel exploitation and natural sources contribute carbon dioxide (CO2) in atmosphere dramatically in higher rate since industrialisation and rising relentlessly. //////It is very clear that colonialisation bears some specific objectives that may be getting cheap raw materials, cheap labour and a captive market for product manufacturing. Here I have used the term eco-colonialism that means the colonialisation which is a growth to the exploitation of ecology. But how colonialisation damage the ecology?//////
