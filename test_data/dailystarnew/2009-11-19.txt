The nation waits to hear the ultimate verdict today in the Bangabandhu murder case trial with bated breath and also in the expectation that finally justice will prevail. It has been a long, painful journey for the people of Bangladesh. It ought not to have been this way, for the particular reason that the liberation of Bangladesh from Pakistani occupation in December 1971 was considered symbolic of a clean break with the past. That Bangalees would see democracy grow in their country, that under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman they would go forth to create Shonar Bangla, a cause the Father of the Nation had consistently espoused since he emerged with his Six-Point programme of regional autonomy in the mid-1960s, was not a misplaced expectation. Indeed, it was a dream that seemed eminently attainable with Bangabandhu as the undisputed leader of this country.//////Bangladesh will lose 8 percent of its rice and 32 percent of wheat production by 2050 if the sea level rises by one metre engulfing 20 percent of its land and displacing 20 million people.//////Revenue earning from the construction sector increased sharply in the first three months of this fiscal year (FY) as whitening black money was allowed.//////The billion-dollar projects of elevated expressway and metro rail for the capital city without detailed feasibility study is likely to bring about financial and technical debacles, said country's leading transport experts. //////Lacking adequate number of vehicles, police stations of Dhaka Metropolitan Police mostly use requisitioned vehicles that torment vehicle owners as the authorities do not pay any compensation.//////Top leaders of different factions of Chittagong BNP yesterday pledged to accept party chairperson's decision regarding the city unit committee unconditionally.//////Elected representatives from different upazila parishads at a roundtable yesterday demanded that the lawmakers and bureaucrats refrain from interfering in the parishad affairs.//////Shakib Al Hasan, world's number one all-rounder in ODIs, has just had another feather added to his already glittering career by becoming the first Bangladeshi cricketer to sign for an English county side. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stated unequivocally that she wants a fair judgment in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case to be delivered today by the Supreme Court.//////The government has deployed several hundred law enforcers on and around the Supreme Court premises to effect foolproof security for the historic judgment proceedings at the Appellate Division today.//////Eid-ul-Azha, one of the largest religious festivals of Muslims, will be observed on November 28 as the moon of the Zilhaj month was sighted yesterday.//////The government will launch a food for education programme this year targeting two million children in the most food-insecure areas to prevent school dropouts there, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said.//////The parliamentary standing committee on the commerce ministry yesterday asked the ministry to ensure country's highest interest before it seals the much-debated Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (Tifa) deal with the USA. //////Criminals gunned down a ward-level Jubo League leader and injured his companion in broad daylight yesterday in the capital's Maddha Badda area.//////Mohammad Rafiq was pleading to the traffic sergeant not to requisition his microbus just two days after it was requisitioned.//////A female Bangladeshi Hajj pilgrim was killed while 11 others were injured as a bus fell into a roadside ditch at Arafat in Saudi Arabia. //////General Secretary of outlawed Gono Bahini, Azibor Rahman alias Azibor Chairman was killed by his rivals in India Tuesday night, his family and local sources claimed.//////A UN commission investigating the assassination of Pakistan's ex-prime minister Benazir Bhutto has questioned former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, the United Nations said yesterday.//////A new report has revealed that Pakistan enjoys a substantial lead over India when it comes to nuclear weapons.//////TODAY the nation has come face to face with a stark truth. The very fact that we had to wait for the last 34 years to complete the trial of the murder of the founding father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman including most of his family members and bring the killers to justice has brought us face to face with the moment of truth. Why had we to wait so long, for after his killing governments came in succession, one of those -- the BNP government of 1991-- being directly elected by the people. Strangely enough, before the Awami League government of 1996 was voted into office, none of the earlier governments felt the legal and moral obligation that the tragedy of August 15, 1975 at least deserved a hearing in the court of law! What had happened to our proud legacy of protest and struggle against all kinds of injustice?//////THE country's position has improved slightly as per the corruption perception index of TI. It has gone three notches down and is now rated 13th out of 180 countries, with a score of 2.4 which was just good enough for not finishing among the ten most corrupt countries in the world.
