We had reservations too about the "National Committee on Withdrawal of Politically Motivated Cases." We are convinced that it was a patently wrong idea primarily because the merit of a case can only be determined by a judge in the court of law and not by a committee set up for this purpose. And our apprehensions have been borne out by the manner in which the matter has been dealt with. Many cases have been withdrawn so far, on the recommendations of the district committees that display a high degree of political partisanship. //////The distribution of free textbooks for primary and secondary level students is happily underway. It is certainly commendable that in this particular sector, among some other sectors, the government has been demonstrating a degree of efficiency that could well be replicated in other areas. The textbook distribution programme is of particular significance because of fears lately expressed about some printers being unable to supply the books to schools in time for distribution. We are not suggesting that everything has turned out well with the inauguration of the distribution on Saturday. But we have reasons to think, now that Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid has reassured us on this score, that students in the primary and secondary schools will have all their books in hand in the course of the next one week. The seriousness the minister and his department have consistently attached to the textbook issue convinces us that matters are under control. That is a far cry from the crises which earlier overwhelmed students and schools owing to uncertainty about the textbooks being available on schedule.//////World Cup ticket sales got off to a violent, chaotic and frustratingly slow start yesterday after most of the ticket outlets saw endlessly long lines due to the slow process.//////A first-half strike from Ntim Twum Frank gave holders Abahani their first win in the Bangladesh League when they handed a lone-goal defeat to their Chittagong namesakes in their second match at Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////A friendly cricket match, among farmers of the remote Char Puliamari, took place at a paddy field after the harvest in the region was complete.//////Bangladesh Air Force finished their Dhaka Bank Victory Hockey Tournament on a winning note after thrashing Barnak Samaj 7-0 in their last group match at Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////Wayne Rooney scored his first goal in open play since March as leaders Manchester United won away in the Premier League for only the second time this season with a 2-1 victory against West Brom.//////Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp says that David Beckham wants to move to White Hart Lane, as he prepares to step up his bid for the former Manchester United star.//////Pepe Reina has hit out at the speculation he could leave Liverpool and insists he will honour his contract.//////Chelsea's bid to retain the Premier League title suffered another blow as struggling Aston Villa snatched a dramatic 3-3 draw at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.//////Ronaldinho is set to close the door on his AC Milan career after leaving their winter training camp in Dubai, coach Massimiliano Allegri confirmed on Saturday.//////Birmingham midfielder Lee Bowyer is facing the prospect of a possible Football Association ban over incidents during Saturday's home Premier League clash with Arsenal.//////Bundesliga club Hoffenheim, having parted company with coach Ralf Rangnick, have appointed his deputy Marco Pezzaiuoli, who takes over with immediate effect the club said Sunday.//////Sir Alex Ferguson is keen to see Federico Macheda remain in the Premier League when he goes on loan for the second half of the season.//////The fate of the Ashes was decided last week in Melbourne but with the series and a huge amount of pride still on the line, neither Australia or England are calling this week's fifth Test in Sydney a dead rubber.//////A solid half-century by Jacques Kallis held South Africa together on the first day of the third and final Test against India at Newlands yesterday.
