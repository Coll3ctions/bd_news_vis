The long awaited ninth parliament begins its journey this afternoon with the responsibility to deliver on people's high expectations that it will put the country on the right track towards prosperity.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday appointed six new faces as state ministers expanding her council of ministers formed 18 days ago. //////Even if her enemies had tried they couldn't have done a better job of embarrassing Sheikh Hasina and her barely two-week-old government. First the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), student wing of Awami League (AL), and now the party's grassroots leaders, including a cabinet minister and an MP, have done precisely the things that she has promised, and is trying to, totally move away from. Their actions have brought blemish upon her and her party's brilliant electoral victory and raised unnecessary doubts in the public mind as to how serious is the AL chief's commitment to bring change in politics and in governance. //////Driven by abject poverty, Rohingyas living in Cox's Bazar camps and adjacent areas undertake perilous sea journeys in search of better lives in Malaysia via Thailand.//////The Dhaka University (DU) yesterday witnessed an ignoble rat race among teachers to get to the newly appointed university officials to pay their admiration and adulation depriving students of their precious classes.//////Thailand offered yesterday to host a regional conference to prevent the mass migration - and resulting suffering - of refugees after the Thai navy was accused of brutally mistreating boat people from Bangladesh.//////Finance minister AMA Muhith has written letter to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and National Board of Revenue (NBR) regarding publication of wealth statements of the prime minister, ministers, members of parliament and other 'powerful persons' within next month.//////The Right to Information Ordinance proclaimed by the immediate past caretaker government appears unlikely to be ratified by parliament anytime soon.//////BNP Chairperson and Leader of the Opposition Khaleda Zia at a meeting with party lawmakers yesterday discussed their strategy at the inaugural session of the ninth parliament today. //////The treasury bench is annoyed as Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar overruled the chief whip's seating arrangement and made a new arrangement for the opposition ahead of today's parliament session.//////Madina Begum still cannot accept the fact that her husband Abdul Malek, a day-labourer, will ever return.//////At least 46 people, including 21 jail guards and 20 madrasa students were injured yesterday in a clash between the two sides over control of a playground in the capital's Lalbagh area.//////Two senior most judges of High Court Division of the Supreme Court (SC) -- Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Md Abdul Aziz-- will be appointed judges of Appellate Division of the SC, law ministry sources said yesterday.//////Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday said the bank accounts frozen by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) would not be restored in a week.//////Alexandrine Parakeet, locally known as Chandana, is now on the verge of extinction in Bangladesh because of loss of habitat, poaching and pesticide use. A flock of eight pairs of the parakeet was recently found at Beelbharat village of Bhayadanga union in Sreebordi of Sherpur by Dr Reza Khan. Explaining the reasons for their near extinction from Bangladesh, Prof Anwarul Islam of zoology department of Dhaka University said these birds compete with other hole nesters like barbet and woodpecker. So they are vulnerable to the loss of nesting sites and competition with other nest dwellers. Trade in parrot also led to the swift decline in their numbers. But at Beelbharat village, these eight pairs have found a safe haven although one of them had been captured as a chick and caged by a resident. These emerald green birds are larger than the common parakeet found elsewhere and have reddish streak on wings, but from a distance they are hard to recognise.//////Over 200 pirates of six to seven gangs rob 15-20 vessels a day in the Buriganga between Fatullah in Narayanganj and Postagola, a number of detained pirates said yesterday. //////Villagers beat a leopard to death yesterday after it attacked seven people at Bagdanga village in Kurigram. //////At least 30 people, including a police officer, were injured in a clash between garment workers and police in front of Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute on Dhaka-Gazipur highway yesterday following injury of a worker in an accident.//////Two people were killed and 58 others injured, including nine women, and five houses were ransacked in post-upazila poll violence in seven districts Friday night and yesterday.//////As part of its efforts to resolve the country's chronic power crisis, the new government is set to implement 10 power plant projects initiated by previous governments. //////Dense fog disrupted road and river communications across the country and caused the suspension of flight operations at Zia International Airport (ZIA) for hours yesterday.//////Brazilian coach Edson 'Dido' Silva arrived yesterday to take charge of the national football team and he was impressed after watching his first match in Dhaka.//////Students of Jagannath University yesterday confined its Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Abu Hossain Siddique in front of his office for half an hour demanding steps to free university dormitories from illegal occupants. //////At least four drunken people died while two others fell sick yesterday in the city's Ramna area after they took rectified spirit Friday night.//////International environmental groups have praised evidence of swift change by US President Barack Obama in his inaugural week, saying it could transform Washington from a green "pariah" into a world leader.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has telephoned the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian territories as well as the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan, spokesman Robert Wood said late Friday.//////The National Heart Foundation Hospital & Research Institute refuted a part of the report headlined 'Illegal Blood Bank-busted in City' published in The Daily Star on January 15.//////AGRICULTURE Minister Matia Chowdhury has informed the nation about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's annoyance at the behaviour of a minister and a ruling Awami League lawmaker at the recent upazila elections. That is as it should be, for no individual holding a responsible position should be allowed to do anything that is unethical and unbecoming of his or her position. What Fisheries and Livestock Minister Abdul Latif Biswas did is unpardonable and so is the behaviour of the young MP from Cox's Bazar-4. In this regard, the assertion of the prime minister that the Election Commission is free to take action against these two individuals is welcome and we hope an example is set that will act as a deterrence against similar activities by anyone in future.//////WE are bit confused! We can't easily tell which one is the cake and which the icing on it. Is Shakib-al Hasan's coming first among the top ten all-rounders in world cricket is the cake, or Bangladesh national side's near- consistent performance against world cricketing power Sri Lanka followed by a convincing ODI series win against Zimbabwe is. Depending upon which is perceived to be truer, the one that is outvoted would obviously be the icing of the cake.//////ONE wonders where the concept of the responsibility to protect has taken refuge when Israel's devastating three week long offensive in Gaza left about thirteen hundred Palestinians dead and wrought destruction that may cost up to two billion dollars to rebuild. //////PERIODICALLY, the topic of low-quality education imparted by some private universities becomes a matter of debate. However, there is a much bigger problem of low-quality education in Bangladesh; namely, the thousands of Qawmi madrasahs across the country. //////BANGLADESH'S elections were a great achievement: free, fair and even festive, with a massive voter turnout. But, as I return to this remarkable country after four years, what sticks in my mind are the vivid images, flashed across our screens, of women queuing patiently to vote on that chilly December day. Of the 82 million Bangladeshis that were registered as voters, 41 million were women: hugely impressive for any country. //////Abahani shrugged off a shaky start to nip archrivals Moha-mmedan 2-1 yesterday in a come-from-behind win that put them on track to retain the B.

The drama is still playing itself out at many war theaters around the world from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Congo to Sudan, from Abkhazia to Chechnya, from East Timor to Tibet and from Assam to Kashmir

It is, as some tend to say, the most important day on this earth in this twenty first century with all its difficult twists and turns, as people across the globe have found a fitting leader with vision and clarity of thoughts and action in the 44th president of the USA. //////Smoke rose above the Gaza strip as the Zionist entity Israel continued its assault on the Palestinians in the region. Schools, mosques and civilian buildings were being subjected to indiscriminate bombing from Israeli fighter jets. There are reports that Israel had even used unconventional weapons against civilians in Gaza. The world was witnessing another severe blow against the principles and values of humanity. Yet the international community could do nothing to stop Israel from killing innocent civilians. The UN Security Council, the job of which was supposed to ensure global peace and security, miserably failed to condemn Israel's disproportionate use of force in Gaza.//////It is estimated that there are 370 million indigenous peoples in more than 70 countries around the world. They represent over 500 languages and cultures. As per available information here in Bangladesh more than 45 indigenous communities can be found. They have been living here from time immemorial. The United State's Permanent Forum on Indigenous issue, an advisory body established by the Economic and Social council in 2000, has been working with the mandate to address indigenous issues related to economic and social development, education, health and human rights. The UN declared an  Indigenous Decade (1995-2005) and called upon all the countries to join hands in preserving and developing the unique cultures, religion and languages of indigenous peoples. Many countries came forward but the then government of this country did not support the declaration. Rather the government said,  There are no Indigenous Peoples in Bangladesh. Such an irrational statement shocked the indigenous peoples in the country. //////Nury Vittachi's struggle to break down the barrier of cultural stagnation and indefatigable effort to bring a way of expressing feelings through a humorous but standard way should be appreciated. Visiting the website www.vittachi.com I came to know about Asia's one of the most widely published writers. His dialogue based columns added a new frame in writing columns. His way of pointing fingers towards problems of our society is really unique. In a column named "We are all robots", he wrote that people can be incredibly stupid. There were some reasons behind pointing finger towards journalists. I think it would be bit better to say, "People (excluding me) can be incredibly stupid. because I have discerned the problem." //////Three extortion charges were filed against Sheikh Hasina in June 2007, which led to her arrest on July 16 that year. Those were the grounds for arresting her and detaining her for nearly a year and on parole to date. //////Barack Obama has stepped into the history of America as the first black African-American leader swearing in as the 44th US President. We whole-heartedly congratulate Obama as the new American President and leader of the world and would like to remind him of the pledge 'Change We Need' he made with the people and urge him to follow the true democratic principles in governance and in maintaining foreign policies. Reasonably, we hope his pragmatic and efficient leadership will bring about qualitative changes.//////Obama remained silent during the Gaza crisis. Barack Obama's chances of making a fresh start in US relations with the Muslim world, and the Middle East in particular, appeared to diminish with each new wave of Israeli attacks on Palestinian targets in Gaza. //////First of all, I would like to felicitate our honourable PM, Sheikh Hasina on her taking the leadership of the country. Your election manifesto was so forward-looking, innovative and visionary that most of the first-time voters were galvanized to support you and your party. Actually, the people of Bangladesh were passing through a very crucial time for the last seven years. We wanted a change. The people of Bangladesh voted for you with a great hope to shape up their destiny. But will they be able to do that? I strongly hope that you will play your due role in this regard. We want that you do nothing but fulfil your poll pledges. If you fulfil your commitments, we will not have any complaint against you and your government or party. I earnestly implore you to pay attention to the following demands://////It will be in vain for the Arab leaders to approach America on the issue of Palestine, as Israel is a disobedient son of the USA.//////The BCL clashes with their rivals in the educational institutions are really unfortunate and unacceptable. The present government has been sworn in power to bring about positive changes. We have been passionately and resonantly waiting to witness the change.//////I really wonder when the BCB and its selectors would come to a firm decision on captaincy. This man has all the excuses in the world to explain why Bangladesh is failing in the critical situations. He never told us about his own failure as captain, though. His funny comment is, " If we played better; so and so did better, we would have won the game!! He has failed as captain and is now gradually falling behind his potential as batsman too.//////A recent article in your daily titled "Hectic lobbying for university posts" (DS Jan 21)reflects how politics has deeply entered into the public universities of our country. The report says that some pro-AL teachers of different public universities are now trying to get the posts of VC, pro-VC and other important posts by lobbying with the government high-ups. Unfortunately though, this has been the usual story of public universities where VCs, pro-VCs etc are appointed on the basis of their partisanship rather than on the basis of teaching experience, seniority and quality.//////A few days ago a resident of one of the houses around the new Tk 32 crore Gulshan-Banani Bridge wrote a long letter in the DS, describing how life for the nearby residents has become intolerable because of the shenanigans of the youth disembarking all around the bridge from expensive cars, who carousel loudly far into the night disturbing the peace of the area while indulging in their expensive hobbies- fast cars and faster women, loud music and louder stimulants from bottles and packs.//////Last Friday we all witnessed an epic final which eventually turned into a tragic moment in the short history of Bangladesh cricket. After that I heard many people blaming our captain Ashraful for this defeat. He was barely getting any kind of support from the people who actually call themselves or act like real supporters. But they don't realize how difficult it is to lead a team which is struggling so much for existence in the international arena. I agree that our team has lost a golden opportunity to win their first tri-nation cup. But people should accept it as a positive thing. //////Pollution is the most talked about issue these days. There are many reasons behind pollution of the environment. Smoke that comes out from the brickfields is a major reason behind such pollution. From the chimney which is used to burn raw bricks smoke comes out continuously and pollute the environment severely. But we cannot think of modern civilization without bricks. As there is no alternative to burning bricks we should be a bit careful in doing so for our own survival. Smoke mixes up with air & pollutes our environment if the chimney is not very tall . A tall chimney can minimize the harmful effect of smoke in the environment. When the chimney is high enough smoke that comes out vanishes in the steam & it can not pollute the environment as it does when the chimney is low. Again, in the brickfield there work children aged 10 to 15 years, though it is very risky. It is want of food that compels those children to do hard work while it is time to study & play. The owners of the brickfields are making money, showing no concern for the future of those poor children. //////The US coalition in Afghanistan opened an investigation into an overnight raid early yesterday that American commanders say killed 15 armed militants but that two Afghan officials say killed 11 civilians.//////Some 200,000 Gaza children returned to school yesterday for the first time since Israel's offensive, many having lost family members, their home and their sense of security.//////The heart bypass surgery performed on Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday was successful, a spokesman for the ruling Congress party said yesterday.//////The United Nations expressed growing concern Friday for the safety of tens of thousands of children and other civilians trapped in the war zone in northern Sri Lanka and called on the Tamil Tiger rebels to let them leave.//////Seven more bodies were recovered from the rubble of an Al-Qaeda den hit by a suspected US missile, pushing the death toll in two separate strikes to 22, security officials said yesterday.//////Syrian President Bashar al-Assad congratulated Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal on the Islamist movement's "victory" over Israel in Gaza at a meeting in Damascus yesterday, official media said.//////Sudan has denied committing human rights violations against displaced people in Darfur, where 33 civilians were killed by security forces in August according to a UN probe.//////A senior member of Saudi Arabia's ruling family has warned the US that it needs to change attitudes over the Arab-Israeli conflict. //////Three Iraqi policemen were killed and nine people wounded yesterday when a car bomb exploded near the western city of Fallujah, a senior police officer told AFP.//////A 20-year-old Belgian man has been charged with killing two infants and a 54-year-old female employee at a child daycare centre and has been remanded in custody, a prosecutor said yesterday.//////Japan on Friday launched the first satellite to monitor greenhouse gases worldwide, a tool to help scientists better judge where global warming emissions are coming from, and how much is being absorbed by the oceans and forests.//////Animal rights campaigners yesterday welcomed an Indian Supreme Court ruling preventing the killing of stray dogs in Mumbai, which prompted a high-profile intervention from US actress Pamela Anderson.//////It was an astonishing theatrical experience for the Bangladeshi audience to have a glimpse in the world of the Smi, the indigenous people of Arctic Europe.

The conversation veered to her views on dance, life and other matters. //////Mian Tansen, the famed maestro of Akbar's Court, is a very important milestone in the field of Indian classical music, which in its turn has influenced the very development of music itself in the sub-continent. He was the introducer of the Seni Gharana. The heritage of Mughal Music did not in filtrate Bengal till the advent of the English. But since then Bengal has played a very significant role in this line. Bangladesh today enjoys a very important position in the realm of music, Indian classical music in particular. In this connection, the Khan family of Brahmanbaria have a traditional heritage as the flag-carriers of the Seni Gharana which Tansen had introduced in the 16th century Mughal Court. This family has contributed immensely to the expansion of Indian classical music, not only through the hereditary practice of the 'ragas' and 'raginis' but also through the creation of new musical instruments and production of illustrious musicians who have introduced the wonderful sublimity and finesse of Indian Music to the outside world through the ages. The central figure in the 'Sangeet Sadhana' of the family undoubtedly was 'Sur Samrat' Ustad Alauddin Khan, the younger brother and disciple of Aftabuddin Khan.//////Cultural organisation Dakkhini Rabindra Sangeetangan has arranged a three-day musical soiree featuring Tagore songs.
