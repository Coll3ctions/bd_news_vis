That it needs these elected representatives of the people at the grassroots level to inform the country and the government about the state of inactivity they have been forced into not only raises questions about the future of democracy but also makes a mockery of this entire idea of local bodies supervising development work at the local levels. Let us make no mistake about it: when upazila chairmen, vice-chairmen and members complain that they have no specific responsibilities other than having tea, engaging in small talk and going back home, they are not indulging in humour. They are raising a fundamental issue of how and why the very principle of local government may be getting undermined in the country.//////We felicitate The Independent on the occasion of its re-launch.

poor immune system. Every year, more than 10.5 million children die before they reach the 5th year of their life. Half of these deaths happen due to acute respiratory infection, diarrhoea, measles, malaria, and malnutrition. People of the rural area are not aware of vaccination. As a result, most of the children in the villages suffer from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, measles, etc.//////Dhaka city is reeling under over population, traffic jam, dearth of roads and streets, deteriorating public utility services, failing law and order, emergence of concrete jungle in unplanned manner, unending stream of floating population, etc. The city has virtually become unliveable.//////A staff correspondent's front-page report of 3rd October on the matter was published in a local English daily. The proposal of evicting all hawkers, given for reducing traffic congestion, seemed rather off the mark to me! The hawkers may block the pedestrians' flow on footpaths to an extent, but its impact on the flow of road traffic is somewhat marginal. It may aggravate the jam in one or two roads, particularly around Baitul Mukarram, but it is not a reason for traffic congestion in most city roads. Will the eviction of hawkers, as proposed, not lead to another opportunity of flow of 'Bakshis' for our policemen? They can always arrange an unofficial daily fine, while the hawkers carry on their trade! The hawkers are rather poor and transient traders who cannot afford a regular shop or stall to sell their wares. This step, if adopted, may lead to many lower income people and their families being cut off from their livelihood.//////Those who claim the constitutional mandate to speak for the masses do not have a voice, and those who have the voice do not have the mandate in Bangladesh.

They examine patients at their chambers in the presence of other patients and their relatives. It is objectionable and embarrassing, because patients have to narrate their symptoms and answer many questions for the sake of the diagnosis. Those should be for the doctor's ears only. The physicians should have enough sense to know that patients need privacy and it is their (doctors') sacred duty to provide it. //////More than a year ago, the former Finance Minister M Saifur Rahman died in a car crash while returning to Dhaka from Sylhet. Investigation revealed that Mr. Saifur Rahman succumbed to his death as the car plunged into the water, and that he could not get out of the car despite his desperate attempts, because of the fastened seat belt. It can be concluded that Mr. Saifur Rahman was killed in the car crash because he was restricted by the seat belt.//////How many of you have gone to Dhaka Zoo? If you have, I am pretty much sure that the opinion you have about the place is same as mine. The place is full of a rotten smell all around, with the tigers, monkeys and the other animals in distress. //////I refer to the editorial of The Daily Star of October 3, 2010 titled 'Ayodhya verdict'. It is an optimistic view just hoping against hope. The real public sentiment can be gauged if the ears are pricked to the crowd's comments in the street. It is hard to believe that the extremists who have been capitalising on this issue for decades for political gain will calm down after this verdict.//////This is in reference to Gopal Sengupta, Avik Sengupta and Shimul Chowdhury's posts in your issue of October 2, 2010.

They were eagerly waiting at the airport of a foreign land to greet the Prime Minister and their party chief. Though unwelcome, their eagerness made them go into tussles with people who went their to show their displeasure of AL Government's treatment to Begum Zia and her party activists.//////During September'10 several news items related to death sentence were published in variousnewspapers.

This means the present government has given utmost priority to the energy sector. //////Recently in an interview to The Sunday Times Salman Rushdie who became infamous for some of his stupid and blasphemous writings termed the British Monarchy and its traditions as stupid and archaic.
