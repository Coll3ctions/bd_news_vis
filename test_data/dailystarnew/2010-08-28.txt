However, it seems like our government is finally catching up with the subject with some degree of sincerity. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Forests and Environment Ministry recently proposed the inclusion of a number of environment-related clauses in the Constitution. This one caught my attention: "The State shall protect, preserve, and improve the environment and safeguard natural resources, ecological diversity, biodiversity, wetlands, forests, and wildlife of the country for present and future generations."//////Traditionally, surface water is the main source of drinking water and consumed without any treatment or after boiling when fuel is available. An increasing population density and inadequate sanitation has led to severe microbial contamination of surface water causing diseases (cholera, diarrhea, typhoid, dysentery) and mortality. In the 1970's the use of groundwater for human consumption was propagated to overcome this problem. In the following decade UNICEF installed about 10 million shallow tube wells (suctioned hand pump) over the country. However, in 1993, high levels of arsenic were found in drinking water from tube wells. Nearly 40,000 people showing the skin lesions symptoms characteristic of arsenicosis have been identified. //////She called me Tukun Japani and cared for me from the day of my birth to age three like a mother.

She was the fourth among my six sisters and called Baby by all. I called her Apajia and hold that name close to my heart. She was a mother figure to me, though I did not get to see her much because she married when I was only three years of age.//////The door opened with a cracking noise. He slammed the door behind him. The library is dark and ancient, so dark that sometimes it seems something is hiding behind those shelves. The library room is filled with gravity and silence. So intense is the silence that one can hear if one carefully listens to it. //////The other day I was just about to wash my face when I saw a lizard staring at me with its bulbous eyes right in the middle of the sink. The sink was deep and the poor thing was trying to climb upwards but was unable to do so on the slippery surface. I could almost hear it shouting out for help as it looked up at me. I could see panic written in its eyes. I got a plate from the kitchen and held it out to the frightened creature. After several trials he finally crawled onto the plate and I was able to rescue the lizard from its peril. I was late that day for my office. My boss glared at me as I entered through the gate. I just couldn't tell him about my adventures with the lizard. However, I had a good feeling knowing that the lizard was roaming around the walls of my home. I had a vision of other lizards hearing the story of their friend's adventure and appreciating my help. And why shouldn't I help these quiet inhabitants of my home? After all, the Lord made them all.//////Who plays the familiar note on the flute ////// in the middle of the night, //////Awakening me with the wildest thoughts? //////The mysterious fog-shrouded figure in //////the courtyard beckons me . . . ////// //////Certain risk factors increase your chance of developing breast cancer.

Vitamin B12 and folate are homocysteine-related vitamins that may have an impact on Alzheimer's disease via their ability of reducing circulating homocysteine levels, vitamin E might prevent Alzheimer's disease via its strong antioxidant effect, and fatty acids may be related to dementia and cognitive function through atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or inflammation via an effect on brain development and membrane functioning or via accumulation of beta-amyloid.//////US President Barak Obama made a historical statement on 2nd August. He announced that the US combat operations in Iraq would be over by August 31st that would end US's 7 years war in Iraq. His predecessor had signed an agreement with the Iraqi government that all US troops would come back by end of 2011. The incumbent President had penned an addition to that agreement that US would bring back all combat troops by 31st August of this year. Under that agreement 50,000 non-combat troops would remain in Iraq to train and assist Iraqi security forces and the rest of the 1,40,000 US troops, all involved in combat, would return home.//////AS Indonesia celebrated its 65th independence day on August 17th, it is also trying to reorient its foreign policy goals to emerge as a responsible power in the Southeast Asian region. The two continuous terms of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono have given a new direction to Indonesia's foreign policy. Soekarno and Soeharto, the iconic leaders of Indonesia, had pursued contrasting approaches and power affiliations in every possible way. Soekarno was keen on emerging as the undisputed leader of NAM. Soeharto formatted his foreign policy by toeing the US line to a large extent. Today, the clear trends are that Indonesia's foreign policy is a unique amalgamation of the two schools of thought and policy of adaptation to changing geopolitical and geostrategic compulsions. Indonesia being the world's largest archipelago with the biggest Muslim population is again trying to gain the leadership position in the region through constructive and cooperative gestures and balanced bargaining between major powers.//////THE devastating flood that has inundated most part of the provinces of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh has rendered fourteen million homeless in Pakistan. The danger of water-borne disease threatens the life of many who are currently staying in temporary shelters and under open skies. The United Nations has called upon the international community to donate generously. However, as of now, it can only meet 40 per cent of the estimated budget that it requires to meet some basic needs like food, health, nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation. To assess the situation UN General Secretary Ban Ki Moon visited the flood affected areas. He said The magnitude of the problem; the world has never seen such a disaster. It's much beyond anybody's imagination. //////TEHRAN: Iran began mass-producing two high-speed variants of missile-launching assault boats on Monday, warning its enemies not to "play with fire" as it boosts security along its coastline.//////Struggle, power and vision. All three waited to be combined by one man. And that brought the South Africans their freedom, and to the world an apartheid-free existence at least the hope of it. It was no surprise to see how anxiously whole world searched for that one black face at Soccer City stadium. Born in the quiet village of Mvezo on the banks of the Mbasa, Nelson Mandela is far more than a legend. He is 'the legend', and a living one!//////How many times has the Romeo and Juliet story been retold? Having asked that question, I'm not certain that Eritrean writer Sulaiman Addonia had Shakespeare in mind when he wrote his evocative story of two star-crossed lovers, not in Eritrea but in Saudi Arabia. However, the publishers of The Consequences of Love highlight the connection to a story that depicts the near impossibility of love in such a stultifying and repressive country. The young lovers, Naser and Fiore, have Eritrean parentage, but the obstacle they encounter as foreigners attempting to fulfill their love is not familial but religious: fundamentalism.//////, has a unique place in the field of Indian drama. The play projects belief in God, in Hinduism, and Jainism --- one belief whose rituals revolve round blood and the other that abhors killing and blood. Beyond the literal lies the more profound meaning, that violence is an integral part of human existence and that the moral dilemma encountered on account of violence is part of everyday life.//////Imdadul Haq Milon, who has played a vital role in inculcating reading habits among Bangladeshis, is hardly considered for his serious works. He is mostly evaluated as a writer of popular fiction. We generally do not remember that Milan is a writer of Noorjahan (1st vol 1995, 2nd vol 2002), Bhumiputro (1985) or Jabojjibon (first published in Journal 1976, in book form in 1990). Along with those he has authored some novels on our liberation war too. Those works may not have been great from a literary perspective, but they are surely good fictional works on that milestone event in the history of Bangladesh. Jibonpur, a novel based on the War of Liberation, is also a significant creation by Imdadul Haq Milon. The main story line of the book is centred on the trafficking of people from Bangladesh to other countries through India and Pakistan. //////
