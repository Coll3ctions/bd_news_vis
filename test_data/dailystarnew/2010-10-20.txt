Truckers used it as a parking lot till newspaper reports in 1996 forced Dhaka City Corporation to reclaim it and install slides, seesaws, swings and other playground equipment. But because of the same DCC's neglect, the amusement tools soon rusted and vanished, and the park became a dumping ground for construction rubbish and sewer sludge.

Now that research by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology pin-points the factors behind frequent highway accidents, we believe it is time for action. These are the bare facts the report by BUET's Accident Research Unit (ARI) has come up with: ten major highways in Bangladesh are at high risk where accidents are concerned because 219 black spots have been identified on them. It is not that we are waiting for disaster to strike. The reality is that there have already been as many as 2,515 accidents on these 219 spots, the number of casualties being 2,349. That, again, is not the entire picture as the ARI would have us know, for the institute gets only those reports of accidents that the police provide it with. The conclusion is therefore simple: a whole range of other accidents occurring on major roads and highways across the country may very well be going unreported.//////In what looks like a major move, the dynamic education minister Nurul Islam Nahid is resurrecting a project that the caretaker government had taken up but which got lost in a bureaucratic tangle down the road.

She doesn't like her school at all. She says her teacher doesn't love her very much. She has to read 11 books being a student of nursery. The situation is alarming. It is ridiculous that the kindergartens want to teach the students everything to fulfil the demand of the conscious (!) guardians. Parents want their children to read more and more from the very beginning of their educational life.//////During the last tenure of BNP-Jamaat rule, the policymakers appointed their cadres in three tiers- at secretary/additional secretary level, joint secretary level and also deputy secretary level. Many of these officers, who are die-hard BNP-Jamaat cadres, have been identified and have been removed or retired. Many of the BNP appointees have become neutral. But a good number of them are masquerading. They are obstructing the government's development works in subtle ways, helping BNP in indirect ways. Their main objective is to bring the present government into disrepute, slow down developmental works and pave ways for BNP-Jamaat to come to power. But it will remain a distant dream if the AL-led grand alliance plays the cards deftly.//////Why do we need to pull down the BGMEA corporate office while it is not harming anybody's interests, public or private? A post editorial in The Daily Star described the logic of pulling down illegally built buildings, though I am slightly of a different opinion. There are a good number of illegally erected buildings in Dhaka city. The caretaker government tried to identify such buildings to demolish. But for some unknown reasons, those plans were not accomplished except for the Rangs Bhaban near the PM office.//////Killing a human being for political gains is nothing new in this part of the world.

The Pakistani authorities, with bad intensions, unleashed that communal hatred.//////Everybody is becoming impatient day by day. In the house, office, classroom, street, bazaar, and transport, everybody reacts to other's actions, every now and then. It is observed very often that sons and daughters shout and even become violent against the decisions of their parents. On a trivial matter, one driver beats up another on the busy street, resulting in a massive traffic jam. A rickshaw passenger slaps the rickshaw puller for giving an 'offensive' look. Students cannot tolerate their teacher's advice. Neighbours and relatives do not come to each other's help. On the contrary, one tries to harass another openly. One's bad luck makes others happy.
