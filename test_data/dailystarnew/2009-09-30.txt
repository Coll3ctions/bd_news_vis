It is one more powerful indication of the persisting menace that threatens to keep the country on tenterhooks as long as the outfit and others like it are not neutralised. The good bit here, however, is that the law enforcing and security forces, namely, the police and the Rapid Action Battalion, have remained busy identifying the camps and flushing out the elements busy trying to undermine the state. We appreciate the skill and confidence with which they have been going after these extremist elements and so persuading the nation that things are well in hand.

The Nixon-Kissinger team would not help us with food because we had the gall to try to do trade with Cuba. The Pakistanis and their 1971 Bengali collaborators were fanning out all over the Middle East telling kings and sheikhs and dictators there of the "anti-Islamic" nature of our secularism. //////IRAN always wanted bilateral talks with the US but the Bush administration never agreed to it.

The police have identified 84 websites, which carry sexually explicit contents involving Bangladeshi citizens. Since the police are friends of the people, they didn't rest on their laurels.

The caretaker govt also took some steps such as knocking down illegal structures besides the roads but these are again occupied by the encroachers. It is clear that every political govt took many steps which later proved ineffective. //////In his documentary, Sicko, Micheal Moore, shows us the shabby state of US healthcare. The documentary informs us that almost fifty million Americans are uninsured and those who are covered are often victims of insurance company fraud and red tape. It is indeed a very comprehensive documentary that reveals the machinations that the insurance companies resort to, to avoid meeting the cost of medically necessary treatments for policy holders, and thus increase company profitability. Moore goes a step further in showing how healthcare in some other countries, France, UK, Canada and even Cuba, is far better than US. He takes a group of people (who worked as volunteers for rescue work of the victims of 9/11) to Cuba to provide them healthcare as ironically and unfortunately they were denied government funds to meet their medical treatments. //////Shabbir A Bashar, PhD has taken Mr Mahboob Elahi, of Ottawa, Canada and myself to task for criticizing him on his so-called unwarranted accusation that foreign diplomats and international NGOs stationed in Dhaka possess the majority of Gas Guzzling Monstrosities (GGMs), drive them at our expense and cause most of the gridlock on Dhaka's streets by flaunting our traffic laws. //////Beware of man-eaters in the Sundarbans.
