It could be ensured through an administrative decree for the time being or involve another amendment to the CrPC. To our mind, it is reopening of the issue that ought to have been settled with the amendment of the CrPC carried out earlier on. This should have delineated the powers and responsibilities between officers of executive cadre who acted as magistrates and the judicial magistrates. The amendment was thought to have cleared the course for the separation of the judiciary from the executive to commence on November 1.//////So-called "condensed sugar" with sodium cyclamate is being sold in the market, according to reports.

It will definitely help in establishing the rule of law and containing corruption. Its implementation is already long over-due. British merchants mingled the judiciary with the administration with a view to exploiting people of this land and painfully the system is still on.

Rafiqul studied up to class-nine at the Sara Marwari High School at Ishurdi, Pabna. But poverty forced him to drop out of school and come to Dhaka to work for a livelihood. At Dhaka, he started working as a helper of a truck. But cruel fate intervened, when in Comilla another truck collided head-on with Rafiqul's truck. In the accident both of his legs were crushed. To save his legs, he sold his arable lands to go to the Vellore Christian Medical College and Hospital, Madras, India, where he was treated by Dr Shyamal Chitta Ranjan and Dr Isaac Xavier. They operated five times on Rafiqul's legs. //////The other day a close friend of mine was lamenting on the state of the mind of our countrymen, and revealed to me some of his inner thoughts. I pass it along to the readers with the benevolent presumption that it might lead to a solo session on reflections--a dialogue with the self. This friend, whom I would call Kamal, has been working for many years overseas on contract, holding a high post in an international organisation. One day he announced that he would be returning to his motherland Bangladesh on the expiry of his contract sometime this year, and enjoy his double retirement. Almost all the Bengali residents in the city asked him the same question: why was he going back to his country, and why he would not try to get domiciled in that country and remain there. After some time, Kamal got bored with the question, and adopted a cryptic reply: "My country, good or bad". The second most popular query was that surely he was not going to lead a retired life; and they were curious to know what he wanted to do after retirement. "Nothing," Kamal snapped. "Do you know the art of doing nothing?" Some were shocked, some did not believe him, while some others did not give him the benefit of doubt. Kamal came to me for solace, and gave me a bit of his mind, because others would not and did not understand his philosophy. "What had happened to the nation?" He thundered in frustration. If well to do citizens cultivated this type of attitude, who would lead the society? He referred to the professionals holding posh jobs overseas, who were only concerned with their own lives. Enough is never enough. The curve in the graph must always be rising even with one foot in the grave. Even at the top, there is no such thing as a horizontal curve. Developing countries need rising curves; and it becomes a motto of private and personal life. Spiritually, avariciousness, and wants and desires have reached the dimensions of a bottomless basket (remember Kissinger?). Gratefulness to the Almighty is forgotten in the chase of Mammon. The tentacles of materialism have gripped a hundred million souls. There appeared to be no escape from the vicious circle. He quoted the great saint of Baghdad. Be satisfied with your present station, and seek not a change, because you do not know what is good for you. Be patient, and seek the blessings of the Lord; He is the most merciful and compassionate. Kamal moaned on the erosion and lack of faith in one's own self. He was very up-to-date with his reasoning. Look what happened to Eastern Europe suddenly and in a few months. Communism's godlessness could not hold for more than two generations. He stressed great spiritual significance to this historic change, and called for self analysis. I tried to bring him down to earth with the observation that the pattern of thinking in the developing countries is similar to the have-not mentality. The negative attitude towards life was due to frustration and lack of security. The sharpness of hunger blunts the conscience. Its effects are far reaching. The principles are eroded, the morality is compromised, moral courage disappears, and the willingness to suffer for principles evaporates. Temptation becomes irresistible. Therefore the have-nots cannot rule; because they are not accustomed to money and power. First self, then the party, then the country.//////In the last few weeks, news was published in different newspapers accusing the private medical colleges of the country. This news created confusion, depression and frustration not only among the students, teachers and staff of the colleges but also among the guardians.//////The largest portion of northern Dhaka is situated on the eastern side of Dhaka-North Bengal Road; the area is known as Uttar Khan & Dakkhin Khan (now declared as two separate thanas) covering an area of about 40/50 square kilometers. The road along which the people of this area mainly move is called Shah Kabir Mazar Road, in short Mazar Road. It starts from the Azampur Rail Gate of Uttara Model Town, Sector No. 4 and extends eastward about 10/12 km to the Balu River. The area has already turned into one of the biggest residential habitats of Dhaka city. On the other side of the river, Kaligonj and Rupgonj thanas are situated. Most of the people of these two thanas cross the river and come to the city along this road by rickshaw, bus, baby-taxi, tempo etc. and on foot.//////We are regularly paying a large amount of money to the government exchequer in the form of taxes and fees levied on our income, savings, investments and expenses.

What is that one problem that has given an opportunity to all the actors and key players to show their concern in real life? As you all must have guessed by now, it is the issue of global warming. But don't turn the page yet, because this is not one of those millions of essays on global warming. It is about how small countries like ours are making a significant contribution to the " Healing Process" without being aware of it. Well, it is neither the existence of an insignificant number of industries in our country that can emit harmful greenhouse gases in the environment, nor is it the fact that the majority of people cannot afford appliances like air conditioners and washing machines, it is the price hike of liquid fuel in the global market!//////Trees are our great friends and gifts of nature.

She also told the interrogating team that she was not influenced by anyone, nor did she exert any influence on the purchase committee to award the contract to Gatco.//////IT appears that the caretaker government has almost set its mind on granting voting rights to the overseas Bangladeshis. This decision may be both popular and constitutional. After all, in a democratic country every citizen is entitled to equal rights, so why deprive the overseas Bangladeshis of the right to vote? //////The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (henceforth, GBM) river system is the third largest freshwater outfall to the world's oceans. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra fall in a number of countries in the South Asian region, including China, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Of these China contributes solely to the flow of the Brahmaputra, and Nepal to the flow of the Ganges. These two rivers often overflow during the monsoon months, and the flow reduces dramatically in the dry season. The region therefore faces two major hazards: floods during the monsoon and scarcity of water during the dry season. These hazards become more pronounced in the downstream regions particularly in Bangladesh.//////The 2nd International Conference on Climate Change and Tourism, held in Davos from October 1 to 3, organised by UNWTO together with the United Nations Environment Program (Unep), the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and supported by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Swiss government, has urged "action by the entire tourism sector to face climate change as one of the greatest challenges to sustainable development, and to the Millennium Development Goals in the 21st Century."//////
