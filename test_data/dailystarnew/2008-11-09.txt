He was elected the 44th president of the United States, the first from the minority community in US history.

Why am I making this gross comment? Let me bring our attention to some recent events and Bangladesh related activities around the world. Event one: the Election Commission announced that they would not be able to announce election schedule (tafsil) within the previously stipulated date. However, they claimed in a low voice that election would be held on 18 December. Event two: Sheikh Hasina meets Richard Boucher in his office. Event three: UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrives in Dhaka. The UN-SG meets the chief of staff of Bangladesh army. After the meeting the chief announces firmly that the election is going to be held on 18 December without any doubt. Event four: the EC announces the polls fixture. Future direction: the CTG assures the UN chief of credible polls. //////Dhaka University---it could be said (and I suppose most of you will agree) is the soul of the country. Why? Because DU is partly the reason behind our independence. If the students of this university had not raised their voices against the Pakistanis, then probably we would not have been independent (at least I would not have been sitting here writing this letter). In 1952, it was the students of this very university who made Bengali the state language of this country. Today we can speak in Bengali freely at school or at home because of those martyrs. And it is said that this fight for language finally led the way to our independence. ////// The tourism sector in Bangladesh has great potential. In Bangladesh we have many natural beauty spots like the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forests in the world, and Cox's Bazar which is the longest sea beach. Many domestic tourists visit these places but the number of foreign tourists has declined significantly. //////Considering the price hike, the Bangladesh government was kind enough to declare 20% D.A. from 1 July 2008, even for those who are enjoying LPR. Pension/gratuity benefits are calculated excluding this D.A. It is a known practice that D.A. is converted into basic pay only when the new pay scale is executed. In fact, those on LPR will be deprived of pension/ gratuity benefits out of D.A. as soon as they go on pension. //////There are some limitations in remitting foreign currency for the purpose of studying professional courses like ACCA. As a result, the students who want to pursue the course at home face serious problems. For example, some foreign banks are able to draw a draft only for the initial registration for the ACCA but cannot remit for other exam-related payments, because there is no permission from the central bank. If this was allowed the students would not have faced such a situation,//////Thanks for your graphical picture on the subject (29 Oct.). It shows a hearing impaired (as reported) woman walking totally unaware on a railway track, with a passenger train approaching hardly fifty meters behind her, on the same track! The picture possibly confirms her hearing impairment, as she is totally unaware of the life threatening danger right behind her.//////Recently many people are writing about the failure of the present Bangladesh government as well as previous regimes to sign as a member of the Asian Highway Network. Bangladesh did not ink the papers because of unfounded fear of allowing transit facilities to India. Bangladesh is insisting on diverting the road network through Myanmar, ultimately connecting with China. The recent lobbying of Bangladesh with the Myanmar government is yet to produce any positive results for our country. Legally, Bangladesh cannot lobby for changes in routes unless it becomes a member. Our position has been demoted to the status of observer from member.//////I am talking about our national cricket team captain. Bangladesh was fighting hard to save the match in Mirpur. The rain was a blessing and respite for us and for our failed captain. One need not mention anything about the performance of the captain as a batsman and team leader. //////Some days ago a news report drew my attention. It was about a 15-year old boy who died in a clash between AL and BNP supporters, following a kabadi match in a village. The boy was quoted as an AL worker. How can a 15-year old become a political worker? He was not even mature enough to enter into student politics! But we see many teenagers being drawn into politics. During hartals, strikes or processions they are used as pickets.//////It is very unfortunate that the anti-liberation forces are trying to destroy our cultural heritage. //////The way Mashrafee and Shakib put their heads down and saved Bangladesh from the ignominy of following on in the two-day Test at Mirpur against New Zealand is really commendable. Both of them also showed great maturity in the Chittagong Test.//////It was earlier believed that staples like rice, wheat, barley, and legumes were the first domesticated crops. But Archaeobotanists at Harvard University and Bar-Ilan University have recently revealed a startling fact published in the Science Journal that fruit trees are the oldest known domesticated crops. According to their findings, the dawn of agriculture may have come with the domestication of fig trees in the Near East some 11,400 years ago!//////It is learnt from an email that 76 Nobel laureates from Science in America were in election campaign for Obama. This was an impressive message. People from every discipline should express their own opinions regarding selection of the leadership. It helps them to cross the barrier between the decision/policy makers and the professionals like scientists. Just because of lack of understanding, the country suffers, particularly the scientists. Nowadays, this problem comes up in almost all scientific events and lots of discussions are held on a regular basis.//////I commend Syed Bayazid for his rational, unbiased views about the Baul statues issue published in a letter on 31 October. Ever since the statues were knocked down for whatever reasons, I have been reading comments, opinions of contributors, readers as well as reports of continuous protests by the cultural activists almost on a daily basis. The reason I appreciate Mr. Bayazid's views is that unlike most of those contributors, readers, protestors who have no hesitation whatsoever to term these 'mullahs' bigots, he has presented an acceptable, accurate account of the issue consistent with our democratic values. //////Eight newly procured animals have died in Dhaka Zoo. The Ministry of Fisheries & Livestock allotted Tk 5.5 crore for the purchase of the new inmates. A total of 87 animals were added. Of the total, 27 rare species were bought from South Africa. Death of these eight animals caused the government a loss of Tk 60 lakh so far. //////I have been observing with keen interest the political developments in Bangladesh over the last 30 years. I was there on Jan 11, 2006 and stayed a whole year. I was extremely disturbed by the blatant interference of the British, Americans, European Union countries in our domestic affairs. //////I watched from my home in UK Mr. George Hargreave on Revelation TV channel at 2.30pm on Sunday 02 November 2008. He is the President of Christian Peoples Party which is a registered as a political party in the United Kingdom.

He also mentioned that as Christianity was based in the belief of God and service of mankind, it should apply to all humanity in UK.//////Congratulations to Dhaka Warriors for their third win in the ICL!

Ever since the row began, the media has been writing about the madrassa students, portraying them as violent and irrational, without giving the rationale for the demands from their point of view. //////THE US is currently experiencing a severe credit crunch, which is the gravest financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The crisis has already spread out to Europe and Asia, and is expected to be global soon. Many economists believe that the US economy has entered a recession that might be longer than usual, sending the whole world into a slowdown.
