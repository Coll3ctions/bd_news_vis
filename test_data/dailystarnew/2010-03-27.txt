The streets of Bangkok are witnessing significant movements of thousands of charged up people who, being ardent supporters of the deposed premier, are demanding the stepping down of the present premier and also the dissolution of the House.

It is painfully true in case of Dr. Fazlur Rahman Khan, the legendary Bangladesh-born structural engineer. His achievements are hailed by men of science all over the world, obituary references to him were made even in leading magazines like Time and Newsweek (perhaps the only Bangladeshi non-political personality to be so honoured), he was acclaimed the 'Construction's Man of the Year' and accorded Alfred E. Lindau Award (considered to be the most precious in the world of architecture), he headed the prestigious Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat for years (till the end of his days), and yet very few in our country are aware of his monumental contribution, world-wide fame and recognition. //////Harare, capital of Zimbabwe is rated as the worst city of the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) of the renowned weekly magazine The Economist published from London.

When night deepens along with the rain, their tiny leaves and branches shake feverishly as if in a storm. From the deep recesses of their pygmy bodies cracklings could be heard, as if the plants were stretching their limbs. Atiq watches as the tiny plants become enormous in size, grow in height, shoot up four- five storeys to almost touch the sky. At such times a greenish darkness radiates from their thick stems, their bulbous leaves and branches and gushes forth in waves to get hold of Atiq. His sleep gone, Atiq gropes for the torch beneath his pillow. These days he has grown accustomed to it. He no longer thinks it as a nightmare. He knows what the bonsais are capable of. //////I was returning home from office. My eyes fell on a Toyota. A very healthy, bearded man was sitting on the back seat. Alone. Slowly I recognized him. That infamous Maulana, whose photograph was carried by Dainik Bangla in December 1971 with the caption 'Wanted!' I looked carefully at him. He was heavy and fat. He looked almost like a Gama Pahlewan. He didn't at all look like a man who had felt great tension during the preceding thirty nine years, suffering from remorse or guilt. He had opposed our independence and killed people who sought freedom. But there was no hindrance to his comfort, to his material success in our country. Strange! //////Long roads, empty corridors breezy//////I run hither and thither looking for you//////And there you are down memory lane//////Was not it a while ago//////You had asked to be fed?//////In such brooding the heart bleeds.//////Your favorite hue of t-shirt was red,//////But in white were you sent to bed!//////Home they brought the warrior dead!//////Even at ninety two you were a fighter//////Was what the doctor had said.//////Coronary angiogram, also called cardiac catheteristion is increasingly performed now a days. It is done when people experience symptoms of coronary artery disease, such as  chest pain (called angina), pain in your jaw, neck or arm that cannot be explained by other tests; congenital heart diseases; heart failure and heart valve problem.

Knee pain and stiff joint may be as hurting as to limit peoples movement.

The light is absorbed by pigment in the hair follicles and destroys the hair within the follicle. Removing unwanted hair thus leaves you with bumps, burns, or the hassles of repeated shaving, tweezing, or waxing. Hence, laser hair removal may be an option worth considering.//////Eating plenty of potassium-rich foods such as leafy greens, coconut water, potatoes and bananas may reduce the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease, according to a recent research.//////A further $4.3 billion is needed if a global vaccines alliance is to meet its goal of supplying life-saving immunisations to millions of children in poor countries by 2015, the organisation said recently.//////Ontu, a three and half-year-old boy is the first baby of his parents. From his early childhood, his mother noticed that Ontu does not speak according to his age, does not interact the way his cousins of same age do. He has his own way of playing, talking and reacting with his surroundings. Sometimes he becomes very much edgy, but most of the time he remains alone. Her mother then consulted a psychiatrist and Ontu was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).//////I was a sixteen year-old teenager in 1971, and 27 March was my birthday. Two days later on 29 March the Pakistani Army gruesomely murdered more than three hundred innocent Bengalis in front of my own eyes. I used to live in the Lalkhan Bazaar area of Chittagong along with my parents, three brothers and two sisters. The Pakistani Army entered Chittagong on the morning of that day and stormed the nearby Chittagong Police Lines. They took over the place by overcoming the resistance put up by the brave Bengali policemen who all laid down their lives after exhausting their insufficient ammunition, struggling to keep at bay a combat army fully equipped with automatic guns and heavy artillery. //////US' preoccupation with Iraq and Afghanistan has, to some extent, stood in the way of the administration of President Obama from focusing fully on the Israel-Palestine conflict. In fact, there have been no Palestine-Israel talks for more than a year. Although President Obama appointed former Senator George Mitchell as his Middle East Envoy to carry forward US initiated peace negotiations, there has not been progress through his efforts even after the Senator visited the region and talked with all conflicting groups, except Hammas. The government of Benjamin Netanyahu has also not shown much interest towards peace either.//////THE evolution of information technology has metamorphosed the very dynamics of contemporary warfare. In the current scenario, national security not only relies on the modernization of armed forces, cutting-edge defence technology and innovative policies, but also on elusive assets like communication and information. There is a transition, from the race of arms, nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), towards the race of information dominance. The enhanced use of information, expeditious chrysalis of microcomputers, information technologies and cyberspace has changed the very face of war and emerged as a new challenge for national security. The avidity to acquire more information and intelligence to counter and design future warfare puts an intense demand on space assets.//////For anybody who loves Bangladesh, it is a singular pleasure to write a few lines in appreciation of this splendid autobiographical venture from a well-known civil servant of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. It is infinitely more so for a person like me, who has been a close friend of the author, Nurul Huq, for the last half-a-century. He has always astounded me and his enormous circle of friends with his phenomenal memory which enables him to remember minute details of events long past. But even then, I was not prepared for the range and beauty of this wonderful journey down memory lane, describing not just the trials and tribulations of the emerging Muslim middle class of Bengal. At the same time, the work is a very honest and dispassionate chronicle of the struggles, successes and failures of the emerging nation state called Bangladesh.//////Small Ethnic Groups of Bangladesh ---A Mapping Exercise retains the history and culture of ethnic people who constitute an integral part of our population. The historic, linguistic, cultural and social attributes of our ethnic people remain latent in the form of CDs to unfold before us. Social and political scientiss may find rich spicy materials in this seemingly small book. The ethnic groups of Bangladesh have enriched our traditional culture and participated in the freedom movement, though these facts have not been widely circulated or known. This book bears the testimony to those realities. The writer has gone to pains to record them for us. This study proceeds with three objectives --- finding out the exact number of small ethic groups; estimating their size and identifying their locations; and gathering selected information on the demographic , educational and socio-economic status of these groups. Though the study deals with these basic parameters, it rather tends to tilt toward education.//////"Starting from 2003, I have been part of ASA and have taken loans of small amount like Tk.5,000, Tk.9,000, etc. This has helped us in buying coal and metal for our business. It was the answer by Mrs. Kunja Lata to the question, What have you gained by becoming a client of ASA?
