With blessings from the West and the armed forces of Pakistan, he held his post quite strongly. Yes, I am talking about General Pervez Musharraf. The general, who survived many attacks on him over the past couple of years, could not survive this attack on his position by 'democracy'. Perhaps, Billawal Bhutto's strong words "Democracy is the best revenge carried the essence of a 'to-be' politician. General Musharraf is said to be the most popular man in Washington and New Delhi. However, he was the most hated and unpopular President of Pakistan. He had friends all over the world and foes all across Pakistan. He was the most trusted partner of President Bush's war on terror but again he was the least trusted man in Pakistan's Presidential office. He tried too many things to grasp power but he failed to do anything to have some love from the people of Pakistan. //////Childhood experience plays a major role in shaping a person's character.

They have forgotten all the past records of Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif. It took Mahatir Muhammad over 23 years to set Malaysia straight. And he did that despite being highly unpopular. We must understand that we as a nation are too naive to understand the complexities of the affairs of the state. //////I would like to request you to report on the sanitation problem of the halls of Dhaka University. The bathrooms are very small in size. Used water can't pass through the narrow outlets. Another problem of Dhaka University is communication. Only a few buses transport the students from different places. The number of students is increasing day by day but the number of buses is decreasing. The university authorities do not buy any new bus though they earn a lot of money every year from the students as transportation fee. I don't understand what is the use of the money which they receive from the newly admitted students as transportation fee. They can buy at least two or three buses every year to lessen the sufferings of the students. But the authorities don't pay any attention to the matter. The buses which are running at the moment are not in good condition. So the students have to suffer. //////Thanks to Mr. Nurul Haque for his post editorial article on the above subject. In this connection I have a question, and I am also curious to know how one would ensure that a candidate meets those two basic criteria. Are the existing laws not sufficient to leave the dishonest (difficult to measure) candidates out before putting their names on the ballot? Without raising further issues on this, I would urge the informed readers to kindly suggest the names of ten most honest and competent persons who are qualified to contest the election. I wish, I am wrong, but I can assure you that the listed persons would not get pass marks, fix a pass mark, if properly screened out without fear or favour by the media with full transparency. Let us try this exercise and then see what is the result.//////We cannot accept premature deaths caused by accidents. Road crashes are a regular phenomena in the highways and cities. Every year accidents take hundreds of lives and leave thousand of others deformed or disabled. The indirect effect of the invisible monster is the downfall and untold sufferings of hundreds of thousands of other people who are family members of those victims. But why this unintended holocaust? //////Khandaker Delwar Hossain, BNP(Khaleda) Secretary General, while talking to newsmen on the eve of observing National Mourning Day demanded that Ziaur Rahman's death anniversary be also declared what he called "national mourning day". This meant that the BNP supporters want to weigh Ziaur Rahman on the same scale with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation. The amount of individual contribution to the war of liberation varies from person to person. Our liberation war did not start on a single day all of a sudden on 26 March 1971.//////So it is another summer Olympics capturing the dreams of the world, and we watched China and the USA fighting for supremacy. Korea, Japan and other countries also had medal hauls, so what about us? It is taken for granted that we will never get a medal in the Olympics, and for good reason at that. The Olympic disciplines are mostly ignored in our country. I study in a school famous for its soccer, and it's soccer only. Even though I am not bad in that sport, I would have really liked to train in sports like swimming, gymnastics or pole-vaulting, but that will never be possible!//////I was wondering why there is so much difference between selling and buying foreign currencies in banks in Bangladesh.//////Thanks to the DS for the editorial today on the above subject. The politicians have already expressed their apprehension about this new undemocratic step. Those who would support the move, at least, do not believe in political freedom and are opposed to democratic values. These are some of the examples by which the government is determined to achieve their original idea of guided politicisation of the country. One would not be surprised to see how a group of civil society members and some known political faces are defending the step. Just add one more news item with it. The EC has asked the intelligence agency and the NBR to check the fact sheets of the elected candidates of the last 13 local council elections. This is another example of deliberate mismanagement of the election procedures, and puts the burden on the shoulder of the judiciary to give the final verdict. One organisation, a NGO or civil society cadre, I do not know, had been campaigning to initiate such action by the EC. The question is, why these groups and the EC did not complete this clean up process before putting their names on the ballot?//////The Daily Star published in the last page on August 19, "Bangladeshi workers protest again in Kuwait". After reading the report I found out how the BANGLADESHI workers are deprived. We should support them and give positive vibes so that the world can know we are Protesting for our Rights, not for FUN.//////On August 8 we saw Georgia's pro-west President Saakashvili's misadventure in South Ossetia. But western media like CNN, BBC, AFP, AP etc. had launched a vigorous media propaganda from which one can conclude that it was Russia who first attacked Georgia. And they also portrayed Saakashvili as a hero who immediately wanted a ceasefire (only after his US trained army got a heavy beating by Russian's military). Among the number of conflicting interests, one is that Russia won't allow a NATO member at its doorstep and western powers need Georgia to extract energy from that region through the Black Sea. Through western media bias we the general readers, listeners or viewers get confused and fail to learn what actually happened.//////I refer to the Op-Ed article (18 Aug) and agree with the writer entirely. I myself am a writer (In English) of many original scientific and other books (including poetry). As it was not possible to find a reputable publisher in UK (You need literary agent here to accept and then push your books for publication), I fell into the clutches of 'vanity publishers' about 25 years ago who published one of my books here. The vanity publishers are so called because the whole cost of printing, publishing and distribution etc is borne by the author and the publishers have nothing to lose whether any book is sold or not. As a matter of fact their main income consists of selling the book back to the author at a discounted price! These publishers are also well known to the critics and no book published by them are reviewed in any literary journal. So I gathered much painful experience and then set up my own publishing firm and website(www.oaktownpublicayions.com) to publish my own rather esoteric books( known as self publishing as opposed to vanity publishing), which are not in great public demand anyway.//////A fuel train hit a mine and exploded near the stricken Georgian city of Gori yesterday as Russia faced renewed European Union pressure to make a complete withdrawal from Georgia.//////Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters had mixed reactions Saturday to the selection of Joe Biden as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate. //////Agreements with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) "are not holy like the holy Quran and the Hadith" and can be modified if circumstances change, Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari said in an interview with BBC Urdu on Saturday.//////Strife-torn Sri Lanka is bracing for intense and bloody battles as security forces close in on the political capital of the Tamil Tiger rebels, according to military analysts.//////Terming the PPP-led coalition government as "most incompetent" in Pakistan's history, cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has said the country's situation will deteriorate further if Asif Ali Zardari becomes its President.//////Some of the women were eating lunch, while others were busy making bread. //////Pakistani troops killed seven militants in clashes near the Afghan border while Taliban rebels slaughtered an alleged spy, officials said yesterday.//////Myanmar's opposition party led by Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday labelled a recent visit by a UN envoy "a waste of time" as the ruling junta continued to trumpet its own vision of democracy.//////Climate change could release unexpectedly huge stores of carbon dioxide from Arctic soils, which would in turn fuel a vicious circle of global warming, a new study warned yesterday.//////US-led coalition troops clashed with a group of Taliban fighters in northern Afghanistan on Sunday, killing six militants, while four militants were killed in a battle in the south, officials said. //////A lack of political leadership threatens to allow seething Hindu-Muslim tensions and separatist anger in revolt-hit Indian Kashmir to spiral out of control, analysts say.//////An official investigation has found that more than 90 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed in coalition air strikes this week, the Afghan religious affairs minister said yesterday.//////Security forces raided the offices of the Islamic Movement in the northern Israeli town of Umm al-Fahm early on Sunday and accused it of aiding the Palestinian Hamas movement, police said.//////In a Naxal attack in the communally sensitive Kandhamal district in Orissa, 30 armed Naxals ambushed the Ban Basi Kalyan ashram for girls when Janmashtami celebrations were taking place on Saturday evening killing six people.//////Pakistan yesterday rejected a ceasefire offered by Taliban militants in a troubled tribal region near the Afghan border as troops killed seven rebel fighters, officials said. //////The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) is home to 11 ethnic communities, each with a varied and amazing culture.
