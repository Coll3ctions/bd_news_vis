Finance Minister AMA Muhith has proposed a new budget with a lot of stress on future reforms and analysis of why things went haywire this year. But his biggest challenges of squeezing out a 7.2 percent growth and strapping inflation remain unchanged. //////Owing to what the finance minister called a gradual decline in international trade-based revenues, the government is making all-out efforts to boost revenue from domestic sources, thereby forcing people to carry a heavy tax burden.//////In the budget speech, the finance minister projected that within the next fiscal year, there will be huge surplus power as a result of implementation of dozens of power projects.//////The outlay of the next fiscal year has been increased by 19 percent from the 2011-2012 revised budget to fix it at Tk 1,91,738 crore, which is 18.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).//////Prices of all non-commercial vehicles like cars, microbuses and sport utility vehicles would go up as the government plans to impose supplementary duties on their imports from the next fiscal year.//////Despite soaring inflation, the tax-free income limit remains at Tk 1.80 lakh in the proposed budget.//////Last year, Abidur Rahim rushed home from office and watched the budget speech alone because the rest of the family thought it was boring. //////The government will face formidable challenges in implementing its budget for the fiscal year 2012-13, analysts said in their immediate reactions yesterday.//////Finance Minister AMA Muhith came up with an idea to ease the ever-deteriorating traffic congestion by introducing road pricing and taxing people into carpooling. //////Though the proposed budget is not highly ambitious, its implementation will be impossible due to uncertainty about funds and the government's administrative inability, the main opposition BNP said yesterday. //////The general public has little to cheer about the budgetary steps since those measures alone are unlikely to relieve them of higher prices of essentials. //////The government targets to contain inflation at 7.5 percent in the forthcoming fiscal year, heartened by this year's bumper food production, falling commodity prices on the global market and promises of higher foreign exchange supply.//////The government has proposed to set the foreign assistance target at Tk 26,442 crore in the upcoming fiscal year to finance its development projects. //////The government has deferred its target time for attaining food autarky from 2012 to 2013 and proposed a farm subsidy outlay that seems far short of the requirement.//////Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday emphasised the need for creating a separate investigation unit to strengthen the police force. //////The troubled stockmarket will get three more incentives in the next fiscal year, in addition to the existing ones, as part the government's efforts to strengthen and stabilise the capital market.//////The High Court yesterday granted bail to 30 opposition leaders, including BNP Acting Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, in an arson case.//////The government is purchasing modern war planes and helicopters for air force and working to install an overhaul plant for war planes to modernise the force, the finance minister disclosed yesterday in parliament. //////The gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the next fiscal year has been set at 7.2 percent expecting that trade and agriculture will continue to thrive and the global economy will turn around by 2013.//////While delivering the budget speech yesterday, the finance minister gave some hope for the development in the railway sector but painted a disappointing picture on improving road communication and easing traffic congestion. //////Criminals strangled a 46-year-old woman right before her septuagenarian mother in their Topkhana residence in the capital before looting Tk 35,000 and six property deeds on Tuesday night.//////Allocation for social safety net programmes (SSNPs) has gone down by two percentage points in the proposed budget, which according to an analyst is a reflection of financing challenge for the government.//////Yet again, the government has given the money-whitening scope for influential groups. //////Speaker Abdul Hamid, Chief Justice M Mozammel Hossain and Law Minister Shafique Ahmed yesterday held a discussion on the prevailing situation caused by the derogatory remarks that High Court Justice AHM Shamsuddin Choudhury Manik made about the Speaker. //////The finance minister's budget speech yesterday showed a beacon of hope amid growing doubts about completion of the much-awaited trial of the war criminals within the present government's tenure.//////Nine firefighting parachutists were killed Wednesday as they battled a wildfire in southern Siberia, Russian media reported, citing forestry officials.//////Nasdaq said Wednesday it is setting aside $40 million to cover brokers' trading losses due to computer glitches that disrupted the launch of Facebook shares onto the market on May 18.//////Today, we are giving our comments in broad strokes on the national budget.

What was quite an unheard of phenomenon in Chittagong even after prolonged deluge not many years ago has come to beset the city with the slightest bit of downpour. And all this because of filling up of the catchment areas, unplanned growth of the city and, to top it, all, illegal construction that impedes the natural flow of rainwater, and clogging of the canals that cater to the rain runoff. While this has been the case year after year we wonder why the authorities seem not to be bothered with the public misery. //////If Poland can upset former champions Greece in the opening game of Euro 2012 on Friday it will be a victory made in Germany.//////The stop-start Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League awaits a grand finale as the star-studded Victoria Sporting Club meet the efficient Old DOHS in the title-deciding last Super League encounter at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium today. //////Pacemen Umar Gul and Mohammad Sami each took three wickets as Pakistan posted a comfortable six-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the first one-day international in Pallekele on Thursday.//////Poland get the honour of opening Euro 2012 on Friday against surprise 2004 winners Greece but it would take a major upset to see either team or co-hosts Ukraine progress as far as the July 1 final in Kiev.//////Usha Krira Chakra moved into the semifinals of the Walton Club Cup Hockey Tournament with their third straight victory after blanking Ajax SC 5-0 at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) all but confirmed Australian Richard McInnes as head coach of the National Cricket Academy. //////Flame Boys and Gregarious won their respective matches of the Citycell Premier Division Basketball League beating their respective rivals at the Dhanmondi Basketball Gymnasium.//////Title contenders Muktijoddha Sangsad joined leaders Abahani in the Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League with a 2-0 win over Sheikh Russel KC in their crucial tie at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////Maria Sharapova defeated Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 6-3, 6-3 to reach her first French Open final on Thursday, reclaiming the world number one ranking and moving one win away from a career Grand Slam.//////David Ferrer says he is ready to face the toughest challenge in world tennis -- going up against Rafael Nadal on the clay courts of Roland Garros at the French Open.//////The first day's play in the third Test between England and the West Indies at Edgbaston here on Thursday was washed out without a ball being bowled.//////Rahmatganj MFS unofficially terminated their coach Mahmudul Hasan Liton following the club's poor performance against neighbouring Farashganj SC in the Grameenphone Bangladesh Premier League.//////Ispahani Cricket Academy recorded a massive 125-run victory over Ekushey Cricket Academy in the CJKS-Urban American Under-18 T20 Cricket Tournament at the MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong yesterday.//////West Indies official Billy Doctrove has retired from umpiring after a 14-year international career, cricket's world governing body said on Thursday.//////The Czech Republic will draw on memories of impressive runs at past tournaments while Russia are looking to show their semifinal appearance in 2008 was no fluke when they clash in their Euro 2012 Group A opener in Wroclaw on Friday.//////Should Russia repeat their run of four years ago and reach the Euro semifinals that would be counted as a success said national captain and playmaker Andrei Arshavin.//////Spanish coach Manuel Preciado died of a heart attack on Thursday, just a day after he was named the new coach at relegated side Villarreal, his former side Sporting Gijon said.//////French playmaker Franck Ribery had a sense of humour failure here on Thursday when he was asked what he thought of UEFA president Michel Platini's joke that France could win the Euro 2012 title if they got off the bus.//////From testicle-biting police dogs to sonic cannons capable of inducing involuntary urination, Polish anti-hooligan squads have an array of weapons ready for potential trouble-makers at Euro 2012.//////England striker Jermain Defoe has flown home from the squad's Euro 2012 training camp in Krakow following the death of his father, the Football Association confirmed Thursday.//////Businesses yesterday opposed government plans to increase bank borrowings and double tax at source on exports for the next fiscal year. //////The government has pronounced a number of fundamental steps in the fiscal management in the upcoming budget, which might create business and taxpayer-friendly environment.

With the aim of accelerating growth, increasing investment, reducing poverty through employment generation, establishing social justice, the budget has made fiscal measures for various sectors. Bringing public finances under control has been a tough task for all governments. This year, it has been even tougher in the context of lower than projected growth of the gross domestic product, slow pace of investment, higher inflation and low development spending in fiscal 2011-12. //////Daisy Liu epitomizes China's obsession with luxury brands: her shoes are Guiseppe Zanotti, her brooch Chanel, a floral Hermes scarf is stylishly knotted over one shoulder.

No did even the fortunate incumbent prime minister, who escaped the gruesome killing as she was living abroad with her (late) professor husband. I wonder why the two-time prime minister Sheikh Hasina is not interested in implementing her late father's plan into reality. Had she implemented the plan that Bangabandhu was about to do, many of the problems would have been taken care of by themselves without extra effort.

Welcome to the crosscurrents of mutual invectives. Never before in the history of this country have so many high-profile railings roiled this nation within the space of a single week.//////The journey towards gender responsive budget (GRB) has gained momentum in recent years. A concrete evidence of government's positive intention to make the budget gender responsive is that a culture of sharing with civil society representatives has started. Sharing and exchange of opinions takes place both before and after the budget declaration. The government now regularly publishes gender budget report as a part of its budget documents. We express our thanks for that. Over the years, the number of GRB reports has increased from 4 (in 2005-06) to 10 (in 2010-11) to 20 (in 2011-12). //////No suits, ties for nine months from March to November, a government circular blurts out of the blue for the government and autonomous bodies.

If the rule sticks by you will have dumped your costly summer suits and boots away.//////After so many bilateral and multilateral summits of European leaders over the past two years on the euro, I cannot help feeling that these politicians are either a bunch of procrastinators or they do not realise that Europe is on the edge of a precipice. While they talk, eat dinner or stroll, the ship is sinking little by little. It is as if we are watching a movie in slow motion of a death foretold. No country, not even Germany will be able to avoid the consequences of the disaster. How can we avoid it?//////Well, a lot is. Words have physiognomic properties which influence perception. To Shakespeare the fragrance of a rose would remain the same even with a change of nomenclature. Suppose we called it "jhotjhotkil" or "quillkerrfiz" and ran an experiment to prove the bard's point of view the results might not tally with his assumption. In the same context take the word "gram" or "grameen." There was a time not very long ago when, for the elite, the pedigreed, the city dwellers, the higher ups, the word "grameen" stood for squalor, a perfume bereft multitude, stench of cow dung, bumpy dirt roads, helplessness and diseases. These things have not changed drastically but a few farsighted, innovative and dedicated men and women have been able to bring about visible and functional change in the stagnant situation. The Persian saying "Qatra, qatra dariya mee shawad" befits their endeavour.//////
