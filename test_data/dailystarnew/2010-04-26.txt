Although this concept is highly concerned with the third world countries, it has come from the first world. //////Really the veracity of the old saying A Picture is worth a thousand Words was proved right by the realistic picture on pg 16 of DS, 21 April. The situation shown is pitiable. No heed was apparently paid by the authorities to The Daily Star's warning some years ago that having a 60 ft funnel at the end of a 120 ft road, would further exacerbate an already serious situation. And so it has proved to be, just a few moments after being declared opened by the prime minister herself.//////Human civilization survived & flourished for the last 5,000 years, since the era of Babylonia and Egyptian Faros, however, we started destroying our mother nature since the era of industrialization in less than 100 years! Global warming, widespread pollution and depleted fossil fuel threats are looming large. The human race never faced so many challenges since their existence on earth. //////We are all the products of our own individual upbringing and experiences so it is completely natural that we will all have differences in opinions, outlooks and beliefs. The world would be a very dull place if we were all the same and it's the incredible diversity amongst people throughout the world that makes it such a fascinating place. To feel comfortable about people whom we encounter, we must understand that people with their differences are part of one human race.//////We are appalled by the news that Awami League men attacked a BNP rally in Dhaka on April 21, 2010, which left 10 people injured. The BNP organized the rally in demand of power, gas, and water, the scarcity of these has made lives of people miserable. So, this demand is not only of the BNP, it is the demand of the whole nation. //////Among all public and private jobs, BCS is considered to be the most prestigious. Hard labour and endeavour are needed to pass in each step of the BCS exams. Only a student having outstanding merit deserves to be a BCS cadre. Since BCS cadres are concerned with important activities of the government, it goes without saying that they ought to be meritorious.//////Education, a basic human right, has yet remained as a privilege mainly to the well-off city dwellers and not the far-off villagers. //////Campus violence not only ruins the academic atmosphere but also claims the lives of many promising students. Students should, therefore, always stay away from any type of violence. They also need to avoid bad companions.//////The idea of local government is old enough. Even in the Indian sub-continent, the idea was introduced long ago. There are four stages of evolution of local government in Bangladesh such as--( 1 ) Pre-British period (2 ) British period ( 3 ) Pakistan period ( 4 ) Bangladesh period. //////The contradiction could not have been starker. A former vice-chancellor of Dhaka University, in a signature campaign programme held for the unconditional release of the son of a former prime minister, urged the people present there to avoid blind praise and sycophancy. The contradiction was that he himself in the same programme said that the former PM's son is one of the shining stars of the young generation and that he is the symbol of the country's independence. (Bdnews24.com; April 21, 2010).//////Unemployment is a major concern in Bangladesh. Every year hundreds of thousands of students are graduating from colleges and universities. At present the unemployment rate of Bangladesh is 2.5 percent. Though it is one of the major responsibilities of the government to provide jobs to the young generation but the government has failed to meet the job demand of the large population. //////Religious fundamentalism mutually with ethnic conflicts and terrorism has appeared on the worldwide ground with extraordinary vigor, and commonness. The customary thought of the expression safety has turned out to be out-of-date. //////The government has decided to recruit as many as 1968 assistant teachers in the secondary level for the double-shift schools. A circular has already been published in different dailies in this regard. Regrettably, there is no post for recruiting agriculture teacher in that circular. In 1995, the then government appointed an agriculture teacher in each government school. Recently, the government has ordered opening double-shift classes in 80 schools at the district level. Now, if the agriculture teacher is not appointed in these schools, there will be an imbalanced stuffing pattern between day and morning shifts. //////Nowadays the BNP is trying to wage a movement against scarcity of electricity, water and gas. They are shamelessly tying to cash on people's plight which they themselves have created. We fail to understand under what moral authority they want to launch this movement. In their last tenure, the BNP commissioned only one 75 megawatt power generation plant which tripped more than 100 times. The BNP hardly improved the water and gas situation in the country while they were in power. They were busy in looting and plundering. They are more than 100 percent responsible for all our problems in electricity, gas and water sectors. Our memory is not that short. We remember all their misrule and plunder of state wealth.//////To ease the power crisis, the government must encourage alternate sources of energy. Solar energy can play a most important role here. It is comparatively cheap and environmentally friendly. The climate of Bangladesh is also favorable as here we have a much-prolonged summer. In Dhaka city, the equipments for utilizing solar power are not quite available to the general people. Many people don't even know about the benefits of solar electricity. Both the government and the private enterprises should look into the matter as this sector has a great prospect of growth if proper opportunities are provided.//////Thailand's embattled premier vowed to clear Bangkok's commercial heart of anti-government Red Shirt protesters as he appeared on national television Sunday in a show of unity with his army chief.//////Rock-throwing Palestinians clashed with Israeli police yesterday near a march being held by Israeli right-wingers through a tense neighbourhood of annexed Arab east Jerusalem.//////US President Barack Obama has invited President Abbas to Washington in May in a fresh bid to relaunch Middle East peace talks, a Palestinian official said yesterday.//////At least 55 people were killed and 85 wounded in fighting between the south Sudan army and Arab nomads from the western region of Darfur, a tribal chief said yesterday.//////Nearly 100,000 protesters attended a rally on Okinawa yesterday to demonstrate against a US air base in a row that is dominating Japan's national politics and souring its ties with Washington.//////Storms in the US state of Mississippi have left at least 10 people, including children, dead.//////With polls suggesting a hung parliament after the May 6 election, the leader of likely kingmakers the Liberal Democrats warned yesterday he would not prop up a weakened Prime Minister Gordon Brown.//////al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) has confirmed that two of its top leaders were killed in a joint operation by Iraqi and US forces a week ago.//////Starting smoking and addiction to it could be driven to a large degree by your genes, a trio of studies published yesterday suggested.//////Gunmen in Pakistan destroyed four tankers transporting fuel to Nato troops in neighbouring Afghanistan and killed three police officials in an exchange of fire on Saturday, police said.//////The United Nations has expressed concern at the fragile security and political scenario in Nepal that has adversely affected children in the Himalayan nation. //////Monday's unveiling of a climate bill in the US Senate has been postponed, after a row over immigration reforms.//////A passenger plane flying from Dubai to India yesterday plunged 200 feet (60 metres) after hitting air turbulence, injuring 20 people, officials from the Emirates airline said.//////Sri Lanka may scrap the state of emergency laws that gave sweeping powers to police and troops during the island's long ethnic conflict with Tamil rebels, a newly appointed minister said Sunday.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai arrives New Delhi on a two-day visit, his Foreign Minister Zalmay Rassoul reached the Indian capital yesterday on a daylong trip for talks that are expected to see India airing its concerns over a proposal to reintegrate the Taliban in Afghanistan.//////A suicide bomber has killed four people and injured several others in an attack at a bazaar in the southern Afghan province of Zabul, officials say.//////Pakistan has asked India to hand over the lone surviving gunman of the 2008 Mumbai attacks so that it can complete its own trial of seven suspects linked to the assault, officials said yesterday.//////Authorities say more than 80 schoolgirls in northern Afghanistan have fallen ill in three cases of mass sickness over the past week.

The king is surrounded by worthless ministers who keep him in the dark about the state of the country and its citizens.//////IF democracy is about freedom of speech and right to gather, hold demonstrations and protest, then our democratically elected governments are consistently failing to adhere to this basic principle. Surprisingly, the major political parties, when they are in opposition shed crocodile tears for these basic principles and values on which democracy stands and at the same time slam the party or parties in power for their oppressive actions against the opposition on the street. And while criticising the government of the time for its undemocratic attitude, they vow to restore democracy in all its beauty once they are in power. //////THE Daily Star of April 18 carried a front-page report which said that the five-member sub-committee formed by the parliamentary committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry was going to recommend enactment of a law for setting the criteria, qualities and qualifications for appointment of the Supreme Court judges. //////THE Bhutanese capital Thimphu is all set for hosting the 16th Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), slated for April 28-29, aiming to set up a green South Asia.

This year's summit is of special significance as the regional grouping completes 25 years of its existence. //////HAVING succeeded in bringing radical change in the age-old healthcare system at home, President Barack Obama has caste his glance at international issues.
