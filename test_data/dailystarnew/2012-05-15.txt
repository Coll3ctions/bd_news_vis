This ancient grand institution was modeled after the Sassanid Imperial Library (the pre-Islamic Persian Empire, 224-651 AD), given the strong bond that Abbasid Caliphate had with the Persians, a great association which many experts believe spawned the very birth of Islamic Golden Period in the first place. It is in this House of Wisdom, for the next 4 to 5 hundred years alchemists, scientists, scholars, writers, men of letters, copyists painstakingly learned, read, wrote and translated manuscripts that were originally Farsi, Aramaic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Sankrit, Devnagari and other languages and linguistically converted them into Arabic and circulated the Arabic translated texts throughout the then Arabic speaking world. In this process many works by ancient Persian, Greek and Indian scholars like Aryabhata and Brahmagupta were translated and further researched which was also one of the tasks of the historic library. There were a couple of technical reasons why House of Wisdom was in Baghdad. For starter, it was the then capital of Islamic empire and secondly it was in Baghdad where, during this era, world's very first recorded paper mill was established which made it possible for widespread literacy in that region and by 10th century paper replaced the usage of parchment and papyrus in the Arab world. And that era was glory times for Baghdad, which was known as the world's richest city housing over a million people, not by the might of oil by the way, and a true centre for the intellectual development of that time, a great accomplishment that many modern day Arab states failed to achieve even at this day and age regardless of their immense monetary wealth and easy access to global scholarship. //////For the first time, archaeologists have uncovered shrines from the time of the early Biblical kings in the Holy Land, providing the earliest evidence of a cult, they say.//////Using the latest satellite tracking technology, conservationists from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the University of Exeter (UK), and the Government of Mexico have completed a ground-breaking study on a mysterious ocean giant: the manta ray//////If all the world's water were to form a single drop, this is how big it would be: A sphere stretching from Salt Lake City, Utah to Topeka, Kansas.
