The pains the nation has gone through since the Father of the Nation and most members of his family were cut down on 15 August 1975 have also been for it a living shame. The shame stems from the fact that for twenty-one years from 1975 to 1996, the course of justice was obstructed by the infamous indemnity ordinance protecting the assassins. The ordinance, decreed by the usurper regime of Khondokar Moshtaq in September 1975, was incorporated in the constitution through the Fifth Amendment by the Ziaur Rahman regime in 1979. Nowhere in the world has there been such an instance of a deliberate closing of all avenues to justice. And this was the shame we lived with, until the Awami League government led by Sheikh Hasina repealed the black law in 1996 and brought Bangabandhu's assassins to trial. In November 1998, Bangabandhu's assassins were condemned to death. The process unfortunately was not taken to a logical judicial conclusion. The delays, the frequent instances of judges feeling embarrassed to hear the appeals of the convicted and the clear, pathetic indifference of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government toward pursuing the case were to lead to a stalemate. Despite exhortations to reconstitute the bench by placing new judges there, the then government kept looking the other way. It could have done better.//////The frustration of the Upazila Parishad chairmen has again come to the open. Their complaints are against the Members of Parliament (MPs) and bureaucrats, whose interference, they say, has rendered them completely non-functional. So, they have urged the government to empower them financially for the sake of a strong local government.//////PARLIAMENTARY democracy is a way of life that demands of its adherents qualities like tolerance, respect for differing views and freedom for all to express their grievances and seek legitimate remedies. The raison d'etre of our war of independence was parliamentary democracy, and that commitment had been reflected in the Constitution although subsequent amendments stood in the way of smooth functioning of parliamentary democracy. Parliamentary democracy, despite the fact that it is very expensive, is the best form of governance in the contemporary world.//////BARACK Obama said that time had run out to secure a legally binding climate deal at the Copenhagen summit in December and threw his support behind plans to delay a formal pact until next year at the earliest.

We know that zoonotic infection spreads rapidly under rural conditions, especially in the developing countries. No systemic data is presently available to evaluate the socio-economic impact of diseases in general and zoonoses in particular. Although livestock is the main source of meat and milk for human consumption, human health hazards associated with these foods of animal origin have great importance from the public health point of view. Diseases like avian influenza, rabies, TB , brucellosis, tetanus , amoebiasis, cysticercosis, fascialiosis etc are found to be common as zoonotic disease in Bangladesh. Approximately 2,000 people who come into contact with rabid animals die of hydrophobia annually in Bangladesh. TB of cattle can be transmitted to man through contact with diseased animals or their products like milk or meat. Milkman and other people drinking raw milk are infected with brucellosis each year in Bangladesh. Amoebiasis is a common disease among the rural people of our country. //////The yearly ritual of wastefulness has begun and this usually lasts till March. During these 4-5 months, the privileged class (net worth 10 crore +) indulges in their annual orgy of throwing lavish parties in 3*,4*,5* hotels, clubs, resorts and convention centres. The occasion could be anything, though birthdays, engagements, weddings are still the most common by far. Receipt of a foreign award (purchased or wangled?), arrival of a 'foreign dignitary' (junior minister from Moldavia, for instance), academic degrees obtained by children in some foreign university, etc, are also some of the fit excuses for the parties.//////Our Economic & Administrative activities and infrastructural developments are centralized in Dhaka as the Capital City.
