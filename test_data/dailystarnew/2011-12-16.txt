We were at a loss what to do. After we got on the train, a group of boys came to us with our missing bag. They told us that they noticed the bag while they were walking along the railway. They guessed that the bag was ours as they saw us leaving the place. We felt so happy and wanted to give them some money as a reward. But Ganesh, Shuzan, Mona and other boys requested us to impart them education, instead of giving them some money. They will thus learn how to read and write.

The integrity of the boys amazed us.//////The 16th of December, a red letter day in the history of our country, has come again. It was on this day that we were to snatch our independence after a bloody Liberation War for long nine months.

Among the 64 districts in the country, hardly a few cities have undergone what is known as urban development. People from all over the country come to Dhaka in search of a livelihood. To keep the city habitable, multi-sectoral coordinated move by the government in consultation with the local representatives and members of the civil society is needed. //////I think the reason developers flout building construction codes is that they do not know why should they obey the rules. Maybe they don't know why filling up of water bodies should harm the environment, for will they not, 9n the short term, earn millions of taka from those works? Who cares, what those will cost the nation in the longer term? Maybe they don't know why they should make adequate parking facilities so that traffic congestion might ease for the convenience of many. Maybe they don't know why they should stop building so many buildings at the same time? The infrastructure of Dhaka city? But then why is the is the government so fussy about such minor problems?//////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has reiterated its earlier assurance that Bangladesh would not be harmed by the 1,500 MW Tipaimukh hydroelectric project. India had said the same thing during the construction of Farakka dam. Now see how severely agricultural lands of Bangladesh are affected due to the Farkka dam. So many rivers are dead due to this dam. Bangladesh could have produced much more crops if there were no such dam. In fact, this dam turned a part of Bangladesh inro desert. According to the environmentalists, Tipaimukh and other dams planned by the Indian government will result in the death of therest of our rivers. Dams constructed by India are one of the main reasons of poverty in Bangladesh. We are grateful to India for helping us during our War of Independence. But today they are doing things which go against our welfare. This dam will not benefit the Indian people much. And not only BNP but also Indian environmentalists are against the building of this dam. Previously, India followed the ideology "people above profit," but now it follows the ideology of "profit above people". //////Through this letter I condemn the continuous attacks made by Israel against the people of Palestine. The air strikes by Israel on December 8th took three innocent lives in Gaza and injured many. The strikes also destroyed many houses. This is simply violation of human rights. But sadly enough, we are not doing anything to help them. Our Prophet(pbuh) said that the entire Muslim community is like one body. If one part of the body is hurt then it hampers the functioning of the whole body. Similarly, if a Muslim is hurt in any part of the world, it hurts the entire community.//////English medium schools allow the students to have a high standard of education. It also costs a lot to study in an English medium school and very few people of our country afford to send their children to English medium schools. After passing O/A levels, the students want to study abroad, but many families cannot afford it. So they try to get their children admitted into good public universities or medical colleges in Bangladesh. //////I was amused to read the article by G.M.Quader, on the above topic in the editorial page of The Daily Star on December 8, 2011.

After 40 years of independence, where do we stand? What are our achievements? Some of the country's leading cultural personalities talked to The Daily Star on several issues.//////Starting from December 14, a three-daylong light and sound show, titled Bangladesh-er Hridoy Hotey, was held at Shadhinata Chattar, Suhrawardy Udyan in the capital.

The surrender of the Pakistani forces to the Indo-Bangladeshi High Command at Dhaka Race Course (now Suhrawardy Uddayan) on this day in 1971 made our declaration of independence on March 26 of the same year a reality.//////Our patriotism works like the recoil of a rifle. In 1971 we had fired the shots of freedom for nine months, and ever since then have been living in its back thrust three months of a year. The number of months we didn't fight in that fateful year matches exactly with the number of months we are overwhelmed by patriotic zeal. The number of months we actually fought is exactly the number of months when that exuberance goes to sleep.//////In 1971 a nation was born out of a fierce and bloody battle for independence and even as I was a witness to that painful birth, I was myself "reborn" out of it. That deep well of sorrow also held my cup of joy. It was in enslavement that I dreamt of liberty and it was in repression that I sang my most beautiful songs of freedom. //////Dr Rohan Samarajiva, chief executive officer of LIRNEasia, a Colombo-based think-tank that works to improve the lives of the emerging Asia-Pacific people by facilitating ICT, recently visited Dhaka to participate in the e-Asia event. //////Sony Corp, set to report a $1 billion loss this year, is banking on a big slate of new software to drive sales of its new PlayStation Vita handheld games device, even as Fitch downgraded the Japanese electronics giant to a notch above junk.//////Dell believes that Bangladesh is one of the key emerging economies in Asia, and we intend to invest here for the long term, said Harjeet Rekhi, Dell's general manager for the Developing Markets Group in South Asia.//////Nokia announced the introduction of Nokia 500, an entry level touchscreen smartphone, in the local market, said a press release. //////BASIS (Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services) is going to organise a programming contest Code Warriors' Challenge for the BASIS SoftExpo 2012, which will take place on February 24-28. //////Google is rolling out a feature that lets members of its online social network automatically find themselves in photos posted by friends.//////
