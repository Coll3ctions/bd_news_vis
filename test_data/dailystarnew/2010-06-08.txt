There are many aspects that we can begin with, but let me start with a very basic ingredient science education. Day-by-day our students enrolling to science in schools are dwindling. Parents want their children to go for business studies to make good managers and accountants, but not scientists and engineers. Moreover, the best among the few students that do enroll for science go for engineering studies and medical sciences, not for basic sciences. This highly imbalanced situation is quite unhealthy for balanced growth of the country. We shall need a lot of scientists to lead our way in this century. How to come around with such a condition?//////It seems man's oldest known ancestor is in a severe identity crisis. Ardi, or Ardipithecus ramidus, a supposed ancestor of man. who was considered to be a scientific breakthrough of the Year 2009 by both Science as well as Time magazine is now subject to a new scientific scrutiny. Researchers are genuinely expressing doubts about where the creature exactly came from, along with questioning whether Ardi truly belonged to the human branch of the evolutionary tree at all. Previously it was believed that the 4.4 million-year-old fossil found in Ethiopia in 1992, used to roam as a creature in the dense woodlands of Africa. But in a new article titled Comment on the Paleo-biology and Classification of Artipithecus ramidus, authored by Dr. Esteban Sarmiento, a primatologist at the Human Evolution Foundation, that was published in the latest edition of journal Science, two critical issues have been raised. The first one is, based on isotopic data from soils, plants and animals; it is now suspected that the species habitat was likely to be a more open savannah with trees rather than woods. And the second concern is more startling which states that A. ramidus is more ape-like than human. It must be mentioned here that Ardi, standing 4 feet (120 cm) tall and weighing 110 pounds (50 kg), was discovered by anthropologist Dr. Tim D. White and remains the oldest known hominid fossil. In fact Ardi is more primitive than the well-known Australopithecine skeleton, Lucy, which was also discovered in Ethiopia back in 1974. //////When plants and animals near the surface of the ocean die, they decay and gradually fall to the seafloor.
