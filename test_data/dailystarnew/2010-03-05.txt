In Zia International Airport, railway stations, bus stands, at tender submission and even in the kitchen markets. //////I am not an expert on Bangladeshi constitution but there should be a strict regulation on explaining detailed consequence of every decision being made in financial terms. So that at any point of time in the future someone can be held responsible for the decision they make. Because at the end of the day all these come down to numbers / money which does not grow on trees. As they are elected (censored) Honourable Members of Parliament perhaps they have now statutory authority to make whatever (censored) decisions they find reasonable. But we live in the era of information technology and we want precise detail of how much money is being spent in the "child play" of name changing.
