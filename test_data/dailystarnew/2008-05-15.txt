The greater parts of this district are dominated by alluvial plains with numerous stream channels. The main rivers are the Jamuna and the Karatoa. During the monsoon heavy rainfall occurs in the upstream area. Rainfall run- off from this vast area coupled with snowmelt brings a huge inflow of water with higher percentage of sediment. During the receding monsoon period, between September to October, heavy siltation takes place in the beds of the Jamuna and its tributaries. In this region the main cause of siltation is the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge. The pillars of the bridge act as a barrier against the main flow of the river and create silt in the upstream near Sirajganj. And the flood flow capacity of Jamuna decreases. Now flood causes every year.//////In Bangladesh, due to shortage of electricity, the economic units of the country are experiencing a setback.

They came to Malaysia for a weeklong trip to know about different measures of good governance. The person in front of me who was also a government official was halted in the security check due to his cabin baggage. The security personnel asked him politely to open his bag. I could see bed sheet, cups and an electronic kettle and other things with HILTON KUALA LAMPUR written on them. When the security personnel pointed out that it was prohibited to carry an electronic item on board and, secondly, the things the passenger was carrying belonged to a hotel in Malaysia, our government official had a reason which was valid to him, that he paid USD 150 per night and he could take away all the things in the hotel room. This scuffle went for about 20- 25 minutes, until he finally surrendered reluctantly the items collected from the hotel. I was thinking while boarding the plane that a responsible government official should have the common sense to understand that you cannot walk away with towels, bed sheets, etc from your hotel room. The Bangladesh government can always verify this matter with the Malaysian customs authorities as I am sure they keep record of all such events. //////Myanmar's ruling junta has tightened access to the cyclone disaster zone in the country's south, frustrating aid groups trying to bring help to survivors, reporters and aid agencies said yesterday.//////The historic Indian city of Jaipur usually draws millions of domestic and foreign tourists but is reeling after serial blasts tore through crowded markets, killing at least 63 people.//////An Arab League delegation was meeting with rival leaders in Beirut yesterday in a bid to mediate a settlement to deadly sectarian gunbattles that have driven Lebanon close to civil war.//////North Korea is expected to submit a long-awaited declaration on its nuclear programme within a few days and six-party disarmament talks may resume early next month, South Korea's foreign ministry said yesterday.//////Air force jets pounded a Tamil Tiger rebel training base deep in the jungles of northern Sri Lanka early yesterday and troops killed 11 guerrillas in other fighting, the military said.//////Four Palestinians were killed yesterday in Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip, medics said, as US President George W Bush landed in Israel on the first leg of a Middle East tour.//////Iran has arrested a total of 15 people over a deadly mosque bombing in April in the southern city of Shiraz, the intelligence minister said yesterday.//////Pro-Taliban militants beheaded a soldier in a Pakistani tribal area after accusing him of spying for US forces across the border in Afghanistan, an official said yesterday.//////Zhang Chengqiang, 50, prepares a meagre lunch for his family over a flame fuelled by bottled gas.
