The ICL fiasco is inevitable. The handling of the senior players makes no sense.

We forgot his captaincy which played the pivotal role in the World Cup. And from then the slump of the Bangladesh team is going from bad to worse.//////As usual, television channels, audio companies, cinema theatres came up with all guns blazing to entertain people on this Eid. People didn't have the chance to feel the dearth of entertainment. But the numbers of quality programmes were very few, to say the least.//////We are facing the great problem of pollution because of the large scale of industrialisation and the negligence of people. Man is the main cause of pollution nowadays. He cuts the tress and it does not rain. If there is no water there will be no crop. He cannot get fresh air to breathe, water to drink, food to eat. Moreover, due to pollution the ozone layers crack and harmful rays of the sun come down to the earth. //////Thanks to The Daily Star for one of the lead news reports about the Huji political party today. We are really concerned about the CTG's attitude towards religion based politics.

Needless to say, this clandestine activity is a matter of great concern. It is also reported that the fish is being sold in markets as a variety of Rupchanda. And the gullible people are buying the fish.//////I am a regular online reader of The Daily Star. Its online outlook & presentation is really nice. The only one thing that I feel should be added is the information regarding the regular advertisements which are published in it.

I even went to propose, among other things, to world people - a bunch of engineering possibilities associated with it: as to how to disable at source (for example) nuclear headed missiles or to disable them before firing from any place of the world at any time, all with the help of, say, identification and breaking up of relevant security codes through an integrative and synchronized anti-nuke weapon technology to be developed on a composite of cyber technology, imaging technology, robotics, remote control mechanism and servo mechanism. //////During an Iftar party hosted for the diplomats on September 26, 2008, AL Acting President Zillur Rahman claimed that withdrawal of all 'false cases' against Hasina was essential to create a congenial atmosphere for free, fair and transparent elections, and remarked that it would be impossible to move forward without making Hasina's release permanent. Mr. Rahman has however not clarified how does the holding of trial of an individual leader under the law of the land can interfere with the creation of a congenial atmosphere for free, fair and transparent elections. How can Mr. Rahman term cases against Hasina as false before the adjudication takes place? Does he have the moral or legal authority to exonerate an accused before the trial is held in a court of law? Does Mr. Rahman, himself a veteran lawyer, and his party the AL believe that all are equal in the eye of law? If so, how can he make such an unreasonable demand, that too in the presence of foreign diplomats who are supposed not to poke their nose in our internal affairs? //////Most of the dustbins in Chittagong are filled up with rubbish throughout the whole day. As a result, the air becomes stinky with the presence of filthy trash. //////The rate at which the prices of petrol/gas are increasing and the demand for these motor fuels rising should force the authorities concerned to give a second thought on the fate and future of the rickshaw, which needs no fuel but manpower to run and which provides employment to many in addition to its great environment-friendly quality! //////Physiotherapy is an internationally recognised health profession and accepted by WHO, and there are more than 70 physiotherapy colleges in India, but there is still no physiotherapy college in Bangladesh. //////Instead of reforming their parties, the AL and the BNP are busy coming up with long wish-lists, one after another. The tactics they are using these days to get their party men most of whom were involved in criminal activities released from prison and to get criminal cases against Hasina and Khaleda withdrawn, indicates that these parties haven't changed a bit. Their anti-people, anti-democracy and anti-progress nature prevails. These parties are holding our general election and our democracy hostage to their petty demands! What about our demands?//////Liton's front page headline news on September 28, about political parties' registration should never have been an issue. The EC must be firm, and draw the line somewhere, and adhere to it strictly. It now appears that the holding of election which is truly democratic is beyond them! Mixing of religion with secular political activities must be avoided at all costs. //////Despite the acid law being enforced through the Acid Control Act, 2002, the support of different NGOs and the extensive media coverage of acid violence in Bangladesh have still not been able to stop this heinous crime. The number of acid attacks has greatly decreased over the years, but the challenge ahead is the most difficult: to eradicate acid violence from the country.//////After a long time, the results of 27th BCS have been published. The circular was given in mid 2005. The PSC had to take the viva voce twice due to allegations of corruption in the examinations like question leakage in the preliminary and written test and money transaction in the viva voce. However, to finish the 27th BCS exams the government has taken about three and a half years. In this long time many candidates of the 28th BCS have already reached the edge of the age limit for government job. //////Every year we face a problem while celebrating Eid and other Muslim festivals. Majority of us follow the guidance issued from the government appointed committee but a small number of people also follow Saudi Arabia. Not only this section of people, but also some neighbouring countries of the KSA follow it, regardless of the moon being sighted or not in their own countries. Obviously, the Islamic world is divided regarding this issue.

He was the first person to take up sculpture in the independent country from the centre point of Joydevpur. A versatile individual in arts, he was not only immersed in the sculpture medium, but print making and painting were also among his favourite media of expression. He had shown outstanding evidence in both creativity and skill in each branch. Even on the day prior to his death, he was silently involved in his work. Abdur Razzaque was 73 when he passed away on October 23, 2005. He died in Jessore where he had conducted a drawing workshop. The participants were his former students. //////The nine-month general public agitation in recent times for access to electricity in the township of Kansat, Rajshahi has been unfolded by two parallel devices-- through a television journalist's conversations with the leaders of the movement, and through the traditional performing art form //////-- in the documentary //////. //////Yes, it was not there. But where was it then? Twice we went up and down the crowded road but to no avail. Sushila Nibash on 92 Aga Sadeq Road had disappeared! The beauty of a house which Golam Rabbani had thought fit enough to be included in his commendable album Dhaka from Moghul Outpost to Metropolis, the house in which my days as a young mother were spent, the house in which two of my babies were born, the house that had given us refuge, had dipped like the setting sun only never to appear again. Gradually it dawned upon me that those of us who had lived there would never see it again because it had been replaced by ugliness incarnate. In its place stood 97A to 97B Age Sadeq Road. The original majestic grandeur was replaced by common concrete bricks which resembled the heavy make up on a wrinkled face. The hideous, after a desecration of the beautiful was having the last laugh. //////While on the high seas as a captain of a merchant vessel, Ustad Azizul Islam kept his loneliness at bay and indulged in flute. His passion for this particular instrument had its beginnings in his childhood. Ultimately it became a passion for him.

They have virtually been poisoned by toxic elements in milk -- the main baby food. We get news about adulterated food almost every day in the print and electronic media. I feel that this world is unsafe for human beings. Even innocent babies are being poisoned to death! We need to contemplate on why this is happening. What is wrong with human conscience? //////Turkey's president ////// is one of his nation's most polarising figures. Western-oriented and pro-EU, his Justice and Development Party has roots in Islam and pushed to abolish the ban on headscarves in universities, provoking debate about the nature of liberalism in this secular nation. Turkey's leaders face a similar balancing act abroad, with instability over its eastern and southern borders -- and tentative allies in the West.
