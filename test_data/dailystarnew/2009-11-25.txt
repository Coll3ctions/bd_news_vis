The proposal also stipulates that the committees must be provided with any documents they ask for at any time. On balance, we at this newspaper feel that the proposal has much merit about it. And we feel that way because we think powerful, purposeful and functional parliamentary committees are one of the factors which strengthen the democratic process in a country. That is ensured through such committees stressing the need to study various issues in detail and clarifying the various aspects of a given situation through seeking information from relevant individuals. We have had occasion to observe the workings of parliamentary committees in the West, especially Britain and the United States. The precedents established by these committees abroad could serve as the foundations our parliamentary committees are based on.//////WE note with a sense of relief, as most people in the country, we believe, do that after about nine months since the BDR carnage, the government is finally able to hold a trial on it.

There have been the sepulchral silences we have enveloped ourselves in. There are the tears we have shed for those we have lost, through the laws of mortality or the predatory instincts of men. But nothing, absolutely nothing, compares with the vacuity you spot in the eyes of the widows and children of the military officers murdered in such insanity at Peelkhana earlier this year. A silence, one you cannot quite put into words, has come over Nehreen Ferdousi. She is not the Nehreen you knew only months ago, regaling people with her conversation, making her way to places where she knew people would sing good songs. And, yes, she and her husband, Colonel Mojibul Haq, always made sure that at the end of the day the soul would give of itself to melody, to poetry.//////THE heads of government of 53-member states of the Commonwealth will meet in Port of Spain, capital of Trinidad and Tobago, from November 27 to 29. //////IT is indeed heartening to note that the highest court in Bangladesh has directed the concerned executive organs to explain the reported continuance of extra-judicial killings. In a scenario where the police have been unsuccessfully struggling to transform themselves and the political class of the country is apathetic towards the need to revamp the police, the concern of the judiciary to keep the law-enforcers on the democratic track is gratifying. //////Bangladesh Under-19 team are looking not only to carry their impressive run of form into the tri-nation series in Sri Lanka but have also set a target of getting their batting in shape ahead of the World Cup.//////Opener Gautam Gambhir top-scored with 167 as India piled up a record 417-2 on the first day of the second cricket Test against Sri Lanka here on Tuesday.//////The national football team put behind their disappointment of the first practice match when they won the second game against BFF XI 2-0 at the BKSP in Savar yesterday. //////Rafael Nadal was beaten in straight sets by Robin Soderling in his opening match at the ATP World Tour Finals on Monday, the Swede repeating his shock French Open win over the Spaniard.//////Pakistan paceman Mohammad Asif celebrated his international cricket recall with three vital wickets to have New Zealand at 276-6 at stumps on the first day of the first Test here Tuesday.//////Shane Watson is fast learning that friendly fire isn't always so friendly.

The Supreme Court of Bangladesh unanimously upheld an earlier judgment that found all those 12 rogue officers of the armed forces guilty of the worst crime in the history of Bangladesh.

There is no guarantee that you can reach your destination within your desired time, but there is a guarantee that you will have to stay stuck in a gridlock of vehicles. //////The President of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh has reportedly shown clemency and released a 'convict', a son of an influential ruling party leader. This was reportedly within his clemency power.

On the way to Dahagram-Angorpota, our guide again and again reminded us not to take snap on the narrow passage known as tin bigha corridor. It is called tin bigha corridor because the total passage measures tin bigha. On zero line we got down from the bus and walked on to the corridor, a narrow passage marked by white colour on both sides of the passage. The guide warns us not to overstep the white marking. 'why?' I asked. ' That's India' he replied. I found BSF personnel standing firmly, guns in hand, eyes fixed on the corridor to notice any walker crossing the white marking. I found a BSF personnel, big camera in hand cautiously taking video of us, another one beside him was manually counting the poor, silent, timid walker passing over there. Again two or more personnel having kingly moustache and wearing half pant and tea-shirt casually sitting on chairs putting one leg on another, chewing gum or anything else and casting merciful look on the passers-by before them. Beside us the BSF personnel raising gun were patrolling their border on high speed open jeep. //////Your paper did a splendid job in highlighting corruption when the BNP misruled this country. However, you have gone totally blind to the corruption ravaging the country under the present government. //////The new Banani bridge connecting Banani and Gulshan has been a great relief for people of these two areas as well as people who come to visit this part of the city. The bridge was well managed at the beginning, but recently things have been let loose. First of all, there is no constant traffic policeman at this important bridge. Rickshaws, motorbikes even sometimes cars try to take advantage of this by coming from the opposite direction in this one-way bridge creating possibilities of accidents. Also, this bridge was rickshaw free at the beginning. Now, rickshaws have been allowed creating traffic jam. For the greater interest of Banani residents and for easing traffic jam, I will request the authorities concerned to provide traffic police in this bridge at least during commuting times for office and schools. Also, this bridge has significantly increased traffic flow at Road #11 at Banani. This road should immediately be made off-limits to rickshaws and this can also be turned into a one-way road as Kemal Ataturk Avenue runs parallel and that can be made one-way the other way around. Let's face it, it will be years before subways can be built in Dhaka. Till then, we must be smarter about traffic jam to make our city liveable, no one else will do it for us, we have to solve our problems by ourselves. This is a good time to start addressing the big problems through small steps and one step at a time. Kolkata can be a good example of how they have smartly managed their traffic by turning some key roads into one-way during peak times and reverse one-way after 1:00pm as well as turning all major roads off-limits to rickshaws and making auto-rickshaws run on selected routes only. We can start by implementing it at a few selective roads and take it on from there.//////It is heartening to read in your 16 November issue, a technology report on the success of a local IT company, TigerITBD.com, in the global market of Automatic Fingerprint Identification System, and that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation intends to work with the company for the ID solution.//////I refer to the timely comments made by former Ambassador M. Serajul Islam in his article "Civil Society and Bangladesh's foreign policy objectives, " published in The Daily Star on November 14, 2009 on 'Strategic Issues' page.//////Bangladesh Football Federation officials are now famous for sacking foreign coaches, right and left. Recently, the axe fell on Brazilian coach Dido. His fault was he did not select experienced players. He did select players whom he thought would do well in South Asian Championship. So it would have been wiser for BFF to decide Dido's fate after the SAF championship. Now we will never know, whether Dido's player selection was a good one or not. Dido did not pick some experienced players, as he had conflicts with those which were never resolved. Dido should have been more lenient toward those players given the fact that the players did apologize. Perhaps Dido was trying to build a team consisting of young players for long-term good results. We should also remember that when a great player falls out of favour because of conflict with a professional coach, that player usually does not get regular playing time and in most cases he has to move to another team. While playing for Villarreal, elegant playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme lost his starting line up playmaking duty, as then Villarreal coach Chilean Manuel Pellegrini (now Real Madrid coach) did not like Riquelme's attitude. So finally Riquelme had to go back to Boca Juniors. But it was Riquelme's brilliant playmaking ability that took Villarreal to Champions League semi-final, a feat they failed to repeat after his departure. That did not matter to coach Pellegrini. World class Dutch striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy fell out with Sir Alex Ferguson that prompted Van Nistelrooy's departure for Real Madrid. A professional European and South American coach's thought process is just like what I describe about Chilean Pellegrini and Scottish Sir Alex.//////A remote-controlled bomb exploded in eastern Afghanistan yesterday, killing six members of a family, including four children, authorities and relatives said.//////A long-awaited public inquiry into Britain's role in the Iraq war opens yesterday, with former civil servants first to appear in hearings set to climax with Tony Blair taking the stand.//////Two top Iranian officials said yesterday Tehran does not oppose sending its controversial low-enriched uranium abroad as long there is a simultaneous exchange inside the country of nuclear fuel processed by world powers.//////The US ambassador to Iraq warned yesterday against "slippage" in holding the country's general election, which has been threatened with delays due to a stalled electoral law.//////The Philippines declared a state of emergency in parts of the volatile south yesterday as anger spiralled over a savage political massacre that has left at least 46 people dead.//////China executed two people yesterday for their roles in a tainted milk powder scandal in which at least six children died and more than 300,000 became sick.//////The US will announce a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions before next month's UN climate summit, according to a White House official.//////The White House braced for a tough sell of President Barack Obama's long-awaited decision on whether to commit tens of thousands of new US forces to the stalemated war in Afghanistan, even as the president met Monday with top advisers for possibly the last major deliberations before an announcement.//////Pakistani troops killed 18 militants in a fresh offensive yesterday against insurgents blamed for a wave of recent bombings in the main north-western city of Peshawar.//////The Indian government tabled the Liberhan Report and an Action Taken Report in Parliament yesterday.

The General Assembly instructed "governments, relevant agencies, bodies, funds and programs of the United Nations system, and other international organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to organise on that day activities designed to raise public awareness of the problem of violence against women." The general assembly expressed "concern that violence against women is an obstacle to the achievement of equality, development and peace, as recognised in the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women, which recommended a set of integral measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women, and to the full implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Reiterating that, according to Article 1 of the Declaration on the CEDAW, the phrase " 'violence against women' means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life." The General Assembly decided to designate November 25 as International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. //////Recently I was timing a car trip from Gulshan to Dhanmandi.

Not surprisingly, the social hour in some circles begins at unearthly times. Perhaps corporate executives who have much at stake will begin to reschedule their office hours in the not too distant future. Then schools, colleges and shopping malls may follow. Matching time slices with road capacity and traffic jams could become the norm one day. //////
