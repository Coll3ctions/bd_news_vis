Regrettably, it is a very rare phenomenon in Bangladeshi politics. From that perspective, one cannot but appreciate the sentiments expressed the other day by two ministers about the performance of the year-old Awami League-led government in certain areas of governance. Both Motia Chowdhury, the agriculture minister, and Abdul Latif Siddiqui, the jute and textiles minister, are senior figures in the government and, therefore, what they say on the issues is naturally taken seriously. In the present instance, they have not hesitated to be critical of the activities of their party men over the past year and at the same time have been courageous enough to acknowledge the drawbacks their government has suffered from. //////A mobile court drive against environment offending industries initiated by the Department of Environment (DoE) in Tongi and Konabari has led to an eye-opening revelation. Even the industries with effluent treatment plants (ETPs) keep polluting adjoining water bodies. Just add to this the numerously mushrooming manufacturing units, and you have a dreadful picture of the magnitude of river pollution through untreated chemical wastes.//////THERE are just wars and there are wars based on duplicity. There are the wars you wage in defence of a human cause and there are the wars you impose on others because of the ego and the arrogance in you. All that ego and all that arrogance leads up to lies. And wars pursued through lies end up leaving tens of thousands, even millions, dead. //////THE Copenhagen climate change conference generated much heat across the world but the outcome has disappointed many because there was no legally binding agreement to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2020 or 2050.//////THE basis of democracy is not maximum consensus. It is the tenuous middle ground between imposed uniformity and implacable hostility. In the process of the genesis of democracy, consensus enters at least at two points: (a) a sense of community that is above mere opinion and mere agreement, and (b) there must be a conscious adoption of democratic rules which enlarge step-by-step the area of consensus as democracy moves down its crowded agenda. //////There has been uncertainty over the fitness of Mashrafe Bin Mortaza but the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has still retained the pace spearhead as captain for the upcoming tri-nation one-day series involving India, Sri Lanka and hosts Bangladesh. //////With the tri-nation series involving India and Sri Lanka knocking on the door, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been facing a problem with Nimbus Sports International Ltd, which holds the worldwide marketing agency rights.//////Sachin Tendulkar hit a solid 96 not out to power India to an emphatic seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the third one-day international here on Monday.//////India batsman Yuvraj Singh has been ruled out of the ongoing one-day international series against Sri Lanka because of a finger injury.

It is the first month of the Islamic calendar. Unlike other calendars the Islamic year starts not with celebrations but with prayers and sermons remembering the martyrs of Karbala. Karabala in Iraq was the place where the followers of Islam, very small in number, in 61 Hijri/680 A.D., led by Hazrat Imam Hussain (AS), the grandson of the Prophet of Islam Hazrat Muhammad (Pbuh), confronted Yazid's force which was opposed to the Islamic teachings. His army was huge in number, well-equipped soldiers, cavalries and archers, personifying evil and tyranny, gathered on the banks of River Euphrates. But the Imam's handful of men were not deterred. On 10 Muharram the decisive battle took place and these brave men, one by one, laid down their lives bravely and boldly embracing martyrdom. Their sacrifice was to uphold and protect Islam from the inimical and perverse force which was contriving against it, bent upon distorting and obfuscating the teachings of Islam and replacing it with their brand of teachings which served their personal interests and solidified kingship and dynasty rule. //////Still now, many children have no access to education. There are more than 18 million children of primary school age (6-10 years) in Bangladesh out of a total population of 137 million. Almost half of them are girls. //////When I look back to this day of victory in 1971 (16 December 1971), it flashes before my eyes hundreds of freedom fighters entering Dhaka City with arms up in their hands and Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu in their thunderous voices. But the slogan that contributed to the birth of this nation was let to sink into oblivion only after four years of our victory.//////Deforestation is now an issue of major concern. Deforestation has become so indiscriminate that it will not be surprising if Bangladesh turns into a desert very soon. It is like cutting the branch of a tree on which we are sitting. This is happening when everybody is worried about climate change and we know deforestation is one of the reasons behind further warming of climate. //////Nine illegal brickfields have been set up in and around Gopalganj municipality and these are producing bricks by using firewood. These brickfields are violating the rules and regulations and have been set up on government Khas land.//////South Asia is the worst victim of insurgency. Every day lots of human causalities take place in this sub-continent where the value of life is hardly considered. Recently, the suicide squads blew up a school in Pakistan resulting in the massacre of innocent students. Sometimes without any reason, the suicide bombers detonate bombs. //////The prime minister has indicated that the closed jute mills might be reopened when Sramik League stalwarts called on her on the occasion of foundation day of the Sramik League. Similar declaration of opening of closed mills was given by the industries minister, just after taking charge of the ministry. Unfortunately, nothing tangible could be perceived till date regarding restart of Chittagong Steel Mills, though this lone mill in the steel sector was closed between 1996-2001 and the industries minister of the present government hails from Chittagong. It is needless to describe the importance of steel, and reopening the lone steel mills should be a priority for the government, I believe. //////Quite a few people manage to occupy a permanent position in the hearts of the people by virtue of their good deeds. My father Late Md Nabiruzzaman was one of them. His life is an instance of plain-living and high-thinking.//////Every day a large number of people go to Dhaka city markets to buy essential food items to meet their household needs. Invariably, each shopkeeper gives less quantity for each purchase to every buyer. Hence, for every purchase the buyer is cheated at least by 100 grams or more.//////December 29, 2008 was a great victory day for the AL and the people. The majority of people supported the AL. As a first time voter, I also dreamt of a better life. But it is to be remembered that a huge number of people are unemployed. They have no job. So, the government should recruit every unemployed capable person as pledged by the ruling party's election manifesto. It is difficult to give everyone a job, but not impossible. //////A few years back a good transport system was seen in the streets connecting all most all the corners of the city. Buses like Premium, Nirapad & Volvo along with other buses used to serve to the satisfaction of the commuters. But to our utter surprise, Premium & Nirapad buses discontinued & the last blow for the people came from withdrawal of Volvo buses to Uttara point. More & more comfortable buses have to be put into service. Yes, the authorities should do it on a priority basis to mitigate the present intolerable sufferings of the people.//////On 6 December, I was shocked to see a picture in your newspaper, showing how a mother with her child were crossing the road near a speeding CNG auto-rickshaw. That time they were on the Zebra Crossing. There are thousands of school going children who attempt to cross the road in a most hazardous situation. Children are our national assets. If we cannot give them safety and provide congenial atmosphere, how do we expect to leave good citizens for future? The developed and many other underdeveloped countries strictly follow the traffic rules, especially for children. It is most unfortunate that there is no such law in this country for children where they are exposed to traffic hazards. //////About 60% people of Dhaka city live in rented houses. Most of them are service holders whose monthly income is very limited. More than half their salary is given as house rent. With the rest they manage somehow their domestic affairs. But the house-owners increase the house rents once or twice a year without any genuine reason. As a result, the people with fixed income suffer. //////Dr. Roy's informative and very appropriate write-up, published in your Science & Life page on 8th.December; should be followed up vigorously at the farming level; mobilising all resources of the government, so that it is put into practice as early as possible. All methods of publicising this technique should be mobilised in all our audiovisual media.//////It is well known to all of us that The Sundarbans is the leading mangrove forest in the planet. The term Sundarbans can be literally translated as : Beautiful forest. There is a myth that the name might have originated from the Sundari trees that are available in Sundarbans in great numbers. On the other hand, it has been anticipated that the name is a corruption of Samudraban ("Sea Forest") or Chandra-bandhe (name of an ancient ethnic group). However, the commonly established analysis is the one connected with Sundari trees.//////The condition of the road at Savar is deteriorating day by day. Road accident is very common in this city. Traffic police have no control at all. Often the vehicles run on the wrong side at good speed. It is unimaginable that even the buses too run in the wrong side. How long can it continue? The situation of Savar Bazar is horrible. Rickshaw-puller to car driver, nobody pays any heed to traffic rules. Though every day a huge number of people go to Dhaka, yet there is no bus-stand. The situation worsens in the rainy season. While entering into the bus, people often try to defeat each other. Can't the bus operators form a queue? Because of CRP, a huge number of foreigners come to Savar. Their experience on the road is not good at all. //////Most people of Dhaka city move by bus, rickshaw, CNG auto-rickshaw and taxicab. But it is painful that like other people women, patients and aged are being harassed by the drivers of the above mentioned vehicles. The drivers demand exorbitant fares from the commuters. //////Our dearest Prophet Muhammad (SM) says, ''Each task of believers depends on their intention. One will, therefore, get a result of work according to one's intention.'' It implies that if a person does a work with a good intention, s/he will get the result accordingly, and vice versa. So, all of us should do any work with good intention.//////A suicide bomber yesterday attacked a Pakistan journalists' club, killing three people in the first assault on media offices blamed on Islamist militants in the troubled country.//////China dismissed yesterday a British editorial accusing it of "hijacking" the UN-sponsored climate talks in Copenhagen as baseless and politically motivated.//////Indian security forces say they have foiled an attempt by militants to infiltrate the international border in Indian-administered Kashmir.//////Documents revealed last week that appear to show Tehran is working on a nuclear bomb trigger were "forged" by Washington, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has told a US news network.//////The Sri Lankan government says the UN has asked it to explain allegations that Tamil Tiger rebel leaders were executed as they tried to surrender.//////Three years after the end of Nepal's civil war, the Himalayan nation is in a state of political paralysis reflected in the blocked streets of the capital and empty parliament this week.//////If talks with Myanmar over democratic reforms fail, the Obama administration could tie up large amounts of money that the country's ruling generals stash in international banks from the sale of natural gas.//////Pepsico chief executive Indira Nooyi inevitably tops the list of what Forbes calls "Eight Indian-Flavoured CEOs" who lead US corporations with revenues of at least $2 billion as the premier business magazine chronicles the rise of Indians in corporate ranks in America.//////The US has passed a law that denies financial aid to the Nepal government, amid stepped up pressure on the country's army to fulfil its human rights obligations, a news report has said.//////Egypt's antiquities chief said he will formally demand the return of the 3,300-year-old bust of Queen Nefertiti from a Berlin museum after confirming it was sneaked out of Cairo through fraudulent documents.//////Expressing confidence on getting an absolute majority in the Jharkhand Assembly polls, the BJP yesterday said that 'nobody is untouchable' as it would not rule out the possibility of looking for allies if it fails to get majority in the results tomorrow.//////Special US forces have reportedly carried out multiple secret raids on the al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions along the Afghan border, a former Nato officials has disclosed.//////Men claiming to be al-Qaeda members have vowed to avenge those killed in a Yemeni air strike on one of the group's training camps in southern Yemen, Al-Jazeera television reported yesterday.//////Eurostar resumed its high-speed rail service linking Britain, France and Belgium yesterday after a three-day suspension that stranded tens of thousands of travellers during the holiday season and left French President Nicolas Sarkozy indignant.//////Ethnic Uighur asylum-seekers forcibly repatriated over the weekend had warned the UN refugee agency they feared long jail terms or even the death penalty if they were sent back to China, according to statements seen by The Associated Press.//////Six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear disarmament must resume soon if they are to be revived at all; South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-Hwan was quoted yesterday.//////Police say 14-year-old sailor Laura Dekker has arrived back in the Netherlands after disappearing from home and flying to the Caribbean.//////The world has "betrayed" civilians in the Gaza Strip by failing to end a blockade of the Hamas-run enclave, 16 rights groups, including Amnesty International and Oxfam, said yesterday.//////A Somali just home from eight years in the US jail at Guantanamo Bay told AFP the prison was "hell on Earth", and alleged torture there had scarred some of his fellow inmates.//////A New Zealand court convicted two farmers on an animal cruelty charge yesterday for impaling a live cow with a tractor's fork.//////The latest instalment of Bengal Foundation's monthly musical soiree 'Pran-er Khela' was held at Bengal Gallery in Dhanmondi on December 21.
