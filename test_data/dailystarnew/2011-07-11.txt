Ultimately, the sea level will rise. In fact, in Bangladesh, there could be more frequent floods and it is predicted that a part of the country will go under water if the sea level rises by 1 metre. Evaporation rates will also increase. The amount of rain may be affected as a result. The changes in temperature and rainfall patterns may in turn cause extreme weather changes which will abruptly affect vegetation. The world is already experiencing these changes. Unfortunately, we cannot stop these but we can try to slow down or prevent further changes. Action has to be taken now before it's too late. Our government can take steps to prepare for a warmer earth. This involves limiting construction along low-lying coastal areas, building dykes to protect the coastal areas from flooding, developing new crop varieties which can grow in drier conditions, protecting wildlife and improving water storage to continue farming in drought condition. With joint efforts, we will surely make progress and efficiently combat climate change. //////The cruelty on Rumana Manzur occurred when I was struggling to educate my contacts (especially males) that women are being mistreated everywhere. Most of the males turn a blind eye to this, and ask for evidence. Even in universities, I come across young men who either feel threatened by accomplished women, or underestimate the potential of women. The most shocking part is that the perpetrator is a student of BUET. What are educational institutions doing to prevent students from becoming cold-blooded murderers? The criminal should be given capital punishment to deter others, and educational institutions should make it obligatory for students to take a Moral Science course. Every woman should speak up against domestic violence to discourage bearing abuse in silence. We must join hands with Mr. Ban Ki Moon, who has embarked on a Ring the Bell campaign, which urges everyone to intervene during domestic disputes.//////There's not enough open space in the city to run and play.

We know that a few days back Shinawatra's party Puea Thai won 265 seats in the 500-seat parliament, yet Yingluck, who will be Thailand's first female prime minister, wants to form the coalition fearing re-ignition of political crisis. We have also learnt from the news reports that the women's organisations and Thai feminists are already publicizing Yingluck's victory as her famous brother's political proxy that can not be seen as a milestone for women's right. The political analysts guess that the political novice Yingluck, who has never held political office, is going to face the challenge to dispel the climate of mutual suspicion among differing political strips.//////This is quite contradictory for the government to have imposed a VAT of 15% on internet usage against its avowed stand for a 'Digital Bangladesh' vision.
