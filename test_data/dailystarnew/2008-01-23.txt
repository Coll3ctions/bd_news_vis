Consumer analysis identifies needs of a product created by a complex interaction of physiological, sociological and psychological motives.

Age and sex of consumers are two other common segmenting variables. Another variable is income level. Yet another market differentiation is between domestic and import consumers. Market segmentation identifies potential consumers and limits the agro-industrial project's options. Thus, it is necessary to select a segment based on competitive environment and the strengths and weaknesses of the company.//////Soon after confirmation of the inter-club players transfer's new
