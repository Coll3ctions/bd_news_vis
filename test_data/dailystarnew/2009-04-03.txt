We saw a devastating fire in BSEC Bhaban in 2007 and now the fire at Bashundhara City has once again exposed our weakness in fighting a big fire. //////We have started to adopt a new culture in the corporate world in most organisations and institutions. A common practice is often seen that we have a tendency to stay late in the office, only to display sincerity, loyalty and commitment that spells out work within 9 to 5 is not adequate, I need more time for my workload. I once had an occasion to work with a British consultant who mentioned that office timings have been fixed within adequate space and time to complete a day's work, if you are unable to complete your work, it proves you are inefficient.

They seem to have become more emboldened after the massive crackdown by the last CTG on corruption. //////Tahmina Khan Dolly, the first woman ambassador of Bangladesh to Sri Lanka, is suffering from amnesia and passing her days in the care of some doctors in a local private hospital away from media attention. Mrs. Khan does not need any financial assistance but needs attention of her party members, as she has dedicated most of her life to the party. She was made an ambassador by President Ziaur Rahman for her hard work, efficiency and competency. She was involved in politics wholeheartedly and was a very dedicated party member even after the death of Ziaur Rahman. Mrs. Khan's contribution to the BNP is invaluable without any doubt. //////Once again some economists and political experts have started talking about a possible meeting between the two top leaders of the country.

It is also the fastest growing component, recording an average growth rate of 21.5% since 2000 and accounting for about 12% of GDP in 2008/09.
