Even a government agency like the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) itself has been found to violate court order by erecting business establishments in the filled parts of Buriganga river at Sadarghat in the city. It has even built a jetty by filling up Shitalakhya River at Kanchpur in violation of High Court Order of June 25, 2009 to demolish all such structures. Do these instances not open the door for the vested quarters to go ahead with illegal grabbing with impunity? And what worries us further is that even if in certain cases where the Wetland and Open Spaces Conservation Act, 2000, has been enforced to bring the violators to justice, they evaded punishment through legal loopholes. That leaves one wondering, if the violators of the river protection law are more powerful than the government and the court?//////What the Rapid Action Battalion has done to the young Limon Hossain of Jhalakati district is a clear outrage. The young man, aged sixteen, has had one of his legs amputated because some trigger-happy member of the force shot him at close range on the unsubstantiated charge that he is a member of a terrorist gang. The truth, as has since become known, is that the RAB personnel accosted Limon as he stepped out of his home to collect his family cattle, asked him about an individual they were looking for and then shot him the moment he answered in the negative. The young man, who was looking forward to taking part at the HSC examinations the next day, then bled for three hours before being taken all the way to Dhaka. By then, his leg had become useless. //////Australia were served a perfectly enjoyable buffet in their only practice game at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium yesterday with paceman John Hastings grabbing

the sky, it has been replaced by an ash colour and the smog, created by emissions from vehicles, factories, generators and many other sources, has blanketed the city sky. We are unable to see the star studded night sky; the pollution filled atmosphere has taken it from us.//////The sprawling urbanisation in and around Dhaka city is moving at such a pace that very soon it is going to absorb the city's empty spaces as well as the greenbelts. It is also bereft of basic amenities such as playgrounds, parks, walkways. Gas, electricity and water crisis is also mounting. It is also alarming to read that the experts have predicted that around 70,000 buildings in Dhaka city alone are vulnerable to high velocity typhoon or cyclone, let alone an earthquake. They opined that most of the builders have filled the ditches, canals and low lying lands and started construction without conducting proper soil test which is an important criterion for construction of a building. It was also seen in the past that due to poor construction many buildings either collapsed or tilted. RAJUK must ensure that proper roads are being constructed in order to provide access to the rescue team in case a building caves in. It is also alleged that the builders get their plan passed in connivance with a section of corrupt RAJUK officials flouting the established building code. We strongly urge the concerned authorities to take stern measures against all these malpractices.//////Now that the World Cup Cricket - 2011 is over, it is time to analyse both our strengths and weaknesses and prepare to be a more competent for the upcoming cricket events. There are more things to be optimistic than to be frustrated about. The interesting thing is, Bangladesh do play really well sometimes. And at times their performance is very disappointing. But that's not the point. The point is that Bangladesh is an amazing "Game Changer". It has been proved in this world cup and no matter how some commentators of neighbouring countries want to portray, our victory against England was no "accident". It is not possible for every team to turn the game from a losing position, while Bangladesh pulled it off against England and proved that if we try we can also change the game. What we need is persistence, focus, determination, commitment and practice.//////There has been lots of hue and cry over the decision of the present government to set up a new airport away from Dhaka. As citizen of a least developed country I consider that the very thought of building a new airport and abandoning the present one is nothing but a unwise idea when the basic infrastructure of the country is yet to be fully developed. //////If I am not mistaken, WASA was set up with the idea of providing potable water to urban areas of Dhaka, and making water easily available, and also to ensure clean and hygienic sanitation and sewage disposal. All these facilities were installed at huge cost to the taxpayers; but what is the result today? WASA's water supply could not meet the demand, and now it has become a water rationing authority; a function that it enjoys, exercising power and authority by throttling water supply! About sewerage, the less said the better! Today, WASA stands for: "Water Available? Sometimes Available!" That sometimes will soon dwindle down to two hours out of twenty four in a day!//////It was nobody but Dr. Yunus who effectively came up with the idea of micro-credit, which indeed came to impoverished people as a blessing and a new hope. Most of the people in Bangladesh live below the poverty line. Dr Yunus' Grameen Bank has always been beside the poverty-stricken people especially in time of their crucial need. It not only enables poor people to manage their daily meals to survive, but also helps the incapable people get proper education. If I am not mistaken, there is not a single government bank that renders student loans to help poor students get education. Now BB is after the Nobel laureate for his constructive initiatives to eradicate poverty and hunger from this country!//////It is high time to review our political approach and philosophy. The young generation looks to the future but dynasty rulers look into the past. There is huge communication gap between the rulers and the ruled. The politicians ignore the majority of the voters who live in the rural areas. Our farmers keep us alive in this fertile land but enjoy no social status. //////As many as 500,000 protesters marched in London on Saturday to protest Britain's deepest cuts in public spending since World War II.

Meanwhile, in the United States protesters gathered in 40 cities on Saturday to oppose tax cuts for the wealthy amid budget cuts in public services.//////I am a freedom fighter's son. My father fought under sector 8. In Bangladesh all parties say that they are ready to serve the freedom fighters. The govt. reserved 30% job quota for their children and most recently even for their grandchildren. But practically, no govt. departments or private organisations maintain this quota system. On the other hand, general students claim that they cannot get jobs because of the quota system.//////More than ten million people depend on water supplied by Dhaka WASA. WASA's Sayedabad water treatment plant has been supplying contaminated water for long. We urge the ministry concerned to do something urgent in this regard.//////Triclosan is a chemical used in cosmetics and in many common household products including toothpastes, deodorants, etc. Because of its antibacterial properties triclosan is also used as an active ingredient in many anti-microbial creams and lotions. But it has been revealed through research that triclosan, a cholorophenol can combine with chlorine in tap water to form chloroform gas that can cause human cancer. The United States and the United Kingdom have classified triclosan as a probable human carcinogen. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has listed triclosan as a pesticide.//////We bring to your kind notice that most of the letters we receive still contain more than 150 words, which makes it difficult for us to edit and publish.
