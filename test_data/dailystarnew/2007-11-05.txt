He was a distinguished Pakistani jurist and is remembered for his opposition to the dictatorship of General Ayub Khan. As a judge and then the chief justice, his speeches at various forums were widely covered by the national press because of the rare combination of intellect, wit, courage and integrity he personified. His characteristic brand of humour and caustic, witty remarks did not even spare the presidents. //////Much has been written recently in the press in Bangladesh about the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
