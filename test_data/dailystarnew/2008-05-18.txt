When it came to importing goods it seemed anything was possible as long as the importer could avoid paying duties and tax. For years the country's prime port Chittagong became a symbol of corruption and inefficiency, crippling honest businesses, holding back the economy and depriving the government of thousands of crore taka a year. This was no small time scam, but a criminal empire involving businessmen, government officials and the very institutions, Customs and the National Board of Revenue, that were supposed to spot the wrong doing. //////At least three people were killed and 220 others injured yesterday as storms lashed different parts of the country damaging over 2,000 houses.//////Anwar Choudhury left Dhaka yesterday ending his four-year stint as British high commissioner to Bangladesh.//////Several hundreds students of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman hall of Rajshahi University ransacked the hall provost Jahangir Kabir's office late Friday night and set fire on furniture, demanding Kabir's removal from office.//////China ramped up efforts yesterday to stave off disease for millions of earthquake victims, as more miracle rescues amid the rubble offered hope in an increasingly desperate battle to save lives.//////The special court will give its order today whether charges will be framed against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and seven others in the barge-mounted power plant graft case.//////The Supreme Court (SC) for the first time in its history is going to publish its annual report for the year of 2007.//////Two people died and two others were injured as they jumped from a moving train at Sadar Rasulpur on Dhaka-Chittagong route yesterday morning.//////Sri Lankan air force jets bombed an air strip used by Tamil Tiger rebels, while 16 insurgents were killed in ground clashes in the north, the military said yesterday.//////The Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment in a clarification of a report published in The Daily Star said the trend of migration of semi-skilled and skilled workers has been positive over the period of successive years in number. //////THE incredibly disturbing manner in which four prisoners managed to make good their escape from Chuadanga jail on Thursday night inevitably brings up the question of the state of prison security. To be sure, it can easily be argued, and for good reason, that the prevailing electricity crisis in the country was a contributory factor in the escape by the four men, all of whom have the bad reputation of being feared outlaws. What cannot be overlooked, though, is the sheer incompetence and lack of alertness on the part of the jail authorities here. It is on this issue that the authorities, especially those responsible for jail administration, must now focus. If prisoners can escape so easily, and that too from a secure jail as Chuadanga's, one can legitimately raise the issue of the lapses that might lead to similar incidents in other prisons around the country.//////SPEAKING in front of the Knesset on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the birth of Israel, US President George W.

The state and influential people are frequently evicting indigenous people from their lands through falsification of land documents, forcible occupation, fake court cases, and falsification during registration, and eviction from the Khas land in the name of eco-tourism park and social forestry. Surprisingly, most of the eco-parks like as Modhupur eco-park, Gajani Abkas, Alutila, Modhutila and Muroichori eco-park have been established in indigenous people concentrated areas. Moreover, the social forestry project of government has started encroaching traditional lands of indigenous people. The existence of indigenous people and their enriched culture, languages, traditional heritages, their own social values and spirituality and the total ways of life cannot be sustained without the entitlement and rights on land. These days the process of evicting indigenous people from their lands is continuing in the name of exploring oil, gas, coal and mineral resources, construction of dam, eco-tourism park as well as through forcible illegal occupation by the state and the land grabbers all around the country. //////The unexpected doubling of the price of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) had a ripple effect. It has increased the fares of CNG-run auto-rickshaws and cabs, which has consequently brought much suffering to the common commuters. Suddenly, commuting has become a lot more expensive. For a long period of time people who travelled by CNG-run three wheelers and cabs had suffered due to the drivers' indiscreet demand of additional fares. Moreover, most of these auto-rickshaws and cabs are too choosy in terms of destination and are reluctant to go to certain places in the city. Although, there are meter-readers in every cab and precise laws regarding its operation, often the helpless passengers are left with no choice but to pay an additional 10-20 taka (occasionally double the actual fare), if they want to reach their destination in time. The scarcity of CNG-run three wheelers and taxis makes matters even worse. Only a poor commuter who regularly travels by auto-rickshaws actually knows how difficult it is to get an auto-rickshaw at the peak hour that will take him to his preferred destination at a fair fare! And it seems the authorities had never taken effective measures to stop these irregularities, which inevitably caused much distress to the general public. We hope, now the situation will improve. Since, we will have to pay an incredible sum to commute we will be protected from such unwanted harassments and more well organised supervision by the government will be ensured for the sake of the general masses. As a citizen, I can offer the following suggestions: //////In Dhaka's fruit market the price of watermelon is not reasonable, despite the bumper production this season. //////I reluctantly agree with some points that Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman has put forward about Tagore and his grandfather, Prince Dwarakanath Tagore. He was welcomed by Queen Victoria and King Louis because they had to keep the interest of the empire in mind. Indeed, he met many writers too including Charles Dickens in parties organised and paid for by Dwarakanath Tagore. But what Dickens thought of him Justice Rahman did not fully elaborate. Dickens called him the Oriental Croesus (who was king of Lydia until he was defeated by the Persians about 547 BC). I do not know if Dickens honoured Dwarakanath calling him Oriental Croesus.//////As a Bangladeshi, I wonder why some of us feel shy to call ourselves Bengalees; even on informal occasions. Bangladeshi is a new political label which had to be introduced (for formality) some three decades ago. We have the largest Bengali population in the world, and we are proud that the land of the Bengalees is called Bangladesh.//////I agree with Mr. Huda. Let the newly reorganised EC , ACC , PSC & independent Judiciary work for a while to take deep roots - which are preconditions for the success of democracy. Let the rule of law continue for a while.

We have to be ready to make whatever sacrifice is needed. //////Dhaka is perhaps the most ill planned, mismanaged, problematic, crowded, congested and dirtiest capital city in the world.//////I got the shock of my life at Zia International Airport the other day when I was told to pay Tk 200/- as entry fee just to get inside the visitors concourse area in the arrival hall of the terminal building. I also came to know that the fee had been doubled with effect from 1st April, 2008. Is this justified? Passengers' relatives / friends reach airport after a great deal of hassle and then if they are made to pay so much just to receive their near and dear ones, how do they feel about it? Has the CAAB ever thought of their feelings? Is this the way the CAAB should earn money from the general public, when they are earning millions by renting premises, charging landing fees etc and imposing many other taxes under so many headings, paid by the airlines, passengers and various other agencies? After all, the airport belongs to the people of a free democratic country. Why should the people be fleeced ? Doesn't it require an approval of the ministry?//////As a regular reader of your daily, I have gone through the articles of Mr. Dhiraj Kumar Nath, former adviser of the caretaker government under the caption "Upazila Parishad, way to go out" and "Gram Sarkar and Local Government Election" published in your daily a few days ago with substantial information projected by Mr. Nath on the problems.//////In a decent society, physicians do not advertise in the mass media showing their names, professional degrees and subject of specialities.
