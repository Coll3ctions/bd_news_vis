After twenty-three years of its existence, it is justifiable for the people to look up to the leaders to implement policies that would remove wide-scale poverty and ensure social, economic and food security of the present generation and that of the future ones.

Consequently, the first few months after the recent elections in Pakistan, the continuing terrorist acts within that country and the inability of the government to usher in a new dawn in Pakistani politics have been a source of disappointment.//////IN two different countries, at two different places, different peoples have met to discuss their age-old problems and find a collective solution.

Therefore, it is no more any fashion rather an imperative to call for effective measures for combating climate change. Of late, the government has given an announcement to create a fund for the purpose amounting to estimated three billion taka in the current fiscal year, which will be allocated to various adaptation and mitigation strategies against already set paradigm of bad consequences from the climate change such as losses from frequent cyclones in the south, drought in the northern region and decreasing agriculture productivity with recurring food.//////ENVIRONMENTAL disasters from climate change and destruction of ecosystems will create a surge of refugees -- 'envirogees' -- across the planet . //////Jamshed Choudhury said to his son, "Tipu, go at a run to Tarafdar and tell him to come over.

"Tell him 'I don't know.'"//////As soon as Tipu left he called out to Jhunu. "Are you going to the academy today?" Jhunu said, "Today we have our examinations." "So what?

Don't you know I'm saying it for their own good?" Mariam said, "Just because you're afraid because God knows whose corpse is lying outside, you've started this ruckus!

"Everybody knows we're not into anything fishy. Because of you Tipu doesn't even leave the house. And you've made the girl huddle inside the house all day."//////It was 2:00 on the afternoon of 21 July when I got a phone call. It was Dr. Tapan Baghchi from Ekushey Television. He told me that Mahmudul Haque had died, mentioning that the writer was on my website. Later I made a text on the sad demise and began sending it. Since the death had occurred around 2.30 in the morning newspapers were unable to cover the news that day. I received calls asking who this Mahmudul Haque was. While mentioning ////// was helpful to some, I kept wondering: How could people not know Mahmudul Haque, somebody who wrote novels such as ////// and ////// Since his death many of his writer-friends are writing in the nation's dailies about Haque's popular presence among them. But was it really so? I do not know and never wanted to know.//////The Daily Star invites submissions to its forthcoming Eid special issue of both fiction and nonfiction pieces.

Bangladesh, which has hardly any other natural resources besides gas, have no alternative than to maximize the resources of the sea.

India and Myanmar unilaterally ignored Bangladesh's claim of maritime boundary and EEZ announced in 1974, and we continued to watch this grabbing of sea areas without doing anything mentionable. //////THE world at large has just finished presiding over the killing of tens of thousands of innocent human beings in Iraq with a mute disdain for its perpetrators. What a shame! One wonders how could we, the members of the so-called civil society, remain at a safe distance when the relics of civilization were being desecrated by the enemies of history. We have heard that when Rome was burning, Nero was playing his fiddle. The neo-Neros of today have been seen on the TV protecting with precision the plunderers of evidences of history. One really shudders at the thought of finding answers to the charges that the progeny would level against us for depriving them of the proof of their 'proud' past. We may therefore have to garnish the leftover garbage to paint a picture that may somehow enable future generations to draw the cue about how their current life and culture came to be.//////NORTH Korea demolished the 20m tall cooling towers at its main Yongbyon nuclear reactor on 27 June and published a long-awaited report on its nuclear program signalling its willingness to begin a nuclear disarmament program.//////
