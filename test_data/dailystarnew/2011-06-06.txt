With the country now home to only 10 per cent of forests where the global required standard is 25 per cent, it is time to ask why we have consistently failed to roll back the damage systematically being done to our environment. Part of the answer comes from reports of a blatant, illegal felling of trees in what is officially known as the Sakhipur reserve forests in the Madhupur region. Over the last two and a half years, no fewer than 52 sawmills have been set up illegally, and with the full knowledge of the authorities, in the area. That is a shame. The bigger shame, though, is that the Department of Forests seems powerless to do anything about it since ruling party people are allegedly involved in the illegal business.//////Rafael Nadal won a 10th Grand Slam crown and equalled Bjorn Borg's record of six French Open titles when he defeated Roger Federer //////Though good judgment has finally dawned on the Bangladesh Cricket Board high-ups regarding discretion during negotiations with coaches, it has been learned that they are zeroing in on one particular name.//////Holders Bangladesh Biman were declared the champions in the men's section of Auto Museum First Division Badminton League after Knit Concern Badminton Club refused to play in the virtual final match following a revised decision by the umpire at the Wooden Floor Stadium yesterday.//////England finally saw the back of Tillakaratne Dilshan at Lord's but not before the Sri Lanka captain had made 193 in the second Test here on Sunday.//////The Worcestershire-Durham Friends Life t20 game at the New Road ground has been called off due to incessant rain.//////Former South African paceman Allan Donald rejected an offer to become New Zealand's bowling coach Sunday to pursue a job in his homeland, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said.//////Bangladesh Ansar established their dominance in the Ashiyan City 27th National Age-Group Swimming Championships edging the defending champions by 10 gold as the curtains were drawn at the at the National Swimming Complex yesterday.

The headline news (The Daily Star; 31-05-2011) indicated that the government's emphasis is to serve our poor; satisfactorily! This is ambitious because several new agenda have been included. These are: i) Stopping private practice of GOB employed doctors, ii) Inclusion of Homeopathy, Ayurbedi & Unani medicines among GOB health service providers, & iii) Inclusion of health insurance in both public & private sectors. As it has been approved without the consensus of major service providers, meaning MBBS doctors' organizations as well as the corporate committees who will have to spend money for their employees, in the form of insurance; government should be aware of possible hindrance. //////The prime minister's defense adviser Tarique Ahmed Siddique recently told that he was 100% sure that RAB shot Limon as he attempted to run away at the time of operation to arrest Jamadder, a local accused. He also said Limon and his father are members of a criminal gang and a conspiracy was being hatched to disband RAB. Then Sahara Khatun, the state minister, confirmed that he (Tarique Siddique) expressed the government's position. It is worthwhile to note that the state minister a few days ago said that she had nothing to do with Limon. Finally, RAB's Director General opined, Limon is a young boy, not a notorious criminal. He just became a victim of the incident. According to the newspapers, two cases were filed against Limon. He was accused of illegally possessing arms and of obstructing law enforcement agencies in discharging their duties. He was also recorded as being 25-year-old, but actually he was 16. The probe committee had not been able to find any evidence that indicates Limon as a criminal.We hope that the PM will personally handle the issue and give directives to the concerned to resolve the crisis.//////One year has just passed on June 3, 2011 since the devastating inferno that caused colossal damages to property and loss of innumerable human lives. It was detected that the warehouses that stored inflammable chemicals were solely responsible for this tragedy, and the govt. assured that those storage facilities will be shifted immediately to elsewhere so that these kinds of gruesome incidents never occur again. But it is sad to notice that despite the Prime Minister's interventions, promises of the concerned minister and other authorities, the chemical stores still remain in the same place. I wonder why nothing materializes in our country despite instructions, promises made by the superior authorities. //////The BNP leaders have said that Sunday's hartal was not against the Supreme Court verdict but against Prime Minister's speech on the Caretaker Government issue. What a big reason for calling hartal, a destructive and damaging mechanism to cripple the country's economy and creating anarchy! If they were correct, they should have waited until the final day of implementation of the Prime Minister's "NO" to the Caretaker Government. The impatient BNP could not wait that long. We must appreciate BNP for their love for people, democracy and national prosperity! I believe the people of Bangladesh will surely bring this party to power if the voting is held under a caretaker administration with power to hold an engineered election without e-voting and voter list. We wish BNP all the success.//////Bangladesh Bank (BB) has claimed that the apex trade body, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) lobbied with it to extend the deadline for bringing down the bank's exposure to the stock market.

As a result, banks made huge investment that took index unusually to 8,900.//////Roy's important report on pollution by tanneries and the photo alongside it both show the red color!

Without studying textbooks, they read guidebooks which are available in the market. They often get good marks in the exams. But we can see that due to memorizing lessons, they do not get good jobs. To get a job, they have to pay bribe and involve in corruption and nepotism. But if students study hard and try to understand what they are reading, avoiding the bad practice of memorizing lessons, it would yield good results in future. It is of great delight that GOB has already introduced creative system in SSC and HSC level which discourages memorizing lessons.//////Directed by Linda Yellen a movie titled - William & Kate: A Royal Love Story depicting the budding romance of Prince William and Kate Middleton and their subsequent fairy-tale wedding is under production and is expected to be released by August next on the Hallmark Channel.Yellen who also wrote the story of William & Kate: A Royal Love Story called the movie a very personal story.
