We certainly commend the move, though we cannot stay away from reminding the government that similar moves were earlier announced as well, with much fanfare, before things went back to square one. Let matters be a little different this time and in a way that takes certain important factors into consideration. Clearly the biggest factor here relates to citizens' comfort while commuting or trying to commute. The government's plans to crack down on 20-year-old buses and 25-year-old trucks, from such a point of view, should be looked at carefully. Much as we would like to see ageing vehicles taken off the streets, we also feel that nothing should be done that will leave commuters without transport all of a sudden. One can well imagine the chaos that will ensue if on July 15 and on the days following, citizens wake up to a nightmare of having to fend for themselves without transport.//////STREET beggary, particularly at the city's traffic intersections, has acquired an ungainly ubiquity. It's hazardous for those who practise it along assorted transports pulling up at a signal point and then rushing out when given green light. Children and women are among the most vulnerable. It is also visibly self-degrading as a crippled hand or leg or a blind eye is called attention to by tapping on the window panes, or if these panes are open show it to appeal to the sense of piety of the vehicle passengers. Some of them look the other way, some handing in a small amount.//////European champions Spain reached the last 16 of the World Cup on Friday with a 2-1 win over Chile, who also qualified from Group H as runners-up at the expense of Switzerland, who parted 0-0 with Honduras.//////Ivory Coast fell short of their goal chase to make the last 16 at the World Cup as they beat North Korea 3-0 in their Group G match to continue the exodus of African teams here on Friday.//////New Zealand exit the World Cup unbeaten and proud after three defiant draws and a country enraptured by their unheralded performances in South Africa.//////An utterly dejected Cameroon go home without a single World Cup point on Friday, after a campaign marred by a bitter selection row with their coach and a failure to live up to billing as Africa's best team at the tournament. //////President Barack Obama in a congratulatory phone call told the US World Cup heroes Thursday that the West Wing of the White House had erupted in cheers when Donovan scored the dramatic goal.//////Brazil coach Dunga spent much of the time during his team's goalless draw in their final Group G match with Portugal gesticulating wildly and berating his players.//////Former France captain Thierry Henry said on Friday he felt sidelined after playing only a cameo role in his country's disastrous World Cup campaign, but insisted the squad were right to show support for Nicolas Anelka.//////South Korea and Uruguay meet here on Saturday in a fascinating World Cup last 16 clash that few pundits would have predicted at the start of the tournament.//////Exhausted record-breaker John Isner tumbled out of Wimbledon in straight sets Friday as Roger Federer and Venus Williams booked their places in the second week.//////Coach Bob Bradley and his indefatigable United States team will seek revenge and a place in the quarterfinals when they meet Ghana on Saturday. //////South Africa 2010 is unfolding itself as one of the most unpredictable World Cup in recent times.

The sentence should have been for a longer term. //////PUBLIC university authorities have been accustomed to flouting financial regulations since long. It existed even before 1971. The reasons for this are the gradual fall of standards in administration, non-application of the disciplinary rules, and tremendous increase in propensity for corruption in our society. This has emboldened the administrators, teachers and others to ignore willfully the regulations and orders of the government. //////Today let me reminisce with you on a day simple in content, yet pleasure filled.

He was John Keats, a very familiar name to the students and readers of English Literature. //////Ahmed Saadi, the Bengali-loving Urdu poet of Bangladesh, dreamed of disseminating knowledge of Bengali literature to the vast Urdu-speaking community of the subcontinent.

Nazrul Institute compiled and published a book on Saadi's Urdu translated selected poems of Kazi Nazrul Islam. But after his death his remaining literary works appear to have gone into oblivion.

The tumultuous historical background suggests numerous factors playing a role in the present breakdown in Thailand. By shedding light on the historical patterns of political evolution in Thailand, one can possibly help resolve the current conundrum of governance for the present and the future. This article will explain the tumultuous situation in Thailand in the context of three significant questions. What parts of the society comprise the 'Red Shirts' and the 'Yellow Shirts,' and what are the root causes for such a violent uprising in Thailand? Are there any major economic underpinnings in the political condition since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997? What are the reasons for the escalation of the protests and how far will it undermine the process of democratization in the region?//////Mohammad Ali Syed subtitles his work as 'A Progressive View', which certainly points to the kind of case he makes for his interpretation of Islamic rules and conventions as they apply to women. Syed has little patience with the proponents of radical Islam, those whose view of the faith embraces some of the most conservative, indeed fanatic assessments of the position Muslim women should hold in society. The increasing alarm that in recent times has been raised over such issues as the use of the niqab and hijab by Muslim women does not, for the writer, emphasise the core of the Islamic faith and indeed goes against history. Not for him the bigotry which has long characterised (and still does characterise) the status of women in Islam. Not for him, therefore, an acquiescence in the thought that women in Islam belong in one place, in this instance the four walls of a male-dominated home. //////If Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet is a manifest love story of two young lovers, Antony and Cleopatra is a mature version of love between two mature lovers. Age can not wither her, nor custom / Stale her infinite variety. Other women cloy/ The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry/ Where most she satisfies. For vilest things / Become themselves in her, that the holy priests/ Bless her when she is riggish (2.3.240-45). The above words uttered by Enobarbus aptly tell us about the entirety of the magic character physical and psychological demeanourof Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt. Who could evade the terminal spell cast by Cleopatra? Ah, none! The three great Roman heroes: Pompey the Great, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony did succumb to the all encompassing and pulling power of the mysterious queen! Mark Antony, at a critical state of making a choice between his martial duties and his love for Cleopatra, falls in an all-lost, happily of course, love with Cleopatra. Their love triumphs over all other mundane affairs. At the time of their impending doom, however, Antony tries to kill himself and an unyielding Cleopatra commits suicide kills herself using a venomous asp's poison. She remains triumphant to herself and their love: Antony shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness / I'th' posture of a whore (5.2.214-17).//////There may be few books that can hold up the tapestry of human bondage so intricately as The Vine of Desire. Desire and loneliness, love and faithfulness interplay through the tale of three Indian immigrants caught in the dilemma of living under the same roof in America. The story is totally engrossing and leaves the reader breathless with the minute details caught in the emotional upheavals of life. Shudha, a young Indian woman, comes to visit her cousin Anju in New York. Shudha is newly divorced and still under the mental agony such family breakups can cause. She left her husband when her he and her mother-n-law wanted her to have an abortion because the baby she was carrying was a female foetus. To escape from them Shudha goes back to her parents. Now she is the mother of the baby girl, Dayita, who is with her in the US. Shudha and Anju have been very close friends ever since they were little girls. Anju had a miscarriage and is very upset and so Shudha has agreed to come to help her out with the trauma. //////Elvis Presley, the legendary American rock-n-roll singer and Hollywood actor of great fame, was a simpleton but a hard-working fellow with unmatched nervous energy. Almost a god to the billions of music lovers all over the globe, particularly to teenagers, he was a craze and rose to the pinnacle of success. It made him a highly paid singer in his times. But he is not dead to music aficionados as yet and still his smashing hit numbers stir the souls of listeners and take them to a different world of music.//////
