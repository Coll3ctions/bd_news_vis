But we are going to have two city 'fathers' of our capital city Dhaka, thanks to the epoch-making 'research' conducted by our talented 'genetic engineers' at the top!//////The Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has complained against some members of the civil society. To some extent I support her. The members of this group are intellectuals, former high ranking officials, veteran politicians, retired army officers, economists, philosophers, professors, eminent lawyers and so on. They are of course respectable persons of society. But they hold certain political beliefs and so they are not fully neutral. About a month ago, I wrote a letter in the DS titled "All are not wrong." Many of the civil society members do not see any positive side of the government actions. They find everything wrong. They never give any hope to the citizens, they only spread frustration among people. Every government has some successes and failures, but the civil society members only see the failures. Instead of giving people hope, they confuse them. Most people expect them to be neutral. //////The Palestinian flag was raised for the first time yesterday above a UN agency, the Unesco headquarters in Paris, in a diplomatic victory won despite stiff resistance from the US and Israel.//////Security forces shot dead 17 people in Syria yesterday and rebels killed seven police in an ambush, activists said, after the UN human rights chief put the death toll from nine months of protest against President Bashar al-Assad at 5,000.//////Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's spokesman said Monday the results of Russia's contested parliamentary polls will stand despite a wave of street protests and a probe by the election authorities.//////The most coveted prize in particle physics - the Higgs boson - may have been glimpsed, said researchers reporting at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva yesterday.//////A US drone captured by Iran is now the property of the Islamic republic, Defence Minister Ahmad Vahidi said yesterday, dismissing a request by US President Barack Obama for its return.//////The French president has said that there are now clearly "two Europes", following last week's summit in which the UK vetoed EU treaty changes.//////Pakistan is considering charging millions of dollars in annual taxes on Nato trucks and fuel tankers, officials told the BBC on Monday.//////A Saudi woman was beheaded Monday after being convicted of practising sorcery the interior ministry said.//////Laid-off workers complaining about unpaid wages disrupted a speech by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday by shouting and throwing objects including shoes, news websites and an agency reported.//////US "occupy" protesters claimed victory Monday in blockading ports along the West Coast and shutting down a major trade cargo hub in a new front on the anti-capitalist campaign.//////Clashes erupted between former rebel fighters that toppled Gaddafi and a tribe seen as loyal to the fallen regime, killing four people, sources said on Monday.//////Tunisia's opposition Moncef Marzouki yesterday was sworn in as the country's first elected president since the north African nation's revolution sparked the Arab Spring.//////A lone gunman armed with grenades opened fire on a square packed with children and Christmas shoppers in the eastern Belgian city of Liege yesterday, killing three people and wounding 75.//////Authorities in eastern China said yesterday 15 primary school children were killed when the bus they were travelling in rolled into a river, in the latest fatal accident involving students.//////The US security firm Blackwater at the centre of allegations that its guards killed civilians in Iraq is changing its name once more.//////The Pakistani army wanted me to sign a statement that said the situation of the then East Pakistan was calm and no genocide was taking place here.
