In the case of our administration the latter is more likely to be the case if the number of public servants reemployed after retirement or have had their service tenure extended, continues to be at the current level. One wonders what the compulsions are for the government to fill up more than 200 administrative posts with retirees and even outsiders, as reported in this newspaper recently. //////Reports of Bangladeshi medical staff, especially nurses, not being allowed to leave embattled Libya are worrying. As our correspondent now in Choucha on the Tunisia-Libya frontier notes, a number of Bangladeshis fleeing Libya have spoken of many nurses being compelled to work in hospitals, tending to those wounded in the armed clashes between government and rebel forces. It is also quite natural to suppose that many of the wounded are individuals caught in the air raids over Libya by western forces. While it is perfectly understandable that those wounded in the war as also others will be in need of treatment, it is inconceivable that foreigners working in these hospitals will be detained against their will.//////Moments after Daniel Vettori had enacted the last act of their disastrous Bangladesh tour (the series-ending press conference) in October, a fellow journalist quipped that New Zealand could end up losing everything before the World Cup but like the Germans in the football World Cup (twelve times semifinalists), they would be in the semifinals come what may.//////Pacer Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and middle-order batsman Alok Kapali have been recalled for next month's three-match ODI series against Australia when the Bangladesh Cricket Board yesterday declared a 14-member squad for the home series.//////England didn't give Upul Tharanga enough runs to break his own world record.

On information, police rushed to the spot, recovered the body and sent it to Satkhira Sadar Hospital morgue for autopsy. Asadul had gone into hiding soon after the incident.//////On March 11 the worst earthquake hit Japan followed by tsunami. We heard the news when the match between Bangladesh and England was in progress. It was a crucial match for us and Bangladeshis were glued to their TV sets if they were not in the stadium. The saddest part was that at that moment none of the Bangladeshi TV channels gave this as breaking news. After Bangladesh won the match, the breaking news was the historic win but not the disaster that had struck Japan and was continuing in the form of earthquakes, aftershocks and the nuclear disaster. Japan has always been a very good friend of Bangladesh and has been helping us in bad and good times.The officials of ICC and BCB along with the players could have observed a minute's silence to condole the death of so many people and to be one with the homeless and the injured. //////Bangladesh seems to have got relieved of cricket fever which prevailed across the country for one month. Thousands of people have been shocked at the inglorious exit of our team. As a host country, our expectation was like a mountain. However, it should be acknowledged that there are some positives as there are negatives. We hope BCB will scrutinise these and appoint experts to train the players. At last, I request the spectators to be rational in showing reaction after games. What we did after our defeat against West Indies was not good. //////With the developed world's liquidity crisis as well as political unrest in the Arab regime triggering a global economic downturn, safeguarding our wage earners is critical. Shrinking wages directly affect our low-income classes. The accompanying dip in consumer expenditure will drag economic growth and delay recovery from recession. The Bangladeshi wage earners' woes are exacerbated by several factors. A meaningful and universal minimum wage policy should precede any further initiative on labour reforms. Another imperative is to step up income support measures. One sector where these are required immediately is also one that is going through a major labour market transformation: the rural agrarian workforce, which suffers from lower job prospects. These call for a further strengthening, not weakening, of labour market institutions. The challenges are huge. Governments in Bangladesh and elsewhere should strengthen their protective role through new initiatives. //////We are grateful to our Prime Minister for providing allowances to the freedom fighters. But still now many freedom fighters do not get this allowance. They cannot buy enough food, medicine and daily necessaries. My request to the government is to provide enough facilities to the freedom fighters. Freedom fighters didn't fight considering that their sons and daughters will get privilege in future, rather they did it for the emancipation of the people of the country. My humble request to our Prime Minister- please does not make difference among the present generation by offering special BCS and quota system for the freedom fighters' children. The general people also contributed much to the country.//////A technical article, titled 'Tech Story' was published on 21st.March, in a local English daily. It was a fascinating piece of information that revealed the dark side of 'high tech electronics'! Here we had the advanced motor car, with electronics all over; and on the other hand, we had the cunning electronics 'whiz-kid', who by changing some programme and may be a few codes, managed to steal the car without leaving any clue or fingerprints anywhere! As we say 'there are down side to everything'; it seems it also applies to the latest in automation! That is the way the modern culprits will go. //////I am writing to express my earnest gratitude to the people of Dhaka and Bangladesh for the relentless support and encouragement they gave to Pakistan cricket team during the quarter-final match of ICC world cup. The jubilation and enthusiasm they expressed as each West Indies wicket fell was very adorable. People of Bangladesh have won our hearts. Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. I sincerely hope one day we will be able to cheer for the Bangladeshi cricket team playing an important match of world cup in Pakistan. //////The CNN has aired a touching story titled 'The Martyr of Benghazi'. A strictly apolitical narrator would tell you that a rebel suicide bomber named Mehdi Mohammed Zeyo blew up a (government) barrack on February 19, 2011. He is therefore, says CNN, a great freedom-loving martyr. I wonder if the admiration would be the same if the incident had taken place in Iraq or Afghanistan or any country in the world for that matter. Also, what of the generic strategy of suicide-bombing? Is it acceptable? If not, then mere imperial-favour has bestowed honour to an otherwise despised act. //////Bangladesh Telephone Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has taken a wise decision by instructing the six private mobile phone operators to keep number 121 free from billing. The Chairman of the Commission Major General (Retd) Zia Ahmed has said that people who are availing services from these operators should not be burdened with extra money. He says there is no point to levy extra money by the operators when customers need to know something about their services. Operators, on the other hand, say that this will create problems for them as they will be flooded with customers' queries resulting in loss of revenues. We hope that BTRC will remain strict in its policy and apply this non billing system as soon as possible. //////It is appalling and shameful how the MPs behave in the parliament.When the parliamentary session goes on, per minute costs a huge amount of money, during this time the lawmakers are supposed to discuss various problems of the country and find solutions, but alas, it is not the case. They waste time by admiring their respective leaders, adding many adjectives to their names every time their names are mentioned.//////The education minister deserves praise for the new education policy and the examination system. Today the media speaks about many aspects of general people's income, expenditure, market prices, costs of living and so on. Thus, a student of class VII or above is well aware about the income of their parents. Students must learn economics in their schools. The education minister should do something about this. //////Those who have watched the famous television serial "The Roots" by Alex Haley are definitely familiar with the term slavery and what it means. America devised new concept ( DV Lottery) of modern day slavery. They do not come, hunt you down, bind you with chains and take on board the vessels en-route to the United States, as we have seen in the television serial. //////As reported by the press, several organisations plus a ward commissioner of Cox's Bazar in a press conference in Dhaka protested the move to expand the Cox's Bazar airport and demanded immediate cancellation of the project to save poor people of the area. Instead, they stressed on the need for construction of the proposed Dhaka-Cox's Bazar railway line.//////At present online-based activities are getting popularity everywhere. A remarkable part of the credit will go to the present government which is trying to turn our country into a digital one. We hope the government will take further effective initiatives so that each person can enjoy this service easily- free of cost- or at an affordable cost. Then, we believe, the dream of digital Bangladesh will come true.//////We bring to your kind notice that most of the letters we receive still contain more than 150 words, which makes it difficult for us to edit and publish.

Pabna district administration organised the programme. //////Use of unparliamentary language has become a culture in the Jatiya Sangsad (JS) or National Assembly. In fact, the term unparliamentary is rather too broad to convey its exact connotation, especially in the particular context. We are not aware if any other democracy in the world has this matchless culture of addressing the leaders of their opponent party with violently offensive and unspeakable words. But it is so common in our Parliament that the lawmakers have no qualm about it.//////The British existed in India for over two centuries. They should have co-existed. They would not have needed a prime minister in 2011, David Cameron, to fiddle around with ideas like Gross Domestic Happiness, his latest barometer to gauge the welfare of society.

A 19th century Cameron would have caught on to the fact that life is something more than a mere industrial revolution.//////Constantinople and Angora change their names to Istanbul and Ankara. //////
