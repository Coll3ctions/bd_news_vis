But this time, as late as in October-November we see it occurring in parts of Dhaka city and Pabna district. //////OUR Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) and the Ministry of Commerce, both organs of government, have set ambitious targets for fiscal 2009-10 (FY10). They feel that despite clouds on the horizon, our economy can generate around US dollar 17.5 billion of exports during the current fiscal. In comparative terms this means almost 13 percent growth over that of the previous year (which stood at US dollar 15.565 billion).//////COMPARISONS are odious. Still when Europe celebrated early this week the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, I thought of the border at Wagha, drawn more than 62 years ago. It has no wall. Yet it is difficult to scale it because its brick and mortar is that of distrust and bias. The Berlin Wall was built to separate the two Germanys. It was a forced division. In the case of India and Pakistan, the partition came about after a willing compromise. Still the fact remains that the wall stands between the two countries to remind people how they have wasted some six decades in hating each other and in letting the opportunity for development together go by.//////All-rounder Nayeem Islam scripted history in domestic cricket by hitting six sixes in an over but his terrific effort in the action-packed match was not good enough for Gazi Tank to stop Mohammedan's winning run in the Premier Division Cricket League yesterday. //////Hot favourites Abahani kept their winning streak in tact with a 92-run victory over Cricket Coaching School (CCS) in their Premier Division Cricket clash at BKSP yesterday, thanks to a brilliant 90-run knock from 72 deliveries from veteran all-rounder Mohammad Rafique that made their task easy.//////Goalkeeper Aminul Haq sustained injury in his shoulder during the practice with the national football team at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan on Thursday.//////Pakistan overcame their one-day international series loss and maintained their world champion status in Twenty20 cricket with a convincing 49-run win over New Zealand at Dubai Stadium on Thursday.//////Unsavoury behaviour from a Gazi Tank official marred the spirit of the game after an exciting encounter at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Friday which Mohammedan won by three wickets. //////Bangladesh Under-19 continued their excellent form with a 6-wicket victory over touring Zimbabwe Under-19 in the first one-day match at the Khulna Divisional Stadium yesterday.//////Daniel Vettori, who was ruled out of the first Twenty20 international against Pakistan in Dubai due to a head injury sustained during the ODI series, has undergone a scan which revealed no serious damage.

It expresses justified concern at reports of "crossfire," "encounter" and "gunfights" that appear to be the preferred means for combating crimes. The premonition is that we are observing an increasing lack of faith in the legal system.//////WITH very grim consequences for the world at large, the demons of ultra-religious zealotry, racism and an ugly form of authoritarianism have popped up in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Indonesia, and parts of the Philippines.

Half of the moon is always lit by the sun and not just the portion we see. The moon appears different to us depending on its location in its orbit around the earth. This is due to the different amounts of sunlight striking the part of the moon facing the earth. //////The traffic situation in Dhaka city is deplorable, worsening at the rate of (they say) 100 new cars on the road per day, is an understatement. In reality, it now takes over two hours to get from, say, Gulshan 2 to Dhanmandi Russel Square. That is what I experienced last week. I was not walking for sure. There are of course worse scenarios and every one has a tale to tell, what with hours of waiting at the end of a long tail.//////Yes, you are reading it right, though general knowledge and common sense lead us to the opposite and that is the problem. Transport planning and management is not general knowledge and common sense. It is a complex multi-disciplinary science and need scientific research to solve the problems. Since early 1990s several studies (Dhaka Integrated Transport Study, DITS; Dhaka Urban Transport Plan, DUTP and Strategic Transport Plan for Dhaka, STP) were taken by government to solve the traffic problem in Dhaka. The latest in the line is controversial Strategic Transport Plan prepared and accepted by government despite vigorous opposition from professionals and civil society. Interestingly data of STP does not even support flyovers and subway in Dhaka. //////From her childhood, the girl has been like this. She is always hungry. She does not want dresses, bangles or ribbons. She just wants rice. Chipped enamel plates and earthen bowls filled with rice, rice and more rice.//////A recent edition of ////// magazine had a short featured article under Postcard: Kolkata, written by Nilanjana Bhowmick. The bi-line says "The fight for Mother Teresa's remains." Mother Teresa is synonymous to India or in the context of the slums of Calcutta. On the eve of her upcoming centenary of birth in August 2010, Albania has demanded that her body be exhumed and flown back to Albania to be buried next to her mother and sister at the Albanian capital, Tirana. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha made this demand to the government of India. It is predicted that Albania will most probably campaign with more intensity to claim her remains before her upcoming birthday. Since this official request was made, the entire nation of India is appalled. There have been protests and the nuns of Mother Teresa's order are wondering why Albania would raise the issue since Mother Teresa had little connection with the country, where she spent her adolescent years only. Fearing that Macedonia may also make such an unreasonable request, West Bengal's million member state forum has called for a mass protest, according to the magazine. The Indian foreign office has issued a statement saying, "Mother Teresa was an Indian citizen and she is resting in her own country, her own land." Her own Missionaries of Charity order has described such a request as absurd.//////On his second visit to Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) as a guest speaker at the Lecture Series on English Studies organized by the Department of English, Dr. Fakrul Alam was clearly happy at being able to address his old friends, students past and present and school friends and thanked IUB for its hospitability. The topic of the discussion was "Postmodern American Fiction and the Visual Arts". He started off by describing himself as a teacher of the theory of postmodernism as opposed to being a specialist. He held forth on the beginning and end of modernism and the eventual rise of postmodernism in the 1960s. He also noted that it is preposterous to think of what is to come after postmodernism since there was just no way of knowing what was to be. In his view, postmodernism is a part of what is broadly called post-structuralism.//////If//////the//////river//////can roll on and on till it meets the sea,//////then//////when//////will you, o wild maiden, be mine?//////William Dalrymple, an eminent Scottish historian and writer, spoke at the Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), on Friday, 13 November, on his latest book, ////// Dalrymple was invested as the second scholar in residence at IUB and presented with a sash.

Diabetes affects 246 million people worldwide. Each year another 7 million people develop diabetes. These statistics are scary and indicate that diabetes is growing faster than most people imagine.//////Hypothyroidism is a disease caused by insufficient production of thyroid hormone secreted from thyroid gland (an endocrine gland in the neck; also known as Adams apple in men).

Bangladesh has its Territorial Waters & Maritime Zones Act of 1974. It has ratified the UNCLOS 1982 on 27 July 2001, having time for claims to UN Commission to the Limits of Continental Shelf (UNCLCS) by July 27, 2011. According to the UNCLOS III of 1982 articles 3 and 15, every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles, measured from baselines determined in accordance with this Convention. The baseline is the line of low tide along the seashore of a state. As per article 17, ships of all states, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea. Article 33 gives authority of a state on certain other matters to further 12 nautical miles called the Contiguous Zone. //////THE civil society in Bangladesh plays a significant role in articulating people's interests in special areas to the government. In recent times, the civil society has built up consciousness among the people on major national issues such as corruption, climate degradation, and land grabbing by influential people in the society that have left Bangladesh's rivers, canals, and wetlands at their mercy.//////RECENTLY, the Army Chief is reported to have said that the "US has not allowed a second 9/11 to happen. Indonesia has not allowed a second Bali bombing to happen. India has allowed people to get away after the Parliament attack, the Delhi blasts and finally 26/11. It's time for all of us to say no more." In the light of weightier civil-military issues however, both analogies are inappropriate and not worth pondering. But it might be useful to consider if this is indeed a defining juncture in India's civil-military relations.//////THERE are books and there are diplomats' books. All these years we have come across memoirs, some smart but most quite shoddy, from superannuated diplomats around the world. And include in that world the People's Republic of Bangladesh, where diplomacy has regularly been a shoddy affair in the way its politics has been. But while that is true, equally true is the reality of diplomats from abroad making their way to Dhaka, spending a few years and then moving on with their accumulated experience, sometimes wisdom. Krishnan Srinivisan comes to mind here. Remember him?//////Born in 1861, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the key figures of the Bengali Renaissance and translating a book of this great man is a feat undoubtedly praiseworthy. Half-willing at first, but then seeing Radha Chakravarty's name I happily decided to go for the review. An English teacher in Gargi College, University of Delhi, she is known for her translation of several of Tagore's works, including Boyhood Days, Chokher Bali and Farewell Song: Shesher Kobita. Gora appeared as a book in the Bangla year 1316 (1910). The present translation is based on the Rabindra Rachanabali, now regarded as the standard edition. This impressive book full of energy, alive and pulsating with ideas, passion and conflicts is popular till today. The present translation attempts to redress some of the lapses and omissions in earlier translations seeking to offer a lucid, readable version of this massive, complex novel to 21st century readers who do not read Bangla --- an immense challenge for the translator! Henceforth many translations have been published, but it is Chakravarty's singular skilful demonstration of parlance which has energised this translation par excellence.//////Dilwar Hasan needs no introduction.
