Just how horrific matters are in the embattled country is made obvious by the ceaseless activities of militants, especially in the northwest. The death toll from bombs and grenades detonated by elements like the Taliban has been rising, with the Pakistan authorities virtually unable to stem the tide of violence sweeping across large parts of it. Matters are certainly not being helped by the drone attacks carried out by the Americans in Pakistan, especially along the border with Afghanistan.//////IN a central bank report to the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) it is revealed that Tk 3,685 crore worth of interest had been waived on outstanding loans during last eight years.

As many as 693 borrowers including former MPs and influential businessmen got the massive waiver from nine state-owned banks and financial institutions.//////A parliamentary panel has recommended that to ensure strict adherence to traffic rules by all, even members of parliament (MPs) and ministers will not enjoy any immunity from the law.

Yet, despite Thomas Friedman's claim the world is not flat enough, conflicting interests abound among G-20 and non-G-20 nations. At the recently held G-20 meeting at Pittsburgh, China and other developing countries got greater say in the IMF while the USA maintained its veto power, but the non-G-20 got nothing. They wanted more resources for development through a new concessional fund, a disproportionate share of the IMF gold sale, a more liberal interpretation of the debt sustainability framework, and funds for climate change devastation. All they got were promises. Still, the very fact that the G-20 was formalised at Pittsburgh was a positive step.//////Bangladesh trounced a careless Zimbabwe by four wickets in the third one-day international at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday to wrest a 2-1 advantage in the five-match series.//////Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan was far from being happy though his side coasted to a four-wicket victory in the day-night third one-day international to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series against Zimbabwe yesterday.//////A first-half brace from Mohammad Rony powered Sheikh Russel KC to an easy 3-1 win over 10-men Muktijoddha Sangsad in their second match of the Citycell Bangladesh League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday.//////The performance of the touring Zimbabwe side in the first match looked too distant now as a sorry Zimbabwe side once again surrendered to the spin-pronged Bangladesh attack to hand them an easy victory in the third match of the Grameenphone Cup at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday.//////Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni continued his rich vein of form and Yuvraj Singh returned to his belligerent best as India won the third one-day international against world champions Australia by 6 wickets and take a 2-1 lead in the seven-match series at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi yesterday.//////Bangladesh retained the same squad for the last two one-day internationals of the five-match Gremeenphone Cup against Zimbabwe.//////England team director Andy Flower believes Kevin Pietersen is in the right frame of mind to overpower South Africa in the forthcoming Test series.//////After four straight wins, Bangladesh Under-19s suffered their first defeat against their English counterparts in the seven-match one-day series at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium yesterday.//////The 18th Bata School Handball Tournament gets underway today at the Dhanmondi Sports Complex with 27 schools participating in boys and girls events, informed the organisers at a press conference yesterday.//////England batsman Jonathan Trott has denied allegations from Michael Vaughan that he partied with South Africa after they won a Test in 2008. In his new autobiography, Time to Declare, Vaughan has accused the Johannesburg-born Trott of celebrating with South Africa's players after England lost at Edgbaston last summer.//////The trouble with having a charge laid against you is that, whether you're cleared or not and even if you pay your penance, you'll always be regarded with some suspicion. Just ask Jacob Zuma, Chris Brown or even Johan Botha. After being cited for a suspect action for the third time, Botha must feel like a wanted criminal every time he steps out to play.//////John Dyson, the former Sri Lanka and West Indies coach, has expressed interest in the New Zealand post recently vacated by Andy Moles. New Zealand Cricket have encountered difficulty filling the head coaching role of late -- Moles' appointment last November came after Matthew Mott, Graham Ford and Mickey Arthur turned down the position -- and the availability of a well-credentialled candidate will be viewed as a positive by Kiwi officials.//////England's cricketers are bracing themselves for a stern test when their tour of South Africa begins this month, with fast bowler James Anderson predicting they would find it "much harder than this summer".//////The International Cricket Council (ICC) has asked all its member nations to prepare sporting pitches for the one-dayer and Twenty20 internationals probably in the wake of low-scoring matches played in the Champions Trophy and Champions League T20 tournaments recently.//////After axing him from the national team, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has now barred Misbahul Haq from playing in Bangladesh and instead advised him to concentrate on playing domestic cricket.//////Referees Tayeb Hasan Shamsuddin and Abdul Hannan Miron have been nominated for the Manwar Hossain Nannu Smriti Referee Award for their outstanding performance in last season's Federation Cup, B.

Earthquake researchers have predicted a massive earthquake, which may cause devastations, especially in the capital city of Dhaka. According to a study conducted by Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) in 2003, about 60 percent structures in old Dhaka are non engineered, of those 50 percent are made of flammable materials. We have the Building Code 1993 and building construction rules of 2006. But truly few constructions are being made under those regulations. //////It is our national shame that even after 38 years of independence, we could not honour Pundit Ravi Shankar, who along with the Beatles, brought our cry of freedom to the world at large. We can still honour him while he is alive. If the government doesn't take any initiative, can a citizens' group, sponsored by the media, organise this? //////Time distance in Dhaka town is far more than the real distance. To reach a destination of 15 minutes drive with respect to distance may often require two hours or so. Almost every day some reports and editorials are published in the newspapers about traffic jam. Experts are also giving their views and opinions for mitigation of the traffic jam but with no results. Energy and time both are lost in the traffic jam. //////Primary education is a basic human right. On top of that, to me, this is the most crucial period of life in terms of acquiring education. In this time, whatever a student learns he or she takes it for granted and remembers it forever. Life is very tender and green and can easily be manipulated. On the other hand, they can be developed as the best human beings.//////How unfortunate. I feel pity for the MPs who did pay, that is! I mean, why did they pay their income tax? Didn't they know that if you are an MP or a minister in our country, the law doesn't apply to you? I request the Treasury to immediately refund all the 303 MPs and apologise for all the inconvenience caused to their families.//////All of a sudden your paper is totally silent on the Myanmar situation. Why? We are anxious to know what is really going on.//////Yesterday (18th.October) early in the morning I chanced to come across a running TV programme about two brothers from a village somewhere in Munshiganj, who had built a Wright brother's type single engine monoplane; all by themselves, which they are sure will fly! The programme held me spellbound; and I watched it till the end!//////Many women liberation outfits and NGOs are quite (rightly or wrongly) vocal about the rights of the domestic female workers popularly known as maid servants. These 'right outfits' incite them to serve certain interests and make the domestic workers more hostile towards the employers. However, many incidents of abuse, violence etc have been reported in the print and electronic media. We condemn the incidents and demand impartial enquiry and justice.//////The city dwellers in Metropolitan Dhaka, especially the middle-income group, are facing tremendous trouble while moving from one place to another. Private sedan is out of their reach due to financial limitations. Taxi-cab service is not easily available and also costly for them. When a family wants to join in a marriage ceremony, it needs a low cost vehicle to go to a community centre. When a patient has to be shifted to a hospital, an affordable baby taxi is needed. If a family wants to go to shopping to celebrate a festival, a baby-taxi is required. To appear in a public examination hall, a student needs transport service of a baby taxi. It is the reality in Dhaka metropolis that affordable transport is not easily available. On the other hand, one cannot move to all desired places by available bus service in Dhaka Metropolis. It is very difficult for females to travel by bus owing to limited service and uncivilized behaviour of a section of male passengers. But it is unfortunate that in the past, governments ignored the acute need of city dwellers. //////A convener of a upazila Awami Volunteer League in Goforgaon occupied a pond and dubbed it DIGITAL FISHERIES. I bet he really wishes to realise the dream of his party well, in his own inflected way! //////This has reference to the news item- Tigers to become extinct in 15 years- filed by Inam Ahmed from Nepal. I doubt Bangladesh Tigers would die down or disappear during the coming 15 years provided the government can control poaching which is the lowest in the subcontinent, can stop killing of stray tigers by the members of the public living close to the Sundarbans and if the sea level does not rise above 10 to 15cm during the coming decades.//////It has been reported (DS October 18) that the government is taking an initiative to grant 30 per cent quota to the children of our war heroes in the ensuing selection of assistant judges. I would request the government to give a second thought to the idea. A judge must possess a very high level of IQ, profound knowledge and integrity. A war hero's son or daughter may not necessarily have those qualities of head and heart and may not qualify in the selection tests. There is nothing wrong in that. Everybody is not cut for everything. If one does not qualify in the tests for the selection of judges one may try to do something else where s/he might excel. If a wrong candidate who does not have the required intellectual ability, knowledge and integrity is appointed as a judge s/he will be failing to apply her/his judicial mind correctly. People who will be going to such a judge will be deprived of justice. People will suffer in the hands of such an incompetent judge for about 30 years or so till s/he retires. Merit and competence should be the only criteria while selecting candidates for posts like those of judges, and nothing else. It is said that judges dispense justice on His behalf. People who will deliberately select wrong kind of people as judges will surely be held responsible by God on the Great Day of Judgment. That is what we all believers believe in. //////My daughter's school begins at 8:00am. So, she has to start from home at 7:00am. During the time of her preparation at home, it is almost dark and thus 2-3 bulbs have to be lighted. Before introducing the new timing we did not need to switch on any light. Like us, thousands of people switch on their bulbs before sending their wards to school. I do not understand why schools have been brought under this new timing as schools break up some hours ahead of sunset.//////Afghan presidential challenger Abdullah Abdullah plans to boycott next week's runoff against incumbent Hamid Karzai following a breakdown in talks on how to fix the country's electoral crisis, two people familiar with the discussions said.//////Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has told US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the Palestinians would not agree to re-launch peace talks with Israel without a complete freeze of Jewish settlements, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said yesterday.//////Former US president George W Bush stepped briefly back into the limelight on Saturday, using a conference speech in New Delhi to defend his record and to crack jokes about his retirement.//////A massive oil leak off Australia's northwest coast poses an "immediate risk" to dozens of marine species, with untold numbers possibly dying and sinking to the Timor Sea floor, a report found.//////The fourth typhoon to whip the Philippines in a month lashed the capital and nearby provinces yesterday, leaving fresh floods and new misery before blowing out of the country.

His constructions are noted for their being in 21st century mode, verging on experi-mentalism. His novel approaches towards architecture make him peerless or practically singular in our country. Besides being an architect, he is also an ardent painter. Palash's solo painting exhibition titled Of Conflict and Harmony is now on at Gallery of Fine Arts, Asiatic Society, Nimtoli, Ramna, Dhaka. //////Renowned Bengali dramatist Dinabandhu Mitra (1830-1876) was born at Chouberia in Nadia, and was the son of Kalachand Mitra.

The grand announcements will have been made, oaths pledged, ideas shared and applause long faded. What comes after the microphones are stowed away and flashbulbs have been tamed is what really matters and what the event's theme making the invisible visible is all about. The argument for observing such a day seems rather baffling when one imagines every think tank, intergovernmental organisation and even the Bangladeshi Government is resigned to the fact that chronic and extreme poverty are inevitable, beyond our control or even a God-given curse. Then why, one might ask, spend large sums of money organising a conference in lavish surroundings with international and national dignitaries when such resources can be diverted to help the very people the conference hopes to address? It's rather simple: the extreme poor are seldom recognised by the political elite: government policies seldom, if ever, reach the economic bottom 10 percent of the population, and state safety net programmes fail to mitigate their poverty and often confuse them with the moderate poor. There are a number of other reasons but essentially, high-profile events like this year's Extreme Poverty Eradication Day provide a platform to reach the highest levels of government and advocate for change.//////IN 1996 I was carrying out research for my PhD on NGOs and poverty reduction in rural Bangladesh. One evening, after a long day trekking round aimlessly trying to find people to interview, I was sitting on the office veranda of a local NGO that had kindly offered me hospitality. It was a beautiful evening with one of those Bangladeshi sunsets that leave you breathless, even inspired. As usual, a number of people had gathered at the front of the NGO office hoping to be able to speak to the NGO leader or his senior staff. From among the crowd, an elderly woman slowly made her way towards me and asked if I could help her by talking to the NGO leader on her behalf. This was not an unusual request and I had become quite used to telling people that I neither worked for the NGO nor had the gravitas to influence its leaders. This time however the elderly woman ignored my response as she persisted in trying to get my attention. Those next to me on the veranda tried to gently move her away by asking her to join the queue of people at the front of the NGO office where 'she might be attended to'. Again unconvinced, she stubbornly held her ground. There was something admirable about her persistence and I began to chat with her. //////ON November 5, 1605, Guy Fawkes was caught with thirty-six barrels of gunpowder, attempting to blow up the House of Lords in the Palace of Westminster, during the State Opening of Parliament. The plot was to assassinate the King of England along with almost the entire British aristocracy. Since then, in adherence to tradition and the true spirit of British democracy, parliament has never been opened on the November 5 (except once), and the Houses of Parliament are ceremoniously searched by the Yeomen of the Guard, as a precaution against traitors and religious zealots. Parliament was subsequently opened on November 9, when His Majesty did not miss the opportunity to wax eloquent on "the divine right of monarchs" to rule, and the infernal "Catholic question". //////Acity can build itself to death, and that is perhaps the most appropriate description of Dhaka's so-called development. //////
