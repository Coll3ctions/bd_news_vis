Especially, donor conitionalities about obtaining and utilising foreign aid have traditionally been something of a sore point with developing countries like Bangladesh. And as a member of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Bangladesh often expressed its legitimate concerns about conditions and the usual strings attached to development assistance.//////SOME clear lessons have emerged from the building collapse in Begunbari the other day. And these lessons centre around the capacity building, or lack of it, that has come to be associated with disaster management in Bangladesh. While it is a fact that by now we have somehow learned how to deal with such major natural disasters as floods, cyclones and the like, we are yet to come to terms with measures for handling tragedies of the kind that has befallen Begunbari. In the case of natural disasters, there is a response mechanism in place, a truth which has been proved in these past few years. Now, given the regular disasters that have been happening in other areas --- collapsed buildings, fires in shanties, even road accidents --- it becomes important that serious thought be given to devising measures of coming to the aid of those affected by unforeseen circumstances.//////Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons revealed Thursday he was set to change his bowling attack as the Tigers looked to level their Test series with England here at Old Trafford.//////England arrived in South Africa Thursday morning hoping a favourable first-round draw can be the catalyst for a serious World Cup challenge.//////Brazil coach Dunga said on Thursday that the pressure on perennial favourites Brazil to deliver a sixth World Cup was normal - but unfair.//////Samantha Stosur is out to end a 30-year-long drought for Australian women in Grand Slam tennis following her wins over Justine Henin and Serena Williams.//////Zimbabwe pulled off a spectacular double against India in a tri-nations series match at Harare Sports Club here on Thursday, winning with three wickets and a huge 11.4 overs to spare.//////Samantha Stosur stormed into the French Open final on Thursday, beating Jelena Jankovic 6-1, 6-2, and she will become the first Australian woman in 30 years to capture a Grand Slam title if she wins again on Saturday.//////Newcomers Shuktara Jubo Sangsad of Narayanganj were relegated from the Citycell Bangladesh League after playing out a 1-1 draw against visitors Chittagong Mohammedan in their last match at the Narayanganj Stadium yesterday.//////The semifinal line-up of the Inter-College Clear Confidence Cup football tournament was completed yesterday when RCCI College, Barisal Govt College, BAF Shahin College and Notre Dame College won their respective quarterfinals at the Army Stadium.//////Six Seasons International Chess Tournament got underway yesterday at the National Sports Council tower with ten players from Russia, Mongolia, India and hosts Bangladesh taking part.//////In a tournament characterised by an overwhelming capacity to surprise, with virtually every underdog having their day, it seemed somehow inappropriate that the final of the 2002 World Cup was contested by two teams who between them had graced 12 of the competition's 16 finals.//////Arsenal have rejected a formal bid from Barcelona for Cesc Fabregas and told the Catalan club that they will not enter into negotiation for the midfielder.

What is surprising however is that while just about everything around them has changed, rickshaw design is still the same that I first saw more than 7 decades ago. Since this is by no means a rocket science, I wonder, why this is so. Is it because those who make them, those that drive them and those who use them are all voiceless to be bullied by the 'law' and herded like sheep by the raucous horns of the ever-growing car-owner's fraternity?//////Climbing up to the height of the Great Mount Everest by the first Bangladeshi, Musa Ibrahim, proves that our youth could make the impossible possible, if they have the goal and determination. It is an inspiring example for the nation, especially for the young generation who dare to dream of a change.//////As the football World Cup nears, football loving fans are becoming engaged greatly in preparing their favourite country's flag to hoist in order to demonstrate their individual staunch support for their favourite teams in the imminent World Cup. After every four years, it is like every house is studded with different countries' various colourful flags floating in the vacuum. Many fans are planning to make gigantic flags to show their great support towards their favourite team. While many others are making the provisions for electricity supply back up as our quarter digital country is going through a little dearth of electricity supply. Whatsoever, the point I want to make is that we exhibit our utmost staunch support by hoisting our favourite teams' flags during the season with a warm, enthusiastic heart, but during our Independence Day and Victory Day we do not show ourselves in the same mood. //////The state has inherited and taken up this critical business of power supply, a vital component of economic function in trade, commerce and industry; not to speak of its vital role in all spheres of our daily life! Priority of this vital sector which is as critical as defence has remained a persistent problem in Bangladesh!//////The prime minister has revealed that Begum Zia had called the government officials not to sign official files. This means she has instructed the government officials to abstain from work. In other words, this call is an instigation to the officials of the republic for non-cooperation and civil disobedience. Is it not tantamount to treason against an elected government? It has been trusted by the people and the officials are the machinery to implement all plans and programmes of the government.//////Apropos to the letter of May 21 "Historical facts" by Mr Satyaki Chanda of Kolkata, India. It may be correct that Lord SP Sinha was given a peerage and became Baron Sinha in the House of Lords as the first Bengali peer. He also mentioned Kumar Bhattacharya in 2004 but failed to mention Baroness Pola Manzil Uddin who became a Baroness in 1998 and thus became the first woman from Bangladesh to get the title. Recently, Rushanara Ali was directly elected to the House of Commons with a Labour Party ticket in the Bow and Bethnal Green constituency and became the first woman and Muslim to win a seat in the House of Commons.//////Well, here's a newsflash for everyone it's not just Facebook that contains such things, it can be found all over the Internet. So it begs the question, when will the Internet be banned in Bangladesh?//////Simple knowledge on light tells us that black colour absorbs all the seven colours of the light spectrum causing heat production and white colour reflects all the colours of light spectrum and keeps the immediate environment cool. That is the reason why people living in a desert ecosystem wears white head to knee garments to keep them cool. For some unknown reason our rooftop water tanks are made of black plastic and during the summer days it picks up all the heat from the sun and amplify the heat several times. This magnified solar heat, especially during hot summer days, would slowly dissolve small amount of plastic into the water contained in these black water tanks. Many of us boil this water and use it for drinking. I presume over the years, continuous consumption of water from these rooftop black water tanks is going cause serious harm to our health, particularly the growing children. If we are to use plastic rooftop water tank it is better to use white water tanks which would reflect heat during the hot summer days and much lesser amount of plastic would be released into our water. //////Student politics, no doubt, plays a very significant role in elevating political standards of a country and also in keeping political situation concern-free. It brings success as long as it remains within a level. //////We welcome the revision of the MPO list. The recently published SSC results and MPO distribution lists have given rise to many questions. Being a founder of a technical school and a senior academic, the same questions have arisen in my mind too. The school that has achieved 100% success with grade -A (minimum) was not in the initially circulated list. But the lucky ones in MPO list have lots of students who failed in SSC examinations. Even if we make a comparative study or survey in only one district, say Faridpur, a clear picture of disparities come out. The studies or survey can be conducted on the following points in addition to previous criterions; (a) Recent SSC results (b) Profile of founder with vision (c) Scope of science and technology education (d) Remoteness (e) Competence in social reformation and (f) Capacity for adaptation of science and technology to create Digital Bangladesh.//////We do hope that the prime minister will be an architect of a crime free Bangladesh.//////Afghan tribal elders discussed ways to reach out to the Taliban yesterday, despite a rocket and gunfire attack by the insurgents aimed at disrupting a national conference seeking an end to nearly nine years of war.//////The ruling Communists in the Indian state of West Bengal have suffered a major setback in the municipal polls.//////India and China are likely to bid for the Machine Readable Passport (MRP) contract for which the government had recently called tenders.//////India and the US hope to set new milestones as they hold their first strategic dialogue yesterday to transform their growing relationship into a global strategic partnership encompassing a broad range from political to economic to social ties.//////A prominent US Senator abruptly cancelled a trip to military-ruled Myanmar yesterday after new allegations that the junta is working with North Korea to develop a nuclear programme.//////French opposition lawmakers yesterday called on President Nicolas Sarkozy to give all details of any links to suspected kickbacks on arms deals allegedly used to fund political campaigns.//////A major cyclone was closing in on Pakistan's coastline, where the president ordered immediate precautionary measures and around 60,000 residents were being evacuated from Sindh province, officials said yesterday.//////The use of targeted killings with weapons like drone aircraft poses a growing challenge to the international rule of law, a UN official says.//////A Beatle met the president when Sir Paul McCartney performed at the East Room of the White House yesterday night.//////President Lee Myung-bak's party has suffered a surprising setback in local elections that were widely seen as a referendum on his handling of North Korea's alleged torpedoing of a South Korean warship.//////Hundreds of activists from a Turkish-led aid flotilla landed at Istanbul early yesterday, dazed and shaken after their ordeal but given a hero's welcome by thousands of cheering supporters waiting at the airport.//////The United Nations has demanded the Israel lift its blockade on Gaza immediately.//////Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday backed Israel's right to board ships bound for Gaza to prevent weapons smuggling, but said Washington remained concerned about the plight of Palestinians there.//////The Times calls him the 'Prime Minister's Office Wife', but Nick Clegg took no offence as Prime Minister David Cameron outlined his deputy's duties for the first time in parliament.//////Achieving the impossible is not much of a daunting task anymore. People are reaching out for their dreams and touching it too; from surviving the deadly cancer to probing Mars to climbing the Everest, dreams are coming true like these are mundane regular feats. But what we don't realise are the reasons for such achievements to be possible; people who make the impossible a reality are strong willed. They just don't know how to give up, they believe in themselves.

Mohiuddin Chowdhury is one of the most dynamic and performing mayor the city ever had, with the exception the of legendary late Nur Ahmed Chairman (He was Chairman of Chittagong Municipality for 33 years till he took voluntary retirement.)

It would perhaps not be an exaggeration to say that the attempt was the first of its kind to calculate the economic costs of //////. Later on, different agencies also followed the suit. //////THERE is a desperation which comes into the business of shutting down a newspaper. It is desperation which brings with it clear brush strokes of huge anger and inexplicable arrogance. When a government decides, in its questionable wisdom, that it is all right to dispense with a newspaper, that there are ways of forcing it off the stands, it does not quite convince people that it has learnt from history. In the post-modern society we are part, it is not expected that all of us will subscribe to the views of a newspaper or of a television channel. But all of us agree that there must be a diversity of views for the fundamental reason that we have little wish to see our democracy, or what passes for it, dwindle into illiberality bordering on the authoritarian. Democracies do not close doors. They open new windows and newer vistas. Elected governments do not suffer from a persecution complex. If they do, it is a social order that is threatened with chaos . . . because governments in such a state of mind go into doing all those things that take them farther and farther away from those they purport to govern.//////SIM tax stands as a major obstacle to the prospective customers as the newcomers will not be richer than the previous ones, says the chief of the second largest mobile operator in Bangladesh.//////Web search group Google Inc is phasing out internal use of rival Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system because of security concerns following a Chinese hacking incident, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.//////Helal Uddin, a biology teacher of a college in Sylhet, had to wait for months for his copy of different foreign journals to stay in touch with the latest activities in the research field.//////Nokia Siemens Network (NSN), a leading global enabler of telecommunications services, on Wednesday organised a two-day conference which was aimed at discussing with local customers subjects from the annual Mobile World Congress, held in Barcelona last February.//////
