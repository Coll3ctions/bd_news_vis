A well-documented report in this newspaper yesterday threw up all the insidious details of the way the forests have been ravaged over the last forty years and in their place have come projects ostensibly geared to development. Just how such so-called development programmes can wreak damage on nature has been made clear in the Madhupur forests. In the last four decades, as much as 85 per cent of the forests have vanished. That means the overall area of the forests has come down from 45,000 acres to a mere 8,000 acres today. In spaces where woodland trees and plants essential for herbal medicines used to be, there are today banana and pineapple plantations. More ominously, human settlements have also been set up in the forests, thus posing even more serious threats to the environment.//////IT seems that the wicked would stop at nothing to get what they want. A recent incident of kidnapping and unlawful confinement of a family of nine in old Dhaka amply illustrates the regrettable increase in the incidence of illegal grabbing of property, particularly of the vulnerable. In many such cases the predators use their political link to exert undue pressure on the victims. In this case, reportedly, force was used at the behest of a developer who had tried but failed to secure the property of the victims, and used force to lay their hands on the small piece of property, the only possession of the poor family. //////IT has been a bizarre experience to witness the furore over the question of transit during the recent months. The importance and urgency accorded to it have indeed a tinge of mystery. The question of transit was never a major item on our foreign policy agenda -- let alone a national issue -- although it could have existed in the peripheries of numerous policy discourses in the foreign office with regard to our bilateral relationship with India. From the hints dropped in recent years by several Indians of prominence, it could be established that India is interested in transit through Bangladesh.//////WITH the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, the kitchen markets in the capital have started to experience a magical rise in the prices of essentials. The government's move to hang a price chart at the kitchen markets in a bid to protect the consumers from the price cartels is not going to help in any way.//////Coach Maruful Haq yesterday vowed to help Mohammedan SC bring home the season's all three trophies, but admitted to feeling the pressure to deliver the elusive B.

The ship breakers are restraining the steel producers from entering due to their influence in the ministries. Because of this the people of Bangladesh are suffering through paying a high price for steel.

Every Muslim knows that killing an innocent person is compared to that of killing the whole humankind in Islam. From Islam we learn that a person cannot be a Muslim whose neighbour passes the night in hunger. Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) once told a young men that taking care of his old parents would be the best Jihad for him. Politeness, self-control, charity, generosity, manners, truthfulness and what not are elements of Islamic teaching. //////The other day Channel-i arranged a discussion with the students to get to the bottom of the causes of failure and the discussants were the Hon'ble Education Minister, Prof. Muhammad Zafar Iqbal and Mrs. Khusi Kabir. The students, among many other problems faced by them, referred to forcefully that they do not get proper attention of and support from their teachers in class teaching. The poor students blamed their fate as they could not afford money, they could not go to subject-wise coaching practised by the school/college teachers in their residences. The renowned personages above, though accepted the students' views, did shy away from finding fault with the teachers, and while advising the students stressed, among other things, the imperative of reading the text, first and last, instead of going through the guides for short-cut success. Question remains whose duty is it to make the students get the habit of reading the text to know things fully and find out the answers there from? //////I am writing in reference to Dhaka Medical College Hospital's visitors' fee introduction (source: The Daily Star; 11-08-09).

In the early eighties of last century some innovative and talented entrepreneurs of our country emerged on the scene with a new commodity for sale in the global market with a huge promise and that is today's RMG. Although faced with tremendous handicaps like absence of backward and forward linkage, poor infrastructure, perennial power-shortage, inefficient port facility and paucity of skilled professionals etc. the RMG industries on their own achieved a fantastic growth over the years. Today it is not only the biggest employer in the country but also it accounts for nearly 80% of our total export earnings, second only in volume to the earnings from our overseas workers. //////Through your daily I would like to thank our Honourable Finance Minister AKM Muhith for granting me an interview on 20th July, 2009. //////I came across the post-editorial bearing the above title in your daily dated 16 July 2009.

Mostly Chhatra League and Jubo League are involved in these incidents.//////Every day after getting up from bed when we have a look at the newspaper, killing, mugging, smuggling etc come to our eyes first. We get utterly surprised when we hear the news of the crimes taking place in broad daylight. Now our country is burdened with some major problems like poverty, and militancy. Again the country is in a precarious position over the issues like Tipaimukh dam, maritime boundary with its neighbouring countries. In this situation if the country is to struggle with its internal affairs, then it would be like a suicidal act. During the rule of the caretaker government, we experienced a drastic reduction of crime as most of the godfathers, top terrors were in jail. But now it's a political government and we feel the comeback of the top terrors with their notorious activities. So it is clear that these are none but the party men of the AL who are giving shelter to the criminals.//////Afghanistan's contested presidential election has the potential to lay the foundations for a political system in which opposing factions draw broad support and power changes hands at the ballot box.//////Leading Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah on Sunday claimed there was widespread rigging in last week's election in favour of the incumbent, President Hamid Karzai.//////Yemeni troops have killed more than 100 Shia rebels, including two of their commanders, in an operation to recapture a small town in the northern mountains, the government said yesterday.//////Tamil civilians who lived through the vicious final battle of Sri Lanka's separatist war are now locked in another struggle for survival with heavy rains bringing misery to the camps they call home.//////After its success in defeating the Tamil Tigers, the Sri Lankan army has agreed to train Pakistani military in tackling insurgency and offered the same to India.//////Powerful earthquakes that have jolted Asia recently do not presage a disaster, although it is only a matter of time before the next catastrophe befalls the quake-prone region, seismologists say.//////India Saturday offered its 'full support' to the peace process in Nepal, with both countries also saying they would hold discussions on reworking their Treaty of Peace and Friendship that was signed nearly six decades ago.//////The Taliban has declared a unilateral ceasefire in North Waziristan during the fasting month of Ramadan.//////Forest fire tore through suburbs north of Athens early Sunday, destroying homes and forcing thousands to flee in nighttime evacuations, fire service and local officials said.//////A report for Britain's Ministry of Defence leaked yesterday said the MoD's procurement programme was hugely inefficient and harming Britain's ability to fight enemies like the Taliban.//////North Korean envoys delivered a message from their leader Kim Jong-Il when they met South Korea's president Sunday, raising hopes of an end to high tensions that had sparked fears of military clashes.//////Keiko Saito's son-in-law recently lost his job and can't find another.

Opinion polls before the elections suggested that Karzai was leading, with 44 percent against 26 percent for Abdullah Abdullah. The second round is expected on October 1.//////IN the early 1990s, I was engaged in an empirical research work relating to the nexus between mobile phone and poverty in rural Bangladesh. However, friends used to tease me and raise their eyebrows on hearing about the project and my interest at that time. This was to be expected in the early 1990s when, not to speak of the poor, even the "solvent" could not afford to have a mobile set. It was treated as a "luxury" item, only to be monopolised by the moneyed people. //////
