That is because of the demands of the times, when modern technology has clearly become a trend in such a significant field as the economy. Besides, the fact that Bangladesh has traditionally been dependent on its agriculture as the mainstay of its economy makes it critically important that all manner of information regarding its various facets as well as its problems and prospects be kept in view. If the government is serious about developing a full-fledged database for farmers as a step toward providing the agriculture sector with inputs and other services, there are certain points which must be looked at first.//////IT is utterly disquieting that Dhaka, being the capital city of a developing country, has no modern taxicab service for citizens. Whatever exists in the name of the service is but a mockery that offers more pain than comfort to the helpless travelers. The dilapidated and ugly looking metal structures on wheels that ply on the city roads with total impunity are mostly run by unscrupulous people who fleece passengers at every opportunity as these vehicles do not have meters or any fixed fare charts. Often drivers join gangs of criminals at night to rob lone passengers. These gangs also operate a chain at the airports to force passengers in hiring their vehicles and at a fare determined by them taking advantage of their vulnerability. And it all happens because of an unprecedented lack of monitoring by any designated authority. //////THE series of earthquakes that shook the country recently have tumbled the nation into yet another grimmer kind of reality.//////THE south is another country, in just about every country. No one associates the north of France with holiday, cuisine or luxury. The north of Italy wastes its time in production, profits, brand-building, grumbling and fantasies of secession; the south goes to church, forgets to collect the garbage, remembers to collect tourists and has fun. Would Berlusconi ever build a private palace improved with Putin beds and exotic weekend guests in north Italy? //////A nation can achieve balanced growth and development if its government has the commitment and makes the effort to meet at least the basic needs of the people, which are food, shelter, clothing, healthcare and education. Non-availability or shortage of any one of the needs has an adverse impact on the others, and that results in imbalanced growth. Among the basic needs, education is extremely important.//////Bangladesh are determined to come back from Friday's shocking 69-run defeat as they meet recouping Zimbabwe in the fourth one-day international of the five-match series at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo today.//////Didier Drogba's injury-time goal - his second of the match - ensured Carlo Ancelotti enjoyed a winning start to his new life in the Premier League as Chelsea narrowly beat Hull City 2-1 here on Saturday.//////England's selectors withdrew uncapped batsman Jonathan Trott from the England Lions match with Australia as they gave a major clue as to their thinking for next week's final Ashes Test.//////Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal both exited the Montreal Masters on a historic day of ATP tennis Friday when the world's top eight reached the quarterfinals at the same event for the first time.//////Sheikh Russel KC will start their three-week conditioning camp at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan today ahead of the season's curtain-raising tournament, the Federation Cup which is scheduled to start on September 10.//////Sprinter Masudul Karim was eliminated from the 100m heat in the 12th IAAF World Championships in Berlin yesterday.//////The International Cricket Council (ICC) president David Morgan will meet Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt in Dubai on August 27 to resolve the issue of Pakistan's hosting rights for the 2011 World Cup.//////John Wright, a current New Zealand selector and former India coach, has confirmed he is in the running for the coach's position at the Kolkata Knight Riders.

That is the likeliest solution for the recent woes against short-pitched bowling that the selection committee will arrive at, when it sits to select the team for the tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy. This should work in the short term as immediate solidarity in the middle order, and also in the long term if Dravid can hang on for so long as the youngsters find their feet firmly.//////The head of Pakistan's blind cricketers on Saturday demanded that the sport's World Cup be shifted from England after the team was denied visas to play two series there.//////Brian Lara, the former West Indies captain, has confirmed he is in talks with the Trinidad & Tobago board about a role for him in T&T's Champions League campaign.

Not only that, he also took loan from a bank mortgaging that land, sources said.//////Holy Ramadan, the month of restraint, is coming for the Muslims. Although there is the practice of Fasting in all religions, but a month-long fasting associated with other rituals are unique. Ramadan fasting, if practiced fulfilling the recommended criteria, will purify the soul and contribute to leading a healthy life. In this connection it is the individual as well as the social responsibility of the Muslims to come forward to ensure that the spirit of the holy month of Ramadan is maintained to qualify themselves to receive the promised reward from Allah, the Almighty. Let us do away with our traditional practices that contradict the true spirit and teachings of Ramadan, e.g. some isolated Muslim sections start and end the Ramadan fasting a day earlier than the rest of the Muslim population of Bangladesh. Ramadan fasting is to be started and ended on moon sighting. Geographically, Bangladesh is a tiny county and there is a little time difference between different areas. So, moon-sighting time cannot differ so much that Ramadan can start on different days. We should remember that fasting is prohibited on the Eid day. So, all Muslims must be extremely careful on this matter and the government and the Islamic scholars have specific responsibility to bring unity on the issue.//////Bangladeshi cricketers have finally proved their worth whitewashing the West Indians in both Test and the one dayers recently.

We think it is a constructive suggestion which must be worked on. Unless there is penalisation, the danger of the canals being again targeted by encroachers will remain.//////Sometimes it seems that we take medicines to die. Different so-called pharmaceuticals are producing various items of medicines that are substandard. However, how they collect the licence to manufacture medicines for marketing purposes is a burning question to all. We know that corruption has spread all over the country, especially in all the branches of the government. //////All over the world, people are being displaced internally and externally due to conflict and persecution. Various reasons are there behind such conflict and persecution. Some people are being uprooted by racial attacks. Some are being compelled to take refuge due to civil war or political unrest and so on. Sometimes, across the globe, this conflict and persecution evict people from a large area. As a result, these harmless people are passing their days in great uncertainty.//////After the 1/11 changeover, the Anti-Corruption Commission could investigate corruption cases and it successfully apprehended many corrupt politicians, businessmen, and government officials.

The rest of the cases could not be completed due to time constraint of the caretaker regime.//////On August 6, 1945, an American bomber dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, obliterating the entire city. Two days later, another more powerful plutonium bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Facing total atomic annihilation, Japan surrendered. The atomic bomb was hailed for shortening the war, saving many American lives. It might have been true. But the real reason behind the A-bombing of Japan had been described by Dr. Leo Szilard, a top atomic scientist at the Manhattan Project.//////Mobile phone hijacking and stealing has become very common, especially in city areas. I can hardly find any mobile phone user whose mobile has not been either hijacked or stolen. In the last six months my wife lost three mobile phones and one of them was pick pocketed, one was hijacked and one was stolen. Moreover, some criminals threatened a businessman after stealing the phone which caused lot of troubles to us. In this regard, I would like to request the mobile phone companies to make a device so that the real owner of the mobile phone can stop using his or her mobile by informing the secret number to the relevant company after it is lost. Mobile companies always advertise their services but ignore one of their most important services for the users. //////I was watching the Bangladeshi television channel sitting at my home in UK. The news about BCL students clashing at Surya Sen Hall at Dhaka University particularly got my attention. //////Every day newspapers are full of news like 'declaring the fifth amendment illegal', 'Pilkhana carnage', 'criminal killed in shootout with Rab',' Ctg arms haul', 'ACC act to be reviewed',' Jesssore Udichi blast', 'War tribunal', 'Trial of war criminals', 'Militants issue' and many other issues like these. Legal news very often takes the place of lead news in the newspapers. Obviously, in a democratic country application of law is a routine matter. As if our life is immersed in the system of law like that of air around us. We take oxygen from air and likewise we take life support from the legal system. //////Inclusion of a number of young ministers in the cabinet by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reflects her farsightedness and goodwill to develop future leadership. Of course some are of the opinion that in this crucial time of global recession and diplomatic congestion, senior leaders should be given more importance in case of placement and deputation. Meanwhile, I believe that the young leadership opted for is appropriate. Moreover, those younger members who have been included in the cabinet are well qualified and energetic. Here I would like to mention the name of Dr. Shireen Sharmin Chowdhury who has recently been included in the cabinet as a state minister and given the responsibility of Children and Women Affairs Ministry. She possesses a strong academic background, intellectual ability plus excellent human relation skills.//////Nowadays, it is no use writing letters to the newspaper. It seems the persons responsible are not readers of the newspapers, nor do they bother about the grievances that we general people express through this page. The complaints, sufferings of the people fail to create any impact on their minds. //////A recent news item very prominently covered by some dailies has once again attracted my attention. You have tried your best to repeatedly bring this very dangerous practice of our fruit-traders to the front. I am sure, like on all previous occasions, such bold reporting will also go unnoticed by our authorities.//////In my office, during teabreak we usually go for tea and some snacks.
