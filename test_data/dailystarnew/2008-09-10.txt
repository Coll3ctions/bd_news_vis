Mr. Imran's objection is that Zakir Naik is not an evangelist in the dictionary definition of the word as it applies strictly to preachers of gospel. While Mr. Imran is not wrong, he's a little misguided about MJ Akbar's use of the term. You see, language is fluid, and words are used in various ways. MJ Akbar knows full well what the dictionary-definition of 'evangelist' is, but chose to use it loosely. One could for example, construct sentences like "Barack Obama is a prophet for change." Does that literally mean Obama is a 'prophet'? Of course not. Meanings of words flow freely, add to that often usage is ironic, derisive, purposefully exaggerated and so on. //////What a drama!!

And it was a very embarrassing moment for me because he discovered some obscene video clips of pornography on the brand new handset. I was insulted and punished. He seized the mobile phone set. I became a culprit in my parents' eyes. Moreover, I faced a lot of difficulties in the family.//////In the year 1999, the government recruited 4,000 senior staff nurses under the development budget. It is the government rule to transfer them from the development sector to the revenue sector automatically after three years of service.

He had, during his life time, held a number of responsible governmental and non-governmental positions - for example a secretary to government of Bangladesh and a president of the institution of engineers, Bangladesh. In addition, he was associated with certain international organisations. His contribution to development of Bangladesh, particularly in areas of rural advancement, are commendable and lesson bearing.
