Even so, there is in us that certain feeling that as governance improves and public sensibilities get to be more sharpened, such wrongdoing will be rolled back and the country can move on toward its desired goals. That being the sentiment, it comes as a shock for all us that some government staff have been involved in the crime of leaking question papers in return for dishonest financial gains. The crime we speak of concerns the Bangladesh Government (BG) Press taking place in Rangpur and involving a number of candidates for the position of assistant teachers at public high schools. As a report in this newspaper on Saturday notes, elements at the BG Press sold question papers related to an interview for the positions for a rather staggering amount of Tk. 25 lakh. The interview was, of course, cancelled as a consequence of the leak.//////JUST because one is an elected law-maker from the ruling party, one is not entitled to manhandling a police sergeant on duty, no matter what was the latter's perceived omission or commission, if any. It was a traffic jam in which the MP's car was stuck and he demanded an explanation from the policeman for something that was hardly of his own making. Even if it was, that would hardly have been a justification for any person, far less, a member of the incumbent party, to rough up a police man by slapping him in the face or otherwise hitting him. Apparently dissatisfied with what the policeman had to say, he reacted physically in a manifest arrogance of position. Mind you, this was done in wanton disregard for public norms, not to say placing hindrance in the way of a policeman at work. Or was he expecting that the sergeant would let his transport pass in breach of rules?//////The big-name players have fallen by the wayside, leaving the Netherlands and Spain, tactically, technically and temperamentally the teams of the tournament, to face off in a World Cup final that should be one for the soccer cognoscenti. //////Ajmal Shahzad marked his return to the England side with three wickets as Bangladesh were held to 236 for seven in the second one-day international here on Saturday.//////South Africa basked Saturday in the success of its trouble-free World Cup, as finishing touches were put to the closing ceremony with superstar Shakira and a herd of giant elephant puppets.//////There was time when the top-order was a cause for concern for Bangladesh.//////Spain's Premier League duo Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres have made late pleas to coach Vicente del Bosque to be included in the starting line-up for Sunday's World Cup final with Netherlands.//////Andres Iniesta, Xavi Hernandez and David Villa may be the media magnets as Spain prepare for the World Cup final against Netherlands on Sunday but Sergio Busquets is catching up fast.//////A - Africa.

We asked the young boy who waited on us, what was available. Off he went reciting rapid-fire, a list of tummy filling, yummy items. Anything light to eat? I asked. A chicken sandwich he suggested with a big smile, though a chicken kebab would be more palatable, he went on. So we settled for the kebab, which was done well and did taste more of spices than of chicken meat. Russel, as he was being called, brought in just the right sized mineral water bottle so there wasn't any waste. The hot cup of tea followed promptly. All said and done, with Russel's attention to details, the stoppage was a pleasant experience, quite unlike another experience I had on a similar journey. //////India's leading information technology exporters should report robust quarterly sales, thanks to improving demand from their mainstay financial clients, but Europe's debt crisis and rising salaries could cap their outlook.//////Wall Street closed out its best week in a year on Friday, snapping back from a long stretch of selling, as investors looked ahead to what many expect will be a solid earnings season.//////Canada's economy created six times more jobs than forecast in June, a near-record gain that pressures the central bank to raise interest rates again this month even as cracks in the U.S. recovery threaten to cool the country's scorching growth.//////Oil traded near 76 dollars in Asia on Friday, lifted by buoyant sentiment after the International Monetary Fund bumped up its global growth projections.//////Shaheda Begum has recently been promoted to general manager of Sonali Bank with a retrospective effect from September 4, 2003.//////United Airways has announced its plan to launch a Dhaka-Jeddah flight from July 29.//////Harley-Davidson has launched its first Indian dealership as it pitches the "freedom of the open road" in a nation with some of the world's most congested traffic, the US company said Saturday.//////India expects bumper foodgrain production this year that should help contain inflation after last year's worst drought in decades drove up prices, Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said Friday.//////YouTube announced Friday that it will invest five million dollars in promising video-makers.//////The European Central Bank's chief economist said Friday that the worst of the eurozone's economic crisis was over but warned other major economies their policies were unsustainable.////// //////This week the euro, sterling and yen all gained grounds against the US dollar, after data showed that there was a drop in the non-farm payroll last month. //////Bodies of three Bangladeshis, killed in a road accident in Canada on July 3, is scheduled to arrive here at 3:00am today, said family sources yesterday. //////A minor domestic help sustained burn injuries as her employer poured scalding hot water on her and locked her in a house at Khilbarirtek in city's Badda yesterday.//////The murder of a communist leader hit Nepal's peace process with a key meeting yesterday among the three top parties, that could have paved the way for a new government, being put off.//////Embassies in Sri Lanka have expressed dismay over an "intimidating" protest that has blockaded the United Nations compound in the capital.//////Speakers at a seminar yesterday urged the government to introduce a separate ministry for Human Resources Development as it is working for establishing digital Bangladesh by 2021.//////Police recovered the body of a female garment worker from a local clinic in the city's Kuril Badda area yesterday afternoon.

Witnesses said a poultry trader, purchasing those chicks from Usha Poultry and Hatchery of Dhaka, was going to Bhola through Laxmipur. On information, agitated poultry farm owners seized the chicks and set those on fire. The government fixed the price of one-day old broiler chicks at Tk 30 per piece and layer chicks at Tk 32 per piece but the hatchery owners are selling those chicks at the rate of Tk 70-75 per piece ignoring government's directive. National Committee of Poultry Farm Owners has been agitating for the last one week against the high price of chicks and poultry farm owners and also stopped purchasing chicks.//////A front page lead report, on this important matter was published in a local English daily on June 29. It very rightly highlighted the need for an urgent solution to the illegal land encroachment that has jeopardised the natural rainwater drainage system of greater Dhaka.//////With the sad and humiliating exit of Brazil and Argentina, World Cup football has, to a certain extent, lost its flavour in certain parts of the world and Bangladesh in particular. //////In schools, it is the uniformity of dress, shoes, belts, ties, etc., that creates an atmosphere of oneness among children, irrespective of the background they hail from. Once in college, all hell seems to break loose with children of rich families flaunting their wealth that includes wearing expensive and fashionable dresses, using costly mobile phones, and spending lavishly in the canteens. This hurts the feelings of the not-so-rich, leading to factionalism, ill-will, and unhealthy competition. Affluent students can indulge in extravaganza outside their colleges but ostentatious display of wealth should not be allowed on campuses. Colleges, therefore, should have uniforms; ban the use of mobile phones within the college precincts; ban students from bringing two- and four-wheelers to colleges. Such measures will go a long way in bringing about equality and uniformity and improvement in the academic environment.//////Once beautiful Dhaka is facing lots of challenges and myriad problems. Noise pollution, beyond any doubt, is a matter of great concern as it has already exceeded the tolerable limits.//////It was perhaps worst day for the Bangladeshi viewers watching Brazil going down to Holland. The referring looked good but not above controversy if you look at the equalizer by Holland. The second match between Ghana and Uruguay was a classic football drama to watch. It was nerve wrecking for the players and the viewers all over the world. In this match too referring was not beyond controversy.//////More than a year ago a picture that was published in all major daily news paper focused on Madam Khaleda Zia wailing at the bedside of her politician son---Tareque Zia at PG Hospital where she went soon after her release from the confinement. Tareque Zia was there under treatment for his injury that was inflicted upon him, as claimed by Madam Zia due to political rivalry. A mother's natural sympathy forced her to cry openly and she pleaded that Tareque was sick and he would not be in politics again until he recovered from the sickness. Tears rolled down her cheek. It was painful to see.//////Two very pathetic incidents have hugely shaken our society.

With the passage of time over the years things have changed but this concept of leadership continues. Though democracy is in vogue but the colonial concept of leadership remains. The son of the king becomes the king; this concept is very much deep rooted in the minds of the people. So long this concept remains in practice, Bangladesh shall not achieve progress in the true sense of the word.//////A news item in The Daily Star (July 2nd, 2010 Page 12, Column 1-4) says, that a four-story building at MAG Osmani Medical College in Sylhet was lying idle for more than three and a half years. This building was intended for the ICU unit and a large casualty ward. For the functioning of the building two other components were necessary, i.e. the urgent need for the medical supplies and the instruments, and the doctors and nurses and ancillary staff, down to the cleaners. For the success of the above project, there had to be necessary co-ordination, for all the three needs. Failure of co-ordination is a complete waste of our own very scare resources. The above instance can be found in hundreds of our own projects. What is the remedy? A good management team is not enough. //////I have been applying for IPOs for some time but unfortunately I am so far unsuccessful in all my attempts. But what is causing me pain is the manner in which the refund warrants are issued in cases where the amounts could not be credited to the account online.//////Recent deaths in police custody particularly in Dhaka city are highly disturbing. A suspected drug dealer was tortured to death in front of his minor son. It was not only inhuman, rather sadistic in nature. Another small business owner was arrested from his own rented house and later killed in a so called encounter. In both the cases there are allegations of demand of bribe. The media has rightly highlighted the incidents. The authorities instituted inquiries. But recurrence of such incidents is shaking public faith in law enforcing agencies. The government's image is being tarnished. It appears that the chain of command and discipline in police is on the wane. Political leadership in the ministry appears caught in the bureaucratic entrapment legalising all the misdeeds. Perhaps a major shake- up is necessary. //////I'm a Bangladeshi national living in Italy. I have resident permit for Italy which will expire soon. But now Italian immigration department is not receiving any application to renew resident permit with the hand written Bangladeshi passport. Currently, they accept only Machine Readable Passport.//////A careful look at the political state of affairs in Bangladesh will substantiate an argument that the Sheikh Hasina regime is a continuation of the military-backed interim government that had ruled the country for about two years, before her party came to power. Sheikh Hasina and many of her party people were jailed and tortured during those two years, and she claimed that there had been an attempt on her life through mixing poison with her food. Her statement in this regard can be interpreted in two ways: 1. She made the statement to gain public sympathy, which explains why she is not taking any action against those who wanted to kill her 2. Her statement is true, but she is unable to take any action, as she is not in command of the affairs of Bangladesh. //////The Finance Minister Mr. A.M.A. Muhith has hinted that price of electricity will be hiked. This has created panic in the industrial sector. The textile sector is already hard hit due to price hike of yarn in the recent months.//////I feel happy to see that the government is going to amend laws in order to uphold the honour of the country's national flag which is the symbol of our nation.

For a month every year, Choita turns insane. The villagers exploit Choita and make him do all kinds of chores. But when he turns mad, he is shunned by all. Even when he goes without food for days, no one comes to his aid. The drama serial Choita Pagol narrates his story.//////Music and football fans are in for a real treat.

And in that, either or both of the men, who have masterminded their team's run to the final, will be hailed as great managers and toasted across their respective countries. //////CONSIDER the irony. Britain's Conservative-led ruling coalition has just abandoned plans for a third runway at London's Heathrow airport, which Prime Minister David Cameron was keen on. In India, the supposedly pro-aam aadmi United Progressive Alliance government has built a lavish, Rs.12,700-crore, nine-level, chrome-and-glass terminal at Delhi airport.//////TODAY is World Population Day. This year, World Population Day highlights the importance of data for development. Demographic data provide an essential evidence base for the development and evaluation of policies. The bottom line is that "a country cannot develop without data." Although the term "data" has technical overtones, there is a fundamental connection between good data and good governance. //////In recent years, I have read a number of highly critical articles in the Western media about the Chinese economic policy: that it is creating a bubble economy, that it is ego-centric and not contributing to world economic recovery, that its currency policy is unfair and is designed not only to increase its exports (goods) but also to import (some use the expression "steal") jobs from around the world. One of the critics, James Chanos, a wealthy hedge fund investor thinks that its economy is hyper-stimulated and it will soon implode. In his words: "China is Dubai times 1,000 -- or worse."//////AFTER the government came to power, democracy experienced a worrisome deterioration. As a democratic developing country, it has been dealt a hard blow from the economic crisis. Spread across in every sector, Bangladesh occupies the world's political "middle ground." Because many issues receive significant attention from international leaders, the challenges its government faces raise serious questions about the prospects for fostering development, deepening democratic roots, and expanding effective governance.//////
