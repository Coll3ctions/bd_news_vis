In my opinion a thorough investigation should be initiated concerning the death of the two collared tigers. Mr. Sirajul Hossain's article uncovers some serious issues regarding the drug used to tranquillise the tigers. Also the method of snaring the tiger before tranquillising should be strongly opposed. There is more than enough evidence in the film by BBC to initiate and pursue a legal proceeding for the neglect shown to the collared tigers. After the death of the first collared tiger, the reason given for death was old age (the tiger died after seven months). If old age was the reason for death, then why was an old tiger collared in the first place? The fate of the second tiger according to the people involved in the collaring process is unknown, but the fate of the second tiger is clearly visible in the BBC documentary "Ganges". It is dead. Why is the collar being removed by re-darting a very sick tiger in the film? //////On 14 March, parliamentary elections took place in Iran. From all evidences, it is clear that the election was a phoney one which has been stage managed by the Shia Mullahs to tighten their grip on power. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, who came to power in 2005 on a populist platform that promised a better life for Iran's poor, has, three years later, failed to deliver. Despite Iran's enjoying a boom from rising oil prices, unemployment and poverty remain extremely high, while the government has been diverting funds for military and nuclear energy. If discontent over the economy is the only visible sign of opposition to the Iranian state, it is because all other forms of opposition, be they political, ideological, and religious or social, have been brutally silenced.//////Islam, unlike other religions, strictly adheres to prayers being offered in a totally peaceful atmosphere and in complete silence signifying voluntary surrender to Almighty and it cannot be a religion that would promote violence and terrorism, as propagated by the West. Rather, Islam preaches and follows a peaceful propagation of the tenets of the religion and peaceful co-existence right from the days of the Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh). //////It is very heartening to hear that the caretaker government is making all out efforts to undo the irregularities associated with allotment of plots in Rajuk's 3rd phase of Uttara. It has already cancelled allotment of plots that were found to be allotted beyond lawful means by the previous government. I would like to urge the present government to consider the following while re-allotting the plots in Uttara://////I refer to the recent letters published in your daily on the above subject. Go to any post office in Dhaka or any other city, you will be appalled to see the situation. Generally, the post offices are over crowded with people standing in long queues. The staff at the counters work with a glum face and it is clear that they are ill fed/under nourished. Therefore, they are just doing their jobs reluctantly.//////There are many street boys in our country. They don't have any identity. Their identity is the street.

As we start for our workplace early in the morning we get stuck up in long rows of vehicles. The huge line of vehicles inches onward, causing irritation to the commuters who travel by bus or CNG run baby taxies. In some thoroughfares it is the rickshaws that are responsible for traffic congestion. Private cars also add to the already aggravated traffic situation. Again drivers often disregard traffic rules, giving rise to a chaotic situation.//////What the Clinton supporters are saying makes no sense at all. How can you lose the race and still say, "Oh, I think you should be my Vice President..." Secondly, why would the Clinton campaigners even want Obama as a Vice President...a VP will take the president's spot if something happens, so that person should be able to run the country in case of emergency. If Obama, according to them, can't be the commander-in-chief, why would they think it is all right for him to be the Vice presidenthypocritical! I have been watching the race very closely. It's not rocket science. The sooner the majority of America realises that, the better!//////It seems that the newspapers do not consider high rent of apartments a burden for the ordinary service holders staying in Dhaka. Recently, all the house owners in Dhaka increased the house rent by almost 50 percent and there is no report on this matter in the press. Only the rise in price of essentials is reported but this aspect of cost of living is not at all reported. Now an ordinary service holder spends more than 70 percent of his salary on rent only. The existence of the middle class in Dhaka will be threatened by house rent increase, if no remedial measures are taken immediately.//////Florida will not redo its voided presidential nominating primary Democratic party officials said Monday, as the agonizingly close campaign contest between bitter rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton plays on. //////Malaysia's Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi unveiled a slimline new cabinet yesterday, dropping veteran politicians and appointing fresh faces after unprecedented election losses. //////The Dalai Lama yesterday vowed to resign as leader of Tibet's exiles if violence back home worsened, just hours before his aides said 19 people were killed in new demonstrations. //////The death toll from a bomb attack near a revered Shiite shrine in the central Iraqi city of Karbala has risen to 52, a health official told AFP yesterday.//////A UN policeman in Kosovo has died of injuries suffered in rioting by Serbs, police said yesterday as Nato tried to restore calm after the worst violence since Kosovo's independence declaration. //////Tourists to Europe will have to fork out more as currency fluctuations mean they will be visiting some of the world's most expensive cities, researchers from Swiss bank UBS said yesterday. //////A schoolgirl and a policeman were killed in a bomb attack against a girls' school near the US embassy in the Yemeni capital yesterday, police said, describing it as a criminal incident. //////An ultra-nationalist Israeli rabbi was lightly wounded yesterday after being stabbed near the Damascus gate into annexed east Jerusalem's Old City, police said. //////Iraq's feuding sectarian factions yesterday began a conference aiming to resolve their differences amid international concern that insufficient progress has been made toward national unity. //////A German court yesterday upheld a regional ban on teachers wearing the headscarf in public schools, rejecting the complaint of a convert to Islam. //////Jordan appealed yesterday for more aid to assist neighbouring countries sheltering hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees uprooted by war, saying the solution lies in their return home. //////Insurgents killed at least seven people in attacks across Iraq yesterday, including two policemen in Baghdad, security officials said. //////A strong 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the Kermadec Islands north of New Zealand yesterday, the US Geological Survey said. //////Suspected separatists fatally shot 11 migrant workers in three separate attacks in India's remote northeast, police said yesterday.//////Belgian political parties struck a deal yesterday on a programme for a coalition government under Christian Democrat Yves Leterme, who will take the reins on Thursday, the Flemish leader said. //////A judge criticised the estranged wife of Beatles legend Paul McCartney as "less than candid" in a ruling on the couple's bitter divorce battle released yesterday. //////I've always been fond of, had the knack for watercolours, admits effacing Professor Hamiduzzaman Khan, whose solo exhibition is on at Galleri Kaya (House 20, Road 16, Sector 4, Uttara).

In fact, Bangabandhu's government started prosecuting the perpetrators of crimes against humanity or war criminals immediately after independence, and he also passed the Collaborators Act (1972) and the International Crime Act of 1973 that barred re-entry of any collaborators into Bangladesh. Sheikh Mujib promulgated the Special Tribunal Order on January 24, 1972, fourteen days after his return from Pakistani.//////THE National Policy for Women's Advancement 2008 was made public on March 8, which was International Women's Day. The first national women's advancement policy was prepared in 1997 with the active participation of, and in cooperation with, different women's organisations and civil society groups and activists. But that policy was challenged in 2004 as the then government in power made some changes in the 1997 policy, which went against the spirit of the women's rights movement in Bangladesh. That was vehemently protested by all quarters. Consequently, the then government in power was forced do away with the changes.//////BIMAN, the national flag carrier of Bangladesh thinks it will fly again.
