One of the main reasons of this rapid depletion of gas reserve is the misuse of gas in every sector. People as well as government are equally responsible for this terrible situation. Too many people do not turn off their gas burners to save a matchstick! //////Global warming is now major issue. It can only be countered if people stop pollution, stop harmful gas emissions by reducing the large number of industries that emit harmful gases including sulphur dioxide, carbon mono-oxide and also many other gases that severely affect the environment.

In your "Star business, the news was published on 18 January, and drew my attention.//////The Secretary General of the BNP and his party members are talking about selling of Bangladesh to India, ever since India and Bangladesh signed a joint declaration following the visit of Sheikh Hasina. They know it very well that a country cannot be sold in a market. Therefore, if the BNP takes the liberty to spread lies, they must be prepared to listen to any kind of allegation against them in response to their wild and untrue allegations against the government.//////A write-up on the interesting subject was published in a local English daily on January 21st. However, the writer was not very clear on the subject matter.

Look at the way Ashraful batted in the second Test. I would like to drill it into the minds of the BCB for the last time that "ASHRAFUL WILL NEVER CHANGE". I am not a cricket player, but even I have enough common sense to realize that Bangladesh were four early wickets down and survival was the key. How many times has he gotten himself out like this? It's no use swinging your bat around in anger and cursing. What he should have done was take off his helmet and given himself a good whack in the head! It is because of people like Ashraful that Sehwag stated that Bangladesh is an ordinary side. Ashraful does not care about his team and plays for his own performance. I also disagree with Jamie Siddons that there are no replacements for Ashraful. What about Aftab Ahmad, Alok Kapali or the other ICL players? I was also surprised to see the way Shakib played a wide delivery to get himself out. This is not expected from a top international player. //////In the last IPL auction we saw that top all rounder Shakib al-Hasan and all Pakistani players were neglected by the IPL selectors. The quality of these players cannot be questioned. //////This is to thank The Daily Star for its dedicated website. Four years back my first-ever letter to any newspaper was published in The Daily Star on its 6 October, 2006, issue. Ever since that letter was published, people's outlook about me and my own outlook about life totally changed quite a lot. But unfortunately, I completely forgot the day and the month of the publication and was confused about the year, while I have been in great need of that Daily Star issue recently. As I forgot the day and month of the publication, I was rummaging through the old issues of The Daily Star but to no avail. Tired, I was almost giving up the hope of retrieving the letter anymore when I luckily came across the search box and thus, to my utter happiness, found what I was looking for so long. Mere words are not enough to express my rapture upon looking at my old letter. //////It is very pathetic that we don't hesitate to kill our national animal The Royal Bengal Tiger. I was struck with wonder to hear that at a village in Sathkhira the local people killed our pride The Royal Bengal Tiger. In fact, the forest department personnel are not skilled enough, therefore when a tricky situation arises things go beyond control. Moreover, the way we are cutting down trees and destroying forests, the animals will soon have no place. //////Some insiders tell us different stories about Bapex and BGFCL's capacity and performances.

Scheduled departure time of the flight was 2000l.t. The flight was fairly over booked resulting in gradation and adjustment of overflow of passengers. Besides some of the passengers also do report later than 45 minutes before the departure time. So airlines at times do have to close check-in counters late for fear of losing revenue. Moreover, most airlines are cash strapped these days. However at about 1920l.t. when I was being checked in, a group of 5-6 checked-in passengers turned up desperately at the counter after being refused entry at the gate by the airport security staff, under instructions of the shift immigration officer in charge, because of their late reporting. I got startled. The GF traffic officer at first rebuked them for late reporting at the gate but later on pacified them by saying to go back and wait near the gate. //////Smoking is not only hazardous for human health, but also detrimental for the atmosphere of our very own planet where we all live in.

Nurul Absar's letter published on the 25th of January, proposing abolishment of a visa system between India & Bangladesh.//////In the on-line poll survey, the readers opined against the duty free car privilege to be given to the MPs. I think the government should take note of this poll survey and reconsider its decision regarding giving the privilege to the MPs. If the government ignores the result of survey, it may have to pay the price later on, as the survey result is the reflection of people's mind.//////Any meeting between President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama would harm bilateral relations, China warned yesterday while repeating Beijing's refusal to discuss Tibet's status with the spiritual leader's envoys.//////Egypt yesterday welcomed statements by Hamas leaders that they were ready to seal a unity deal with the rival Fatah faction but said Cairo's blueprint for Palestinian reconciliation was not up for negotiations.//////The 33 infants and children that an American Christian group tried to smuggle out of quake-hit Haiti are being reunited with their families, the US-based aid group now caring for them said yesterday.//////A spasm of bloodletting by drug gangs claimed at least 46 lives over a long weekend in Mexico, including at least 16 young people gunned down at a high school party, officials said.//////Iran yesterday criticized the US move to boost the defensive missiles system in Gulf Arab countries against potential strikes by Tehran, calling it a political ploy to increase American military presence in the region.//////The Pakistani Taliban said yesterday that there is no need to release proof that the group's leader is alive to refute reports that he died from injuries sustained in a US drone strike in mid-January.//////Sri Lanka should end the indefinite detention of some of the 11,000 people held in its custody for suspected links with the Tamil Tiger rebels, a leading rights group said yesterday.//////Republican and Democratic hopefuls will duke it out in a primary election yesterday for the chance to win a potent symbolic prize: President Barack Obama's former US Senate seat.//////US President Barack Obama has proposed a USD 3.2 billion assistance for Pakistan for fiscal 2011, a substantial jump in American aid to that country.//////Four Nato soldiers have been killed in bomb attacks in Afghanistan, defence officials say.//////A South African presidential spokesman yesterday called a newspaper story that the country's polygamist leader had fathered a child out of wedlock "a private, personal issue" without confirming or denying the report.//////Ten Ugandans are suing the British government for crimes committed by colonial officers during a late 19th century war in the northwest of the country, the group's lawyer told AFP yesterday.//////Under attack from Shiv Sena for his remarks on the IPL fiasco, Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan said he was not apologetic for favouring the inclusion of Pakistani players and termed the activities of the party as "undemocratic".//////Every part of India belongs to every Indian, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi said yesterday while hitting out at the Shiv Sena for its 'Mumbai for Marathis' slogan and asserted that he would not remain silent if migrant workers in Maharashtra were subjected to violence.//////Aung San Suu Kyi may be freed during the national elections in Myanmar, Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya said yesterday, predicting that the polls could be held during the second half of 2010.//////The death toll in continuous political violence in Karachi has touched 24 with six more deaths being reported from different part of the city.//////Prosecutors have said a Pakistani woman accused of shooting at US agents was determined to kill them, in the closing arguments of her trial in New York.//////Five American terrorism suspects alleged yesterday in a message on tissue paper that they were tortured by the FBI and Pakistani police trying to frame them, the latest wrinkle in a case that has added to sensitivities in US-Pakistani relations.//////With an aim to generate awareness against social injustice, the weeklong National Street Theatre Festival has begun at the Central Shaheed Minar premises on February 1.
