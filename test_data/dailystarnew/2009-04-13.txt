This time they spent 3 days but couldn't locate any Broadbill. However, they were able to rescue a rare primate: Slow Loris (Lajjaboti Banor in Bangla). WTB member Enam Ul Haque and researcher Samiul Mohsanin bought it for Tk 500 and released at the same place where a local had captured the primate the night before they arrived. We feel that a countrywide campaign against capturing and killing of our threatened wildlife need to be seriously addressed.

A 16-member committee is working at it. As stated by the education minister, the new policy would aim at improving the present state of education at all levels, giving special emphasis on setting up institutions for providing vocational education at all upazilas across the country. Theoretically, all this sounds good, but we wonder whether he is living up to his own criticism of the culture of frequent shifts in policies by himself initiating yet another policy. //////A summit of ASEAN leaders was aborted in the Thai beach resort of Pattaya on Saturday when hundreds of supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra descended on the venue to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. Obviously, it was an embarrassing sight in full view of the world and it certainly put Thailand's embattled government to shame. The incident clearly shows the pitfalls the country's fledgling democracy has been up against, especially since a coup in September 2006 deposed Thaksin and replaced it with what has come to be seen as unending chaos.//////IT goes to the AL's credit that it has been able to establish itself as a pro-people, secular and progressive political outfit. The public was never found wanting in passionately backing the AL throughout its chequered history. It had the unique privilege of drawing popular support which, in fact, sustained the party through the vicissitudes of time. //////IF the proverb "All that glitters is not gold" needs an example, the city of Dhaka might be a good example. It has skyscrapers, dazzling shopping malls, big business houses, posh golf courses, expensive Japanese, American and European cars, eye catching fast-food shops -- all that is needed for a city to look modern. Yet, it does not have the basic requirements of a modern city.//////LAST week, US Attorney General Eric Holder moved to dismiss several counts of corruption charges against former Alaskan Senator Ted Stevenson after discovering evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in his conviction. //////Everyone was in for a big surprise at yesterday's press conference at the Kurmitola Golf Club (KGC), organised by the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) to confirm a deal worth Tk 4.5 core with Bashundhara Group. //////A total of 100 schools will participate in the National School Football Championship, which will kick off on May 2 across the country.//////With the much-needed final nod from Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) the sports organisers of Chittagong has gladly taken the challenge to launch Bangladesh version of Twenty20 cricket styled PCL (Port city Cricket League).//////Chief of Army Staff and National Sports Council (NSC) chairman General Moeen U Ahmed said that the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) has been solely allotted to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) for training and matches.//////Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar believes beating Australia in the limited-overs series in the UAE would help send a strong message to other nations to tour Pakistan.

Bangladesh is a tropical country where difference of day and night time is not too wide. Sun shines 10 to 12 hours in daytime around the year. As such advancing the clock by an hour will not be useful for us. The concept of day light saving is very much correct and we should utilise it in a customised way but not by advancing clock time. This is not also practised in our neighbouring countries India and Pakistan. We can do it by designing and constructing houses and offices very much accessible to daylight. In contrary to that we see that houses and offices have no access to light, even in secretariat building windows and doors are covered by heavy curtains to make artificial dark and then light it with many unnecessary decorative lights consuming a huge amount of electricity. We should immediately stop this culture to get the benefit of daylight.//////I am really disappointed to know that our government is planning to raise primary education to Class VIII. As an ex-student of Bangladesh Primary School, I would like to share the following with the readers, policy makers and concerned institutions. The Simon Fraser University, Canada conducted a study in 2006, the author was Sandra Nikolic, titled "Educating the future: Raising the quality of primary schooling in Bangladesh". This study investigates the low quality of primary school education in Bangladesh. Elite interviews suggest that GoB (Government of Bangladesh) primary schools fail to provide students with quality education, demonstrate poor teacher performance, have overcrowded classrooms, and weak management and administration. Quantitative analysis of parents with primary-aged children reveals that of the four principal primary schooling options available, public primary schools are more likely than other primary schooling options to exhibit components of poor quality. The findings indicate that parents are equally concerned about male and female education; that administration functions are a matter of concern, and that poverty is an overarching barrier to attendance and retention rates. The important policy message is the need for establishing a system of accountability of school performance to parents and communities. All stakeholders, in turn, should be involved in partnerships affecting primary school conditions.//////Khwaja Yunus Ali Medical College and Hospital is a world-class hospital situated in a rural char area in Enayetpur, Sirajganj. The vision and mission of the hospital is to give gold standard service to the poor at a minimum cost. At this moment, the cancer institute adjacent to the hospital is the pioneering cancer treatment centre in Bangladesh and the service is unique in nature in South and South East Asia. The patients do not need to go to Singapore or India because a minimum cost helps the cancer patient to survive. The hospital has varieties of specialty and also has specialty in heart surgery. All types of cardiac surgery are performed here at one-third cost, compared to private hospitals in Dhaka. //////We've talked a lot about the guidebooks menace so far; we've talked and written a lot on the mushrooming coaching centres and their activities in the name of inculcating knowledge to the students at large. Yet, very unfortunately, we haven't been able to stop the guidebook business in the open perimeter of the institutions and beyond --- they are being printed and sold out to the students. It is unfortunate because most of the guidebooks, as it has been reported frequently, are full of mistakes, haphazard organisation of ideas, and most tragically, misleading. Despite the government's ban on the guidebooks they are on the open platter in the markets for the education pursuers. //////All dailies in a front-page news report on 1st. April covered the DMCH incident triggered by BCL's violence on the campus. It is a poor reflection on the AL's management capabilities. If they cannot manage their party's activities; how can they manage the various problems of Bangladesh?//////The glorious past of student politics is now waning because of present so-called student politics. Student politics is now a horrendous proposition. Today student politics means extortion, tender hijacking, admission business, occupying dormitories, taking free-meals, seat politics, controlling campus, chanting slogans in favour of their god fathers or so called leaders etc. Not an iota of activities in favour of general students is visible. So, why is student politics prevailing on campus? Obviously, not for students, but for the ruling party and the opposition. //////The boy with a bright future is gone. He has left all of us and has gone to such a place from where he will never ever come to us. Sayem, a brilliant Dhaka University student of Psychology, was like my younger brother. He passed away on April 8, 2009 after suffering from cancer for almost a year. We met a couple of times and I have always found this boy sober and calm. He was ambitious and was always optimistic. He always looked at the positive sides of life. Even, the last time when I met him at the hospital a couple of weeks ago, he was hopeful and positive that he would recover soon and start attending his classes again. I was shocked when I heard about his death. It was unbearable for me to witness the death of such a young optimistic boy. Now, I can only tell myself, Sayem, my brother, today you are no more with us, but your memories will always be in our hearts and we pray to the Almighty for your eternal peace. //////This is in reference reply to my letter by A. Bashar, published on April 10, 2009. The writer accused me of charging smokers in a wholesale manner in my letter, disregarding the tobacco act. My point is that when a doctor examines a patient suffering from tobacco related diseases he never asks whether the patient had smoked cigarettes maintaining tobacco code or not or whether he had smoked in the public places or private places designated by the government. It seems the writer is a supporter of smoking and I had hurt his sentiment by comparing the smokers with terrorists and by appealing to the present government which initiated the anti-smoking law to enforce the same very strictly. Smoking is harmful and injurious to health which may cause death as is evident from the statutory warning on every cigarette packet. //////When a new party assumes power, their student wing is found to be in a hurry to regain control over all the educational institutions, defeating other student wings. After that they start to fight among the groups of their own parties. They always try to reign supreme on the campus. Why do they adopt such a policy? Actually, it is a profitable business. The student wing of the ruling party tries to control all activities and take a big share of money spent on different projects. //////Recently, the government disclosed the names of officials seeking clemency from the Truth and Accountability Commission (TAC). But the officials opted for voluntary disclosure with confidentiality guaranteed by the then government. Disclosure of their identity was indeed not fair to them. //////The Construction Act gazetted on 27th May 2008 and published on 29th May 2008, is no doubt appreciable in many a respect, but the new floor area ratio (FAR) seems to be unrealistic, in the context of our availability of land mass. The FAR table deserves revision for the benefit of the small landowners. As per the FAR, small landowners possessing up to 10 katha or less have to keep almost 50% of the plot vacant all around to conform to the new regulations. It is simply not feasible to construct a liveable house by the land owners/developers on the plots measuring up to 5 katha or less. We have come to know through media that large number of applications filed by such landowners is pending, awaiting approval of the offices of Rajuk in view of above provisions. //////Referring to the report in your daily on 6th April on a comment by the agriculture minister, "Prices of rice had been between Tk 9 and Tk 9.50 a kg during the tenure of the last AL government between 1996 and 2001, which increased to Tk 22 to Tk 23 during the BNP regime." Such a comment to prove the weakness of an opponent is not judicious. //////Income tax & Value Added Tax (VAT) of a business is assessed on the basis of sale or turnover. This is unbelievable but believe it that in Bangladesh the sale or turnover of a business is always assessed twice by two different govt. departments & the sale or turnover figure assessed by the two departments for the same business is always different. This funny thing is happening because Income tax & VAT is assessed by income tax & customs departments respectively and there is no co-ordination between the two departments. As a result, a businessman is harassed twice for the same business, which is completely unnecessary. //////Some time back, prices of oil were up for a while for which a transport company raised their bus fare from Dhaka to Chittagong and vice versa from Tk. 465 to Tk. 565 for non executive seats. Has the BRTA any consideration of such factors on which a reasonable bus fare is to be decided? //////An exceptional book 'After the Road Accident' was available in the last book fair by Akota Prokash. It's an outstanding novel that focuses on the tragic occurrence of a road accident and its inevitable consequences on a person's life against the background of our socio-economic and cultural reality. This novel is written by Akash Pradip. The language of this novel is extremely simple. Any ordinary person can read this novel. //////He was a General and still a General and acted like a great General. He demonstrated his courage, a rarity in our country's context. He did not compromise with what appeared bad. He did the right thing to quit his position, being helpless as a lone soldier to fight. Only a few people are happy and many are not. His sincerity and honesty of purpose and integrity are beyond any question. He is a decent man also. Hats off to him. //////Thailand's deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban yesterday appealed directly to soldiers and police to act to enforce a state of emergency.//////Mohammed Ajmal Amir Iman, accused of being part of a 10-man group that attacked the Indian city of Mumbai, was ripe for recruitment by Islamist militants, police and security experts say.//////US President Barack Obama Saturday asked nations around the world to come together to solve global problems like a recession, climate change, nuclear proliferation and international terrorism that has claimed innocent lives 'from Manhattan to Mumbai'.//////Afghan and international forces killed 40 Taliban militants in separate battles in the troubled country, authorities said yesterday.//////Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger chief Velupillai Prabhakaran, who is said to be facing a military rout at the hands of the government troops, has "agreed to a rescue mission by a western country," a state-run media report said Sunday.//////Some 150 militants armed with rockets and automatic weapons attacked a northwest Pakistani terminal that lies along a key supply route used by US and Nato troops, wounding three guards and torching eight cement trucks yesterday, police said.//////Iranian parliament speaker Ali Larijani said yesterday world powers must accept the Islamic republic as a nuclear power as top officials vowed no let-up in Tehran's sensitive uranium enrichment drive.//////Nineteen American sailors who escaped a pirate hijacking off the Horn of Africa reached safe harbour on Saturday, exhilarated by freedom but mourning the absence of the captain they hailed for sacrificing his freedom to save them.//////Israel's hawkish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to hold talks with the Palestinians, in his first remarks on the troubled Middle East peace process since taking office.//////Conservationists have discovered a new population of orangutans in a remote, mountainous corner of Indonesia perhaps as many as 2,000 giving a rare boost to one of the world's most endangered great apes.//////It's decided: the Obamas have chosen a 6-month-old Portuguese water dog to be the first pet.//////Muslims in Andhra Pradesh are likely to throw their weight behind the ruling Congress party in the elections to parliament and the state assembly.//////Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee will share the campaign platform with Congress president Sonia Gandhi April 27 at a rally in West Bengal's Jangipur, from where External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee is seeking re-election to the Lok Sabha.//////Middle-class professionals have been spurred into standing in India's general elections, fed up with what they say are declining standards of governance and complacency, corruption and cronyism.//////One week after North Korea defiantly launched a rocket, the United States is working on a delicate balance between condemning the communist state and nudging it back to dialogue.//////State prosecutors in South Korea have questioned the wife and son of former president Roh Moo-Hyun in an escalating corruption probe, officials said yesterday.//////Global social and human rights organisation, Drishtipat, arranged a unique rally in the city last Saturday to promote the dignity of women and the rights of pedestrians on the streets.
