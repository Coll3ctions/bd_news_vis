Such action has not gone down well at all and is in glaring contrast with the oft-stated desire of the government to introduce democratic practice and transparency in national affairs. The high-handed manner in which the authorities acted on Wednesday in the matter of the DUTA polls has taken us aback. We believe that the action, at once inexplicable and abrasive, was uncalled for. We will not be surprised if citizens now begin to think that there is today an invidious desire among the powers that be to harass the teaching community. Where politeness in dealing with university teachers should have been the norm, there now seems to be a clear intention to show them disrespect.//////IT was a reunion long overdue.

As I travel around the city I can see people standing in front of fair price outlets. It is not only the poor who are hit by soaring prices of the essentials. The middle- class and the lower middle-class also suffer immensely due to spiralling prices.//////Many countries have good, some have bad and some may have even worse records of human rights. Somebody needs to look into the matter globally. Is there any internationally recognized legal framework to see and deal with the human rights situation all over the world? Yes, the world now does have the Human Rights Council of the United Nations! Then who is the US to reveal other countries' human rights situation? Isn't it a single sovereign state like our poor Bangladesh, Kenya or Myanmar or the rich Norway, Japan or the UK? //////I read a news item in The Daily Star stating that there has been a bumper harvest of potatoes this year.

I am grateful to Mr. Zakaria for his kind comments. The following lines will make the picture somewhat clear for the prospective passengers, as well as the public at large. The DEFRA bulletin as stated may be OK in the UK, but not necessarily everywhere which is not a British colony. It may allow frozen fish (presumably raw fish?) or cooked food items in carry-on bags in the UK, but definitely not allowed in Germany, the USA and Thailand based on my travel experiences. Just imagine the dripping water when the ice melts at the cabin temperature, particularly in a long flight! Won't the smell of raw fish seep through and pollute the cabin atmosphere? A few days back, the Thai delicacy that I had in my cabin bag, although allowed at the entry security check, was removed and dumped at the final pre-boarding check of hand baggage at Bangkok airport.//////We are Bangladeshis, We know how to fight against any problem. This month bears testimony to what we are capable of doing. We were united in 1971. Shouldn't we be so once again? //////The cracks are developing on the Jamuna bridge slabs very slowly. The cause behind the cracks is not definitely known. However there is definitely some kind of fault in the construction of this very big bridge. One striking feature of the bridge is the construction of the steel towers for the electric lines on the same side of the bridge as the railway track. Whether this put the slabs on unequal stress is best known to the engineers of the bridge. If it does, there should be longitudinal cracks parallel to the bridge slabs. Another important consideration is the geology of the site. It is now known that the Jamuna river more or less defines the line of contact of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. The plates are supposed to be on continual slow movement all the time. If the Jamuna Bridge spans these plates , there should be deleterious effects on the bridge no doubt, as the slabs are placed on the columns constructed deep underground. //////As reported in your daily, the proposed truth and accountability commission (apparently being set up by the CTG ) would let the possessors of ill gotten money off the hook if he confesses to committing the crime and deposits the sum to the government exchequer. Independent of the question of commensurability of such a commission with the independence of the Judiciary, a confession to the commission closed doors is unlikely to have the desired deterrent effect on the same or another potential offender. In this context it is worth considering an East Asian practice, especially in Japan and Korea, where the repenting offender is required to appear before the national television to ask for pardon publicly. This requirement might be of interest also to the ACC and the Judiciary for enhancing the deterrence effect on the practice of corruption, especially by the "respectable" practitioners.//////I was just reading an article in The Daily Star (Friday March 21). It stated that the Awami League was planning to stage a street protest again price spirals. It is a good political move.//////Mobile communication has experienced significant growth in the last couple of years throughout Africa. To keep pace with this giant market growth, the biggest mobile companies of Africa are relying mostly on foreign engineers. Many Bangladeshi engineers, those who were mostly working with different GSM companies in Bangladesh earlier, are now providing the highest level of professional services in the African market and earning huge remittance. Our motherland is known to be the place of natural disasters, political turmoil and other messy things. However, the days are not that far away when this stigma will be erased and our beloved motherland will stand with its firm, esteemed and glorious image to the international community. The huge amount of population that is often seen as a burden can make significant difference if we just turn them to manpower. //////Case 1: A 50-year old man suffering from pain in the middle of the chest every night just before going to bed, which resolves after some time. He doesn't feel any kind of pain during daytime. He is moderately hypertensive and suffering from no other diseases. After consulting with his doctor the doctor prescribed him glycerol trinitrate to use when the pain starts. Then the doctor gave him some laboratory investigation. After investigating the doctor prescribed him to continue the same drug life long for that pain. But, the patient again consulted some doctors and they also prescribed him the same medicine. Although he is OK with this drug , he is still blaming the doctors, The doctor told me to take this life long but why can't they cure it?//////Finally, we are going to have upazila election and general election at a time. The CEC is considering that option. //////The long political turmoil that was brewing over Bangladesh for decades finally ended up in the present fiasco. By now we know most of the covert and overt reasons of the gradual decline of our political system. The factor topping the dark list is the continual recession of government accountability in each fold of its activity. In strict sense, accountability means that public officials -- elected and un-elected -- have an obligation to explain their decisions and actions to the citizens. The absence of such a transparency mechanism gives rise to many an irregular action, the foremost of which is corruption. Now that the closed vault has been forced open, we are appalled at the gargantuan volume of veiled misdeeds and corruption that got piled up over the years. Lack of government accountability lies at the core of such massive fraud and deception.//////US President George W Bush and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao pressed North Korea Wednesday to come clean over its nuclear arms programme as South Korea warned that time and patience were wearing out on Pyongyang. //////EU foreign ministers will discuss a possible boycott of the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony in protest against China's crackdown in Tibet when they meet for talks in Slovenia today. //////President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday that France will boost its military presence in Afghanistan, a move welcomed by his allies in Britain and the United States. //////Myanmar's junta chief Than Shwe said yesterday that civilians would take the reins of government after elections in 2010, once a constitution is approved giving broad powers to the military. //////Hillary Clinton's popularity has plunged to a seven-year low, while her Democratic White House rival appears to have escaped unscathed from controversy over his outspoken pastor, a poll suggested Wednesday. //////New Delhi has cancelled a proposed visit to Beijing by Trade Minister Kamal Nath after China's early morning summons of the Indian envoy over Tibetan protests here, a report said yesterday. //////At least eight people have been killed and 10 others injured in a stampede at a temple in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, officials say. //////Journalists and police officers were among 25 people killed in a fireworks explosion in a remote part of northwestern China, state media reported. //////Israel is set to inaugurate a new police headquarters for the occupied West Bank in an area outside Jerusalem that is at the heart of a bitter land dispute. //////President George W Bush Wednesday said Britain was still the United States' "greatest ally," despite having scaled back its military presence in Iraq, in an interview with foreign media including the Times of London. //////On the occasion of the 37th In-dependence Day Grameenphone honoured the artistes of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra through a concert at Gulshan Youth Club premises on March 26.//////On the Independence Day, the Liberation War Museum premises was crowded with eminent artistes, poets, litterateurs, media personalities and freedom fighters.
