We thought that raising the tricolour over Edwina and Lord Louis Mountbatten's palace marked the end of the freedom project launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1919.

While the concept is bizarre, it's a real possibility, according to scientists who have devised the first test to investigate the idea.//////ONE of the accomplishments of the Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam was to give geometrical constructions for the roots of a cubic as the intersections of two conics. Of course, this approach had been used earlier by Menaechmus and others to solve certain special cubic's, especially in relation to the problem of "duplicating the cube. But Khayyam generalized it to cover essentially all cubics. Although with many individual cases so as to avoid negative numbers). It's usually said that Khayyam erroneously believed the cubic could not be solved algebraically, but I think we need to be careful about assuming that Khayyam was referring to the modern idea of what constitutes an "algebraic" solution.
