They have huge public health implications. Unfortunately, this issue remained under-focused until now in the policies and the programmes. As an inevitable consequence, urinating and defecating in open have been usual in the cities and towns of the country. This study on public toilet conducted by Centre for Urban Studies in collaboration with WaterAid in Bangladesh focused on Dhaka City's public toilets. Detailed and systematic assessment were made on the existing situation of this important service in terms of volume of the needs, existing service volume and quality; operations, maintenance and management system; and regulatory framework especially roles of responsibilities of different agencies. Based on these, several policy recommendations have been formulated. This report presents a summary of the findings and recommendations. //////This burgeoning megalopolis of over 10 million is difficult to manage that no one will disagree. What is however making it unnecessarily more unbearable and unclean is the absence of public toilets at strategic places. The result is outdoor defecating, usually at predawn, and street-side urinating throughout the day. Needless to say the womenfolk are most disadvantaged due to the prevailing situation. Here is one instance where the offender is blameless.//////Professor Serajul Islam Choudhury, a distinguished teacher, research scholar as well as leader in sociological, philosophical and political thinking, assumed the chairmanship of the Department of English of Dhaka University after the war of liberation to usher in an era of the democratic tradition of liberal intellectual exercise.

I have been drawn to ////// because of what I share, even if to a limited extent, with the writer. Jamil Ahmad, as a member of the Civil Service of Pakistan, has served, among other places in his country, in Baluchistan, Quetta to be precise. I spent the first seventeen years of my life in Quetta and finished school there. Almost a quarter of a century after 1971, I went back to Quetta on New Year's Eve in 1995 and ended up walking around the old familiar places for the next five days. Quetta, indeed the mountains of Baluchistan, its desolation and the many tribes who have called it home for centuries, have always held magic charm for me. And it is magic which Jamil Ahmad recreates in this softly spoken tale of how tribesmen, and women, defined and pursued life in the times before the whole region stretching from Baluchistan and all the way up to the North-West Frontier Province (these days known as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) was laid low by religious fundamentalism typified by the Taliban and then made worse by al-Qaeda.//////One hears the story of an enchanting land comprising people who are a world unto themselves in terms of ways of living their lives, their demeanour, emotional outbursts, moral standards set by themselves, however wide the deviations might be from the edicts of religion entailing double standards and many others. A reader keeps on peeling off layer after layer of darkness only to discover a nadir of darkness sown in their character as reflected particularly in their private lives unknown to the world outside. One common factor that binds all such people in all such families is that they are all 'obscenely rich'; their men are free to do as they like while women as lesser beings are ruled by them and are the arbiters of their fate. There is dissatisfaction, resentment, fear and sorrow among the womenfolk but all in a hush-hush way. Then the reader is startled coming face to face with a rebel, a belligerent young woman who is determined to fight tooth and nail for her freedom as a human being, knowing full well the price she will have to pay for it. In other words, Amira, the protagonist, later known as Jenna Sorrel in America, risks her life along with her baby son to win freedom. //////Debut author Abu Bin Mohammad Zubair's first foray into the world of literary fiction is a showcase of some of the most ignored and in effect forgotten facts of the blood and tear-stained glory that is 1971. A tale of both choice and consequence, ////// stands as a new biting portrayal of the lives before, the lives during and the lives after the brutal nine-month war for hope that gave birth to Bangladesh.//////
