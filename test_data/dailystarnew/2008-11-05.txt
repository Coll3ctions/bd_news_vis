There can be no denying that the move eases further the situation vis--vis the holding of the general elections next month. The fetters that have been there since January last year now have been removed in order for politics to get back to normal. At the same time, by revoking certain clauses of the Emergency Powers Rules, the government has removed the hindrances that have so far stood in the way of the working of the media. There have already been notable developments among the political circles, with parties like the Awami League taking preparations for participation in the polls. It is expected that other parties will take the cue and go fully into election mode in the next few days. //////We are seldom surprised by reports of bribe taking in public establishments.

This time it is the very ethos of the People's Republic of Bangladesh that has come under assault. Hannan Shah of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Ali Ahsan Mujahid of the Jamaat-e-Islami have given us to understand that the general elections of 1970 were organised by the regime of General Yahya Khan to favour a particular political party. And, of course, that party was the Awami League, though they shy away from saying it. //////FORMER political prisoner Mohamed "Anni" Nasheed (41) routed Asia's longest serving leader, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom (71), in the Maldives' first democratic presidential election. Gayoom has been defeated by a human rights campaigner who was thrown in jail by him. Nasheed was a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience.//////PAKISTAN'S economy is failing and it has to seek IMF aid to avoid being declared insolvent. Pakistan cannot pay all its liabilities, which include those bonds that mature early next year as well as debts owed to western powers. Criticism of Pakistani policies is well deserved because, while it has continued to borrow and also undertake some development, it has never seriously tried to build the ability to repay all its debts as and when they fall due.

A few wins against Pakistan, Australia, India, New Zealand etc. worked as tonic and magic for the team and the whole country. It seems to have satisfied their appetite for the 'kill'.

One of the first populations to be affected by HIV in South Asia were injecting drug users. In areas where drug injection has been long established, such as Manipur in north-eastern India, HIV prevalence rates of over 40 percent have been recorded for several years. Several hundred thousand people infected during the explosive start of epidemics are becoming ill and undergoing treatment. The treatment of infections becomes a great burden for the country concerned, because HIV/AIDS requires long-term and effective medical care, periodical hospital-based care and trained manpower to provide comprehensive healthcare services. For countries where resources are scarce, easy access to treatment and care remain very difficult and prohibitive for many PLWHAs. (People Living with HIV/AIDS)//////People who sacrificed a lot during our liberation war are the freedom fighters. Perhaps, we are going to forget them. Our upcoming generation may remain in the dark on this issue.//////Nowadays cricket is the most popular game in our country. Although cricket is an old game and our cricketers have been playing for a long time, still their performance is not good. As far as I know, there are all sorts of facilities available, then why do our cricketers perform so poorly in comparison to any other Test playing country? Our national cricketers never go through any financial crisis.//////It has become a custom among people to give valuable gifts. There is no reason to worry about the rich, but the middle and low income people face a big trouble.//////In Dhaka city traffic congestion is a common phenomenon. City dwellers are facing this problem on a regular basis. //////The Jamaat has a large number of clandestine activities that distinguish it from other political parties. The party has its own economy that consists of banks, shops, factories and even print and electronic media. It has infiltrated its cadres into various government organisations such as the civil service, the judiciary, and even educational institutions such as cadet colleges! I know of a case where a Jamaat member got a job in BUET but he was ordered by the party to join the BCS. No other political party resorts to such activities. The Jamaat economy can be termed as an economy within the economy of Bangladesh and its organisation a state within the state of Bangladesh. Their clandestine activities are a threat to democracy and human rights. Moreover, due to their clandestine activities and their wrong interpretation of Islam, they are portraying Islam in a negative manner. Also a political party should not monopolize Islam or any other religion. This is wrong and dangerous particularly in a country where there are a large number of uneducated poverty stricken people. It also places the regular political parties at a disadvantage.//////It is surprising and contradicting how many of the media people and even general members of the public in the USA are trying to justify that Mr. Obama is not a Muslim and he never was and, on the other hand, how many are trying to establish that Mr. McCain's adopted daughter is not raised as a Muslim, even though both of them have Islamic backgrounds. These media outlets and citizens of a civilised nation are trying to confirm that they are not against Islam, rather against extremist Islam. At the same time, it seems from their propaganda that being a Muslim or even being in contact with Islam in any way is a crime!//////For the first time in the history of Bangladesh, the price of something which went up has come down! It is a welcome development. Though the oil price has come down by 10 percent, I don't think it will have any positive impact on the national economy.//////There is every indication that Democratic nominee Barack Obama will become the next US President. He is favoured over McCain, he has got all the qualities a president should have--a very impressive person indeed. //////Nowadays people cannot think of life without mobile communication, even for a moment. Mobile companies (multinational) have a booming business in Bangladesh. Updated mobile technologies keep coming one after another. The mobile companies have adopted some business policies to attract youngsters. Mobile phone has brought a radical change to our information and communication systems in Bangladesh. A person can enjoy internet, audio, video, MP3 player, games, recording, video, picture and so many multipurpose systems in a mobile phone. //////It is definitely horrifying and alarming news for us that Assam is now the new target of terrorists. It is hard to tell which group is responsible for this massacre but there is no doubt that they are now targeting the areas which were not their target before and the security systems appear to be a bit lax. So the Indian government should have a strong anti-terrorism system in place, so that this kind of crimes cannot be committed in future.//////I am a Bangladeshi studying in Malaysia. I will be finishing my course soon, so I will be going back to Dhaka. //////Melamine is a nitrogen rich white crystalline compound added to milk powder by dishonest producers to give fake appearance of higher level of protein. This compound in milk has adverse effect on renal system, particularly of children as reported in China and other parts of the world. //////The top leaders of the two big political parties are now demanding release of those convicted/charge-sheeted for various crimes/corruption, so as to facilitate their participation in the upcoming general election and getting elected anyhow. One leader of a big party said that they would send the one to the election battlefield who would 'win' -- obviously by hook or by crook (be he a diehard criminal or corrupt). //////A couple of good things were heard from the UCG. The number one is, rule of ethics to stop sexual harassment of girl students in our seats of higher learning. Secondly, they won't allow any more private university in Dhaka city. These are definitely good moves and should be followed in letter and spirit.//////I live 12,000 miles away from you. I will be there in spirit and so will be tens of millions of Bangladeshis supporting you. We want a complete victory for your side. We want a balanced USA with a leader who does pay serious attention to dialogue and diplomacy. Someone who understands that the fate of the USA and the rest of the world depends on 'selling peace' and not military armaments.//////There are no more obstacles in the way to participation in the elections by the two big leaders.
