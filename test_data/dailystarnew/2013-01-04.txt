They have received textbooks ahead of time. More than 26 crore books have been distributed across the country among 3.68 crore students. This is not for the first time that the day has been observed every year under the stewardship of the education minister. This is undoubtedly indicative of an effective education policy vindicated by recent PSC and JSC results. It is also a commendable effort taken by the education ministry to upload all the primary and secondary books on the website of National Curriculum and Textbook Board. Besides, education minister warned the culprits of stern actions if found selling the free textbooks. It is a thank-you note to the education minister for doing these good turns for the students.//////Human rights situation is deteriorating in India. A medical student was gang-raped in a moving bus. She later died after a lot of suffering. A speedy trial is the demand of time. Indian women don't feel safe when going to work; parents are worried when sending their daughters to educational institutions. Damini's family demanded speedy trial and punishment of the perpetrators that would also ensure security of Indian women. People all over the world are expressing their concerns over the matter and waiting for justice. We expect a quick trial where the rapists will get capital punishment.//////We are shocked at the death of popular Nazrul Sangeet artiste Sohrab Hossain. The sangeet guru died on December 27, 2012 at the age of 91. It is widely recognised that he maintained the correct notations of Nazrul's songs after they went through major distortion during the 1940s and 50s. Nazrul researcher Professor Rafiqul Islam called Sohrab Hossain's voice a gift from God. We hope, like Khilkhil Kazi, that Nazrul Sangeet artistes of today and tomorrow will follow Sohrab Hossain's path and keep Nazrul's music in their hearts. We pray for the eternal peace of his departed soul.//////My sister, a student of Monipur High School, got up early on January 1, 2013 and went to school with the hope of getting new books. She came to know from the media that this day will be observed as 'Textbook Festival Day'. She was very excited about getting new textbooks. She went to school facing much difficulty since most of the roads were dug for repairing. She reached school on time but she was told to come again at 1 o'clock the same day. She came back home and went to school again but the authorities told her to pay the readmission fee first for getting the books. My mother assured them that she would pay the readmission fee soon and requested them to give my sister a set of books but her request went unheard. At last, my little sister and other students came back home broken-hearted.//////The death of the 23-year-old girl, who was gang raped in Delhi, India, has shocked me so much. I cannot imagine the sheer physical and mental pain that she went through just because she was a woman. Violence against women has increased despite the spread of education and awareness. Bangladesh is also no stranger to violence against women. Many women are being raped or burnt alive or killed by husbands and in-laws but the government has not woken up to the reality. Stringent punishment to the perpetrators of violence against women is urgent. Paying only lip service to the problem is not a solution.//////The two major political parties have completely failed to fulfil people's expectations. Do they really understand democracy, the word they utter a million times in their speeches? I don't think they do. But we are bound to vote for one of these two parties as we do not have any alternative. People want something different from the political parties. We want new and committed leaders to run the country.//////Majority of the population in Dhaka have to live in rented houses. And the recent hike in the house rent has become intolerable for them. The landlords seem to have no mercy on the tenants. They increase the rent as they wish and at any time of the year. They do not understand that the service holders get increment once a year. If they have to spend two-thirds of their salary on house rent, it becomes difficult for them to meet the other expenses. We know that there is a law regarding house rent but it exists on paper only. The law is not practised anywhere in the country. The respective authorities should look into the matter. //////An important front page report published in a local English daily on December 28, 2012, highlighted the causes behind the education department's ignoring rural schools. I think well over seventy percent of our school and college students come from rural areas. For improve the quality of their education, it is necessary to provide additional financial incentives to rural teachers. This will encourage them to teach near their homes, as well as help their families including parents and dependents. It will also help to improve the overall quality of education in most of the rural schools and colleges. For implementing this, our education department must classify the schools/colleges by their location, for examples, as based in city, upazila or village. The financial allowance will be applicable to the teachers so long as they are based in upazilas or villages. The allowance could be ten percent for upazila and twenty percent for village-based schools/colleges. This allowance should be consistent with government pay scales for city-based teachers. It should also take into account the educational qualifications and experience of the teachers. This fund needed for this additional incentive to teachers should be incorporated in the annual budget. //////My elder daughter, running 9, often bothers me by asking some bitter questions and I, with much patience, try to keep mum. The scenes of vandalism, felonies, running-battle, atrocities, torching vehicles, gun-brandishing and hacking innocents with machetes on TV reports often make her ask if this is happening in her darling country. I, with great efforts, try to bypass her questions somehow or other. I just feel jogged inside but I do not dare telling her the truth that the people about whom she asks questions are none other than those so-called political jugglers whose objectives are to realise money (even in exchange for the country) and gull the gullible countrymen. I do not tell my daughter the truth, not because I am a timid person, but because she is growing up with her feelings, dreams and hopes that will turn into patriotism. I do not want to hurt her feelings. I want her to be a genuine patriot.//////Today, younger pastors are less willing to try to finance multimillion-dollar churches with debt. After the recession, there was a surge in church foreclosures, reaching record highs in 2010 and 2011. Since 2008, more than 300 church properties have been sold after defaulting on their loans, according to the Co-Star Group, a real estate information firm. There is an interesting story which has come down from medieval times: The great scholar, Thomas Aquinas, came to the City of Rome to pay his respects to the one who was then pope. In the course of his visit, the pope proudly showed him all the wonders of the papal palace, and took him to his treasury and showed him chests of silver and gold received from every part of the world. With something of a smile on his face he said, "You see, Thomas, we cannot say with Peter, 'Silver and gold have I none.'" Looking the pope in the eyes, Thomas Aquinas fearlessly replied, "No, and neither can we say, 'In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.'" Riches had come, but power had gone! Peter and the apostles had poverty and power. When the church ceases to be in touch with another world, it is no longer in touch with this world. It's funny how a dollar can look so big when you take it to church and so small when you take it to the supermarket.//////Gang rape comes to light after 3 weeks; 4 rapists, their female aide remanded in Tangail//////President Obama signed a bill late Wednesday night boosting taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while preserving tax cuts for most American households.//////President Barack Obama has signed into law a $633 billion US defense spending bill that funds the war in Afghanistan and boosts security at US missions worldwide.//////Rebels yesterday battled to seize an air base in northern Syria, part of a campaign to fight back against the air power that has given President Bashar al-Assad's forces free rein to bomb rebel-held towns.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton left a New York hospital late Wednesday after three days of treatment and is expected to make a full recovery from a rare blood clot in her head.//////US drone strikes killed a prominent warlord who sent insurgents to fight Nato troops in Afghanistan along with nine other militants in Pakistan's tribal belt, local officials said yesterday.//////A gunman with known psychiatric and drug problems opened fire in a village in southern Switzerland, killing three women and injuring two men, authorities said yesterday.//////Sri Lanka's Supreme Court yesterday ruled that an attempt by lawmakers to impeach the country's top judge was unconstitutional, in the latest salvo in an escalating battle over the independence of the judiciary.//////Argentine President Cristina Kirchner published an open letter in the British press yesterday calling on Prime Minister David Cameron to return the disputed Falkland Islands.//////The pan-Arab news giant Al-Jazeera bought Current TV, a struggling US cable channel, Wednesday in a deal aimed at giving the Qatar-based broadcaster the scope to challenge major American TV networks.//////Students at a US elementary school where a gunman massacred 26 children and teachers last month return to classes Thursday, at an alternative campus described by police as "the safest school in America."//////Police formally charged five men yesterday with the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old medical student from north India, a crime which appalled India and led to national soul-searching about the treatment of women.//////Myanmar faced growing international pressure yesterday to halt air attacks on ethnic minority rebels in Kachin state, where an escalating conflict has overshadowed wider political reforms.//////A prominent Congress leader of lower Assam, who is the chief coordinator of the party in Bodoland Territorial Council area has been accused by a woman of attempt to rape in her house at Salbari in Chirang district on Wednesday night.//////The father of shot Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai has been given a diplomatic role in Britain while his teenage daughter recovers from her injuries, according to reports.//////New Delhi has suffered its coldest day in 44 years amid a cold snap across northern India, the local weather office said yesterday.//////Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday granted fast-track citizenship to France's Gerard Depardieu after the movie star complained about his Socialist government's proposed 75 percent tax on the rich.//////Authorities in Turkey have detained a former military chief for his alleged role in a 1997 coup that forced an Islamic-leaning government from power, Anatolia news agency reported yesterday.//////A group of Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians in the West Bank village of Jalud overnight, injuring several people, an army spokesman said yesterday.//////Mexican soldiers killed 12 suspected criminals in a running gun battle across the central state of Zacatecas on Wednesday, an official said.//////The much-awaited Hatirjheel-Begunbari integrated development scheme in the capital opened to the public on January 2.
