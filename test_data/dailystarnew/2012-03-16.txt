True, Gates plan has noble intentions. //////The incumbent government is committing blunders one after another and is getting itself detached from the people. To thwart the opposition's grand rally it took undesirable steps and doing so it was exposing its fear and moral defeat.//////Growing up with books all around me, I can see the difference between the people who read books and who don't. Children now-a-days are constantly experiencing new technology, and all this limits the growth of their imagination. Digital interactive entertainment options such as movies and music takes them away from mediums such as books, poetry and prose that will have enhanced their minds, imagination and creativity. I believe that we should again revert back to reading books at home again. Let us ban computer games and save electricity. Let's read for a better future.//////The news report titled, New company set up to make hydraulic machinery for vessels published on 6th March, 2012, was the best and the most important news of the day for us in Bangladesh. It was refreshing to know of something constructive coming up, amidst the usual news of problems and politicians' stale talks that fill the pages.//////It is a bad thing to hurt someone or attack someone when he or she is in a vulnerable state. It is easy for the attackers because the victim is powerless in that condition and unable to strike back. Clever people take lesson from their experience and remember the faces and wouldn't give second chance to such attackers in the future. In our country, the fellow politicians do not dare to speak their mind when the two lady leaders are in power. Once they're vulnerable, the opportunity seekers cry wolf for a reformed party. A person having good intention won't do that. If you want reform you should ask for it anytime, why only when the 'cat is in the well'? He, who speaks, speaks all time.//////It now appears from sub-section 10 of section 14 - Contributions to UN Peace Keeping Operations - of the Wikipedia, Bangladesh has been contributing civilian police to UNMISET/UNMIT since 1999 to till date. The information is not fully correct because Bangladesh had sent civilian police to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in 1999. UNTAET was responsible for administering East Timor during the transitional period to independence. It administered East Timor from 1999 to May 2002. In May 2002, on completion of its mission in East Timor, UNTAET was replaced by UNMISET with a different mandate for post independent East Timor.//////It becomes a bad practice in our country that like other service providing agencies, public hospital staffs neglect child patients from slums. Especially, the children aged between 12 and 18 years are the worst sufferers. A report was published in this daily on a survey titled, The context of children in healthcare services in Bangladesh for good governance. The survey was carried out in November last year by child members of Child Parliament, a national-level children's organization, with assistance from Save the Children, said that around 70 percent of poor children are dissatisfied with the behaviour of the doctors and even about 69 percent of those surveyed failed to access healthcare facilities for many reasons. //////The youngsters in our country are badly affected by the satellite channels and the dark side of globalisation. We notice that they are conscious about the western fashion trends, music, movies, and above all the western lifestyle. However, we need to change our mindset to adapt with the modern world. That actually remains unchanged. In this civilised world, girls still face eve-teasing which is a matter of great regret for us. If we become unable to provide a favourable environment for girls, then how can we expect development? When a girl gets a job, financial security is ensured for her family in most cases but she may lose that opportunity when she is faced with insecurity in some cases. But we strongly believe that our liberal minded youth are imbued with ideals of equal rights and respect for all which is particularly needed for the prosperity.//////Swept by the all-engulfing waves of commercialization, education has also turned into a very costly 'commodity' especially for the poorer section of the population. Even in the remote villages, a guardian has to meet a long list of expenses. Apart from spending a big amount on admission, purchase of books and school uniforms, he/she has to pay annual school development charges, tuition and periodic exam fees. Though girls are exempted from tuition fees, most of them have to bear extra-cost on transport and miscellaneous needs. But the poor guardian's main burden is the private coaching fees. It is now an open secret that school teachers have unofficially made private coaching compulsory for good results in the examinations.//////The other day I was watching a Bangladeshi TV channel where some youths were sharing their views on our politics.

The rising film star recently came to the DS Caf to field a barrage of questions from his fans and admirers. //////Humayun Faridee often threw questions at others, asking them about their thoughts on the meaning of life. It was the talented thespian himself who gave the answer, saying, "Life is the inevitable progression towards death."

The memories of the great actor were shared by his colleagues and close friends at a memorial hosted by the Television Programme Producers Association of Bangladesh at the Chhayanaut Sangskriti Bhaban, Dhaka on Wednesday. The programme was titled "Tumi Robey Nirobey". Tariq Anam Khan was the moderator, and read out an introductory message. Memories of Faridee were shared throughout the programme, while many recited their own poems written on the legendary actor.

Each tried to outnumber the other in a purported showdown to do an assessment of their political strength. //////I have just returned from attending the second Asia-Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Forum in Bangkok on March 12-13.
