The news item on the front page of The Daily Star on Sunday says that it is done so not on a one-off, but regular basis to compel workers to come back to work after a short while as they would not be able to endure the rough walk for long. It is beyond comprehension that female workers are subjected to such cruelty right in the middle of the capital city and well into the 21st Century.

Such practices remind us of the days of bonded labour and barbaric treatment to workers that civilisation was thought to have consigned to oblivion. //////AFTER having gone through two years under a state of emergency, it was presumed that the politicians would have learnt to conduct themselves in accordance with the universally accepted norms of democratic politics.

Such allegations, in fact, appeared queer and deprecating or dismissive as the people cast their vote in the most transparent ballot boxes under fool proof security, after correct scrutiny of their names and identifications and also in an utter fear-free mood, never felt in any earlier elections, and as hundreds of local and foreign bodies of observers who observed and monitored the election proceedings found no notable anomalies and commented to their satisfaction that the election was international standard. That sets aside the allegations as phoney and expressive of shameless wallowing in lies which the BNP was always observed to live in and thrive on. That the respective polling agents and even MP candidates of both camps could not observe any irregularities to complain about, such as the use of fraudulence or manipulation by any quarters until the end of the counting, as nothing of the sort was also reported in the print or electronic media, the BNP's allegations simply fell flat and many of its supporters were heard saying that the BNP's claim or blame was for its own sake only and many gave vent to that: The BNP needed this kick in the teeth.
