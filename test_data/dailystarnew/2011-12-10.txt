Recently, German President Christian Wulff visited the institute located in Dhanmondi, Dhaka. For Judith Mirschberger, Director of Goethe-Instut (GI), it was a great honour to hear from the German President that GI has made significant contribution to the German-Bangla cooperation. Mirschberger shared her views with The Daily Star recently: //////As part of the ongoing joint celebrations (by Bangladesh and India) of the 150th birth anniversary of Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore, Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, High Commission of India, Dhaka is holding an exhibition, titled Tagore and Kantha at National Art Gallery of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.

In the same write-up, he was also mentioned as 'Shafeen Chowdhury'. According to the artiste, his name is spelled 'Shafin Ahmed'. We deeply regret the errors.//////The advent of yet another civic body comprising politicians, academics, lawyers amongst others, with an avowed objective of promoting democratic culture and intending to do an honest constructive criticism of the government, keeping in mind the nation's interest, does not appear surprising. By now civil society activism is at least two decades old in Bangladesh. Whether or not such entities have succeeded in creating the desired impact on the body-politic could be a matter of opinion. The media and discerning citizens, however, evince interest in such bodies with perhaps hopes in mind.//////Had President Barack Obama expressed regret over the killing of 24 soldiers within Pakistan immediately, Islamabad's fears might have been assuaged. And probably Pakistan would have attended the meeting on Afghanistan at Bonn. It is no use shedding tears over the spilt milk. However, many in India wonder why Islamabad did not accept 'regret.' The regret is not exactly an apology but it comes to that.//////IT is not that Bangladesh only owes the responsibility to try the genocidal atrocities of 1971. The international community was also under an obligation to bring the alleged perpetrators to the altar of justice. One has much reason to interpret that failure to bring the perpetrators, military personnel or their aides, of human rights atrocities in Bangladesh during the 1971 liberation war, was the starting point of failure to preventing further genocidal atrocities in the global context. The wanton killings in Cambodia in the 70s, massacres in Serbia, atrocities in Rwanda were examples of these. //////BANGLADESH remains an overpopulated country. There are children belonging to very poor families who are deprived, underprivileged and often marginalised. Among them are the street children without parents, homes or any form of shelters. There are slum children living on the sides of the streets or next to the railways. //////Since the Independence, the Government of the Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh has been committed to support social inclusion through a variety of national laws and policies to fulfill the commitments of the Constitution. //////Climate diplomacy is not ideology, but issue-based. From the beginning, there has been strategic shifts made by major groups involved in climate negotiations. This leadership crisis started particularly after the thirteenth Conference of the Parties (COP-13) at Bali. A new but important trend in climate diplomacy is evident since then. True to Morgenthau's `power politics', emission power (few big emitters) tends to rule the game - the impacting countries from both sides are calling the shots, and the impacted ones tend to be relegated to sidelines.//////International environmental law has come a long way since 1972, through the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration on Human Environment. Twenty years later, climate change appeared as a distinct issue in 1992, when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [the Convention] was adopted. The Convention laid down the basic framework with voluntary commitments of the Parties to stabilise atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference to the climate system. //////With climate change comes global warming and a rise in sea levels, and Bangladesh is already the second lowest lying country in the world. A higher sea level makes it easier for freak tides and cyclones to breach the coastal and tidal defences, and the effects of climate change also increases the risks of river flooding and earthquake losses. //////The modern world has brought boons in our life and also many curses. We reduced the rate of infant and maternal deaths but the burden of having non communicable diseases (NCDs) in younger age is increasing. We have cooled our homes with ACs but heated up the world with global warming. In addition to this, without lessening the rates of diseases, the multiplier effects of climate change on health may greatly exacerbate existing health inequities between and within countries, posing a major supplementary dispute obstructing global development. There is a conventional assessment that suggests that the extent of climate change that had already occurred by the year 2000 was directly responsible for the loss of at least 5.5 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) //////My heart and I, we both have matured. This heart beats too fast; faster than the average heart, literally. And yet again, as I belong to the female species, my heart has the upper hand over my male counterpart. We have faster heartbeat. Well, if I live the average lifespan my heart will have the luxury of keeping me alive by beating approximately two and a half billion times, give or take! Of course, it all depends.//////Dominance of electronic media: Although there lies a whole lot of debate as to when precisely the golden age of World literature existed, one thing is for sureliterature's current state of affairs is at the farthest from its heyday. With the printing media's coming under the powerful influence of its electronic counterpart, pieces of classic literature are having to survive on the whims of the electronic media. As a result, they are falling easy prey to cynical manipulations at the hands of the soap opera makers. Maybe, they are saving them from sinking into oblivion, but they are taking a heavy toll on this. Increasing public interest in audio-visual media has given rise to serious misgivings about the consequence of literature. The existence of Shakespeare's plays or Dickens's novels owes more to the celluloid versions of the film-makers than to the old moth-eaten texts which are only gathering dust on the library shelves. As a matter of fact, people by and large are losing interest in the act of reading itself. It appears as if reading is a wearying task in itself. Back at home after a long day's work, people, tired and exhausted, tend to fall back upon the electronic media for easy and effortless entertainment. The habit of reading for pleasure is waning rapidly. It is a big hurdle standing in the way of literary pursuits in general.//////I was deeply moved by the very wonderful and sensitive 'Remembrance' A daughter remembers by Qumrun Nahar (Daily Star, November 26th, 2011) and it brought many poignant memories of 1971 back to me but made me also think about other people.//////Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis (inflammation of joints). It is also called a degenerative joint disease. It is characterised by the breakdown of cartilage in joints (i.e., intersections of two bones) and is often caused by wear and tear. Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows for easier movement within the joints. As osteoarthritis progresses, bone spurs (osteophytes) develop within the affected joint and the joint space narrows, increasing pain and decreasing mobility.//////Diet and weight maintenance are two crucial tools to control diabetes. Setting a strategy on food intake and shedding extra pounds is the first and imperative step. The American Diabetes Association recommends that patients with diabetes should aim for a small but consistent weight loss of 0.5 - 1 pound per week. Most patients should follow a diet that supplies at least 1,000 - 1,200 kcal/day for women and 1,200 - 1,600 kcal/day for men.//////Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an optical signal acquisition and processing method. It can capture micrometer resolution creates three dimensional and cross sectional images of biological structures using differences in the reflection of light and help for the visualisation of minute details in both two and three dimensionally.//////Bell's palsy is a paralysis or weakness of the muscles on one side of face characterised by drooping of face, deviation of angle of mouth, difficulty in eating, drinking, whistling, speaking. It is due to the damage to the facial nerve that controls those muscles.//////Around 40 percent of cancers diagnosed every year are caused by avoidable life choices including smoking, drinking and eating the wrong things, according to a new research published in the British Journal of Cancer. Tobacco is the biggest culprit, causing 23 percent of cases in men and 15.6 percent in women. Next comes a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in men's diets, while for women it is being overweight.//////Researchers from Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine found that the human body is better at fighting gum disease when fat cells, which trigger inflammation, disappear.//////After prolonged US engagement in Middle East and Afghanistan on War on Terror there appears to be a major policy shift of US about its global role. This is evident from US President Barack Obama's recent weeklong visit in the Asia Pacific region and Hillary Clinton's visit to the Philippines and Thailand. US policy makers have now decided to focus on Asia Pacific region where it has political, economic and security interest.//////A series of reforms by Myanmar's President, Thein Sein, a former prime minister and general in a previous military junta, have caught most Myanmar-watchers by surprise.//////Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's 'super-woman' of democracy will be contesting the upcoming by-elections in the country in December. This statement from her publicist came soon after her party, the National League for Democracy, announced its decision to re-register itself as a political party and go the parliamentary way. She has not yet decided on the constituency she wants to contest the elections from, among the 48 available constituencies. This decision came after the civilian government in Myanmar scrapped the article in the 2008 Constitution which disqualified Suu Kyi from taking part in any parliamentary process in the country. What impact would this development have on the political future of Myanmar? Would Suu Kyi be able to provide a balance in the political structure of the country? What would this mean for the ethnic minorities in Myanmar? And, how would the west see this step?//////In her book //////, Lois Holzman brings the theories and insights of Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist, into the lives of ordinary people and their everyday activities. Vygotsky's influence is enormous in the fields of psychology and education, but he seems to be too difficult for ordinary readers. Holzman does an excellent job in bringing him from academia into the field. In this book, her main purpose is to tell her own story of bringing Vygotsky from the scientific laboratory to ordinary people and their communities. ////// can, therefore, be a great resource for teachers, psychologists, child development practitioners, and social workers. //////When one comes to the end of ////// one has a feeling of having completed a very peaceful journey through a great story. The plot of this story holds a superb build up that takes the reader in a smooth sailing with the characters and events and then climaxes into a great insight about the truths of human relationships, about how unpredictable life can be.//////Something stirs in the heart when you come across new books. And then something cracks in it when you remember you simply cannot afford to buy all those books because of the prohibitive prices that come with them. With all this twenty two per cent tax imposed on the import of books, you cannot argue with the bookseller and ask him why he cannot give you the tomes you need at prices you can afford. He too has a life and a career to plod through. Now, the queer bit here is that he is in no position to give you the book the way you want it; and you are not quite ready to spend all that money you happen to have at a given moment on that book you have been eyeing for a while.//////
