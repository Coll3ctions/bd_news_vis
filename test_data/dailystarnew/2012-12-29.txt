Apart from a healthy growth of local tourism, 2012 witnessed a marked increase in inbound traffic of foreign tourists. Indeed, going by newspaper reports and industry data, the market grew by up to 15 percent in 2012. That growth is now threatened as the political scene in the country gears up for a regenerated opposition movement.

Crane and Kauffman's original premise is recycled, re-used and rehashed every year. 2012 was obviously no different. Replace cafe with bar, toss in an ethnic minority and you have a repackaged modern version of the same old show. It's a tried and tested formula and it works.

This sector must be given attention with special emphasis. The country like Bangladesh has to be very serious in all respects to understand and exercise the services offered by the forests. We must remember that the services are very important and useful and they could be made so when and if we become serious about maintenance of forests.//////Thirty-seven industrialized countries had been accused of releasing Greenhouse gases in Kyoto Protocol under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

This year Climate leaders from all over the world gathered at Doha from 26 November to 8 December 2012 to find 'what to dos' for reversing the grim effect of global anthropogenic climate change. However, outcomes are a mixture of both success and failure with depiction of slow pace in progress.//////Years ago at a Nilkhet bookstall I spotted a book //////a collection of poems. It was first printed in June 1976, exactly the time I got admitted into the English Department of Dhaka University. Until I saw the book I never knew about it and I got enthused in reading it because the poems like St Joan In Prison, My Journey, The Map were written by her at Azimpur Estate in 1961-62. Forty years later I was also residing in the same place and reading those poems written there! Definitely it added to my nostalgia about those golden and dreamy days of the 1960s and 1970s. I was already writing about her, one of my most favourite teachers during my university days, and I planned to surprise her with its publication in our alumni magazine. My writing about her was finished halfway. On 29 Dec 2011 morning as usual I was sipping my steaming tea and glancing through the newspapers. I stopped at the sight of an obituary Razia Khan passes away. My writing came to a halt. Perhaps it will remain like the unfinished poem Kublai Khan which she taught us while taking class on Coleridge! //////My acquaintance with Parveen Shakir's poetry began in late 1995 in Lahore, where I had gone to attend a media conference of journalists from South Asia. At the end of the conference, those of us in the Bangladesh team --- Enayetullah Khan, Badal Rahman, Shakhawat Ali Khan, Matiur Rahman, Syed Kamaluddin and I --- decided to have a tour of a market in Lahore before flying to Karachi on our way back home. At the solitary bookshop in that particular market I was happily surprised to know of Parveen Shakir the poet and immensely sad to be informed that she had died a year previously in a car crash. I asked the salesman to give me a copy each of Parveen Shakir's collections of poetry, //////and //////that I spotted on the shelves. He was happy to oblige. As I was about to pay him, Mintu bhai (our very dear Enayetullah Khan) stepped forward and asked me if I could read Urdu. I said indeed I could. But he would not take my word for it. Asking me to read a few lines from Khud Kalami before the salesman, he told the salesman to confirm if I read correctly. I read, which reading was duly confirmed by the salesman. Mintu bhai was thrilled. I walked off with the books, which after all these years form part of my little library at home.//////I had the privilege of being taught by Professor Khan Sarwar Murshid (1924-2012) when I studied for an MA in the Department of English at Dhaka University back in 1997. By then, he had retired from full-time teaching at Dhaka but still continued to teach a class or two as a supernumerary professor. I was not taught by him during my undergraduate years and don't remember seeing him very often at the department. My first encounter with Professor Murshid was, in fact, at a conference on women's studies at the British Council which was also incidentally attended by Taslima Nasrin, the controversial Bangladeshi writer. During my student years, I was quite active in the cultural and literary circuit of Dhaka University. I directed a drama on the Liberation War and appeared in it at the TSC, presented departmental programmes at the British Council, recited poems from English, French and Bangladeshi writers in various forums, and even headed the departmental debating team to victory. In those days, the British Council was yet to decimate its excellent library for profit; and for anyone seriously studying English literature, it was a safe haven for good books, bearable company, and occasional good addas. The English Department at Dhaka regularly hosted many of its seminars in liaison with the British Council; and at one such seminar, Professor Murshid stood up to give his blistering analysis of an academic paper just delivered. //////The year 2012 is marked with some glorious achievements and released new crucial data in terms of health. At the end year 2012, we would like to highlight some of theses milestones to respect sincere endeavours behind these achievements and encourage people to do more in the coming year.//////Eminent ENT specialist from the Novena ENT-Head and Neck Surgery Specialist Centre Prof Dr Christopher Goh recently visited Bangladesh and shared his view with Star Health.

So, growth and development should run parallel. Growth means increase in weight, height, head circumference, mid upper arm circumference etc. Development means mental maturation, intelligence, skill ness etc.//////Young children are prone to choking.

This statement appeared on page 14 of the issue of the Economist dated September 24 to 30, 2011. //////The United States came into being through mass movements of populations. The movements came in waves from all over the world and, depending upon the historical moment, they served differing purposes, but there were two constants. First, each wave served an indispensable economic, political, military or social function. The United States -- as a nation and regime -- would not have evolved as it did without them. Second, each wave of immigrants was viewed ambiguously by those who were already in-country. Depending upon the time or place, some saw the new immigrants as an indispensable boon; others saw them as a catastrophe. The debate currently under way in the United States is probably the oldest in the United States: Are new immigrants a blessing or catastrophe? So much for the obvious.//////Standard Chartered Bank has generously sponsored The Reading Circle's venture of translating Kazi Nazrul Islam's ////// into English. The result is //////where eight members of The Reading Circle, a group made up of aficionados of literary works, combine to translate the letters that constitute ////// As those familiar with the novella already know, Bandhon Hara is made up of stories told through letters.

This book is a compilation of some of her best short stories, according to the editor Domoyonti Basu Singh, and they are all stories of love and redemption. Despite what the editor thinks about the book, I felt the compilation to be uneven. The stories are all built around the same formula: it works for some, but fails for the others.//////Every sunrise appears with the hope of the day illuminating not only the darkness but also wiping off the tears from paupers' eyes. Japan, known as 'Nippon' or 'Nihon', the most prosperous country in Asia, is called 'The land of the rising sun'. This compliment has really matched every instance of progress in Japan, even till now. This is reflected in every page of the book, 'Japan Probash', written by Manmatha Nath Ghosh more than a century ago. There are two startling themes of this book. It is the first book about Japan written in Bengali, on the one hand. On the other hand, the picturesque description of Japanese society given by the author in this book has not changed much even after such a long time span. This undiscovered resource of our literature has recently been revealed by Subrata Kumar Das, who has edited this book with great care by collecting almost all the information provided by Manmatha Nath Ghosh in his original book. Ghosh had to go to Japan in 1906 for purposes of education. He recorded aspects of Japanese life, culture and etiquette in detail as he experienced them in his three years' stay in Japan. He did it in a critical manner but used very simple language and subsequently put them together in a book, in other words, the one under review from Kolkata in 1910. One hopes the Dhaka edition of the book, a century later, will be appreciated by readers. //////
