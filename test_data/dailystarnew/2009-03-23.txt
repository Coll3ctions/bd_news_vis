Judges can make some law (case law) in areas where there are no parliamentary statutes. A statute will supersede any case law and take its place and there can be no conflict. Claims of such conflict are mere exaggeration and like the proverbial storm in a teacup.//////There are about160 tea gardens in Bangladesh. These tea gardens are located mostly in Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sylhet and Chitagong Hill Tracts. Though these tea gardens increase natural beauty of Bangladesh and add to our foreign currency earning, the woes of tea garden workers have a dampening effect on their performance. Tea labourers have a significant role in the tea industry. The progress of the tea industry depends on the hard work and motivation of tea labourers. But they never got their due in terms of salary and other benefits. //////Myanmar has totally failed to show due respect and good neighbourliness towards Bangladesh.

It engulfs all values and destroys the social fabric.//////The nation is aghast, stunned into silence at the indescribable acts of violence at BDR Headquarters at Pilkhana recently. It is only logical and fair to demand exemplary punishment to the conspirators, perpetrators and their cohorts. However I would like to raise an issue that seems to have escaped most of us. The disciplined BDR jawans who risked their own lives to protect the army officers and their families should be duly and suitably rewarded for their heroic deeds. //////It drew our attention that Court permission will be required to evict slums, a private bill by Saber Hossain Chowdhury published in The Daily Prothom Alo on 24 February.

He was a journalist, dramatist, novelist and a poet who had worked relentlessly all his life. //////To increase production use of fertilisers is a common practice among the farmers. Though farmers can make much benefit by using fertilisers on the soil, it is having a negative impact on soil fertility. The use of fertilisers on the soil destroys its original fertility. The use of insecticides helps destroy the harmful insects. But sometimes these insecticides mix up with the surface water which is a big health hazard. //////ABM Musa, the respected journalist, highlighted his point of view on a Channel-i programme on issues of BDR enquires and terrorism scare in the government. We are not aware whether the government has any system to listen to and act or react to such comments coming from a popular media programme. The issues Mr. Musa raised should be an eye opener for the government policy makers. //////The system of skill category migration has been in place in Australia for long. There are some methodologies/procedures/rules to get/obtain skill category migration. Initially, the applicant has to obtain 90-120 points to apply for skill category migration. This point is measured based on the applicant's age, proficiency in English and job offer in Australia. It should be learnt that the Australian government prepares a migration occupation list each year. An applicant who does not have any job offer, whatever qualification s/he has, will not qualify to apply for the skill category migration. //////Unlike other years, this year the HSC examination is scheduled to start from the middle of April-- probably the hottest month of the year. In the previous years, the exams were held in June--the month when monsoon arrives .As we know, load shedding becomes a very common affair in the summer, making life difficult through the length and breadth of this land. //////Corruption is a multi-faceted term these days. Corruption may be committed in two ways --corruption above the table and corruption under the table. Mahathir Mohammad once said the former can be checked through the rules or laws but the latter cannot be rooted out through the mundane rules, it is related with the moral values and norms. Corruption is a practice which deviates from the accepted norms. It is prevalent in every society from primordial times. In the eighteenth century the level of corruption in America and the UK was less in comparison with the later centuries. //////I want to start my story with a proverb; wherever the luckless goes, he would get the same result. Since my childhood, I heard the buzz proverb several times. Though I could not understand the actual meaning of that, but today, the alarming rate of our migrants coming back due to global economic recession makes it clear to me.//////In light of the current huge shortage of electricity and future increase of demand and scarcity of gas for large-scale power generation, it can be said that the county's electricity supply situation will never be normal without at least one 1000mw N-power plant.//////A few days ago, we witnessed a shameful incident at Rajshahi University . Our past heritage provides us with ample evidence of students' glorious presence in and contribution to politics. Past studies show that in our language movement and the movement of our independence the students had contributed a lot. //////"Redefining secularism, published in the DS, is an extra-ordinary article indeed. Mr. Anwarul Kabir in this prudent write-up has rightly defined secularism. While defining secularism at the state level, we must consider the people and their psychology. Secularism devoid of religion will not be acceptable to the people of present Bangladesh. Rather, we have to think about religions with liberal views. As long as religions remain flexible and show tolerance, establishing secularism of our style is possible. Restricting religions to the private sphere of the life, as western notion suggests, is not possible right now. Even western society is now in a dilemma and with the increase of Muslim population, some countries in Europe and America are considering installation of Sharia Board (e.g. Canada). France is also compromising in the context of wearing Hizab in public schools.//////I was really shocked to see on BBC that Bangladesh had banned YouTube for broadcasting certain things. I do understand that there is classified information which should not be published. Whoever had uploaded those things did not act like a good citizen. But, unfortunately, my concern was more about the way the government had tried to resolve the matter by banning YouTube in Bangladesh. Such action was not expected from the party that has promised to build a digital Bangladesh. I believe the situation could have been dealt with more efficiently. Before banning, did anyone from the government request YouTube to restrict viewing the news from Internet concerning our internal security? I believe they would have got a good response. //////The sloth in the ministries- panic caused by random reshuffle in the administration: loyal civil servants get favourable transfer and posting and the disloyal ones end up as OSDs and go on forced retirement. //////The entire episode was eye-opening. Stark was the absence of a national crisis management mechanism designed to swing into action. The prime minister's meeting with mutineers to settle issues 'politically' was in itself a breach of security protocol. Equally absurd was professionally ill-equipped Home Minister Sahara Khatoon and State Minister Jahangir Nanak's role as negotiators. //////Population boom is one of our main problems. About five lakh job seekers are not getting jobs, as the job market is small. Our students cannot study in good universities in developed countries due to lack of required standards and poor performance in English. There are many reasons behind these. One of them is student politics. Our students do not study as per requirement. After taking admission into the public universities, they start indulging in politics for getting undue facilities. //////To bring the Taliban into the Afghan political process in order to achieve a peaceful resolution to the war in Afghanistan, the United States has signalled a new initiative.//////A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says attempts to win the release of a captured Israeli soldier have not stopped despite strong signals from Olmert that no deal was likely during his last days in office.//////Pakistan's top judge resumed his post at the Supreme Court yesterday following two years of political turmoil over his ouster in the al-Qaeda-threatened, US-allied country.//////A six-month campaign of Predator strikes in Pakistan has seriously damaged the al-Qaeda structure there, forcing militants to turn on one another as they search for culprits, The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.
