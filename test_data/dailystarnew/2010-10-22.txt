For far less critical comments we in the media would have been hauled up for contempt, but that is a different matter, about which we reserve the right to talk another day. //////The revelations made by the latest UNFPA report are a very good reason why the government and indeed informed sections of society must sit up and take notice. Population-wise, in a country of slightly more than 54,000 square miles we now have 16.44crore (or close to 161 million) people. It is clearly a stunning discovery, coming at a time when we thought population growth had tapered off and the nation could now go ahead in identifying the various ways by which the quality of life could be improved. Our surprise comes in knowing that where the census of 2001 spoke of the population being 12.43crore, this jump by 4crore in just a decade is an unmistakable sign of how and where the national effort toward family planning and population control may have gone awry. The prospect of further rise in another decade or two at the current unbridled rate is simply a nightmare. //////Brothers Union became the first team to reach the last four of the 23rd Grameenphone Federation Cup when they blanked defending champions Mohammedan Sporting Club 2-0 thanks to yet another mesmerising performance from their Brazilian recruit Everton under lights at the Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////Without any doubt the historic series victory against New Zealand pleased Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons the most.

They are forced to work for a living, sacrificing their childhood as well as their future for bare survival of self and family. Bangladesh is the home of 6.6 million working children, accounting for more than five percent of the world's working children.

Between the promises and reality in this case. //////The government came down heavily on opposition leader's remarks that the government had deliberately orchestrated the train accident at Sirajganj. Such remark from a person who was an elected prime minister for two times is totally frustrating for the nation. It is a sign of negative politics. Main opposition and its supporters are yet to come out of the culture of destructive politics. The incident of setting fire to the train, which is a state property, is a highly condemnable act.//////As I have witnessed, traffic signals are not operated properly in the city, which contributes to the increase in the frequency of traffic jams. The time management is not rational. Most traffic signals, operated manually, block traffic flow on one side of the crossing for a long time, while on the other side it is allowed to flow in short intervals. This creates a long queue of vehicles on the road. //////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.
