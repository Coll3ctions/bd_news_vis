Chemical manipulation at the nano-scale -- that is at a linear scale equivalent to a billionth of a metre -- has allowed to alter, enhance and incorporate physical and chemical material-properties. Such innovations have generated new materials improving the products, devices, and processes of immense commercial and scientific importance; for example, transparent catalysts for touch-screen devices, high-efficiency semiconductors for solar cells, core-shell particles for deliverable and release-controlled drugs, heat-conductive materials for cancer therapy, reactive agents for environmental cleanup, etc. Such promises of nanotechnology emanate from its ability to crosscut disciplinary boundaries and its ability to be applied to any field, which desires improved material properties for better efficiency and performance. Thus, many developing countries, which are otherwise not heavily involved in technology development, are entering a phase of technological competitiveness using this interdisciplinary field of nano-scale science. Leaving Bangladesh, a leading nation in the 'Next 11', out of this race seems to be unwise. This article will introduce fundamental and applied aspects of nanotechnology and will discuss the promises of this technology for Bangladesh. //////Garment accessories and packaging manufacturers seek to treble their exports in the next five years. //////The Daily Star yesterday visited families of three deceased of a fire that gutted a labour camp in Manama of Bahrain on January 11.

And accordingly, they should be punished.//////According to the media reports, a 14 year school girl of Tangail was violated 4 days by four men.

In developed countries, the wastage takes place at retailers' and consumers' levels while in the developing countries most wastage are due to inefficient handling and poor storage facilities. The report revealed that in South-East Asian countries, losses of rice range from 37 to 80 percent of their entire production, totalling wastage of about 180 million tons per year. Many developing countries have given priority to investment to improve infrastructure. In Bangladesh, wastage of food grain during harvesting, transportation and storage is also high. In order to contain food wastage, the Bangladesh government should also increase investment in infrastructure development for proper storage of food grains and other agricultural produces. //////It seems that we have fallen into a dark era with looting, killing and violation of women's rights. Gory incidents of murder and cruelty against women are happening in regularly destroying the lives of so many people. Has society at large nothing to do except writing a few lines in the newspapers or organising and standing in human chains in protest? Delhi youths have revolted against the crime against women but here in our country we are yet to go to such an extent. Initiating a war against crimes is overdue. We have seen how party politics have institutionalized crime in every strata of society with impunity. So we have to come forward irrespective of caste and creed and form a united social movement against crime. Otherwise as a human being, we will be accountable to our creator for all our inaction. //////I was surprised to read the news item 'was president's permission sought?' (The Daily Star 9.1.13).

Didn't the office know that the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by Nobel Foundation not by any 'state'? //////Everyday some sort of disturbing news awaits us. January 9, 2013 was no exception.

It is the same company that had triggered a lot of controversy during the tenure of the last BNP government by setting up a low quality power plant in Tongi. The MP has allegedly secured several other power projects by influencing the bidding process.//////Currently, the weakness of our Tigers is the longest version of the game. I believe this weakness exists mainly due to lack of playing test matches. In Bangladesh, domestic cricket leagues consist of T20, ODI's, 3-Day or 4-Day versions. I think that full 5-day matches must be held in league tournaments in order to improve the playing condition of Bangladesh. I also feel the televising of domestic cricket would increase the popularity and importance of it. This would also encourage sponsors to advertise on TV during the matches.//////Nirmal Sen is no more. He breathed his last on January 8, 2013 at the age of 82 years. We have learnt from the newspaper reports that he was brought to Dhaka from his village home for hospitalization late last month as he was suffering from acute pneumonia and was kept on life support for ten days.

Why has appeasement of hardliners in Pakistan, an avowedly communal state carved out of the two-nation theory, become a touchstone for secularism in India? If this were limited to an irony it would doubtless find its level in the varied folds of public discourse. As an artful strategy to legitimise the present UPA government's weak knees, it has more disturbing implications.//////Journalists representing both print and electronic media from eight member countries of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) met at South Asian Free Media Association's (SAFMA) 8th South Asian Free Media Conference on "A vision for South Asia and Union: Opening minds, opening borders," in Amritsar on January 6 and Lahore on January 8-9, underlining the historical, social and economic ties across South Asian borders. //////For many countries in Latin America, demand from China has been essential to maintaining high GDP growth rates over the last decade. But will Chinese demand for commodities be enough to sustain high prices for the region's exports in the coming years?//////Weep for those precious hands which the flames turned to ashes, weep for the frantic bodies that leaped to the ground for a maimed disfigured life, weep for the shivering kid who will never find its mother's warm bosom, weep for the cruel command of conscienceless authority , who preferred the safety of matter to man. Weep for my dear university colleagues whose unquestioned patriotism led them blindfolded to the Mirpur wilderness and who could not see their freed country. Weep for the two women, one elderly and another young, clinging to each other as the bright hot flames approach them stealthily, until they became discernable, half burnt corpses. Weep with Biswajeet's people. In this land of half truths we may never know what really happened, but weep because his parents will never see, hear or touch him again. //////American Revolutionary War: Ratification Day, United States Congress ratifies Treaty of Paris with Great Britain.//////
