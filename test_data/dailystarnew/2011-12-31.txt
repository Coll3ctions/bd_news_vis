The marginal cost of this transition and trade-off with growth and development are key issues that developing countries are dealing with. In developing countries, the estimated cost of additional investments to finance mitigation and adaptation efforts are estimated to be US$100 billion per year by 2020.//////From all the available information and data, it can be predicted that frequency, intensity and severity of flood would be increased in Bangladesh in future. Indeed all disasters affect the whole community. But the rich people generally are not affected by the natural calamity; if they are affected hardly ever, they can recover their losses personally or by using the social and state power. By taking this into consideration, we should give utmost attention to the less fortunate; generally disaster is accentuated by the poverty in their life.//////Razia Khan Amin was the one of the first teachers who enlightened us at Dhaka University on English literature. That was early in October 1975, barely two months into a situation where Bangladesh teetered on the brink of chaos. Bangabandhu had been assassinated and we who had entered university suddenly found ourselves in conditions where the country was on a steep slide to regression. On that first day, apart from speaking to us of literature, Razia Khan Amin reflected on the violent political change that had taken place. Neither she nor we had any way of knowing on that October morning that our national tragedy had just begun. In a month's time, the leading lights of the Mujibnagar government would be dead. Some of the bravest of our war heroes --- Khaled Musharraf, Shamsul Huda, ATM Haider --- would die too in a country they had fought so hard, and so successfully, to liberate.//////About seven years ago, when Eid-ul-Fitr came quite close to Christmas, and it was interesting to observe the joy of festivities with family and friends and the giving and receiving of gifts. The giving is, of course, related to 'Zakat' by which, as I understand, 2.5% of one's 'disposable income' (e.g. cash, savings and jewellery) should be given away, once a year, to the extreme poor and orphans. As a foreigner living and working in Bangladesh, I see similarities between Eid and Christmas, such as the family coming together at a special time of the year, special foods, the joy of giving and remembering those who have very little. My work in 2004 was connected with assisting the very poorest in a Government project, Adarsha Gram, which was assisted by the European Union and provided houses, homesteads and livelihoods to homeless and landless families, particularly those who have lost their homes through river erosion. Despite the many administrative and bureaucratic difficulties in managing such a project, the experience is enriching as well as humbling. I continue to work with the same category of extreme poor people with the DFID and AusAID supported Chars Livelihoods Programme in the north west of the country.//////A few weeks ago, I received a call from Manishadi. It was a Sunday evening and I was absorbed in the popular reality show The Amazing Race. I picked up the receiver and squinted to read the caller ID. Manishadi does not call me often, so I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the caller ID. As the phone rang for the fourth time, I hastily pressed the on the headset before the answering machine could kick in. It was Manishdi indeed, and after pleasantries, she invited me to a literary event which she informed me was taking place for the first time in Boston: an afternoon of Bangla short story reading, or Chhoto Golpo Dibash as it was to be called. //////Although Bangladesh has made a commendable success in reducing child mortality, the number of newborn deaths in Bangladesh is still very high. In Bangladesh, more than 113,884 newborns died in 2008 , most of those could be prevented by ensuring home based Essential Newborn Care (ENC) by a health worker at or within two days of birth.//////Prediabetes is the state that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than that of normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes.

Conflicts disrupted health services and added to health demands in a number of countries, notably in Libya.//////People who brush their teeth twice a day not only have a good oral hygiene, but are also less likely to suffer from pneumonia compared to those who brush just once.

The incident soon led to a nation-wide protest in Tunisia, and subsequently engulfed neighbouring Arab countries in parts of West Asia and North Africa. The Arab world has since witnessed a number of remarkable developments, significant among them being the overthrow of four long serving dictators: Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen. The events leading to the overthrow of these leaders were marked by protracted street protests, often leading to casualties and severe injuries among the protestors. //////INDIAN Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrived Moscow on December 15 on a three-day visit for a bilateral summit with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as part of the 12th annual Indo-Russian summit. Manmohan Singh met also Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on December 16.//////I must confess I had felt as much drawn as repelled when I first set my eyes on the book. The massive volume with 560 odd pages even in paperback and 481 solid reading materials without notes, appendices and a not-too-short list of books consulted is, no doubt, intimidating. Added to this was the mental list of a considerable number of books I already have read on different facets of life, living, history and on many other aspects of the countries of the sub-continent. But the desire to know and understand the people of the region ever more thoroughly, especially of Pakistan in the wake of the threatening rise and expansion of religious fundamentalism there ultimately made me go for the book. And I must put on record my deep sense of happiness at having read it. ////// A mother is supposed to love her children equally. But for Sara Fitzgerald this is a twisted truth. Her elder daughter Kate is a patient of leukemia and her younger daughter Anna is genetically programmed to be an organ donor for Kate. Anna is the sibling who can save her sister. For Sara and Brian, her husband there is the choice of saving Kate through using Anna as the donor or save Anna from the pains of undergoing countless surgeries, transfusions and shots that her role as the donor requires. They wonder, can a parent love a child too much or is too much love never enough? //////The book Korokdi Ekti Gram (Korokdi Is a Village) bears testimony to the deep love of one's motherland and one's desire to learn its glorious history. Subrata Kumar Das has brought together the glorious history and famous personalities his village has produced. With the passage of time many of these personalities have opted for a life in Kolkata. Das has photographed the remains of the homes of these famous personalities and posted them on Facebook, which has in turn aroused their interest in seeing the village they left in their childhood. A big reunion was arranged by Das. The book contains a vivid description of the gathering, the reminiscences of expatriates, renowned Bangladeshi litterateurs and local leaders. A few kilometers from Bagaat, off the highway and some two kilometers through the open field lies this culturally rich village called Korokdi. //////Beyond My Imagination//////Al-Haj M.Abdur Rashid//////Distributor: Dik Darshan Prokashoni//////Tel: 7115618, 01711 172 518//////
