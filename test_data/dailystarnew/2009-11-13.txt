And it cannot also be denied that the old pay scale did not match the reality of the present market that dictates the cost of living. The present effort of the government will hopefully go to address the mismatch between the old pay scale of the employees and the rising cost of living. //////Over the last couple of years there has been much talk and quite some action regarding structures falling foul of building regulations. During the period of the caretaker administration, some purposeful exercises were undertaken to demolish unauthorized structures. But at a point those drives appeared to come to a stop for reasons that have never been explained. And since the present government took over early this year, the demolition programme has been going on at various places in the capital. Every so often, there have been news reports of the authorities, in this case Rajuk, getting busy retrieving spots that have fallen into the hands of unscrupulous elements. In the past few weeks, if not months, one has come across reports and images of bulldozers busy pulling down parts of structures not authorized under the existing regulations.//////THE number of small nations is bigger than the number of big nations in the world. G. Pascal Zachary writes in //////, published in 2000, that the world had 74 small nations in 1946. At the time of writing his book, he counted 190 small nations, of which 87 had populations below 5 million, 58 less than 2.5 million and 35 lower than 500,000. But does size matter in international relations? As Bob Dylan sang, "the answer my friend is blowing in the wind."//////FOR decades, the road transport sector in Bangladesh has been plagued by rampant extortion and bribery. Due to the domino effect, the cost of extortion is passed on from vehicle owners to transport users to wholesalers to retailers and finally to the hapless consumers who are the ultimate victims. This issue has been recently highlighted by the food and disaster management minister, who went on record in the electronic media citing precise figures to emphasise how extortion results in manifold increases in transport costs. //////The Bangladesh cricket team will have a busy schedule next year as revealed by the home schedules released by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday.

large ship-breaking industry that has grown in an unplanned way in Chittagong is now an environmental concern. //////Geographically, Bangladesh is located in a comparatively disadvantageous region, exposed to various natural catastrophes like flood, cyclone, drought etc. which are causing havoc to our life and economy. A substantial portion of our GDP is adversely affected due to these calamities. It is a proven fact that these natural calamities are the direct impact of changing climate across the globe. Climate change is mostly attributed to the manipulation of nature in terms of various dimensions such as- emission of carbon monoxide and some other greenhouse gases, rapid and unplanned urbanization and industrialization, deforestation and exploration of land and water etc. It has been reported rightly that the developed nations are the major participants in this unpleasant manipulation of Mother Nature. The ultimate consequences of these activities are those natural calamities that we are facing along with some other nations. So, it is the responsibility of those developed nations to indemnify us not in terms of loans, rather direct support in terms of financial, technical and infrastructure facilities. //////Over six million expatriate workers of our country contribute a whopping amount of around nine billion US dollar annually to the national exchequer. This amount constitutes the second highest foreign exchange earnings over any other sectoral export trade.

These workers are our unsung heroes.//////Finding Build a separate functional capital written by Shahnoor Wahid in The Daily Star (10 Nov), I started reading this article with happiness, thinking someone is there to think about the city planning. But after reading a while I became very sad as he wrote, the great politicians, the great engineers, the great town planners, the mayor, who came and went like sea tides couldn't see it coming. They were so busy making money that they had no time or urge to look ahead and plan ahead. Sir, reading that I would love to ask when and who ask town planners to take care of the city? Who gives permission to a town planner to talk? Where is the place of town planner in the government hierarchy? Urban Planners are not the government officials. We are nowhere, Sir. Nobody knows about us. Nobody knows what we do. //////Much is being written on the subject in most dailies as well as your "To The Editor" page. Unfortunately, the ideas put forward in your daily on 25th. October by a writer are somewhat divorced from realities.//////At last we have some real facts and figures on traffic jams in Dhaka from authoritative and reliable sources. The DS of 23 Oct contains a report on the workshop held by JICA/BUET (page 2) City Traffic Worsening, and another article on Page 11 entitled Road Safety and Traffic Congestion by Md Rezaul Karim of Transparency Int. This letter therefore contains the information divulged therein as they make interesting reading and are eye-openers.//////It is great that our government is planning to construct elevated railways, orbital waterways and circular motorways to make life easier for our people (DS, 29 Oct). These ambitious projects will cost us billions which this government doesn't have at its disposal. However, making the ACC more effective, separating the judiciary, freeing our varsities from corrupt politics, giving our police force the necessary freedom to do their job honestly, etc., will benefit the whole country (not only Dhaka) and they wouldn't cost us a huge amount of cash either.//////I wholeheartedly support this letter (31.10.09). As an expatriate spending a considerable time every year in Dhaka I find looking for taxis whose drivers want to go where I want is a time consuming affair and often impossible. Baby taxi is a solution if it is readily available, the driver runs on meter without a grumpy face, and even happily plies short distances now covered by rickshaws. The minimum fare for baby taxis should be fixed in this light to encourage then move even short distances so that rickshaws can be slowly phased out, and car imports restricted. Refusal to ply short distances should be reported for heavy fines on baby-taxi owners. At one time Dhaka was only a city of rickshaws, some buses and horse drawn carriages. //////Our members of parliament demand the following material benefits from the government who run the country in the name of the people for the welfare of the people. MPs demand the following perks from their voters who have very 'kindly' voted them to power, otherwise the MPs would not have been seen or heard. //////I would like to bring to your attention the issue of parking tickets. Recently on a weekend, Friday at 7:00pm I went to Gulshan 2 and parked behind a building in front of Lavender Shopping Mall. I have been going there for a long time and have never been charged for parking. However, this Friday two people came up to me with a pink slip and tried to charge me Tk 10/- for parking there. I had a look at the slip and it had no registration number of DCC on it, nor was there any ID cards on those people. They told me the name of their company. According to the ticket collector they had been given this job outsourced from DCC several months ago. I queried about their registration number but they had no answer and told me to contact their boss. //////The present elected government came to power in January'09. It has the responsibility to do its job for the betterment of people. Training on technical trade is one of the ways to help the poor youth that would lead to employment opportunity and generate income for them. The number of poor people would be reduced as a result of technical education. A driver earns more than a general labourer. It is necessary to impart training in a technical trade like driving. Setting up and operating a driving school is not a costly business. //////I would like to remind all that we have been gifted with two most precious things by none other than Bangabandhu and his worthy daughter Sheikh Hasina.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.

Subsidising the prices of the aforesaid fertilisers will minimise food production costs, particularly of food grains and vegetables, and thereby encourage the farmers to grow more food.//////ALONG with corruption, another malady that pervades our body politic and society is sycophancy. Sycophancy is a vile verbal art of showering false admiration on others. It is used as a means to achieve unethical private interests. The word originates from "Sycophantes," the Greek god who used to teach the art of flattery. However, throughout the world, dishonest politicians and inefficient bureaucrats seem to have inherited this art from the royal poets who once used to flatter kings and queens, and then earn income out of this manipulative art. //////IT'S a tough call to unwind almost half a century of life to search out the prints that were left by Imtiyaz, for our lives were knotted together over this long stretch. When, in our late teens, we met I do not recall, for life was then a passion on the run lured by hazy dreams; we shared the zest for life, no-holds barred, mostly in the folds of Ramna, the young romantic Dhaka which in many ways mirrored our age.//////The power of youth can never be underestimated. The young generation is always brimming with new ideas, but alas, very little is done to tap into this resourceful treasure chest, especially here in Bangladesh.
