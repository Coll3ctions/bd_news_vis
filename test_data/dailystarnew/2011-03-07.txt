Foreign Minister Dipu Moni asserted on Friday 04 March, 2011 that the removal of Dr. Muhammad Yunus from the top position of Grameen Bank will not strain Bangladesh's diplomatic relations with the United States terming the removal decision a domestic issue which has been taken in accordance with law.//////The nation that does not revere its jewels is a doomed nation. Dr Yunus has brought so much pride, and so much joy for the whole nation, yet he finds himself out of favour with the government within five years of winning the Nobel Prize.

He stood far taller than ever before and with him we too stood taller. He was always known for being a powerful speaker. But that day, 26 years ago, he outperformed himself a thousand times over, and a thousand times more empowered we felt that day. During that crucial March afternoon, and especially through the electrifying moments of the speech he stood towering above the nation, singly shouldering the burden of leading an unprepared people towards sell assertion.//////The spring is the time of the year when the Bengali people had many times in the past risen up in protest against oppression, injustice, betrayal and tyranny by authorities in power.

I also know that there are many like me. I remember, on hearing the news of Prof. Yunus' Nobel Prize I jumped about and screamed like a person gone mad with happiness. There have not been too many such occasions in my life. My happiness was not because someone I knew got the Nobel Prize but because the prestige of Bangladesh went sky high. Only those who have lived abroad can truly gauge how cruelly, indifferently and disrespectfully Bangladesh is sometimes talked about, and it is Prof. Yunus and his work that have helped us enormously to counter that. The Wall Street Journal in a recent piece, pointing out the difference between Pakistan and Bangladesh, wrote, Pakistan's hero is a rogue nuclear scientist who unlawfully smuggled nuclear technology, while Bangladesh's hero is Prof. Yunus, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for helping the poor with small loans.//////
