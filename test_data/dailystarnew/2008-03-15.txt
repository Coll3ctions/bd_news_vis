The bad news is that when it comes to a question of access to reproductive health services, employment and decision-making, they yet have a pretty long way to go. Perhaps these are truths we have known for quite a while. What a report of the World Bank has now done is inform us officially of the conditions in which Bangladesh's women find themselves today. Implicitly, the report is also a broad hint of what must be done further to have the other half of our society take full and absolute part in any and all development related activities in the country.//////THE seminar on the role of police in preventing domestic violence has brought forth the harsh truth that such violence accounts for a huge number of deaths of women -- far greater than what is generally believed. Equally mind-boggling is the fact that 60 percent of our women are tortured in some way or the other, which indeed presents a grim picture of domestic violence. //////THE reports run by The Daily Star and other dailies during the last seven days, on so called NGOs vanishing with about Tk 500 crore after swindling the poor villagers is deeply shocking.

There was an effort to identify a qualitative leap forward in relations.

India in particular was in buoyant mode as it reiterated its views on regional flashpoints and global economic concerns.//////THE country still depends on foreign loans given by the World Bank, ADB and also other countries of the world for financing its annual development plans and other infrastructural projects. Every year shortages of internal revenue arise while implementing the annual development plans in the national budget and to meet the shortages the country has to resort to foreign loans or loans from internal banking system. Apparently the foreign loans appear to be cheap with interest rates ranging from 2 percent to 6 percent per annum, but at the end of the day total costs rise from 20 percent to 30 percent per annum .

These days people may argue whether the doubling time of knowledge is eight or ten years. Presently we are witnessing an overwhelming predominance of things that are new over those that are old. We are witnessing colossal changes, cognitive, technical and practical ones in our day-to-day lives. The enormity and rapidity of these changes mean that we suffer from a kind of desiccation. Presently, we find it extremely difficult to keep in mind what happened in the past and unite all our fond memories with our present commitments. Because of these problems of adjustment we have to endure the imbalance and uncertainties that prevail in society nowadays, King Canute was wrongly counseled by his advisers and sycophants. The roaring sea did not tarry a while. But no matter how painful and insistent the problem of adjustment is we must not only endure the imbalance, we must vow that in the end we shall overcome it.//////Disaster management, its diverse magnitudes and preparedness plans, forecasts and practical confrontation are very complex. The recent surge from water of the Bay of Bengal and its accompanying high velocity wind destroyed standing crops, marooned and rendered shelterless millions of people of about 15 southern districts, disrupted communication, cut off channels of supplies, damaged habitats, killed livestock, birds and beasts, destroyed commercial and industrial enterprises etc. The immediate impact of the disaster stupefied the survived victims for loss of near and dear ones, for want of drinking water, medicare, shelter, food etc. Instant relief was obviously difficult for want of transport, lack of foodstuff and medicine. The stupefaction was quickly overcome because of the instant availability of lots of helicopters of the defence forces and their officers and jawans for relief and rescue operations.//////Good governance is not just about government, it is also about political parties, parliament, the judiciary, the media and civil society. It is about how citizens, leaders and public institutions relate each other in order to make change happen. Election and democracy are an important part of the equation, but equally important is the way government goes about the business of governing. Good governance requires three things: (i) state capability, (ii) responsiveness, and (iii) accountability. This means citizens, civil society and government need to work together to build effective state and provide better governance to reduce poverty.//////Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project (TQI-SEP) under the auspices of Ministry of Education is the biggest project so far taken for the development of secondary education in Bangladesh. The goal of the project is to increase the quality of education of the said level by improving the quality of teaching. One of the steps the project has taken to achieve the objectives is to introduce participatory mode of teaching instead of traditional teacher-centred approach. In the traditional teacher-dominating approach, teachers are quite totalitarian. Learners are usually inactive and sometimes they are bullied to remain passive. As a result, classrooms, become joyless, tedious, monotonous, boring for both the sides, especially for learners. With a view to minimising this sort of limitations and making the classrooms joyful, interactive, and democratic, learner-friendly, learner-centred, TQI-SEP is going to initiate participatory approaches at the secondary level.//////Climate change is already happening. Glaciers are melting, sea levels have risen, and cyclones, tornados, floods and droughts are becoming more frequent as well as intense. With rising carbon emission levels, climate change is likely to get worse before it gets better. The anticipated climate change impacts in Bangladesh would be manifested in two ways in two contrasting regions such as (i) the southern part towards the sea will experience drainage congestion due to higher water and river bed levels, salinization of soil and water resources due to lower river flows, sea level rise and more intense disasters including cyclone and storm surges with higher risks because of higher water and (ii) the other part of the country in the north-western region will be subject to scarcity of water leading to drought condition and aridity with lesser rainfall and higher temperature.. Tropical cyclones, tornado and Nor'western which strike the country periodically and annually and create untold misery and loss of life, property and ecosystems, are likely to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change. Against this adverse climate change scenario the people would be striving for their livelihood which has already fallen into serious vulnerable category.//////In analysis of ecological studies, it is found that human activities are altering ecosystem on four basic point: by (a) selectively destroying species; (b) importing new species; (c) destroying habitats; and (d) introducing xenbiotics. But conservation of natural resources especially bio-resources appears most important in the present world. Conservation of natural resources is essential not only for maintaining natural balance but also for maintaining the economic soundness all over the world.//////A news item on hoax e-mails prompted me to write this piece. The Daily Star on 10 October 2007 reported that the British High Commission was warning people against being duped by Internet scams which claim to offer large financial sums. The need of such a warning was now apparent since many people had started receiving such unsolicited e-mails, purportedly from UK companies. But who warns when those come from companies of other countries! Moreover, the fact is such e-mails are the product of the computer age, and have been in practice for quite some time. This story is about one such email scam.//////An international judging panel has awarded the 2008 Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best First Book Award for the Europe and South Asia region to ////// (2007, London: John Murray) by Tahmima Anam.

I hadn't written, hadn't called, and hadn't done anything since I got back from Bhubaneswar. Bharathi, the nightingale from Karnataka, was a schoolteacher and a poet who believed in revisions. Her poem 'Taimur' had gone through at least ten rounds of revision while most would be attempting to write the next poem and paint the next page. She also had a voice that demanded the attention of even the most vocal bunch of sixty-four poets, thirty-four of whom were from Orissa. Bharathi was indeed a bridge. And with her help, I ended up without having to suffer the severe bouts of fibromyalgia - painful muscle-tightening of the back - that long distance travel otherwise triggers off in me. What cures it is simple rest. That has been difficult all my life except this one time I'm writing about now, where no discomfort was experienced despite daily bus travels for over five hours to distant places, eating out of kolapata platters, drinking tea in plastic cups, and having to use public toilets. It also speaks volumes about the therapeutic powers of poetry!//////I heard the ////// this morning//////as the mangrove forest appeared out of the darkness//////a photograph developing//////Most people have headaches from time to time.

But emotional eating  eating as a way to suppress or soothe negative emotions, such as stress, anger, anxiety, boredom, sadness and loneliness  can sabotage your weight-loss efforts.//////More people can survive a cardiac arrest when emergency medical workers use a new resuscitation method that starts with a round of 200 chest compressions before a defibrillator shock, US researchers said.//////The amount of fat a person accumulates in relation to their body size as they grow into adulthood, not their birth size or their growth per se, influences their risk of developing type 2 diabetes, results of a new study suggest.//////Bird flu  so, no chicken and no eggs in food item, which are the two major source of protein in our diet.//////To raise awareness on epilepsy disease, its treatment, care and support and rehabilitation of the patients, Sanofi-Aventis, a leading pharmaceutical company organised a programme recently, says a press release.//////THE Iraq war has put the usefulness of the UN in a very difficult spot since its inception in 1945. After the Iraq war was launched by the US-led forces in March 2003, many questioned the need for a new institutional framework and vision that could marry prudent anticipatory self-defence against immediate (not perceived) threat to states.//////Since its inception 37 years back, Bangladesh has a very good track record of conducting free and fair election for the most part. All of these elections were under microscopic watch of the European Community, other international election monitoring agencies and human rights organizations. And it is they who ratify whether elections conducted were free and fair or not. The losing party might have stated some negative remarks but that did not resonate further from any other reckonable corner. Now the question is, what we practically achieved from all those well conducted free and fair elections? Could the people of this country fulfill their long-cherished aspirations? Could we institutionalize our political or ethical values? Some might say it is the opposite. They will point at the institutionalization of corruption at all levels under the cover of democratic practice. //////South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) set up in 1985, includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. Afghanistan was incorporated as the eighth member during the 13th Summit of SAARC, which was held in Dhaka on 12 - 13 November, 2005. In the 14th SAARC Summit, Afghanistan was formally introduced in all the SAARC agreements, declaration, and legal documents by a Joint Declaration. //////The war of liberation in 1971 touched the lives of people in myriad ways. As a nation, Bengalis reaped independence at the cost of millions of lives. Many of those who lived through the war have come with their tales of the war. In Journey Through 1971: My Story, Farida Huq holds up spell binding accounts of her own experiences. The story is told in first person narrative. The author offers her deep insights and experiences with a marvellous mastery of words. //////People called the fort at Mandalay in Burma, the Glass Palace  a city in itself' the story of the last days of independence of the country that became a part of the British Empire in 1885.//////The tragic fact of life is that women, in most parts of the world, are second-class citizens and they still face inequality in all spheres of life. They are discriminated against at birth, subordinated and exploited throughout their life despite their valuable and noteworthy contributions to society and national development process, and end their life as being dependent on their sons. This fact has been eloquently noted by the author when she writes that 'the index ranking of 151 countries on gender inequality in addressing poverty, education, basic health, employment, violence, political participation' contained in various Human Development Reports prepared by the United Nations Development Programme between 1995 and 2003. These reports show that no country treats its women population as equally as it does its men.//////It's not often that a work of literary fiction successfully crosses the divide into the popular mainstream, but with the publication of his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns, author Khaled Hosseini has achieved precisely that for the second time running. Following the spectacular success of his debut The Kite Runner in 2003 -- interestingly, the first novel published in English by an Afghan author -- A Thousand Splendid Suns is a heart-wrenching tale of endurance, betrayal and an indestructible friendship set in the backdrop of over four decades of the social and political landscape of Afghanistan. Deriving its title from a poem about Kabul by a seventeenth-century Persian, the story chronicles the lives of two women whose destinies become inseparably entwined through a series of personal and, subsequently, common misfortunes. //////William Dalrymple has lately revived interest in the last Mughal emperor.
