This technique can be used reliably and effectively to map location, size, quality of wetlands and some aspects of habitat.

Some of the works accomplished by SPARRSO are as the following://////What is our unhappiness? Sakhina, can you tell me? Do you know how powerful we are in this country?

It pointed out that South Asia remains one of the most vulnerable regions for terror attacks and trans-national security breaches. That the danger which terrorism poses within and among the countries of South Asia has every potential to stymie political goodwill earned through bilateral and regional initiatives such as SAARC or BIMSTEC. That despite having emerged as the epicentre of the US led global 'war on terror', South Asia's success in hunting down the 'terrorists' or their 'masterminds' have been less than enviable. That terrorism in South Asia is trans-national in nature and necessitates a regional approach, no matter how difficult it may seem to achieve, given the political tension and mistrust among countries in the region. It is high time that countries in South Asia cease to view terrorism as their neighbour's problem, set aside the culture of recriminating neighbours to the detriment of regional cooperation and crack down on terrorism as a common security challenge.//////WITH Barrack Obama at the helm of USA, the global atmosphere, especially on terrorism and foreign policy front, is bound to change.

Despite his foolish choice to wear a coat of coloured leather lozenges in the heat of Fatehpur Sikri, the traveller wittily introduces himself as 'Mogor dell'Amore', the Mughal of Love. As Akbar falls prey to his silvered tongue, the yellow-haired traveller starts to relate a story of love which can 'make his fortune or else cost him his life.'//////
