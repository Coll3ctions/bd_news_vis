They'd wait eagerly for this radio programme, 'Anurodh-er Ashor' [requests from the audience], that played popular contemporary songs. On the All India Radio [Calcutta] programme, the last slot -- in other words, the most popular -- would be reserved for Burman's songs. Once I asked my father: 'Why not Lata [Mangeshkar], Sandhya [Mukherjee] and other conventionally easy to the ear singers? Why are Sachin Dev Burman's songs this popular?' My father's response was: 'When you can truly grasp his songs, you'd understand why.'
