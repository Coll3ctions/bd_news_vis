In addition, reference application is filed in the High Court if the assessment is not satisfactorily delivered by tax department. In essence, the proceedings of DCT are mainly the fact finding, verification and finally issues assessment orders. Appeal commissioner and income tax tribunal mainly address the grounds taken by aggrieved taxpayers against order of the DCT and finally, High Court for mainly law points involved in the assessment procedures. In reality, assessments are not always completed as expected and these are explained in the subsequent paragraphs. Universal self-assessment system is an addition to tax assessment procedures subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. Under this system, tax returns so filed are considered as final assessment unless the return is taken up for audit. Once it is picked up for audit, the special privilege attached to it is redundant and assessment is completed in usual process.

These vehicles do not belong to the rich class only. When they torch a vehicle, they put some family's future in great uncertainty, as most of these vehicles are bought with bank loans. Public transports are also vandalised during hartals. Why do they do this? Don't they have any common sense at all? The authorities must find out the culprits from the video footages and photographs and punish them severely so that they think twice before committing such crimes. //////We wait with bated breath to discover whether the 'Wonderland' on Gulshan Avenue will turn into the 'wonderland' that we all need - a truly public field with all land-grabbing private enterprises firmly removed.//////Almost every day we have been watching horrid occurrences of road accidents.

Bangabandhu was put behind bars for years and after a long struggle, the great leader succeeded in liberating Bangladesh. //////This letter is in response to the letter published on 4th May under the same title. The writer mused on some unanswered questions although several analyses are prominent in the media. Understanding the reason behind his disappearance does not require perceptiveness like Sherlock Holmes. Barrister Rafiqul Haque termed the disappearance a well rehearsed drama of the government to conceal Suranjit's graft scandal. Intuitively, something required to be done that would avert everyone's attention from the railwaygate scandal. //////As a profession, nursing is a noble one. A nurse looks after the sick and wounded persons and thus performs one of the most important duties for the mankind. But our society looks down upon the nurses, and their services are not valued in Bangladesh. Here nurses are not well educated. But education is a must for all nurses. And there remains a huge gap between nursing education and nursing practices. Nurses must reduce this gap. If the nurses practice what they learn in the trainings, the quality of nursing will be improved.//////Newspaper reports of 15 May suggest that the prime minister has finally realised the importance of dialogue between the major political parties for creating atmosphere for holding a free, fair and credible election in the country. This is an important change of her mind because she was always talking about constitutional changes and vehemently denying the caretaker government issue. I highly appreciate the prime minister for her understanding of what she should do for holding a free and fair election and also what steps she needs to take to avoid farther political unrest in the country. We thank her and urge all political parties to join hands, sit for a dialogue, and save democracy and the nation. The sooner, the better.//////Hillary Clinton was an invited guest. Like everybody concerned about the political development of Bangladesh she made some suggestions to the Bangladesh government. But our finance minister made some arrogant comments which were insulting to the guest. He did not even hesitate to insult Prof. Yunus, the only Nobel laureate of Bangladesh. Adding insult to injury, the LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam questioned Yunus' competence and capability in getting the Nobel prize. He even criticised the Nobel prize committee for awarding Prof. Yunus with such a prize. According to the minister, such awards may even be obtained through manipulation. What a discovery by an immature minister of Hasina's government! We should be ashamed of such utterance. Both the ministers showed their arrogance by making such remarks which they should apologise for.//////More than 50 world leaders were gathering in Chicago for one of the biggest Nato summits in history yesterday aiming to draw up a unified exit strategy in Afghanistan after a decade of war.//////A roadside bomb exploded in a restive suburb of the Syrian capital as senior UN officials toured the area yesterday, the latest incident in which the unarmed observer mission has nearly been caught up in the country's bloodshed.//////G8 leaders expressed their wish to see Greece stay in the eurozone at a Camp David summit Saturday, as the group papered over deep-seated divisions about how best to tackle the eurozone crisis.//////Sri Lanka's president has ordered the release of his jailed electoral rival, ex-army chief Sarath Fonseka, bowing to a US demand three years after the end of the island's long Tamil civil war.//////Abdelbaset Ali Mohmet al-Megrahi, the only person convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing over Scotland in which 270 people were killed, died yesterday, his brother told AFP.//////Strikes brought widespread violence to Nepal's largest two cities yesterday, just a week ahead of a deadline for the impoverished Himalayan nation to complete its first peace-time constitution.//////Pakistan yesterday blocked Twitter over a competition to make caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed on the social networking site, officials told AFP.//////A year back, all artists of importance, and art enthusiasts, had gathered at Safiuddin Ahmed' residence, they spoke with him formally for last time.

Honesty and politics are like oil and water, at least that has been our national experience. Politicians mask their actions with rhetoric aimed to please the public, or delude them. George Orwell once remarked: "Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind." This is where a statesman or national leader differs from a run of the mill politician. Then this is expected of the politicians, and we should not be surprised by this dichotomy in their speech and actions. A statesman uses truth to keep power in the hands of the people while a politician uses euphemism to gain power over the people. //////It is profoundly distressing that India's political parties unanimously condemned an inoffensive 1949 cartoon about Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar's pivotal role in the making of the Constitution. The cartoon, reproduced in a Class XI textbook published in 2006 by the National Council for Educational Training and Research (NCERT), shows Ambedkar riding a snail depicting the Constitution and Prime Minister Nehru standing behind him with a whip in hand.//////The BNP chairperson in public speech on May 13, referring to AL rule right after independence, declared: "As the Awami League resorted to terrorism and killings, people didn't vote it to power for 21 years.

Science and technology (S&T) complement each other via complex, two-way interaction. Science brings reason and enlightenment, and provides ideas for technological innovations, which improve the quality of life. Technology, in turn, provides science with new tools and instruments for doing research, for the storage and dissemination of information and for stimulation of further research. This organic process has led to fundamental scientific breakthroughs in the 20th century, which has unleashed a technological revolution of such unprecedented scope and power that today, for the first time in human history, we have the know-how to ensure that no human being is poor, uneducated and lacks the basic health care necessary to lead a decent life.//////In 100 days time the London 2012 Paralympic Games will begin. I am looking forward to these being the most exciting Paralympic Games yet. We are focussing on all those thousands of final details we need to get right to ensure that, when the athletes of the world come to London, all they will need to think about is doing the performance of their lives, as we will have taken care of everything else.//////
