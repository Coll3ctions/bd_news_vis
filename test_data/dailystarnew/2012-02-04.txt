The country, unhappily, is being led towards a state of political unrest with the inevitable harmful impact on the economy, and the garment industries as well as the country stand to lose enormously as a consequence. The fact that Bangladesh is poised to make significant gains in the RMG sector and may lose out because of political conflict is worth serious consideration by our political leaders. //////We are surprised that the minister for local government has taken umbrage at the media for describing the deaths in road accidents as killings.

The fearsome postures of the actors and the operatives inject a sense of helplessness in the minds of the ordinary people and no wonder the disorder and inconvenience caused by political confrontation could breed public apathy towards political protest. That, without doubt, is an unwelcome scenario.//////How free is the media or, for that matter, how free is the right to express one-self? This is the question which has arisen in India after the three speeches, one by Vice-President Hamid Ansari, another by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and yet another by Justice Markandey Katju, chief of Press Council.

It seems that ominous crises are going to plunge the country into chaos and uncertainty. //////Fuel economy and fuel efficiency" is a widely discussed topic in the world. Fuel economy is dependent on fuel efficiency and people's activities related to fuel consumption. Although these two terms are well known to the people in general, the technical term "fuel efficiency" may not be easily understood by every one. It is now important for every citizen to understand the term and to take individual responsibility to increase fuel efficiency for reducing fuel consumption that will in turn save our economy and prevent environmental pollution. It is true that if one is sincere about maintaining fuel efficiency of the machinery and equipment he uses in his day to day life, saving fuel cost is possible. In the context of fuel price hike, I would rather say hiking price will compel the people to know about increasing fuel efficiency that may help adjust their fuel cost within their ability, and at the same time contribute to national economy and environment.//////It was only very obvious long before Barack Obama advanced his confirmation on Tuesday of the CIA's use of drones against militants in Pakistan. As he gears up for elections, the US president has admitted for the first time that the offensive was in the nature of "precision strikes" against anti-American forces, notably the "al-Qaeda and its affiliates." He has stopped short of delving into the canons of international law, let alone Pakistan's seemingly valid grouse over this "violation of sovereignty."//////Nijhum Dweep is the national coastal biodiversity hotspot especially for the migratory birds in Bangladesh.

The underparts are white and lack the colours seen in breeding adults, which have a russet red head, neck and breast streaked with brown, and dark upperparts with pale brown and red edging to the feathers. It calls quietly with a 'preeep' and a 'wheeet' .//////To speak agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good words or in good order. --- Bacon, //////I have a growing feeling these days that I am getting gradually alienated from my own society and culture. Some kind of strangeness has surrounded me since long. Or has it invaded my own small world, comprising my thoughts, emotions and actions? It is strange because it is different, rather very much different, may be absolutely new, but certainly it is a changed phenomenon in one's life. However, change being a normal occurrence is expected to bring better results, improvements and all in the positive direction, looked upon as a boon in society. An opposite direction of it certainly cannot be welcome, however large a segment of society may fall for it. Then again, speaking practically, infiltration of one or two not so desirable things may perhaps be seen as small instances of cultural intrusion that no culture is immune to. But when all-out change in various walks of life shows itself with much force and is capable of metamorphosing the fabric of one's culture and society, one cannot but experience a vortex of emotions -- a whirlwind ready to make one frustrated and depressed. //////Being diagnosed with cancer is one of the worst nightmares in anyones life. The deadly cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide that accounted for 7.6 million deaths (around 13 percent of all deaths) in 2008. Unfortunately, more than 70 percent of all these cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh where resources available for prevention, diagnosis and treatment are limited or nonexistent.//////The thyroid is a small gland (popularly known as Adam's Apple) located in the front of the neck that produces hormones responsible for various functions including growth, use of energy and oxygen, immunity etc.//////Sugar is as damaging and addictive as alcohol or tobacco and should be regulated, claim the U.S. health experts. Therefore, the research team from the University of California feels that the sale of products containing added sugar should be subject to regulation through taxation and legislation, just like alcohol and tobacco.//////Insulin is a lifesaver for many people with diabetes, but it must be stored correctly. The American Diabetes Association offers these guidelines for proper storage of insulin://////Measuring blood pressure in both arms should be routine because the difference between left and right arm could indicate underlying health problems, says a study review published in The Lancet. The researchers found that a large difference could mean an increased risk of vascular disease and death.

It showed that sound waves could be used to reduce sperm counts to levels that would cause infertility in humans. Researchers described ultrasound as a promising candidate in contraception.//////With new EU sanction on oil import from Iran the European countries have joined hands with the US in a new round of measures to squeeze Iran to bring her to the negotiating table on Iran's nuclear programme. Though Iran has repeatedly stated that her nuclear programme is aimed at peaceful purpose only to meet her electricity needs which the US and her allies are declining to accept. The EU sanction came at a moment when the "US naval flotilla accompanied by British and French warships is already in the region testing the freedom of passage" in the Strait of Hormuz. Moreover the US and Israel are preparing to conduct the largest ever military exercise in February. These events have already raised tension seriously in the region and losing of nerves by either side will invite catastrophe. //////As a country importing 11 percent of its oil from Iran, the latest American and European move to isolate Iran has put China in a quandary. Should it join the West with which it has close economic ties, or ignore the call for sanctions on Iran, not backed by the United Nations, to maintain its energy security? With the recent visit of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to three oil-rich Gulf monarchies, Beijing's deft diplomacy has sidestepped the issue. //////Uncertainty has ruled Pakistan's history. After the Salala check post attack by Nato which took the lives of 24 Pakistani army soldiers, Pakistan declared to stop cooperating with the US. It cut off the Nato supply route to Afghanistan. Recently announcement has come that Pakistan is going to reopen Nato supply routes, allow the US military trainers including Special Forces teams into Pakistan and resume close cooperation with the CIA in targeting militants who use the Pakistani side of the border as a safe haven and breeding ground for extremism as early as April or May. According to the terms of engagement of nations in the international system, "there are no permanent allies, no permanent friends, only permanent interests." The US and Pakistan both are allies, not friends: they fight together, but they do not like and believe each other. What factors do lead Pakistan cooperate again? Is it a pressure from the United States or a greater strategic demand of the time?//////No one goes looking for a war. It comes suddenly, taking people unawares. And once it does, there is that sure, eerie feeling that huge havoc will be the consequence, that people will die and with them an entire set of values. That being the historical truth over the centuries, there is that other reality of war being a time when heroism and villainy make their appearance. Individuals die defending the nobility of a cause, thwarting the evil designs made by other individuals for whom the idea of a good life comes in a destruction of the lives around them. Some soldiers win wars. Other soldiers, rendered or proved qualitatively inferior to their adversaries, end up losing them, with results whose ramifications can last generations.////// When the frozen body of a young woman is discovered on a crystalline Montana morning, the heart rendering story of a family in crisis begins to unfold.
