While we realise that it is rather too early in the day to comment on such situations, we do hope that it does not become a pattern. It is regrettable that even as the nation happens to be going through a crisis over the BDR tragedy, our lawmakers, especially those in the ruling coalition, have already begun demonstrating disquieting indifference to the JS. This quorum crisis is but a repetition of the past, where parliamentary sessions were rendered pointless through similar attitudes on the part of the then ruling party. We would like to make it clear here that the entire responsibility for the quorum crisis on Wednesday must be borne by the chief whip and other whips of the treasury bench as they have more than three-fourths of the seats.//////Nearly five years ago the entire nation was rocked by the seizure of the biggest smuggled arms consignment in Chittagong.

But the settlement evoked controversy along political lines and also among a section of armed forces members. //////The revolt in the BDR headquarters in Dhaka is an eye-opener. Due to revolt, more than 50 lives have been lost, including civilians. Whatever the causes of the revolt, it is a fact that there has been serious intelligence failure, and, secondly, the death of civilians and subsequent alarm demands a serious debate on the merits of keeping the headquarters of security forces or cantonments inside crowded localities of the nation's capital.//////Cricket in the sub-continent suffered another blow as the Bangladesh-Pakistan limited-overs series was postponed for an indefinite period.//////Surjo Torun demolished Biman by 144 runs at BKSP yesterday to join the vanquished and reigning champions Abahani atop the Premier Cricket League table.//////Yesterday's postponement of the Bangladesh-Pakistan limited-overs series was not unexpected, hot on the heels of two tragic incidents -- the brutal killing at Dhaka's BDR headquarters last week and the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus in Lahore a couple of days ago. //////Who wants to be a multi-millionaire?

an indigent country like ours almost every group of people has countless grievances and unfulfilled demands. Students have demands for an efficient educational system; labourers have demands for higher wages and better living standards; while civil servants have demands for effective administrative reforms. However, having grievances and demands (no matter how grave they might be) doesn't justify mayhem by the aggrieved. Just because a few students have certain demands, it doesn't anyhow give them the right to vandalize their campuses and brutalize their teachers. Similarly, in a civilized society distressed workers aren't expected to slaughter their employers if the latter fail to fulfil the workers' rightful demands. By the same token, the incredible crimes perpetrated by the BDR mutineers is by no means a justifiable way through which a disciplined and well-trained armed force should express their grievances. It's quite apparent that there were several constructive ways through which these mutineers could have communicated their demands to the authorities. Instead of killing a great many of their superior officers they could have called a non-violent strike (or even a 'hunger strike'). Moreover, it was also a legitimate option for them to communicate with different interest groups, the media and the government policy makers via their own spokespersons. Despite having all those applicable alternatives, they resorted to indiscriminate violence that actually made us question the credibility of their blatant accusations. If they had taken a peaceful route to achieve their objectives, they might have been able to make their causes clearly justifiable. Brutal killing of superior officers apparently exposed the inadequacy of moral and cultural grooming that exists in our paramilitary force. //////The Department of Criminology and Police Science (DCPS) of Mawlana Bhasani Science and Technology University (MBSTU) in Tangail has undertaken an exceptional publication named Crime index 2007 of Bangladesh. This is reportedly the first ever initiative of this in the country.

Zoos are no longer meant to serve as showpieces, exhibiting wildlife in confinement. Rather, these are supposed to serve long-term needs of conservation by facilitating research on diverse aspects of wildlife and their management. On the front of upkeep of animals and birds, too, greater emphasis has been on securing for the wildlife an environment as close to their natural habitat as possible. //////The dastardly attack on the Sri Lanka cricket team is the death of Pakistan cricket. The country is no longer a place for going. Travel and tourism will be finished. Possibly it will become another Afghanistan with Taliban ruling the country!//////I am a mother who has a daughter like you. I am a teacher who has taught and guided students like you in their sensitive years of growing up. At this moment I have no words of comfort for you. I and all the patriotic people of Bangladesh condemn the shocking incidents of the last few days.//////Women for Women, a research & study group, wishes to record its support with your newspaper for the news "Benod Behari Chowdhury asks all to unite, save two schools". While thanking DS for its prominent coverage of the hunger strike by members of the Chittagong Civil Society led by the respected leader Benod Behari Chowdhury who is 99 years old and who surely never thought he would see such a tragic day, Women for Women registers its strong protest against Chittagong City Corporation and demands that the plan to demolish Aparna Charan City Corporation Girls' High School and Krishna Kumari City Corporation Girls' High School be immediately rescinded.//////We are a bit concerned over the issue of climate change and what would be the consequential effects of such ecological change and how it occurs. Many of us may not have a clear idea about this issue and how it would eventually affect our social, economic and environmental segments. Climate change is one of the biggest environmental challenges the world is facing now. Rising global temperatures will bring changes in weather system, raising sea levels and leading to increased intensity of adverse weather.//////At this moment there is a huge shortage of English and Math teachers in rural secondary schools and this is severe in madrasas. In almost all the rural schools, English and Math are taught by the teachers who haven't studied Math and English at their degree level. Teachers themselves do not know English and Math, so how will they teach their students? Even in England, the government gives extra facilities to the students, who are studying Math or Science at the degree level to produce Math and Science teachers in their secondary schools as there is a shortage of Science and Math teachers. //////Indian visa and its office has become a headache for visa seekers as well as neighbours of the visa office. As India is our nearest neighbouring country people have to visit India for many reasons. But having an Indian visa has become quite difficult due to heavy rush of visa seekers. Neighbourhood people of visa office unnecessarily suffer due to the crowd gathering since early hours of the day. Now Banani dwellers are very rightly opposing shifting of the office to their area. To avoid the hassles, we put forward a few suggestions which may solve the problem.//////A handful of disgruntled BDR personnel rushed inside the Durbar Hall from the back door and with a burst of gunfire killed completely unarmed officers. Their subsequent heinous acts are by now well known to every citizen of the country. With her wisdom the Honourable Prime Minister declared general amnesty to bring the situation under control. But the general amnesty certainly did not mean pardoning those who were involved in the act and the same has subsequently been made crystal clear by the Honourable Prime Minister. //////What good are they when they could not come together on the day one hundred and fifty of our bright army officers were brutally murdered? What stopped the Prime Minister from calling upon the Opposition Leader to join her in facing the grave national crisis? At a time like this they are still busy mud-slinging and blaming each other, instead of joining hands in saving the country and giving solace to the wounded national psyche.//////The photographs printed in your daily of men in white caps standing with their feet on the chest of a flattened man and rejoicing on the streets of Dhaka, again of men in the same attire throwing shoes at other men in similar attire inside sacred mosques have raised a question. Who are they? //////Eggs were to be served to the accompanying people of the bridegroom in a wedding function in Rangunia. But as the father of the bride could not manage to collect about 700 eggs at a time from the market, the bridegroom's people became very angry and later the brave bridegroom broke 19 eggs on the newly married girl's head. Actually, the man is not a Bor (bridegroom) rather a Borbor(barbarian). The innocent girl will be burdened with the memory of this incident up to her last day in this world.//////Corporate Social responsibility or CSR is a very popular buzz word today. The corporate bodies are trying to demonstrate that they are doing many social welfare activities from CSR point of view. It would be a matter of great satisfaction if they really would do so. Actually many people do not know the real essence of this commonly uttered term. The organisations should be more honest and sincere.//////Pakistan investigative agencies are of the view that militants are using Tuesday's attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore to facilitate the release of Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Zakir-ur-Rehman Lakhvi.//////Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) chief Nawaz Sharif has warned President Asif Ali Zardari that agitation will continue if he fails to restore the judiciary to its pre-Nov 3, 2007 position.//////The pre-poll tie up between the opposition Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Assam for next month's parliamentary polls has hit a major roadblock with the two parties failing to strike a formal deal. //////The United States endorsed yesterday a resumption of top-level Nato talks with Russia, setting the stage for an end to a seven-month freeze sparked by Moscow's war on Georgia.//////With President Barack Obama's backing, US lawmakers on Wednesday unveiled legislation aimed at using trade-spurred jobs growth as an antidote to Islamist extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan.//////Israeli air raids on Hamas-run Gaza killed four militants just hours after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ended her first Middle East trip vowing to breathe life into the peace process.//////A local Red Cross employee has been killed in Sri Lanka's war zone, where government troops have cornered Tamil Tiger rebels after decades of ethnic conflict, an official said on Thursday.//////Nuclear powered Pakistan posses a greater threat to the world and a bigger challenge to the United States than Afghanistan, a top US diplomat has said.//////China's Premier Wen Jiabao said yesterday that Beijing is ready to hold talks with Taiwan on political and military issues in the pursuit of ending hostility between the longtime rivals.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton consulted Nato and European allies late Wednesday on Washington's new strategy to combat the insurgency in Afghanistan.//////Pakistan faced new questions about its security forces yesterday as dramatic footage emerged of the cricket attackers making a leisurely getaway from the scene of their deadly assault.//////Six members of the Russian security forces were killed yesterday when a bomb went off in a village in Russia's Caucasus region of Ingushetia, the Interfax news agency reported.//////Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said Wednesday he could not rule out the possibility that Tamil Tigers were involved in the attack on his country's cricket team in Lahore.//////India rejected yesterday the last-minute offer by a US collector to cancel the controversial auction of Gandhi's iconic round glasses.//////At least 14 miners were killed and 11 others injured Thursday when a coalmine collapsed in southwest Pakistan's insurgency-torn Baluchistan province, officials said.//////The arrest warrant issued Wednesday by the International Criminal Court against Sudan's President Omar al-Beshir's opened up a global divide on how war crimes justice is administered.//////A car bomb exploded yesterday in a crowded cattle market south of Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and injuring 60 others, Iraqi police and medical officials said.//////With a landmark nuclear deal removing an "albatross" in relations, India says it is seeking new forms of cooperation with the United States -- and sees climate change as a prime area.//////China vowed a massive boost yesterday to social programmes even as the global crisis placed a severe strain on government budgets, reflecting growing worries about the potential for unrest.//////More than 25 percent of the world's 91 known antelope species are threatened with extinction, according to an update of the IUCN Red List, an authoritative index of threatened animal life.//////It was an exclusive occasion for Nazrul enthusiasts when most leading and contemporary Nazrul artistes gathered at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) on March 4.

Moshiur who were murdered in cold blood by my own countrymen. We met when we were only 12 at the Jhenidah Cadet College (JCC). As my elder brother had done, Moshiur's brother had also gone to study in America. That was our connection; otherwise, I knew him as a very good boy and a good cadet. But, Rahman Shafiq, as we called Col. Elahi, sat next to me in the class for all the six years we were at JCC. //////On February 25 the nation lost over a hundred officers of the armed forces in a bloody mutiny, which was waged by a disgruntled clique of BDR sepoys. These murderous mutineers had the audacity to give their victims a bad name by leveling graft charges against the valiant officers of the Bangladesh army whom they killed in a most heinous way. //////More often than not, I find that my friends who speak both Bengali and English habitually complain about their linguistic difficulties in terms of the usage of Bengali, especially in reading and writing and, somewhat amusingly, they pit it against English. Interestingly enough, they blame the language and its orthography for it. So, for quite some time, I've been attempting to tell them that the problem isn't with the language, it's with the user.//////Quick. To the bathroom. Grab the razor.
