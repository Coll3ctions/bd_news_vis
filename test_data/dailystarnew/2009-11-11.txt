No doubt, in his daily practice as a doctor he saved the lives of many patients, but it was in fact his role as a whistle-blower exposing the dangerous practices within the country's pharmaceutical sector that saved more lives, and particularly deserves the country's praise. //////The education ministry and school and college authorities in the capital yesterday agreed in principle to introduce bus service for students of certain schools in a bid to ease traffic jam on the city streets.//////Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday showed arrested an alleged member of Harkatul Jihad al Islami (Huji) in connection with the August 21 grenade attack case.//////With India importing rice for the first time in over two decades this year, Thailand and other rice producing and exporting countries in Asia are rethinking food security, as experts say further output growth has to come from technology rather than lands that have already become sparse. //////Four special state counsels of Bangabandhu murder case yesterday urged the Supreme Court to deliver a verdict giving exemplary punishment to the killers of president Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members.//////Detectives recovered stolen car parts worth around Tk 1 crore and arrested the ringleader and two members of a gang of carjackers in Fatulla on Wednesday night. //////Building Agartala-Akhaura railway line and a submarine cable linking Khulna and Chennai are among the priority projects to be placed with the Indian government during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming India visit.//////Bangladesh will receive a portion of $20 billion fund pledged by G-8 countries for global food security, said a US delegation yesterday. //////Foreign Minister Dipu Moni yesterday said the upcoming Copenhagen conference must agree on funding the victim countries grants, not loans, so that they can cope with the impacts of climate change.//////Experts blamed contaminated sources of water as well as the climate change for the sudden outbreak of diarrhoea in different areas of Dhaka and Pabna district recently. //////A suicide car bomb ripped through a packed shopping street in Pakistan's northwest town of Charsadda yesterday, killing at least 30 people and wounding around 55, officials said.//////A badly damaged North Korean patrol ship retreated in flames yesterday after a skirmish with a South Korean naval vessel along their disputed western coast, South Korean officials said.//////A team of Indian intelligence officials left the US disappointed after a week-long stay here as they could not question American national David Coleman Headley, arrested by the FBI on charges of plotting a major terror attack in India at the behest of Pakistan-based LeT.//////THE DAILY STAR has received a letter from BNP Secretary General Khandaker Delwar Hossain following his October 29 rejoinder on this newspaper's report dated October 27 and headlined Aug 21 attack on Hasina, AL Rally: It was Hawa Bhaban Plot.

That only ten percent of the ADP got implemented between July and September, 2009 does, however, make us sit up and take note. If only because of (a) the fanfare and aplomb with which the AL government had announced an all-time ambitious ADP for fiscal 2009-10 amounting to Tk 30,000 crore; and (b) the news of under-performance coming from those who are perceived to have had a role in implementing the ADP such as the finance ministry and the NBR. //////In a world confronted with newer crises nearly every day, the importance of regional cooperation, be it at bilateral or multilateral level, cannot be denied. Which brings us to the role SAARC has been playing in South Asia since the mid-1980s. Perhaps the potential that was once noted about the organization has not quite been realised to the extent one would have expected, but the fact remains that the body has brought the countries of this region together in remarkable ways. The recent visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Bhutan underscores this reality. The three-day trip has now thrown up certain new opportunities for Dhaka and Thimphu to explore.//////PRIME Minister Sheikh Hasina is, like many of us, worried about the frequent trips civil servants periodically make abroad. On the face of it, we should not be overly worried about these trips. For if civil servants, or people in other areas of life for that matter, are invited to seminars and conferences abroad, who are we to grumble? Obviously, there must be some very real, some very good reasons why all these men at the centre of administrative authority are provided with the opportunity of going abroad to speak for the country. //////BHUTAN (Druk Yul -- the land of the Thunder Dragon) is a land-locked country located between India and China. It shares 470 km border with China and 605 km with India, out of its total border of 1,075 km. Since the mountains are very high on the north, its connectivity on land with the external world lies in the south through India. //////THE RMG sector is our second largest foreign exchange earner. Virtually with no past experience our private sector has been able to prove its dynamism by becoming the fourth largest supplier of readymade garments in the world, even though Bangladesh is heavily dependent on imported fabrics and yarn from other countries. The success it has gained is mainly due to its competitive price, which is due to low wages of garment workers. //////The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) yesterday announced a fresh list of 31 players for the SAFF Championship camp keeping sacked Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido's choice of 23.//////It is the metaphorical equivalent of being ejected from the casino even before the roulette wheel has stopped turning. You never even had the chance to find out whether you betting the house on 13 had paid off. In football terms it would equate to giving Fabio Capello the boot for having the gall to not pick Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in the same team. In slightly more specific terms, it would be similar to showing BFF (Bangladesh Football Federation) president Kazi Salahuddin the door because of his non-linear approach towards football development. No youth structure but already talking professional league?

At one stage of the dispute, Aminul and Jabbar of the same village were killed on the spot by the aforesaid convicts. //////Air pollution in capital city Dhaka has gone higher than Mexico City and Mumbai killing thousands prematurely each year. According to the Department of Environment (DoE), the density of airborne particulate matter (PM) reaches 463 micrograms per cubic meter (mcm) in the city during December-March period - the highest level in the world. Mexico City and Mumbai follow Dhaka with 383 and 360mcm respectively. An estimated 15,000 premature deaths, as well as several million cases of pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illness are attributed to poor air quality in Dhaka, according to the Air Quality Management Project (AQMP), funded by the government and the World Bank.//////As Bangladesh is an agricultural country, village people are actually keeping us alive. They work from dawn to dusk in the fields for growing different crops and we buy and eat those very easily without thinking about their hard toil. Again, they face natural disasters almost every year. //////According to FAO, currently about 45% population in Bangladesh are below the poverty level while around 20% are hardcore poor. The population is predominantly rural, with about 85 per cent of its 135 million people living in rural areas. For their livelihoods rural people depend mainly on land, which is both fertile and extremely vulnerable. Most of the country is made up of flood plain, and while the alluvial soil provides good arable land, large areas are at risk because of frequent floods and cyclones, which take lives and destroy crops, livestock and property.//////The article entitled The Mystery Remains Unsolved by Elita Karim in DS on October 30, 2009 was a unique piece , which appealed for justice for the victim of a barbarian from the educated community.

The beach was full of hawkers. //////I would like to draw the attention of the ministry concerned or any person who has read the anti-smoking law.

Is this the correct interpretation of the law?//////During the last couple of weeks a few incidents have drawn my attention which might have political ramifications in my judgment. These are://////If anybody with common sense listens to the suggestions of the former Chairman of Regulatory Reforms Commission Dr. Akbar Ali Khan, he will surely agree with me that he is not only a great patriot but also a very efficient government servant with a strong commitment to the nation.//////Daylight Saving Time in the western hemisphere countries has a definite purpose and period which extends from April till end of October. Setting the clock right in tune with sunrise and sunset in winter time is the most logical thing to do. If this is not done, we will be wasting power in lighting up our houses in the morning. Moreover, as the days get shorter, it will become even more difficult to get up when it is will remain pitch dark even at 6.30 am, since our biological clocks are naturally tuned to sunlight.//////Motor vehicles are wasteful in terms of energy and fuel used to transport only two or three persons at most! Every time the car engine runs, four fifths of the energy supplied goes to overcome the frictional resistance of the car engine, transmission and the bodyworks and their weights which accounts for the high fuel consumption! The electric car however goes a long way toward reducing wasted energy by replacing the internal-combustion engine with batteries. Even so, electric cars lose about 60 percent of the energy because heavy mechanical parts are still used to deliver energy from the batteries to the car wheels through air box and mechanical transmission system. Lately, though, engineers have come up with a far more efficient way to accomplish the same task: by using magnets in the wheels; in place of traction motor and mechanical power transmission gears.//////I am working in an NGO. Showing respect to the government's new timing for office, our new office time is now 10:00 am 6:00pm. The government decided the timing of private offices, as if there are no women working in private offices, they don't have children! //////I was shocked to see the news item that a BAF training plane crashed in Bogra, while on a training flight. The type and condition of the plane does not seem to suit training for the two trainees of the rank of Squadron Leader! The enquiry must show whether it was training and who among the two was the trainee.//////The words of Energy Adviser Dr. Tawfiq E Elahi Chowdhury on not reverting back to the old timing in an interview with BBC Bangla Service on October 25, 2009, have baffled us, because the adviser himself admitted that the length of day and night are quite different in countries where DST is being used for a long time but in tropical countries like Bangladesh the difference is not much.//////Bangladesh has been expanding its industrial base in the last two decades. Mentionable development has been achieved in industries like garment, cement, textile, steel, sugar, paper, pharmaceutical, shipbreaking, shrimp culture etc. Manpower export has already been proved a significant financial positive factor for Bangladesh economy. In addition to the garments industry, information technology and shipbuilding have tremendous potential. To operate the existing industrial ventures, to expand the industrial sector and to export technical manpower abroad, Bangladesh needs a huge technically educated manpower. Without proper manpower, no industry can be developed. But if we evaluate the scenario of Bangladesh for expanding and for modernizing technical education a poor picture is observed.//////A difficult question of funding political parties from the state coffer has been launched by TIB, backed by its research, and perhaps seconded by our Election Commission, for discussion. Actually, it's a dilemma that goes beyond Bangladesh. In the absence of mass membership contribution, many political parties, or politicians, rely on private donations to support their activities. But private donations, mostly corporate, are often determined by influence-peddling. So, making a case for public funding of political parties to keep them honest is an option, but isn't easy. It could be a doubled-edged sword, while public money goes to the parties, they can't be made accountable. //////The continuing saga of extra judicial killing and torture by law enforcing agencies such as Rab is extremely disturbing, to say the least. The recent killing of an actor and torture of a New Age journalist by Rab prompted the constitution of departmental enquiries, the outcome of which is anybody's guess. While condemning such illegal acts committed by the very organ of the government which is supposed to protect the innocent and punish the culprit within legal boundaries, I think everyone also needs to ponder who is the beneficiary of such extra judicial killings and why this saga is going on unabated for such a long time. The summary disposal of alleged criminals before giving them an opportunity to speak out and expose the masterminds and godfathers is advantageous to those very people who create and nurture top criminals. //////Maoist activists blocked all roads in and out of Nepal's capital Kathmandu in the latest stage of a two-week protest against the government yesterday.//////A landslide triggered by torrential seasonal rains swept through a hilly region in southern India, killing at least 42 people, an official said yesterday.//////The United States said Monday it would no longer allow its row with Myanmar to hold its ties with Southeast Asia hostage, as President Barack Obama geared up for his debut official visit to the region.//////More than 500 people have died from swine flu in India since the first fatality was reported in August, the health ministry said Monday.//////Criticising former Pakistan president general Pervez Musharraf for his verbal attack on President Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal House spokesman Ejaz Durrani has called the former general 'a hypocrite'.//////President Barack Obama joins this shaken military community yesterday in mourning victims of a bloody rampage amid growing questions about the chief suspect's links to militant Islam.//////The White House on Monday pressed Iran to quickly respond to a deal that would supply the Islamic Republic with enriched nuclear fuel, or else risk fresh sanctions.//////Maoists blew up a school building at Banbirua in Jharkhand's Latehar district, a senior police officer said yesterday.//////The two Koreas briefly exchanged naval fire yesterday along their disputed western sea border, with a North Korean ship suffering heavy damage before retreating, South Korean military officials said, as cross-border tensions rose a week before a scheduled US presidential visit.//////US efforts to revive the Middle East process floundered yesterday after President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held closed-door talks amid signs of friction.//////"Celebrating Life" -- the composite competition providing a platform for upcoming filmmakers, photographers and lyricists -- is all set for this year's finale.
