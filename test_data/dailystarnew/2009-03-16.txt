mentioned Dr Anwar Hossain instead of Dr Anwarul Islam, professor of Dhaka University. //////A study of six high-rise buildings in the capital by this newspaper has resulted in some disturbing findings. The bottom line is that these buildings (and one can be reasonably sure there are others as well) are dangerously exposed to disasters. These buildings are plagued either by a lack of fire-fighting equipment or trained manpower to operate whatever equipment is there. Friday's fire incident at the Basundhara city complex has only exposed the glaring gaps that characterise safety measures in skyscrapers or buildings that are regularly used by citizens. //////We are concerned at the unabated extraction of underground stones of various sizes with the help of machines despite a government ban. The extraction process has created large holes in some areas of Jafflong and Bholaganj, thereby completely altering the structure of earth below. According to environmentalists, for centuries boulders and small stones coming down with water from hills and mountains have been depositing underneath the top soil in the plain lands and in the riverbeds of Bangladesh. Over time these stones went deeper into the earth and became a part of the earth structure. Therefore, extraction of the stones quickens the process of loosening of the earth deep below. It is therefore not surprising that environmental scientists and activists would express their fear that such distortion of nature might trigger a severe environmental disaster in the near future. We wonder what stops the authorities concerned from taking stern action against the violators of the law. //////THREE weeks on, the Pilkhana carnage continues to be the staple of discourse in drawing rooms, the city's diplomatic cocktail circuit and across the country's formal or informal gatherings. In the meantime, the nation is suffering from nervousness and unease characterised by paranoid anxiety. Throughout our existence as a nation, the breathtaking frequency of violence in the country would have us believe that we live on the top of a volcano, without knowing whether it will erupt. Before we can adapt to one sad reality it is overtaken by another. Barely out of the horror of the liberation war, we faced the ugly reality of the Bangabandhu's assassination. The wound thus inflicted on the national psyche never healed. It rather festered, as the unfortunate tradition carried on.//////THE BDR mutiny caught us unawares. The prime minister led from the front as she was expected to do. Her astute handling of the crisis saved the lives of so many military and civil hostages inside the BDR compound. With that ended the first phase of the crisis. //////Weakness can sometimes be a blessing. It has often been the case in an Abahani-Mohammedan match.

A few days after the smooth handover of power to a political government and restoration of parliamentary democracy, this incident has given rise to many questions, some of which are legitimate, some far-fetched and some misleading. Some questions that are coming up frequently from the opposition bench in parliament surround the general amnesty offered by the prime minister and the time that passed from the start of the mutiny to the surrender of the mutineers. A blame game started and it has disappointed many of those who hope for a united stand of our political leaders during a national crisis. //////The descendants of the Portuguese are still to be seen in Chittagong. Most of them married local women and are known as Kala Firingis or Matia (earth coloured) Firingis. They are mostly Roman Catholic Christians. During the British period they enjoyed certain privileges and were given preference in appointments in certain institutions like the port and the railway and in clerical posts in government offices. An area in the city known as Firingi Bazar is said to be named after them. The most significant contribution of the Portuguese is the presence of many Portuguese words in the Bengali language which are in daily use till now. A few examples are - Anaras (pineapple), Pepe (papaya), Padri (clergyman), Fita (ribbon), Alpin (pin), botam (button), Chabi (key) etc.//////Without any further delay all foreign spies and their local agents must be found and charge-sheeted for their involvement in the extra judicial killings starting with the father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman & Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman up to the carnage at the BDR headquarters. //////Muhammad Zafar Iqbal's recent book titled  Muktijhuddher Itihash (History of The Liberation War), which was launched in this year's Ekushey Book Fair, is an excellent book.

He has focused on the division, discrimination, exploitation and conspiracies that Bengalis had to face from the Pakistani rulers and which ultimately led to the separation of East Pakistan from West Pakistan. //////I'd been a coward I kept thinking what would people say. What would my friends say? What if they don't agree with me. Now, its high time I voice it out, if I don't write now, if I don't voice it now, may be it's not worth being flesh and blood. May be I'll lead a life of something I despise the most, a jellyfish--a creature with no spine.//////Spending the afternoon watching the shocking live footage of yet another tragedy befalling us, I can only wonder what the enquiries will conclude, and what comes next?//////It just seems a split second ago our country was on the brink of a radical change. The ambience was of great optimism. And the wind of change was blowing which generated a fervent aspiration. Now, barely three months have passed, and it's all chaotic. The government has plunged into a tumultuous situation which promises no end. After listening to all the biased and unbiased comments of numerous people nationwide, a question triggers one's thoughts. Was it their fault? We are in the midst of an atrocious and wicked world where people are killing their brothers. The cause behind this hazardous situation is one simple thinganimosity. In adverse circumstances, we human beings are so carried away by our anger that we tend to transgress the regulations of plain rationality. //////The other day my friend Binod Mangsang was reading a Bangla newspaper. At one stage he got stuck up at a heading, it read Amar Meyeke Bachan, Baba (Save my daughter ). I became curious at that and went through the report . To my utter dismay, I came to know that a woman named Champa Khatun had been barbarously tortured by her husband's family. //////The media is the main outlet through which people receive information. With the passage of time, getting news from every corner of the world has become easy. The electronic media is showing us what is happening throughout the world within a very short period of time. The media defeats autocracy and conquers humanity! It destroys root of injustice. While the media is to be used for serving humanity, we sometimes feel that in some cases it remains silent. //////With the advent of spring, we have to face a myriad of problems in our day-to-day life. In other words, we are hard put because of the scarcity of water, to speak nothing about the other problems that continue to plague urban life. As we wake up in the morning, and turn on the tap, we find that there is no water. Sometimes several drops of water trickle down, augmenting our vexation.//////The other day I was travelling in a bus on my way back home from Agrabad to GEC circle. The bus was horribly jam-packed as there wasn't any tiny space left. At that moment, a young woman was struggling to keep balance as the people were rushing inside the bus to have a better position. I was surprised to see none around the woman showing any kind of respect for her. So, I decided to give my own seat to her. But to my utter surprise a burst of laugher came out from my right side where a group of young people were sitting and exchanging dirty jokes with each other. I was puzzled for a while as though I had committed a sin by giving my seat to that woman. //////Despite national and international pressure to put an end to the ongoing political turmoil in the country, President Asif Ali Zardari is firm about not reinstating sacked Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.//////Pakistan's ruling coalition has been split and the country brought to the brink of chaos by broken promises from President Asif Ali Zardari about reinstating judges sacked under emergency rule.//////Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari is not willing to restore the dismissed chief justice of the country because of the massive corruption cases against him, cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has said. //////Six months into the job, President Asif Ali Zardari has pulled Pakistan into a crisis that has shattered hopes his civilian rule would put national interest above naked ambition, analysts say.//////National polls in India used to be a two-horse race with the country's oldest political party, the Congress, vying with the Hindu nationalists for the right to govern the world's largest democracy -- but not any more, say analysts.//////Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati said on Sunday her party would fight the Lok Sabha polls on its own but did not rule out an alliance with the Third Front after the elections.//////Taliban leader Mullah Omar has given his approval for talks aimed at ending the war in Afghanistan and has allowed his representatives to attend Saudi-sponsored peace negotiations.//////Taliban militants in northwestern Pakistan torched eight trucks carrying supplies for Nato forces in neighbouring Afghanistan in a pre-dawn attack yesterday, police said.//////With resignation of two key members from the Pakistan cabinet, and the pass up of several unpopular decisions, cracks have begun to appear within the ruling Pakistan People's Party.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton phoned Pakistani leaders Saturday ahead of a protest march on the capital which risks further destabilising the nuclear-armed nation, local officials said.//////Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain has sought a three party alliance for forming a government in Punjab.//////Two Sunni Muslim men were shot dead Sunday in the second apparent sectarian attack in a restive town of northwest Pakistan in as many days, a senior police official said.//////New investigation undertaken by a New York-based daily reveals that al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden could be ensconced in Pakistan's trekker paradise of Chitral.//////The United States is planning to build a USD 400-million sophisticated "spy blimp" that will float 65,000 feet above the Earth and track enemy aircraft and troop movement on the ground in troubled nations like Pakistan and Afghanistan, an American newspaper has claimed. //////Israel's outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said yesterday that his government had been ready to sign a peace deal with the Palestinians but that they had lacked the courage to do so.//////Iran's reformist ex-president Mohammad Khatami is considering withdrawing from the June presidential election, local news agencies Fars and Mehr reported yesterday.//////Cancer-stricken British reality television star Jade Goody who is reported to be close to her end has said in a final interview that she wants to be remembered as a fighter.//////A string of bombs ripped through parts of Afghanistan yesyterday, killing four US soldiers and three Afghan civilians, officials said, in attacks linked to a Taliban-led insurgency.//////Politicians, corporate executives, engineers and greens gather here today for a week-long arena aimed at tackling the planet's fast-growing water crisis.//////The three-day 'Lalon Smaran Utshab' (memorial festival) ended on March 12 at the Chheuria Akhra (den) in Kushtia.//////Century-old coins have been recovered by the police at Bangabari village under Gomostapur upazila in Chapainawabganj recently.//////Canada-based Indian director Deepa Mehta is a busy woman as is actress Preity Zinta, the protagonist of her latest film "Videsh" about the struggles of a married Indian woman subjected to domestic violence at her in-laws' in Canada.//////The 174th birth anniversary of Sri Ramkrishna Paramahamsa was celebrated with a two-day programme (on March 12 and 13) in Thakurgaon.

He is former president Hossain Mohammad Ershad, who has said that foreign investigators who do not know our language cannot make much headway. //////THE most dangerous kind of lie is the one that has a tiny bit of truth mixed inside. As maxims go, that is not very well known. Liars do not advertise their wares, and the truthful are easily seduced. The broad space between honesty and deception is occupied by the gullible. To prey on the gullible is the politician's art. //////AN incendiary apple puff mystery; the literary festival becomes a love-fest; and grumbles over a world poetry prize//////
