The party is nowhere in UP despite the Indira Gandhi family descending on the state in full strength. Punjab and Uttrakhand, which were expected to go to the Congress, have slipped from its hands. The party has been routed in Goa and the only consolation prize is Manipur, where feuding factions do not allow a government run for long.//////In an ideal world, there are some stories we'd love to avoid -- those with an excess of blood and gore.

There is a general sense of alarm across the country, aroused by a recent spurt in crime involving the young and including everything from extortion to robbery to arson to murder.//////In pursuit of a stronger and more assertive position in the global community, Russians gave Vladimir Putin virtually his fourth straight mandate -- including four years of regency -- in the recent presidential election.

Is this the end of a democratic wave ushered in by the Arab Spring and the Responsibility to Protect, the R2P doctrine that the international community applied to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's threatened massacre of his citizens? Published accounts estimate more than 9000 people have fallen in the Syrian unrest, with thousands wounded and displaced while others linger in government prisons. One question that emerges is whether the global community is complicit by failing to stop the mayhem.//////After decades of isolation, Myanmar is again on the international radar. A series of high-level interactions with Western dignitaries including the US Secretary of State and the British Foreign Minister are indicative of this. While democracy in Myanmar is still in an embryonic stage, the international community seems to have opened its arms to the government of Myanmar. With the US indicating a withdrawal of economic sanctions against Myanmar in the near future, the biggest questions that come to mind are: Why now, and what next? //////The work is a timely and valuable contribution to the annals of publications on the economy of Bangladesh. Coming exactly forty years after the liberation of Bangladesh, the book meets a long-awaited need for a comprehensive and lucid presentation on how the economy has performed in the longer-run during this period. It is a successor of the seminal and benchmark studies by A.R. Khan (The Economy of Bangladesh, Macmillan, 1972) and A.R. Khan and M. Hossain (The Strategy of Development in Bangladesh, Macmillan in association with OECD Development Centre, 1989) and adds to the efforts of the very few others who have attempted such periodic stock-taking exercises. One comes across more numerous studies, published both in Bangladesh and abroad, of the type which concern themselves with questions of the current challenges and future prospects of the economy of Bangladesh. The stock-taking exercise is the more difficult of the two genres. This publication fully meets and exceeds expectations in terms of its technical analysis, presentation of facts, and interpretation of past trends, while still not skirting issues and questions of the challenges, obstacles and opportunities going forward. The author is to be congratulated for this contribution, and more so for the very readable style in which it is written without compromising on the rigour of the analysis and references to theory, research and empirical findings.//////Former Bangladesh ambassador Barrister Kazi Ahmed Kamal's book, //////, is an exceptional addition to the political history of Bangladesh.
