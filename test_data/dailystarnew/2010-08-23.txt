Women lose their natural ability to conceive with age. Egg formation process called oogenesis begins before a girl is born during the prenatal development of the ovaries. In the Embryonic Ovaries the number of eggs cells are determined. Biologically speaking at birth a girl baby is born with two million eggs. During puberty only 3-400,000 eggs remained alive. In case of male, sperm production is continuous since the diploid mother cells that give rise to primary spermatocytes continue mitosis through out life. However sperm count become lower with age in man. Sperms are freshly generated by spermatogenesis compared to the egg which started the process before birth and set the number at early stage of meiotic cell division. Set numbers of eggs during prenatal development in girls continue to die and get aged with the passing of time. //////The Arabic word Ramadan is derived from 'Ramad' which means - to burn or to destroy something by fire.

With a view to bringing qualitative changes in education the ministry of education introduced School Based Assessment (SBA) of students as a part of creative question system. Generally, in the secondary schools, the examinations focus on assessing students' ability to memorize what they have been taught. But to ensure a quality education, proper assessment is needed along with an effective syllabus. So, the government asked the schools across the country to carry out SBA of students of class VI-IX, instead of the existing evaluation system that depends solely on examination. With the introduction of the new assessment system, students' promotion to the next class level will depend not only on examination results but also on their performance throughout the year and on their personal development. Some essential qualities such as oral presentation, leadership, tolerance, co-operative attitude, school behaviour, co-curricular activities, and social values are included in the assessment system. But it is a matter of great regret that many a school does not follow the rules of the SBA. There are some teachers in every school who are not at all willing to implement it. They are habituated in traditional lecture method, rather than participatory ones. That's why the students get bored and try to whisper in the classroom. At times, the teachers become emotional and are compelled to give corporal punishment to the students. If the SBA is properly implemented, no student will get chance to waste his valuable time and won't be bored with the learning method.//////The gas is a priceless asset, which is being wasted each and every day due to the negligence of some housewives, who do not realize the value of it.

I was taking a look at girl's panjabi''. A foreigner was also there. She took a panjabi out and asked the sales girl that where she could get a pant. The person who has been asked the question did not understand her as she does not know English. The foreigner asked her the same question by saying pants, I want a pant, do not you have a pant with this? The sales girl failed to understand her again and was really ashamed of her as she could not speak English and started feeling inferior. She, restlessly, called another sales girl to help her out.
