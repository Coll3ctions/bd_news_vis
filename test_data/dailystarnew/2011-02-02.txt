And what was particularly noticeable was the clear propensity of non-Bangalee scholars as well as politicians to propagate the demand for Urdu as the language of the state. It did not matter that Urdu was not the mother tongue of the peoples of the five provinces of Pakistan --- East Bengal, Punjab, Sind, Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Province.

We fully understand the sentiments of the experts, all of whom are highly respected individuals in society. For the minister to suggest that work on the project is being held up owing to the ego of these experts is actually to look away from the reality. He would have done better had he examined the bureaucratic reasons behind the delay in project implementation.//////As much as the opening position is most satisfying, the middle-order is the most troublesome for the Bangladesh think-tank ahead of the World Cup.

To me personally it seemed like the best thing that ever happened in this country after achieving independence in 1971. No doubt it is a milestone achievement in the transportation sector.

I simply wonder when this nation shall become civilized, or shall we remain rustic forever?

It is the priority vehicle number one on the street. Since I did not have the opportunity of coming across any presidential motorcade, while in Houston, I think by all means school buses are the number one vehicles plying the streets.

I felt humiliated. Memories of Pilkhana tragedy came crowding in my mind. I thought who actually was behind the killings.
