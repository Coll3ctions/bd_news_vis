Graft that has rocked the foundations of the banking system. Unfortunately, the Board of Directors cannot exonerate itself of any blame. The board is supposed to play a supervisory role. They receive copies of audit reports and most important of all, directors are supposed to vet the process by which large loans are disbursed. As it is, the management works under their watch from policy watch to operations. Hence, the board cannot absolve itself of any responsibility in this case. Whatever may be claimed, board members cannot pass the buck over to the management since they did not object to or raise any suspicion on the big chunks of cash that were taken in loans by Hall-Mark over a six month period since October 2011. //////There are indeed times when our perception of the right and the wrong is shaken due to the impossible that happens through the cracks of the system.

heritage and culture, were burning, the police did nothing to stop the mayhem. And then the politicians as usual gave statements blaming each other with a view to gaining political advantage out of the outrageous incident. Suranjit Sengupta rightly pointed to the law enforcers' inaction in this regard.

The very manner of the attack learly shows that it was preplanned and well-orchestrated. //////Many diagnostic centres are playing with the helpless patients of the country. In most of the cases, they charge exorbitantly high fees. The main reason behind this is that they have to pay a large percentage of the money to a section of doctors who refer the patients to those diagnostic centres. Sometimes they recommend unnecessary tests for earning extra money. They refuse to see the test reports if those are done in any other diagnostic centre. It is commonly known that such doctors are paid 40% of the money charged for the tests from the patients. In a recent investigation, aired in a famous news channel, it was shown that a doctor earns taka 24 lakh only from the diagnostic centres a year.

When you are on a short trip to a nearby place, it is always better to walk. There is an alarming number of diabetes patients and heart patients in Bangladesh who should walk regularly. Walking reduces all the risks associated with different kinds of diseases. But where to walk? Footpaths are illegally occupied by the vendors and land-grabbers. They have grabbed almost all the footpaths of this city forcing the pedestrians to walk on the road and there is no one to take care of this. Even the busy streets of this city are not out of the clutch of the footpath grabbers. Sometimes they even occupy the roads hampering smooth traffic movement. //////Here in Houston, Texas we were watching the 14th anniversary celebrations of Channel i live, it made me post my views on this favourite daily of mine immediately.
