It is more embarrassing when the PM herself, while making the error, hints of wrongdoing by this newspaper in the press conference on Wednesday as to how a particular daily newspaper could publish the letter sent to Anti-Corruption Commission before the Commission, the finance ministry or I got it. She then asked the journalists to ...please make an inquiry to see if there is any ill motive or purpose behind it. She was referring to the letter, dated 9 January 2013, sent to the ACC by Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief of the World Bank's external panel, following his teams visit to Dhaka. //////The holy Eid-e-Miladunnabi, marking the birth and death anniversary of Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (pbuh), will be celebrated across the country today with due religious solemnity. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has blocked a move by the energy watchdog to increase retail power tariff, considering its burden on consumers and the public at large. //////BNP yesterday threatened that its lawmakers would quit parliament if the government did not restore the caretaker government system.//////Sikder Real Estate Ltd, the local partner of Dong AH-ASCON-Sikder JV, issued a rejoinder to a report published in The Daily Star on January 15 with the headline "Rajuk boss resigns, retracts a day after.

That is because the Prophet was one of us, was indeed an individual whose journey through the endless vicissitudes of life gave him to understand the complexities men and women go through along the long trail between life and death. The Holy Prophet's association with the quotidian details of existence before he received the call from divinity is a story which is as much his as it is ours. And then there is, of course, the huge impact Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has had on the lives of millions, on the imaginations of the generations that followed his propagation of Islam. Today, the message of peace and brotherhood and belief in the Almighty he disseminated in his lifetime remains the focus of our dream of what our own lives should be.//////In spite of a number of ministries and bodies working to ensure food safety in the country, adulteration and excessive use of chemicals such as formalin, calcium carbide, pesticides and artificial growth regulators continue unabated, making everything from fruits and vegetables to fish unsafe for consumption. Consequences range from immediate food poisoning to long-term effects on health which include but are not limited to skin diseases, asthma and cancer. The problem persists despite pure food laws originating in 1959 which were updated in 2005 and the occasional operations of mobile courts against adulterated food. The recently introduced 'formalin free' markets in some areas, though certainly a positive measure, are essentially offering what should be not an exception but the norm. //////From being a batsman woefully out of form in recent times Khulna Royal Bengals skipper Shahriar Nafees came roaring back to form by plundering the first century by a Bangladeshi batsman in an official T20 match against Duronto Rajshahi at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna yesterday. The 197-run unbeaten opening partnership he shared with Lou Vincent set the platform for a comprehensive 68-run victory, their first in the second edition of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) T20. //////In a low-scoring match where batsmen from both sides found it hard to get the ball off the square, the Chittagong Kings secured their first win of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) T20 by defeating the Barisal Burners by 21 runs at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna yesterday. //////* Three-member committee submitted investigation report to BCB president on Wednesday.//////Barisal Burners captain Brad Hodge became the first ever batsman to score more than 5000 runs in T20 cricket with his 34 against the Chittagong Kings in Khulna yesterday. He reached the landmark in 171 matches. Hodge, who has been Barisal's mainstay ever since the inception of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) T20, has played for 14 Twenty20 teams around the world and scored at an average of 36.29. He scored two centuries and 34 half-centuries in this format of the game.//////Having picked up more than 150 wickets and scored close to 3000 runs in T20 cricket, Pakistan all-rounder Azhar Mahmood, playing for the Barisal Burners in the Bangladesh Premier League, is considered a veteran in this format of the game today.

How much more innocent people should suffer because of some "culprits"? I was utterly shocked when I read in the newspaper about a 10-year-old boy getting killed in a gun battle between two factions of Chhatra League at Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) in Mymensingh. What a shame! Time has come to question whether student politics should at all exist in our country. Instead of bringing honour it has rather brought violence, shame and disrespect. More and more these student groups are becoming violent and ruthless. Why had this boy of 10 to be the victim of senselessness? Will the parents of the hapless boy get justice under the present government?//////I refer to the news published in The Daily Star on the 5th of January 2013 titled "Obesity bigger health crisis than hunger." It seems that it is better to remain hungry than becoming obese. Obese people are at a greater risk of getting afflicted with various diseases than the hungry people. Eating junk food and drinks and doing no exercise invite obesity for kids. Obesity also creates heart disease, diabetes and kidney diseases. The number of obese children is on the rise in the urban areas of Bangladesh. Parents and teachers can discuss this issue with children and make them aware of the bad impacts of junk food and electronic gadgets. This will change their food habits and other bad practices and thus the number of obese children will decrease in Bangladesh.//////Guests are those who deserve to get special care and hospitality. But in Bangladesh hunting the guest birds during winter is a very common scene. Though there are laws prohibiting hunting and selling of guest birds in the open market, the hunting spree has not stopped. The punishment of hunting and selling migratory birds is jail term and fines. Birds and other wild animals directly and indirectly keep our ecology balanced. We have already lost many kinds of exotic birds. It is high time we came forward and protected the local and migratory birds of our country.//////It is with great interest that I noticed a couple of letters published in The Daily Star last Friday regarding the demands by the Shadharan Chhatra Parishad that the government should raise the age limits for government jobs. //////The 22nd January will remain one of the most memorable and a historical day for the nation as the first verdict against a collaborator of Pakistani occupation forces was delivered from International Crimes Tribulnal-2. The judges showed unprecedented discretion as well as bravery in delivering their maiden verdict sentencing Abul Kalam Azad (Bachchu Razakar) to death by hanging. Charges like killing, rape, abduction, torture and arson, and genocide were brought against the convict and all proved to be true except one. The historic judgment was given accordingly.//////Padma bridge is the long cherished dream of the people but the dream now appears to be very distant. The World Bank has told the government again and again to take action against those involved in corruption but the government did not pay heed to any of the allegations brought by the World Bank. The government has left no stone unturned to save a particular minister. The PM even called him a 'patriot'. Earlier we saw that the vociferous railway minister was very adept at articulating his views against corruption. But the midnight drama at the Pilkhana has left the people of the country dumbfounded. And he still remains a minister. But this very government has taken nefarious measures to undermine the country's lone Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus. The sooner the government realises its mistakes and takes measures to control the all-engulfing corruption, the better for the country. This government has done many remarkable works: the first verdict of ICT has just been announced, remittance flow has increased, etc. but all its good deeds have been eclipsed by corruption and the excesses committed by BCL.//////Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. About 1100 people live per square kilometre and the population growth rate is 1.34 percent per annum which adds 1.8 to 2.0 million people every year. Currently, more than 35 percent of the population is below 15 years. In the slums of the capital and other cities, we see that these people are deprived of basic amenities of life. It is very common that children of poor families start going to school only to drop out the next year. //////The government is acting in a very strange fashion and has shown its fear and uneasiness by imprisoning Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the acting general secretary of BNP on false charges. He is not getting bail and the charges brought against him are so ridiculous that people feel outraged.//////What was the fault of the 10-year-old girl? It was the age of playing with friends and going to school. But she left school, used to help her mother after her father's death. She was not aware of the cruel world. Punishing those criminals with death sentences will not be enough. Let us (people, government and the law enforcement agencies) try to stop these crimes forever and ensure a safe life for girls.//////The UN is launching an inquiry into the impact on civilians of drone strikes and other targeted killings.//////North Korea yesterday said it planned to carry out a third nuclear test and more rocket launches aimed at its "arch-enemy" the United States in response to tightened UN sanctions.//////Pakistan's top court yesterday ordered officials to register a second criminal case against the prime minister, raising the pressure on the government as it nears the end of its term in office.//////India's first special court to deal with crimes against women opened in West Bengal state yesterday.//////Amidst strain in bilateral ties arising out of ceasefire violations, Pakistan yesterday said it wants to resolve all issues with India, including tensions along the Line of Control, through talks as dialogue is the best way to address such matters.//////Pakistan's top law officer yesterday disclosed for the first time that security agencies are holding at least 700 people indefinitely without trial in connection with the "war on terror".//////A South Korean court yesterday sentenced the elder brother of President Lee Myung-Bak to two years in jail after convicting him on corruption charges.//////One of the main Islamist groups in Mali split yesterday, with the breakaway faction saying it was ready for talks to end a two-week-old French-led offensive, amid mounting concerns over rights abuses by government troops.//////US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta will lift a ban on women serving in combat, officials said Wednesday -- a ground-breaking move after a decade of war that saw female troops thrust onto the battlefield.//////Around 15,000 crocodiles have escaped from a farm in South Africa amid heavy rains and flooding, local daily Beeld reported yesterday.//////Rupert Grey, great-grandson of former British Prime Minister Earl Grey, has brought his 1936 Rolls Royce to Dhaka, for the Chobi Mela VII. Rupert -- a lawyer with a passion for photography -- is attending the festival. The antique car had travelled through the Rajasthan deserts, gone along the foothills of the Himalayas, came down the Brahmaputra to Bangladesh, but was stopped at the Tamabil border, where it was denied entry.//////Tisha's credible performance and silver screen debut in Mostofa Sarwar Farooki's Third Person Singular Number created much stir. Her latest film Television, also directed by Farooki, which is set to see its countrywide release today, has created a massive hype even before hitting the theatres. Tisha talked about Television and more in a recent interview.//////As part of its 20th anniversary celebrations, advertising and communication agency Expressions Ltd has organised an art exhibition, featuring the works of Shambhu Acharya. The venue is Dhaka Art Centre, Dhanmondi, in the capital.//////It has been confirmed that Adele will perform Her James Bond theme, Skyfall at this year's Oscars in February, which is also nominated for best original song at the ceremony. It will be the first time she's performed live in 12 months, after giving birth to a son last year.//////Life magazine quoted Nazi killer Otto Adolf Eichmann in its December 5, 1960 issue when he was still awaiting trial in Israel. "To sum it all up, I must say that I regret nothing," was the chilling statement from a man who was nabbed by Mossad agents in Argentina. During the Second World War, he had managed the logistics of mass deportation of millions of Jews to ghettos and extermination camps. The difference between Eichmann and Abul Kalam Azad, the first war criminal sentenced in Bangladesh last Monday, is not just the manner of crime but also the condition of trial. While our man is absconding, Eichmann was already in jail.//////In Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, as in Chittagong, the country's second largest city, following meetings with writers, poets and academics I understand that it is necessary to create a network of liberal Muslim artists and intellectuals to protect our countries against the tidal wave of Wahhabism and Salafism. The latter is transforming Islam and leading its people toward close-mindedness and fanaticism. //////The Prophet of Islam, Hazrat Mohammad (Allah's peace be upon him) said: "Poverty is my pride." What is the nature of that poverty and what is the essence of that pride? Materially and spiritually the Prophet personified in himself poverty so as to be addressed by his Lord as servant (Abd) first and then messenger (Rasul).//////THE 7th century "//////"-- otherwise known as the Charter of Madina -- was the first written constitution known in human history. Originally laid down by the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) to govern Medina, present-day scholars marvel at the amazing similarities between this document and documents such as the Constitution of the United States of America drafted eleven centuries later. //////The Republic of Ireland has just one game plan.
