The heart-rending manner of the BUET student's death is a reminder once more of the menace which roads and bad drivers have become. We have repeatedly spoken of what must be done to ensure security of life on our roads. With a rapidly increasing density of population in the urban areas, it is only natural that the number of vehicles on the roads will also go up. Unfortunately, such factors have not been complemented by measures towards improved road safety. Conservative estimates alone place the annual number of deaths from road accidents in the country at more than four thousand. The figure could certainly be a lot higher. One can of course argue that accidents can and do happen everywhere. But what makes matters rather different in Bangladesh is the quality of drivers behind the wheels here, especially on public transport.//////OF the 910 development projects to be taken up in the freshly announced Annual Development Programme (ADP) for the fiscal 2010-11, 816, that is, about 90 per cent have been carried over from the previous year's ADP.

It's a saying among Dutch football fans that poor quality tournaments are always won by the Germans and, while Dutch-German enmity ought to be borne in mind, this tournament most definitely added weight to the notion.West Germany, soon to become plain old Germany after reunification, hit the ground running in the group stages with a 4-1 thrashing of Yugoslavia and a 5-1 thumping of the United Arab Emirates. Lothar Matthus had been released from his marking role of 1986 and was leading the attacking charge. He grabbed three goals in those first two games, setting out his stall for a finals of immense personal achievement.//////This wasn't really an upset. Zimbabwe were the stronger side of the two, which showed in the assured manner of a tall chase, set up by fliers from Brendan Taylor and Hamilton Masakadza and finished off with 10 balls to spare by a cool-on-debut Charles Ervine. The return of high-profile cricket to Zimbabwe put smiles on the faces of a spirited crowd, built mostly of school children, as they meticulously beat India for the first time in eight years.

The High Court, on 25th May last issued a suo moto rule asking the police authorities to submit to it within seven days a report on why they requisition vehicles in the capital.//////The difference between a statesman and a politician is that the first looks at the future while the second remains stuck in the present. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh shows such a streak at times and jettisons the deadening hand of politics. His statement at his maiden press conference to have "good ties with Pakistan" indicates his determination to come to terms with the sub-continental realities. A hostile neighbour is an irritant, which you can ignore only at your peril.//////RECENTLY, there has been renewed interest in nuclear power in Bangladesh. This is understandable in view of the electricity crisis the country faces. An agreement has been signed with Russia for a 1,000 MWe plant. A roundtable on the issue was organised by The Daily Star, which also wrote an editorial on it. Others have commented on it too. //////AN established opinion in the economic and political-economic circles around the world, substantiated by worldwide practice, is that regional economic cooperation and its higher form, economic integration, has become a major contributing factor of development in the individual countries. //////MUCH of the country's fast growing population is without job or business.

Ecosystem services can shape the development paths of a country, region, or locality e.g. whether it chooses to pursue agriculture, timber production, fishing, tourism or any combination of these or other productive sectors. The world economy and national and sub-national economies are largely dependent on biodiversity. Many developing countries rely on the export of natural resources such as agricultural commodities, raw materials and ecotourism services. In developing countries biodiversity, the natural capital, is estimated to be a quarter of total wealth as compared to 13% in middle income countries and 2% in high income OECD countries. //////GENETICALLY Modified (GM) foods are derived from genetically modified organisms. Genetic modification involves the insertion or deletion of genes. GM crops are also known as biotech crops. The first commercially grown genetically modified crop is tomato (1994). Currently, there is a number of genetically modified food species. Some biotech crops alongwith their traits are: soyabean (herbicides tolerance, oil content), cotton (insect resistance), maize (herbicides, insects), canola (herbicides, fertility restored, oil content), rice (herbicides, insects, vitamin A, B1), wheat (herbicides), potato (insects and virus resistance), tomato and melon (delayed ripening), papaya, squash, sweet pepper and plum (virus resistance), linseed, sugar beets and alfalafa (herbicides tolerance), sugarcane (insecticides, high-sucrose), rose, petunia and carnation (modified flower colour), tobacco (herbicides tolerance, nicotine reduction).//////Such goes the strapping spirit and confidence of a poet: a poet of the Bengalis, Bangladesh, and the world as well, a poet who was a patriot, composer and a myriad minded writer. Nazrul once said, Even though I was born in this country (Bengal), in this society, I don't belong to just this locale. I belong to the world. He was by nature and conviction a people's poet. His work, full of vivacity, brought a new note of robustness in Bengali literature. He was crowned the 'rebel poet' in 1972 as the National Poet of Bangladesh.//////The old man was crossing the intersection at a point where a single shabby road jutted into a long asphalt thoroughfare, thereby making the whole configuration appear as a giant T. He had succeeded in crossing from one side of the interloping street to the other whenwell, reader, read on.//////Blood pressure is no longer an adult entity. One may suffer from high blood pressure or hypertension at any age. One may account such illness due to the complications of certain diseases, whereas another group may acquire hypertension just for their changing lifestyle. The consequence of such flunky habit is obesity. Sedentary lifestyle including remote control electronics, escalator, sports car, junk foods  all may be the blessings of modern era but at the same time denounced the young frantic generation with unhealthy state. Obesity and heart disease just go side by side.//////Despite significant progress in decreasing poverty gap, increasing primary school enrollment with attaining gender parity, reducing child and infant morality rates over the past three decades, the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Bangladesh is still one of the highest rates in the world.//////Sinusitis, an inflammation of sinus and nasal passage is increasing among the population by and by due to environmental pollution. Until recently, along with medication, various ablative surgeries were being performed to eradicate sinus pathology. But these surgeries have several complications that distort the nasal physiology and drainage of the sinuses. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is the most advanced method in the treatment of sinusitis that overcomes the obstacles and has good patient compliance.//////Breastfeeding may protect babies from post-vaccine fevers, according to a new study in the journal Pediatrics.//////Patients treated over long periods with metformin, a common drug for diabetes, are at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency which is also likely to get worse over time, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal recently.//////Although many people, especially children do not like Karella's taste, but it is a very nutritious vegetable. It is a good source of vitamin C, containing most of the vitamin B complex and vitamin A in the form of carotene. It is also rich in calcium, potassium, phosphorus and iron.//////THE situation in the Korean Peninsula is tense to use a mild word to describe a situation that an US official has called, with reference to the sinking of the South Korean ship Cheonan by an alleged North Korean torpedo that killed 46 South Korean crewmen, the gravest provocation in decades. It has also set into motion possible developments that could re-define the future of the decades old strategic relationships shaped in the region painstakingly out of realities emerging from the end of the Second World War; the Korean War; the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of China as a world power. //////ON 17th May Iran managed one of its diplomatic coup by bringing to Tehran Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Erdogan and President of Brazil, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, (both countries being the current members of the UN Security Council) who negotiated a deal with Iran of a swap of nuclear fuel with Turkey.//////Did the two year intervention by the military that backed Fakruddin Ahmed's caretaker government teach any political lessons to the political parties in Bangladesh? The answer is unfortunately no. The culture of confrontation and ideological contestation are very much parts of Bangladesh's political culture where the two political parties refuse to cooperate. The Awami League (AL) won a landslide victory in December 2008, which generated the hope of democratization and a change in the confrontational politics that has plagued the nation. People sincerely believed that the two years of military intervention has certainly taught the parties a lesson. Expressing such sentiment the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) General Secretary said We should replace the existing political culture with a fair one. I won't see your face just because you hold different political ideals or there's a difference of opinionthis attitude can never be helpful for democracy."//////A proof of widespread charlatanism in Bangladesh is how we go by shallow and superficial ideas about important issues. One may easily place the example of our handling of the concept of a civil society. Civil society is what we nowadays mention off and on. Very recently one typically important person here came to call it 'evil' even. It is difficult to pinpoint when this phrase came to acquire wide currency in our country, but once it settled in, nobody looked back before using it to mean this, that and what not. //////FATIMA Bhutto has taken great pains in writing this book. She conducted a series of interviews both in and outside Pakistan of the persons who were either related to the Bhutto family in different ways or in the knowledge of affairs as media people. The writing indicates that the author is in quest of searching the glory and merit of her late lamented father Murtaza Bhutto, the first son of ZA Bhutto, former prime minister of Pakistan who was hanged by his protege General Ziaul Haque through the so-called trial held by the army influenced civil court. Throughout the book I have found the agony of Electra for securing justice for her father. The book opens with the chapter where she has narrated the painful incident of the shooting of her father. When she first hears the sound of shots of firearms, she frantically tries to contact her aunt Benazir Bhutto then prime minister of Pakistan. But, according to her, Benazir's oleaginous husband Asif Ali Zardari (presently president of Pakistan) refuses to give in. Finally it is he who confirms that Mortuza has been shot. Can it be thought that the brother of the prime minister can be so openly shot and killed without the blessing of the state? But, of course, this is the legacy of Pakistan.//////Poetry elevates the soul. It sharpens the senses. Best of all, it explores the entirety of being. That happens to be at the core of this work. Do not be surprised by the bilingual nature of it. There are the poems in the original, by Zahida Meherunnissa. And then there are the English versions of them, crafted into meticulous form by Feiroj Adams. You might argue that there is a straying of the rules here in that the poems come in a package, that is, in a single volume. Obviously, though, Adams was too moved by Meherunnissa's poetry to consider coming forth with them separately. And thus you have the pleasure of a work, coming to you per courtesy of Meherunnissa, enhanced through the constructive engagement, as it were, of Feiroj Adams.//////THE book under review, although a small publication, yet contains some important observations on our national poet, Kazi Nazrul Islam, who is popularly known as the Rebel Poet. We know that Nazrul Islam was a genius with versatile talents. Till now much research on the literary aspects of the poet's outstanding works has been conducted and a lot of unknown findings have also been released. But as far as this reviewer's knowledge goes, no research has so far been undertaken to explore the scientific aspects of Nazrul's wonderful poetic creations. The author of the work ////// undertook research work to explore the scientific messages hidden in the poetic verses of the great poet. As revealed by the author, it was Poet Nazrul who hinted at the arrival of the mobile phone (or mutho phone) in his famous poem //////: //////BISHSHAW JOGOT DEKHBO AAMI////// AAPON HATER MUTHOYE PURE.//////
