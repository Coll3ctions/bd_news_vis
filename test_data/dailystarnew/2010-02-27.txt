lethal nonetheless in its consequences. That is where the tragedy becomes all the more poignant. As though that was not enough, topped off as it was by a supreme irony that it was so very avoidable. As panicked workers in their desperate bid to escape flames rushed to the upper floors thickly circulating smoke choked up 21 of them to death. Such a large number dying from smoke inhalation, and not from burn injuries brings into sharp focus the dismal state of preparedness against fire-related accidents in a factory stacked with inflammable materials. //////THE ship breaking sector is running in a free-for-all style with no legal framework in place to make the parties concerned accountable to any authority. Allegations are often heard of anomaly and corruption right from procurement of vessels from foreign buyers to getting hazardous ships cleared for entry into our territorial waters. One wonders how toxic vessels could get past the port into the yards when there is a ban on import of such vessels posing risks to environment and human and animal health. Questions keep surfacing as to why no pro-environment measures are in place at the ship breaking yards and why the condition of obtaining pre-shipment inspection certificate from a qualified foreign inspection company has been waived. Although environment officials are said to be examining ships, would it not have been more effective a safeguard against hazardous vessels if pre-shipment obligations were complied with by the exporters?//////PROFESSED and published declarations to improve the lot of the poor people, particularly in developing societies, are an integral part of the political-economic programme. Some international organizations have pronounced pro-poor agenda that aim at socio-economic empowerment of the downtrodden, particularly the women and children of distressed localities. A significant factor in such scheme of things is the behaviour and performance of police, now considered an important institutional link in development process.//////THERE have been different interpretations about the recently concluded London Conference on Afghanistan. Some have described it as having been hastily conceived with the principal intention of being a political face-saver for two unpopular leaders, Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai. Others have claimed that it united an important section of the international community pertaining to their further commitment to Afghanistan's future. A litmus test in this regard has been the strategic approach to the initiation of the latest ISAF armed 'Mashtraq' engagement in the Helmand province in the south of Afghanistan.//////Can Shakib Al Hasan's men prove, while launching their campaign against England tomorrow, that they are the better team than the one that played at home more than six years back? //////Only in their wildest dreams would the children from the Sher-e-Bangla Government Primary School have thought of the events that transpired yesterday afternoon. //////Serious questions have been raised regarding selection procedures after the board allegedly interfered and later overruled the team list of the selection committee while choosing the Bangladesh side for the ODI series at home against England. //////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has finally managed to find a sponsor for the Bangladesh-England series as Beximco came forward to save the country's most affluent sports federation from an embarrassment.//////India have made the challenge of accomplishing their first clean sweep against South Africa much harder by resting regular openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.

Ahmad Mujtaba Muhammad Mustafa (peace be upon him) was born as a Guide for all of creation. "The advent of this great teacher, whose life from the moment of his Ministry is a verifiable record," says Syed Ameer Ali in //////"was not a mere accident, an unconnected episode in the history of the world.

Interest in this issue was heightened even further by the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change held in December 2009. //////In 1996, Cairn Energy, a British oil company, discovered Sangu gas field in the Bay of Bengal, and started production in 1998. With offshore gas reaching the land for the first time, people began to hope that it would take the country out of the energy crisis and bring economic prosperity, like in so many other countries that have successfully tapped their respective offshore oil and gas riches. After all, the Bay of Bengal is a large sea and its true oil and gas potential is not known.//////Bangladesh's unique geo-climatic conditions make it traditionally vulnerable to natural disasters. Since 1970, at least 10 major natural disasters and countless local emergencies have struck the country.//////Mohit Ul Alam has accomplished a splendid job for those who want to read Shakespeare's great tragedies in Bangla. He completed with virtuosity his arduous but praiseworthy task by presenting us with the Bangla rendition of Shakespeare's great plays in one edition: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth. Alam's translation is innovative as well as new. This is because he is candid and honest about his abilities. Rabindranath Tagore was intelligent enough when he abandoned his attempt to translate Macbeth in the middle. Shakespeare is so great that he is sometimes untranslatable because of his divine language, astonishingly varied imagery in poetry and infinite variety of vocabulary. Alam rightly presumes it to be so.//////DR. Ahmed Sharif, the doyen of Bangladesh's Marxist intellectualism, was born on February 13, 1921 and died on February 24, 1999 on his way to hospital.

Many people suffering from various conditions like haemophilia (genetic disease that impair the body's ability to control blood clotting), dengue, severe anaemia, blood cancer, thalaessemia need blood transfusion.//////Although mental health is crucial to the overall well-being of individuals, societies and the country, it is largely neglected and often overlooked in Bangladesh. World Health Organisation (WHO) has given utmost importance to promote mental health services and has been campaigning for the full incorporation of mental health in public health. But it is matter of great regret that many people including some of health professionals are very reluctant to give mental health a priority.//////Often, we face embarrassing situations when we cannot recall names of people very known to us or forget the date of birthday of our beloved one. Then we started to blame our poor memory. Although everyones capacity to memories things is not the same but we can boost our existing memory by staying mentally active including physical activity in your daily routine. Here are some ways you can try to improve your memory://////When pregnant women take antidepressants, it sometimes causes their babies to hit developmental milestones late, Danish researchers reported recently.//////Dhaka Urban Comprehensive Eye Care Project (DUCECP) has incorporated new features in its ongoing five year project to bring more people under its comprehensive eye care services.

A new device that looks a lot like those home ovulation and home pregnancy tests but checks sperm count will soon be available in Europe, and is undergoing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for marketing in the US.//////IT is one year of one of the blackest events of our history. Time is really the best healer. But on the other side, many contentious spots remain vivid. Rumors and suspicions continue to dominate public discourse and spreading hatred and pointing finger against each other sees no end. Many blogs, face book groups, and websites have joined to fuel fire to the propaganda war that the killing was politically linked.//////WITH US forces entering the second week of a 12 to 18-month campaign in Afghanistan, the general in charge of US forces in the region acknowledged yesterday that the way ahead will be tough.//////Iran's navy launched its first domestically made destroyer in the Persian Gulf on February 19 in a ceremony attended by the supreme leader and the commander-in-chief Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the media reported.//////Lt. Gen. Hamad Mohammed Thani Al Rumaithi, chief of staff of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) armed forces, arrived in Seoul on February 22 for a four-day visit, the Ministry of National Defence said.//////IN the backdrop of an increasingly assertive China and an uncertain Pakistan, India has embarked on a major strategic offensive which includes taking American allies on board, cooperating with countries that are apprehensive of China and, last but not least, using its more than average economic growth to entice export led economies of Asia. If one analyses state visits to India in the last six months, it becomes clear that though climate change and WTO negotiations have been the issues discussed with trans-Atlantic countries, however, economic resilience has proved that India rather than being a 'swing state' is very much on the path of becoming the 'second state' in Asia. The strategic community in India has witnessed visits by the Japanese Prime Minister, German President, Canadian Prime Minister, Australian Prime Minister, South Korean President, Vietnamese Defence Minister and Malaysian Prime Minister in a period of three months. This shows India's elevation as a relevant regional power. India has initiated a comparatively quick defence procurement process and defence budget allocation has also risen dramatically in the last five years, despite the fact that each year thousands of crores are left unutilized.//////DURING the Cold War, the security discourse centred on East-West rivalry, a global struggle for dominance between the USA and the Soviet Union. In 1946, George Kennan, then US ambassador in Moscow, argued that the Soviet power was inherently expansionist and would have to be contained. That was the beginning of the Policy of Containment that marked the US security policy throughout the Cod War. Security between the two sides was ensured by what was diabolically called Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). It was assumed that because none of the adversaries would be 'mad' enough to seek self-destruction, they would not attack each other. While the peace activists were calling for banning the nuclear bomb, the security experts were arguing that the bombs were actually ensuring a Warm Peace by preventing direct confrontation between the two Super Powers. Thankfully, the Cold War ended, when Soviet Union broke up in 1991, not due to any war or invasion, but because of the communist economic structure collapsed in the face of democracy and free market. During the 1980s, thanks to the initiative by the UN, there was gradual realization that the concept of national security need not be confined to the narrow ambit of East-West rivalry, but should to be broadened to include other issues that pose serious danger to individuals, societies, states and the humanity. //////Sanjeeb Drong writes with quiet passion and with a lot of nostalgia. The loss of heritage, the disappearance of land that was home is a theme that recurs in this work of intense devotion. But, then, Drong is not alone in the way he feels. Anyone who has watched the gradual assaults that have been made on the way, or ways, of life that Bangladesh's indigenous people or adivasis have suffered through since the British colonial period will empathise with him. Consider the recent forest fires in the hills, the casualties in terms of lives and homes put to the torch. But Drong's is not a partisan view of conditions. That he belongs to one of the tribes which have found Bangladesh to be home for long generations is a truth that does not mar the quality of the essays he presents in this work. There is, of course, anger in him as he narrates the tale of the tribal girl from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a young woman forced by poverty to take the road to the city. It is in the putatively secure confines of domestic employment in that urban centre that her virginity is taken from her.//////A common allegation against physicians in Bangladesh is that they do not discharge their professional responsibilities with a mind of service to humanity, which their profession is meant for. Maybe it is not applicable to all physicians but it is true of a large number of them. There are multifarious reasons for this. As a nation we lack a humanitarian service-rendering tradition; many physicians coming out of poverty-ridden families set money-making as their only goal in life; at the institutional level it is not ensured that physicians will come to patients' service whenever and however necessary; ethics of medical practice are not inculcated properly in a physician's mind; and a wave of capitalism has driven medical practitioners into a rat race for material gains. It is undoubtedly a sorry state of affairs. //////Swedish linguist Sven Ohman (1936-2008) knew differently, and it would be even harder to imagine why he believed that Noam Chomsky (b. 1928--) has never been a linguist. It is something hard to believe for anyone who is familiar with the name of Chomsky and the reputation it carries. Formerly an Uppsala University professor of linguistics, Sven Ohman in his book, ////// has successfully established his observations and findings denying Chomsky's position as a linguist.//////The field of study called Memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concept of cultural ideas, symbols or practices being transmitted from one mind to another through speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena. The etymology of the term relates to the Greek word mimema which means something imitated. This controversial new field, therefore, makes an elaborate study of the universal human tendency to imitate. //////
