When I looked at the report, and thereby knew that some local musclemen led by one Nur Hossain Master demolished a community in which indigenous people live in, the whole thing stopped me for a while, as I was thinking about the national identity. At the same time, it was haunting me, I wanted to know the multiple answers: why did thousands of people lose their accommodation rights? Why were they oppressed severely by the land grabbers? Why did the attackers damage and torch their homes? Where is the provision to stop the heinous crime? //////The prices of commodities increase higher and higher day by day. If the price of a particular commodity increases by a certain percentage, then it never gets back to its previous position, regardless of what is happening in the market. The price of a particular product will be estimated at the equilibrium level where the supply and demand intersects. But the prices in our country fly much higher than the equilibrium level. Greater demand and lower supply is one of the major reasons of price increase. There are also some natural and man-made causes which play their due role in price increase. Natural causes like floods and droughts are unpredictable and we need to be prepared for that. Apart from natural causes, man made causes increase the prices and a particular group of people take advantage of increasing price level. It is quite common that the prices of essentials increase in the holy month of Ramadan. Certain commodities are used mostly in Ramadan for preparing Iftar, but what's the reason behind increasing the prices of other commodities? The government has asked TCB to import several essentials which are consumed mostly in Ramadan to ensure smooth supply. //////Finance Minister AMA Muhith has stressed the role of ICT in creating a corruption free country while speaking at a seminar in Sylhet on Digital Bangladesh. He raised different issues and sectors that can benefit through creation of a digital country. Though it is a bit late, the initiative taken by the minister is appreciable. It will be wise for all members of parliament (MPs) to follow him and arrange similar seminars and workshops in their respective constituencies or regions. The seminars and workshops should be held in local institutions like schools (general, vocational and madrasah), colleges, institutes and universities. Not only the students and teachers will attend but the local people must be invited and encouraged to attend the events. The most important thing is to raise awareness among common people about the benefits of ICT which is the main tool for a digital country. Once they make up their minds to take such initiatives, experts from the respective regions will come out to cooperate and to lead the programme further. They can be termed as the hidden human resources for the region. Their expertise can be utilized for the welfare of the localities.//////The results have been digitalised.

It is said that my critic is my best friend. It is very natural that people make mistakes knowingly or unknowingly while performing their duties and critics help them to be on the track by pointing out the wrongs. Unfortunately, we as a nation have very little power of tolerance and that's why we react very sharply to the slightest criticism we get from our opponents. The political parties show very little endurance which is of great importance in maintaining peace and harmony in society.//////This is nothing but public perception of political events unfolding in Bangladesh. The BNP has made a political mistake by not attending parliament on a flimsy ground of 'front row seats' They have now committed the most irreparable political blunder by refusing to participate in the parliamentary team that went to Tipaimukh on a fact finding mission. The non-cooperation by the opposition parties is only strengthening the hands of the Indian government to deal with the issue of Tipaimukh in their own way. //////It is difficult to believe that the Public Service Commission building has no space for accommodating three new members thereby making the commission totally inactive to discharge its obligations.

They are crystalline compounds formed from water cages stabilized by guest molecules such as methane, ethane etc. usually at low temperature and high pressure. One unit volume of gas hydrate provides as much as 160 volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure. Gas hydrates therefore have been considered as one of the potential energy resources. Since the 3rd decade of the last century gas hydrates have been paid special attention due to their potential to block the oil and gas flow lines. Beside the energy concern, gas hydrates show various beneficial applications such as water desalination, gas storage and transportation of methane. The see floor and permafrost regions set optimum temperature-pressure conditions for the natural occurrences of gas hydrates. Recent reviews on the concerned subject show that more than 90 sites on the globe have been directly (experimental evidence) or indirectly (Geophysical data analysis) identified to contain natural gas hydrates. Current estimates show hydrates could contain from 10(to power 15) to 10(to power 17) m3 of methane at standard temperature and pressure.//////Recently, Samina Chowdhury lunched her Rabindra Sangeet album Tomar Khola Hawa. Samina has already won thousands of hearts through the magic of her voice. As a blind fan of Samina, I hope that this album would give a new dimension to her popularity.

I had to go to the bus stand on foot through water, folding trousers up to the knees. I found people waiting for the bus standing in the water. Some vehicles were plying and watering the standing people. I was also drenched. Two buses (shuprovat) were stuck in the water. Luckily, I found a bus (shuprovat) and got into it. My dress was wet. Others were also suffering like me. //////Due to heavy downpour almost the whole of the city of Dhaka was inundated on July 28, 2009. Life came to a standstill. Millions of city dwellers were in deep trouble. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, like all her former CEOs of Bangladesh, lost her patience and summoned all the ministers and bosses of the concerned departments and organisations to her office to give them a bit of her mind. It all came in the media next day. We, the ordinary citizens of Dhaka, felt satisfied that the matter has been noted by the prime minister. Like every time in the past, this time too, our hopes will run high. But shall we be disappointed again like it happened umpteen times in the past ? Shall the govt take stern actions this time against those land grabbers, corrupt bureaucrats and insincere politicians who make a natural disaster more disastrous by human machinations? Or, shall we have to wait for the next year when the prime minister will again show her anger and displeasure to her ministers and officers on the same issue?//////Fatah kicked off its first congress in 20 years yesterday with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas urging his party to seek "a new start" and admitting a litany of past errors.//////North Korea welcomed former president Bill Clinton to Pyongyang with flowers and hearty handshakes yesterday as he arrived in the Communist nation on a surprise mission to bring home two jailed American journalists.//////An extremist Shia group believed responsible for the killing of five American soldiers in a bold raid south of Baghdad and the kidnapping of five British men has agreed to renounce violence, a government adviser said Monday.//////The United States warned on Monday it may seek tough new sanctions on Iran if the Islamic republic misses a September deadline for agreeing to hold talks on its suspect nuclear programme.//////The United States and the European Union hit out Monday at Israel for evicting Palestinian families from east Jerusalem, warning that such moves endangered the Middle East peace process.//////Osama bin Laden's right-hand man Ayman al-Zawahiri took aim at US President Barack Obama in a new video, accusing him of continuing to spill the blood of Muslims and saying Israel was a "crime" that must be wiped out, according to a US monitoring group.//////Frightened civilians fear the Taliban will pounce again on Pakistan's Swat as residents try to rebuild shattered lives and shot nerves in the mountain valley once likened to Switzerland.//////Pakistan's Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani has showered praise on his Indian counterpart Dr. Manmohan Singh, saying that he had no doubt about his sincerity towards the peace process.//////A day after issuing a three-day "ultimatum" to the government to restore "civilian supremacy" in Nepal, the Maoists yesterday announced their months-long agitation plan that will start with a blockade of parliament on August 7. //////Opposition parties walked out of the Lok Sabha yesterday on the issue of the Pakistani Supreme Court indefinitely adjourning the case against the release from house arrest of Jamaat-ud Daawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, who India says masterminded the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.//////The British government was hiding behind a "wall of secrecy" over allegations security agents colluded in the torture of terrorism suspects, an influential committee of lawmakers said yesterday.//////The New York-based group Human Rights Watch yesterday pressed for an international probe into the killings in Sri Lanka of 17 local employees of a French charity three years ago.//////Authorities killed rats and fleas yesterday as they disinfected a town sealed off after three people died of pneumonic plague in a remote farming town in northwestern China, according to the provincial health department.//////Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik has said that officers of the rank of Major, who wanted to target army generals and elements in the intelligence agencies sympathetic towards terrorists, have been arrested.//////Nato's new civilian and military leaders briefed top members yesterday on command changes in Afghanistan and other matters affecting the escalating war, a spokesman said.//////A pilot was killed and seven passengers injured yesterday when a commercial jet skidded off the runway as it landed on Thailand's resort island of Ko Samui and hit an old control tower, the airline said.//////Four people including a couple and their eight-year-old daughter were killed in a blast in Vietnam while they were trying to remove explosive material from a war-era bomb, police said yesterday.//////A media committee in Venezuela's parliament is set to begin Tuesday studying a draft law that, if approved, could jail anyone publishing comments that authorities consider a threat to national interests.//////As a playwright, Abdullah Al-Mamun looked at society as a whole entity, where the poor, middle and upper class occasionally confront one another but, nevertheless, coexist.
