//////CULTURAL diversity is one of the major ideas that underpin societies in our times. There is a growing acknowledgement worldwide of the traditional rights of indigenous communities, a point that has engaged the attention of such global bodies as the United Nations. The latest instance of how ethnic diversity constitutes a crucial component of national culture as well as global realities comes through the formal apology offered by the new Australian government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to Australia's ethnic minority. Without question, the step takes Australia to a new path in politics because it formally endorses the idea of an inclusive society that will be the priority from here on.//////IT is disconcerting to note the increase in criminal activities in Savar industrial area, so close to the capital. This is perhaps a reflection of the general trend of law and order, despite the state of emergency.//////THE world is watching with great interest, and a degree of amazement, the presidential primaries now being fought by the contenders for party nomination of the Republicans and Democrats. The procedure being followed is complex, and the money (in millions of dollars) and energy spent would certainly satisfy many political scientists, for example German Jorgen Habermas, who says "the state's raison d'tre does not lie primarily in the protection of equal individual rights but in the guarantee of an inclusive process of opinion-and-will formation in which free and equal citizens reach an understanding on which goals and norms lie in equal interest of all." //////THE February 18 election is supposedly meant to provide a transition from an autocratic government to a more welcome democratic one. What a turnaround from October 12, 1999, when an autocratic regime was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the people of Pakistan on the overthrow of a democratic one. Less than a week before February 18, one should analyse why the expectations of the people in the great promise of October 12 were dashed, and what the future holds for Pakistan.//////THE recent sub-prime mortgage market meltdown in the United States forced big investment banks like Merrill Lynch, Citibank, Morgan Stanley, etc. to announce massive write-downs, creating a huge crisis of confidence in the entire financial system. //////South Africa captain Graeme Smith vowed to continue their re-cent success when they play in a two Test and three-match one-day series against the Tigers during their month-long tour in Bangladesh. //////Newly promoted sides BKSP and Surjo Tarun upset the Premier League applecart yesterday with victories over Mohammedan Sporting Club and Old DOHS in the opening day of the Twenty20 competition at the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium.//////Coach Jamie Siddons should be a relieved man to see his batsmen score runs during the practice match yesterday and the most encouraging fact was that left-handed opener Tamim Iqbal returned to action after a long break.//////Ranjan Ram stormed into the last 16 of boys' singles in the Dhaka Bank 22nd Bangladesh International Junior Tennis Championships yesterday.//////Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene vowed here Thursday to target Australian frailties as the tourists bid for top spot in the tri-series table.//////A first-ball duck; a win for his new club in the afternoon, but former national captain Khaled Mashud Pilot reserved his best for his followers at night -- a Valentine's Day special drama in which he played the role of Chor (thief).//////Record-breaking former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming announced Thursday he will retire from international cricket after the third and final Test against England next month.//////Revisiting his injury-blighted past, Brazilian veteran Ronaldo prepared to fly to Paris for surgery on Thursday after rupturing a tendon in his right knee during AC Milan's 1-1 draw with Livorno, media reports said. //////Werder Bremen goalkeeper Tim Wiese saved two first-half penalties as the Bundesliga side began their UEFA Cup campaign with a 3-0 win over Braga on Wednesday.//////AC Milan needed a controversial penalty to earn a disappointing 1-1 home draw against minnows Livorno at the San Siro on Wednesday night in a game that also saw them lose Brazil striker Ronaldo. //////France's surprise Australian Open finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga suffered a disappointing return to France on Wednesday as he was beaten 7-5, 7-6 (7/3) in straight sets by Croatian Mario Ancic in the first round of the Marseille Open. //////AFC president Mohamed bin Hammam has lashed out at the powerbrokers of the English Premier League for putting "money before responsibility" in their plan to play matches overseas. //////Brazilian football legend Pele separated from his wife of 13 years on Wednesday, it was announced by his press officer. //////Luis Aragones will stay as Spain coach until the end of Euro 2008 in June, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) announced on Wednesday. //////Bangladesh Cricket Board yesterday named the match officials for the three Twenty20 matches between Bangladesh and West Bengal this month in the 2nd Indo-Bangladesh Bangla Games.//////New Zealand will be pushing to wrap up their one-day cricket series against England early and complete a remarkable transformation when the third match is played here on Friday.//////India is often accused of abusing its power to suit its ends, but Australia has been equally culpable in manipulating the international programme this week.//////In a country used to being dismissed, perhaps unfairly, as a minor player in world cricket, Stephen Fleming has been a giant.

The fair covers a big area. Moving from stall to stall is actually difficult for the aged. Young people also get tired if they want to visit every stall of the fair. The overall arrangement for the fair was satisfactory but the objectionable and disturbing thing was the sound pollution created through the mikes and big speakers for advertisement of commodities inside the fair. Even I was facing difficulty to talk to the sellers as I had to shout to bargain with them. //////Police reform is indeed a very good idea of the present caretaker government. Police have lost their image. The police law was enacted during the British period in 1861. It is not befitting for the present time. So, the police law must be modernised for developing a fully-fledged service oriented institution. //////What prompted me to write this letter is the report I found in Internet about the Muslim background of Obama, the Democratic Presidential candidate. //////The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) is the home to many ethnic communities having rich cultural heritage. Sadly, People of the CHT have never been given due opportunities to develop and have consistently been victims of discrimination in many sectors. To make their lives even worse this year, rodent attack has deprived them of the expected harvest.//////I was very happy to see the 28th BCS circular but when I saw the age limit I was shocked. This circular has been declared after two and a half years. The circular of 27th BCS was published in 2005.Owing to reforms in the PSC and the exam procedure, the circular has come late. And for this reason, almost 50 thousand candidates won't be able to appear in this exam this year. //////Whatever I may have achieved as a physician in terms of education, finances, service to humanity, I have always felt that, sum total of all that is credited in my account, will never be equivalent to that of a university teacher. I have pursued studies to earn degrees, I have been reading occasionally to overcome certain professional problems, I have been attending (at times speaking in),seminars, workshops and conferences, to meet requirements for continued professional registration, but, a University teacher produces people like me, earning and disbursing knowledge is their day to day work, so are the seminars and conferences. I have seen wherever I have gone and worked, the Middle East, Africa, Europe and North America they, the University teachers, are at the top most strata of admiration.//////I look forward to the days when metro train will be running in Dhaka city and we will be freed, even if partially, from the agonising and punishing traffic jam. //////This is in reference to a news item appearing in your daily recently regarding the proposed ban on graffiti and posters. I would like to extend my heartiest congrats to the caretaker govt. for the bold decision. I had been very vocal on this issue and feel elated that my concerns received due attention. The LGRD has drafted an ordinance proposing a ban on graffiti and pasting of posters on the walls of houses and establishments across the country. In order to keep the cities and roads clean and beautiful, the decision is very timely and has no alternatives. It would be appreciated if the proposed ordinance is extended to cover all the banners, arches and billboards. It would be interesting to observe the implementation of the law through stringent punishment to the violators. //////It is good that every year some people get Ekushey Padak for their outstanding achievements and service to the country or humanity, but it pains me when I see that some Padaks are awarded posthumously. Why the govt waits for their death, or is it given as a solace to the bereaved family? Why the award was not given during their lifetime is still a puzzle to me. //////Nowadays there are many health related programmes on satellite television channels, which are very encouraging. Many physicians come on TV and answers questions of the viewers. However, it is sad to get the wrong information from them. I was watching one such programme and one of the doctors was saying that there was no relationship between heart attack and smoking. This is not true.//////People are posted in government service through BCS (Bangladesh Civil Service) exams. It is an old recruiting system of this subcontinent.//////Aamir Khan is the most talented and respected actor of his generation. May be his popularity is less than other two Khans, Shahrukh Khan and Salman Khan but Aamir Khan is a superstar in his own right. And he has proved it yet again. His directorial debut Taare Zameen Par was the only movie last year, which brought tears in my eyes. Audience became a part of the film while watching it. Many of them felt, it was their story or the story of their children. It educated us. After watching the movie, we do feel there needs to be a change in the education system of our country as well.//////An editorial on the subject (Jan:26) in a local English daily was very timely, pertinent and necessary. While one appreciates the CTG's actions against corruption, under the same criteria action against alleged torture of victims on detention and remand also needs to be speedily taken. This is a far worse crime than any form of corruption, be it for monitory gain, influence peddling or misuse of power and authority for personal gain; none of which physically harms anyone!//////I had the privilege of being introduced with Justice Sobhan. The last time I came in contact with him was in the Human Rights Summer School organised by ELCOP on 10 December 2007 in Proshika Centre, Manikgonj. Justice Sobhan went there to preside over the moot court session. When I met him he inquired of my well being addressing me by name. I was astounded a little bit. Because I thought that he might have identified my face but recalling the name would be a remote possibility. I informed him that I was thinking to opt for judicial service. He discouraged me and said, You are quite perfect for an academic discipline. I told, You are always campaigning for improving the judicial system, then do you not think that I would be of use for that purpose? Good academicians are also not out of the ambit of anti-generic lawyering- he retorted. Such was Justice K. M. Sobhan. I did not contemplate then that we, as a last bite of 2007 (31 December 2007), would lose the star of progressive movement, a relentless campaigner of human rights and a loud voice for trial of the war criminals and their aides of 1971. //////We can prevent cancer epidemic in many ways but at least three things we can do://////This is indeed a most interesting subject and I congratulate you on publishing the review of the book, "The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture" by Edwin Bryant (19 Jan 08).

It is time to review the 5-day working week imposed by some previous political regime; for more output, every minute of each hour; as our systems losses are very high, due to politics of patronisation. It lowered social discipline, and established black spots for lawlessness, and other undesirable activities in public life.

This would include freedom of expression, right to information, tolerance for each other's philosophies, and rule of law. All these factors have to come together to bring success to democracy. //////THE caretaker government (CTG) of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed completed one year in office on January 11 this year. The CTG took charge with lots of promises, which kept on fading as the days passed by. Unfortunately, within this short time, the people are getting somewhat disenchanted, at least as far as their economic well-being is concerned. //////MORE and more, we see the rise of two opposing political camps in Bangladesh. One is the old that wants to revive politics through immediate parliamentary polls. The other is the new that emerged after January 2007, and wishes never to return to old political dominance by dynasties, lawlessness, and the inability or reluctance of elected governments to bring reforms.//////A coral reef is made up of thin layers of calcium carbonate (limestone) secreted over thousands of years by billions of tiny soft bodied animals called coral polyps. Coral reefs are the world's most miscellaneous marine ecosystems and are home to twenty-five percent of identified marine species, including 4,000 species of fish, 700 species of coral and thousands of other plants and animals. Coral reefs occupy less than one quarter of one percent of the Earth's marine environment, yet they are home to more than a quarter of all known fish species. //////The UN climate advisory body Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global environmental change will entail increasing climate variability and increased occurrence of extreme weather events. Since 1750s onwards overall accelerated human-societal development led to activities like burning of fossil fuel, land use change and extensive agricultural practices which have ensued irreversible loss to the bio-capacity of present earth. Best estimation shows about sixty percent of the ecosystems are being degraded or exploited unsustainably across the globe; and these sorts of pressures increase the risk of trade-offs in ecosystem functions. //////Biodiversity is disappearing from the natural ecosystems of forests, savannahs, pastures and rangelands, deserts, tundras, rivers, lakes and seas .This is largely the result of human activity and represents a serious threat to human development.
