And that is a truth which once more has been highlighted, this time through the grim statistics provided by Unicef.

Add to these worries those which have patently been brought out into the open by last Friday's issue of the Star magazine, which informs us in no uncertain terms that the problems which children and mothers face in Bangladesh are related not just to hunger. There are too such crucial issues as under-nourishment and malnutrition.
