The reason is that safety is considered as the number one priority in every construction work all over the world, be it a bridge, flyover, building or any other structure. There is no doubt that in other parts of the world it is not always that the most experienced contractor or the contractor with the most reputed track record is awarded the project, but the authority ensures that the contractor who is awarded the project has some experience in constructing the structure. This is done because a contractor who may not have prior experience in doing such type of project may not be aware of the proper techniques, which may lead to breach of the safety of the general public. This is why authorities in other parts of the world strictly ensure that no one plays with the safety of the public or tries to tamper with it because they highly value the lives of the general public.//////Is Bangladesh a blatantly violent society; is it violence or the transparency of violence featured on live television for everyone to watch that causes a sense of disgust?

More on the book and my struggles as I plod through it later, but let me confide to my readers that I will need a few more weeks, if not months, to finish this complicated history of 16th century England and Europe! That's partly because my knowledge of the British emperors until now has been very limited, and acquired mostly from watching movies based on Shakespeare's plays or hearsay.//////November 27 marked the 59th death anniversary of America's pre-eminent playwright Eugene O'Neill.

He was awarded four Pulitzers and a Nobel Prize in literature in 1936the only playwright who has achieved such a feat so far in America. As a dramatist he was highly experimental in technique, and his themes generally involved lust for power, body, land and oil; reinventing pagan depths in American complexities, racial and class problems; and his family. //////Hajj is//////A realization//////That I have to go//////Soon, maybe later//////Towards the approaching//////Day of Judgment//////That while I live//////I expect, I hope//////For the certainty//////Amidst uncertainty. //////No one is happy in all occasion, but some people feel as if they can never be contented.

These are rather heavy requirements for such a small nation.//////Vladimir Putin runs for a third term as president against a backdrop of mounting public opposition.

Close to a fortnight ago, Nazrul's ////// was launched in its English translation in Dhaka, to much acclaim. It surely goes to the credit of The Reading Circle that it undertook this rather gigantic task of going for the translation. Something, as they say, is always lost in translation. But then there are translations that hold your attention, that are indeed riveting. This translation of ////// promises to be one work that could make a difference. I am yet to read it and when I do, I know that old bug, the urge to review, will take hold of my imagination and I could actually end up doing a critique of the work.//////When I first came across the book //////, I was indeed taken by surprise. It is a well written and well referenced book but more importantly, it is an attempt at a comprehensive critical approach to Elias's short stories. One would still wonder why a critical approach should surprise one in this way. That Elias's stories call for extensive critical attention from a variety of angles is an agreed-upon truth. The same can be said about a good many of his contemporaries from Hasan Azizul Haque to Mahmudul Haque. Evidently, the reason behind giving this critical attempt a special place lies elsewhere.//////
