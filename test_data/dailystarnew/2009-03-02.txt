We commend the armed forces for the way it has held its grief in check and gone about performing its duties in the most professional manner. //////US President Barack Obama has begun to live up to the expectations of the peace loving people around the world. He has declared that the US will end all combat operations in Iraq through withdrawing two-thirds of the US forces deployed in the war-ravaged country by August 2010. The declaration amounts to offloading the legal and moral burden associated with the Iraq war, which he inherited while stepping into the White House.//////AN immutable law governing power is that it cannot be shared, because the one holding the sceptre brooks no competitor. Perhaps because of the spirit of that law, Sheikh Hasina has surrounded herself with diehard loyalists in her ministerial team. That is fine. Anyone in her place would do the same in this country. Although it ensured her grip on the levers of the power many feel that a good deal of experience and efficiency has been compromised, leaving the vital flanks of governance vulnerable. //////THE Congress has begun its campaign -- for the general elections of 2012-13. All over Kolkata, the party has put up hoardings of a smiling, heavily-dimpled Rahul Gandhi. The visual message is "cute." The written message is unambiguous: this is the face of the future. He may be forced to share the limelight with his elders in 2009, but this is the last compromise.

The result is unprecedented in our political history. Having the earlier experience of the BNP regime vivid in our minds, we are worried that this absolute power could lead the AL to an unfair exercise of power and consequently dysfunctional democracy. //////Though children's labour may be necessary to the survival of some families, it does not represent the ideal for children or their families. Putting children to work too early can stunt their development socially and educationally as well as expose them to physical risks.

Education is imperative for all development activities but there is no university in Barisal city. If we look at all other divisional cities, we will find a different picture. Even many district towns have public universities. Doesn't it bear testimony to the unequal treatment meted out to Barisal? Although the present government has already treated Barisal badly not including anyone in the cabinet from the region, we hope it will set up a university in the city in order to make Barisal a part of Digital Bangladesh.//////The AL said before the election that it would appoint the deputy speaker from the opposition.

This is an everyday hazard which puts a lot of pressure on their nerves. Hence a foot overbridge connecting Mohakhali kutcha bazar is a long felt necessity.//////A daughter of mine recently got her Ph.D from Harvard and came home for a few weeks to meet family and friends before returning to Harvard to do research as a prestigious Swartz Fellow in the newly established Department of Neuroscience.

Death by violent means has been a pattern of life, of the end of life that we have known for ages.

In 1975, in the space of a mere three months, we lost to assassination the entire leadership that had led us through the long, tortuous struggle for liberation.

And then came the night when the four leaders of the Mujibnagar provisional government were gunned down in the putative security of prison. //////IT'S only natural that emotions will be high among the army personnel, more so the officers, after the exposure of harrowing stories of brutality inside BDR headquarters. Not to be so would be abnormal. With every passing day pictures of barbaric acts by the mutineers are being bared to us. It is difficult to believe that genuine BDR jawans could have carried out the senseless killings. The brutalities have reinforced the suggestion that the rebels were not working on their own.//////Memo //////To: God. //////From: Nury Vittachi. //////Dear Sir or Madam, //////
