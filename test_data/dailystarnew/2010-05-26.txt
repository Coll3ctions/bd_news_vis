It was only to be expected that with a disaster of such magnitude, all out efforts would be made to rehabilitate those affected in the quickest possible time through making such rehabilitation a priority on the part of the government. Natural disasters anywhere arouse a high degree of attention on the part of the authorities, to a point where the machinery of administration is swiftly deployed to roll back the damage caused.

Such stories are regularly heard and published in the newspapers and shown on the electronic media.//////Democratic responsibility and democratic right are two sides of one coin. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is using their democratic right by calling an unpopular hartal on June 27 this year. If you look at their performance in discharging their democratic responsibility, you might find it very difficult to justify their call for hartal. The democratic responsibility performed looks like this://////Why does the school system require classes such as math, English, and science, but not basic things that everybody needs in their personal life? We force students to learn algebra, trigonometry, calculus or chemistry and physics, yet how many of us ever use it again after graduation? In contrast, how many transactions involving money will we each conduct on a daily basis for the rest of our lives? Think about each time when we purchase something with a loan, or pay taxes. Even though these transactions are common, we receive very little financial education on them from our school system, or even our parents, colleagues, and others. Now, it is not uncommon that we apply for a loan to buy a flat or car, or to buy an insurance policy, or opening a BO account, apply for IPOs, or buying and selling shares. How do we expect to make wise financial decisions when we have little education on even the basics? //////An interesting article on the subject, published on 19 May in a local English daily, deals with the possibilities of cellular biological 'germs' interacting with light and water to produce electricity. It is indeed a revelation to me! My idea is limited to the production of methane gas from solid animal and human waste only. This is a totally different concept. In our interest BCSIR laboratories should study this matter and try it out experimentally to develop a working pilot plant. It will be the salvation of Bangladesh, and no less!//////It is the duty of a democratic govt. to meet the basic needs of citizens of the country. On the other hand, the role played by the opposition party is that of a shadow govt that criticises the activities of the govt to keep it on the right track. But the recent decision of hartal taken in the BNP rally at Paltan Maidan is not a permanent solution to different problems faced by the people of Bangladesh. In a least developed country like Bangladesh, the ruling party and the opposition should play effective roles. The success and failures of the govt should be openly discussed in presence of the ruling party and the opposition. The govt should also take suggestions from the opposition for handling the national issues. //////I am rather shocked to learn that a BBC radio Disc Jockey (DJ) has recently cracked an unexpected silly joke announcing - Queen Elizabeth II has died.//////With the passage of time, our student politics is no longer based on any ideology.

I hope Satyaki Chandra would understand the difference between a lawmaker meaning a Member of Parliament and a nominated "Baron" or "Peer".

Then again, to glorify the outstanding personalities like Sir S P Sinha and Prof. Kumar Bhattacharya, one does not have to put down another budding personality like Rushanara, MP. //////We were hoping, expecting and looking forward to a change after the Awami League government came to power with the promise of 'Din Badal' --the 'Charter of Change' and Digital Bangladesh, winning a landslide victory in the general elections in 2008.//////Every year so many girls are murdered, tortured and raped. Many of them commit suicide. We have laws to deal with the criminals. But we don't take quick steps to arrest the offenders. //////The govt of Bangladesh took a massive project to distribute energy saving bulbs provided by World Bank to electricity users countrywide on 19 June, 2010. This is definitely a remarkable and noteworthy step when the country is in dire need of electricity. But the whole programme may be jeopardized due to shortage of preparation by one biggest distribution agency like Dhaka Power Distribution Company. They have no experience of performing such programmes like Rural Electrification Board. They are just chalking out programmes of distribution but unaware of practical pros and cons of the whole procedure. Because distribution of almost ten lakh CFL bulbs in exchange of the same amount of incandescent bulbs used by customers in one day requires huge involvement of trained manpower and ample time. It also requires enough organised transport facility. High officials of DPDC are only the planners, but the low level officials and employees who will implement the entire work are still in dark and in confusion. So, the sagacious govt. decision for such a grand programme may end in a fiasco. More time should be given for successful implementation of such work. Any hectic decision may be costly for the govt. and may tarnish its image. Besides, the bulb distribution date has been fixed for the rainy season. If heavy downpour occurs on that day, what will be the fate of the whole programme? //////The education ministry declared new 1,022 non-government education institutions out of 6,000 in cue to receive MPO (monthly pay order) for teachers' salaries and benefits.
