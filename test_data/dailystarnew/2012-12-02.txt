The highest number of deaths so far in garment fire hogging international media attention, the overseas buyers are chagrined and worried. Are the BGMEA and its constituent manufacturers and exporters any wiser and resolute to call a halt to the accidents? //////In the death of Inder Kumar Gujral, India and indeed the entire South Asian region has lost a man of vision and courage. There was in Gujral an urbanity, both in terms of his approach to politics and in his dealings with people on an individual level, that revealed the substance his personality was made of. No one could have foreseen, back in the 1990s when India went through some rather rapid changes in power in New Delhi, that Gujral would one day be called upon to lead India as its prime minister. But, then again, as foreign minister twice, first in the VP Singh government and then in the HD Deve Gowda government, he did a rather good job of giving a new dimension to Indian diplomacy, especially where it concerned Delhi's relations with its neighbours. As prime minister, albeit rather briefly in the late 1990s, what came to be known as the Gujral doctrine would subsequently be regarded as the foundation upon which future leaders in South Asia could build an edifice of cooperation.//////What a difference a day makes. On Thursday it was hard to imagine a way for Bangladesh to emerge triumphant in the first ODI of the five-match series against the West Indies. Friday's match at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna changed that perception as the Tigers put in a clinical performance to beat the visitors by seven wickets. //////The key to Bangladesh's victory over the West Indies in the first ODI at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium on Friday was that the team started excellently in both bowling and batting departments, and the heartening aspect was that they kept the momentum going throughout each innings. Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Abul Hasan kept West Indies opener Chris Gayle and Lendl Simmons relatively quiet so that the rest of the team tried to attack the Tigers' strong suit -- their spinners. //////Shakib Al Hasan has been ruled out for rest of the series against the West Indies as the champion all-rounder has been advised to rest for six weeks after being diagnosed with shin injury.//////West Indies skipper Darren Sammy was very likely not expecting the result that he got from the first ODI at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium on Friday. Judging by his press conference the previous day when he talked of a 5-0 result as the aim, a seven-wicket defeat to Bangladesh probably did not sit well with the team. //////Former national pacer Talha Jubair found form at the Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra as he finished with figures of 8 for 35, his best in first-class cricket, against Rangpur yesterday.

Curiously however, the Chinese are keen to have access to Kolkata port through this road in spite of the various bottlenecks in using the port.//////The guessing game over China's next top diplomat has intensified, now that the exit of incumbent Dai Bingguo is confirmed.

There was so much pressure on him that he retracted the statement. But he remained steadfast on his proposal of a status for Kashmir outside the constitution but inside the Indian Union.//////It is under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) that China today has emerged as a most vibrant and strong nation, and the second largest economy in the world. This phenomenal rise of China in the last three decades is like a miracle.

In November, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalated, resulting in the Gaza death toll soaring past the bloody milestone of 100. Add to this the continuing unrest in Syria, the resurging dissent in Egypt, and we have a scenario of economic upheaval, social unrest, terrorist attacks and the possible threat of a full-scale war in the Middle East. //////The British Government invites four Indian leaders, Nehru, Baldev Singh, Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan to obtain the participation of all parties in the Constituent Assembly. //////
