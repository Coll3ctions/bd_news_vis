Parochialism is rearing its ugly head in Mumbai too frequently. The Shiv Sena is threatening to throw out "outsiders" from the city and the rest of Maharashtra. Self-centred party chief Bal Thackery has created a ruckus once again, this time dragging into controversy Sachin Tendulkar, the world's best batsman, who said after the 20th year of playing cricket that he was proud to be a Maharashtrian but he was Indian first. How should this remark irritate anybody? Still the shrill voice is coming from Mumbai.//////SCHOOLS all over Asia have started teaching English poetry using pop song lyrics. This plan is excellent in every way, except for one small drawback: the average pop lyricist has as much poetry in his soul as a bag of ready-mixed concrete with accountancy qualifications.//////The Renewable Energy Policy of Bangladesh, published in 2008, states that renewable energy will take a vital role for off grid electrification in the country. The main renewable energy resources in Bangladesh are biomass, solar, wind and hydropower. The hydropower potential of Bangladesh is low due to the relative flatness of the country. Wind power generation in Bangladesh has certain limitations due to the lack of reliable wind speed data and the remarkable seasonal variation of wind speed. The country has good prospects of utilizing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for electricity generation, but the high capital investment cost is a big barrier for adopting such systems. Biomass is the major energy source in Bangladesh and biomass utilization systems represent a proven environment-friendly option for small- to medium-scale decentralized electricity generation.//////The biodiversity hotspots of the globe contain a high degree of endemism and are undergoing gradual loss of habitats. Maximum portion of these hotspots are located in tropical forests, which are considered as the most endangered. Habitat fragmentation is one of the major causes of the biodiversity loss. Habitats can either disappear completely or they may become degraded and/or fragmented, both causing serious impact on biodiversity as well as ecosystem processes. Loss of natural forests and the fragmentation of remaining areas into progressively smaller patches is a significant global trend. The habitat fragmentation occurs in different ways, like in patches (e.g.), in waves (e.g. by urbanization) or linear (e.g. by construction of roads).//////Every species plays an important role in maintaining an ecological balance among the living systems of the earth. Loss of any species threats the survival of several species inclusive of man. Man's own survival depends on his willingness and ability to co-operate with the living environment as it provides critical benefits to humans. These benefits encompass ecosystem services, such as air, water, and soil purification, climate regulation, and the generation of moisture and oxygen. Human beings turn to biodiversity also for spiritual, psychological and cultural benefits. Biodiversity is aesthetically pleasing and provides opportunities for recreational activities. //////There is little question that Bangladesh has been producing a good number of little magazines for the last few years. Many of them are up to the mark, but people inclined to reading journals from Kolkata cannot really detach themselves from those. The Dhaka literati who once had few bookshops, like Marieta at Dhaka stadium market and nothing like the present Aziz Market for foreign books and periodicals can surely recollect the many issues of ////// edited by Rabia Ghosh. Numerous novel thoughts on literature enriched the issues. Shibnarayan Roy, Sumantra Chattopadhyaya and Subimal Mishra were among the regular contributors to the magazine. //////The leaves have started falling here in London and dawn has a different hue these days. I have always been attached to dawn since my childhood because it has had a special meaning for me. I am the youngest of ten children and as a child I always remember being an early riser in Kolkata. I can recall as early as when I was three, when I would awake at dawn and stand beside the red and green wrought iron railings of the long verandah overlooking the quiet road that ran by the house where I grew up. I would watch the Kolkata corporation people wash the roads. I would then skip inside to see my father, Syed Badrudduja, rosary in hand, sitting in his study and praying, a little tray in front of him. The tray contained his morning tea. Soon a maid would appear and pester me to drink a cup of milk sweetened with ovaltine. I would resist and then my father would intervene and get me halwa puree form the halwaais nearby. //////The question ////// is one that writers hear often, sometimes asked in jest and at times with serious intent. How writers choose to answer it (again, sometimes in jest, and sometimes seriously) can vary, because the question is difficult, frustrating, and perhaps futile. Lurking within it is a number of flawed, thin assumptions about the nature of utility and importance. The question's main assumption is that, because not many people read, therefore reading, and the work that produces reading (writing), are both, inherently, not truly important acts. Since few people have the time or luxury to read, writing cannot, then, be very important. Indeed, no one will read this is the deadliest phrase the struggling writer whispers to himself in self-defeat.//////It was a dawn painted in black//////When many a Brutus //////Danced to the sound of gunfire//////To perpetuate an unholy orgy //////Amidst bloodied human corpse.//////I sat by you head bowed in silent prayer//////Here and now is mine, not to share//////Others can wait to set you at liberty//////Before I let go, this moment belongs to me//////I hold your hand for warmth//////I touch your feet for blessings//////I feel your face for assurance//////I hold you long to my heart's content //////You will always be my luminary//////Like other basic demands, getting access to healthcare is an ongoing battle for most of the people living with disabilities. Too often, they are unable to access healthcare services and face major hurdles from family, community and health service provider level. This is not about just the physical access to buildings, but also access to services, information, care and support.//////When it comes to childhood diabetes, there are many things to consider including how you care for your child, costs of caring as well as the potential psychological or social problems your child may experience due to diabetes. But with little precaution and education on diabetes these children can deal it easily and lead a happy life.//////A sensible diet is one that contains a wide variety of foods which includes protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and fats. Plan your meals properly during Eid holidays. Delicious meat dishes (especially made of beef and mutton) are one of the essential food items during this time. But it is wise to control your intake of this food for the betterment of our health.//////The longer a person remains in poverty, the more likely he or she is to develop heart disease, a new study suggests.//////Labaid Cardiac Hospital has organised the 3rd International Conference on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery and 1st Dhaka Live 2009. The two-day conference including live surgery has been inaugurated yesterday in a local hotel in the city. //////When did you consult a doctor last time? Can you remember the date, medications and investigation reports? Is it handy to find out? Think about another situation: you are in a doctors chamber and discovered that you do not have previous prescriptions and investigation reports in your file. Would that visit be worthwhile? You might end up your doctors visit incomplete or need to reschedule your visit wasting valuable time and money.//////THE Indian Foreign Secretary's visit ended positively for a number of reasons. She was upbeat about the forthcoming visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India next month. The fact that Nirupama Rao found time to meet Khaleda Zia and refrained from calling on the Army Chief that her predecessor had done added to the positive tone of her visit. //////7 November 1975 is a historic turnaround for 'Bangladesh politics'. I said 'Bangladesh politics' not 'Bangladesh' because if the event was the very positive move to exonerate the country from many bad elements as the proponents of the day claim, the country would have gone much further than where we stand right now. But, yes, it changed Bangladeshi politics a lot.//////RUSSIA assumes its new role in world politics through supply of natural gas to energy-deficit states. Recently China and Russia signed a natural gas deal on 13th October for the supply of up to 70 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Siberia.//////THERE is much to commend in Agnes S. K. Yeow's recent book, ////// It is thoroughly researched, lucidly written and completely focused on its subject: the stories and novel Joseph Conrad wrote where the Malay Archipelago is the setting. Making good use of recent Conrad criticism, poststructuralist approaches to texts, and her knowledge of the history and geography of the region, Yeow has provided us with fully contextualized, readable, fascinating and nuanced readings of works such as ////// and of course, ////// In the process, she manages to convince us not only of the romance that drew him to fictionalize the region he had experienced on his own but of the way he problematized it in his narratives. Additionally, she tries to persuade us that in the trajectory of Conrad's aesthetic development, there is clearly a 'Malayan' phase in which he negotiated between art and history.//////POLITICS without repartee and politicians without wit can often turn out to be an abrasive concoction. And it is especially in these present, some would say mediocre, times that a sense of humour in politicians remains acute by its conspicuous absence. We are rather unfortunate that ours happens to be an age when, for much of the time, we laugh at politicians rather than laugh with them. That is the pity, given that there used to be a time when men like Piloo Mody, Atal Behari Vajpayee, Syed Badrudduja, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan injected good doses of humour into their politics and left people feeling pretty light-hearted, even jocular, about conditions that were otherwise quite weighty.//////ERICH Segal's Oliver's Story is a popular romantic book from one who was born 1937 in New York as the son of a rabbi.
