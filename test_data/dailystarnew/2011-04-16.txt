Perseverance and optimism are the route to success. Those are the very words that my father had told me, when I was very young. Verily, this credo has been implanted in my mind for a very long time. A very important lesson that I have learnt throughout the course of my life is that hard work never results in futility. However, unless you receive the support of others, the path to success is pretty much like a labyrinth. The former provides you with a tower of strength. In simple terms, hard work and succour are the backbone of success. My opinion might be very subjective, but this is what I believe in.//////On a cold Saturday evening in February, while we were waiting with bated breath for two rounds of winter storms that had been forecast for Boston, we celebrated Aagami's annoprashon, and for the crowd gathered around him, the gathering clouds did nothing to take away from the merry-making and joyous chanting that continued well past midnight.//////The second highest rate of stillbirth (the death of a baby before birth at or above 28 weeks of pregnancy) in Asia occurred in Bangladesh in 2009.

At this point, it is a concern for preservation of the environment and more specifically of water resources in relation to specific actions of different countries that attempted to create treaties, agreements and international standards on the proposed issue. And in the Congress of Vienna in 1815 the subject of international rivers was approached by international documents.

Of course he did not, for he inhabited an era when music and song in India were redolent of meaning and poetry. And did you know that Kundan Lal Saigal, the man from Jammu, was in the early stages of his career a typewriter salesman who sang even as he dealt with customers? There were all those times when people walked into his shop and asked him to sing a few lines before they walked out with new typewriters. It was in one of those moments that someone noticed the fine tenor of his voice and thought it could resonate all over India. The rest is, well, history. Those who came after Saigal began with the notion that music could only be the way Saigal made it or it was no music at all. Remember Mukesh's ////// There were others who eventually were led to the conclusion that they could carve their own niches in the world of melody only through going out of Saigal's shadow. Talat Mehmood, who never pretended to emulate Saigal, could nevertheless know that in the man was a defining spirit of Indian music.//////
