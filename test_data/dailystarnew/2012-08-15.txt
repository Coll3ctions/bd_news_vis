Firstly, nothing was mentioned about potholes, pools of rain water flooding potholes and other damaged road surfaces; and the dangerous crumbling and disintegration of the subsoil on the sides of the embankment over which the highways and roads are laid! This could lead to dangerous collapse of large chunks of the highways and roads. Yes traffic can move, but in urban areas, very often, rickshaws and three-wheelers get toppled and the passengers fall off and are injured, in the dirty water covering the roads. Some of these are shown in photographs published in almost all dailies as a daily feature. //////The holy month of Ramadan teaches us to practise abstinence in all spheres of our life. This holy month urges us to keep ourselves aloof from greed and lust, to shun nastiness in thoughts and actions and to develop and nourish among ourselves the virtues of righteousness, honesty and benevolence.

Unscrupulous manufacturers and traders are vigorously using harmful chemicals and toxic substances in ready foods, fruits, fishes, sweetmeats and drinks. Rampant extortions in marketplaces and on highways are going on. Crimes like stealing, snatching, killing etc. are showing an upward trend.

Secondly, it reveals that illegal trade of fish is several times higher than its legal export. And finally, it states that this fishy fish business is a regular incident in the country. //////That's a question I often ask myself, especially when I am spending my money in Dhaka city. I feel stupid to buy fake Dairy Milk chocolates that have no aluminum foil cover and taste deplorable which is found even in the most reputed stores and superstores of the city. I feel stupid buying fruits laced with chemicals, because no one can do anything about it. I feel stupid bargaining with the CNG driver over the fare, because I know it's not his fault why he can't afford to go by the metre. I feel stupid waiting in the traffic jam because of lack of planning in developing the city. I feel stupid when I read about students being handed out GPA 5 galore, because it does not reflect the intellectual prowess of our students; they just vomit out what the educational system wants. I feel stupid to see the standard of our schools and universities, because we are so far behind everyone. I feel stupid that I don't have the power to do anything. Maybe I need a crash course on how to change Bangladesh. Maybe everyone needs it.//////It is now essential to construct a foot over-bridge at Nabisco point, Tejgaon Industrial Area, Dhaka. Lots of people have to cross the road every day, especially during business hours. This point is being used to go to Gulshan avenue, Mohakhali inter-district bus terminal, land registration office, ICDDR,B and Ahsanullah University. Besides, there are many factories there.

But I wish I could read it every day because science is part of every moment of our life. Can we take a single step without the help of science? But we in this country are barely paying any attention to it. The advanced nations are developing everything and we are passively enjoying the fruits. Our schools, colleges and universities are teaching everything but science.

Was it not possible, he asked Pakistan's prime minister, for East Pakistan to become independent someday? The question startled Suhrawardy wide awake. In a state of disbelief, the prime minister (he was in office only a year) admonished Mujib. Do not ever entertain such thoughts, he told his protg. Pakistan had been achieved at a huge cost and its unity needed to be preserved. Mujib murmured, almost muttered: "We'll do our job when the time comes." //////He is the Father of the Nation. Let us not split hairs over this; as it is, the nation is dreadfully divided along entrenched lines, some so banal as to defy credulity in right-thinking persons. And a nation divided against itself cannot stand as a strong entity, with the attendant debilitating effects on its political and economic development. Not giving a person his/her proper due or proper place in history, or, on the flip side, giving overblown, or even non-existent, credit to a person are symptomatic of this malaise. //////The unfinished memoirs of Sheikh Mujib are a vivid recollection and narration of history. They are the history of Sheikh Mujib's struggle for Pakistan under Muslim League banner, the post-liberation struggle to free Muslim League from the clutches of a few aristocrats, launching of the Awami League and finally routing of the Muslim League government in Dhaka in 1954 election under the banner of United Front. The memoirs ended here, but the struggle continued on issues of provincial autonomy, six-point programme and finally, independence of Bangladesh.//////In an interview with eminent writer Dr. Humayun Azad, which was published in "//////" on December 2, 1984, national professor and renowned political scientist Abdur Razzaq was asked to comment about the major highlights of politics in Bangladesh in the preceding one decade. //////In the dawn of August 15, 1975, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made one of his final phone calls to his military secretary Col.
