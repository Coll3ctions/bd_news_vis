being tortured on remand is but a vulgar attempt at maligning the government and the judicial system of the country not to mention the noble profession of journalism.

Only 16 per cent of the financial targets has been met from July to November, 2007. At this rate, it is well-nigh impossible to implement the remainder 84 per cent in the next seven months of the fiscal year. Such an obvious statement, however, may not ruffle seasoned bureaucrats. For, in most years, at the corresponding point in time, the rate of progress on ADP had been rather low -- between 20 and 22 per cent. Of course, this year it has hit the nadir but that is just part of established pattern. //////The incident of leakage of 2nd year Honours English compulsory questions for examinations 2006 of the National University for the second time on 12 January last has stunned the whole nation.

The last time the United States convened a full-blown Middle East summit, at Camp David in 2000, it collapsed.

That Anil Kumble would get there had been apparent for a year, that he would get there so quickly in this series was perhaps not expected. When he got to 400 wickets in 2004, he had said it would be nice to get to 500.

Today there was absolutely no use making such a statement, since the notion of a flawlessly mercury-coated mirror had departed from the heart of Zaman Sahib a good while back. But then the departure had not been total, since the parting mercury had dutifully left marks of its prior presence at various places, so that even today our nearly eighty-year-old Zaman Sahib could recognize this four-cornered, ghostly object as a mirror in the bathroom of his two-storied house in Maghbazar. It wasn't that he shaved staring at the mirror, where both eyes and mirror were nearly incorporeal, but it was a necessity for him to stand at least once a day in front of the legendary object in the dim bathroom. And standing here every day he pondered on the unimaginable dialogues, those that appeared in life without any provocation, thoughts that forcibly dragged the disciplined man outside the normal frame, made him completely dizzy. //////I must confess that these days I am rather wary of attending Writers' Festivals. It could be that I am jaded after the overexposure to the relentless grind and repetitive nature of such occasions and the pretensions and hype that go with them. Whether it is in Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide, you constantly see harried publicists, wearing frowns and furrowed eyebrows, barking into their mobiles, literary agents, who have to be diplomatic keep their cool, as authors want better deals for their forthcoming books, publishers and the upper echelons of the industry with baronial miens, as though the feudal system is still in place and, of course, academics lamenting the paucity of intellectually rigorous literature and the demise of high culture. Nothing really changes except the venues. //////We marvel at your sensitivity//////and reprove for the word 'hunt//////as if, in the phrase 'how to hunt a razakar//////it is not 'razakar' that bears the brunt//////of your ire.

Mystery in the dating of the civilisation, whether it is actually a material civilisation, where its original homeland was, etc., are questions that still exercise minds worldwide. There are two distinct schools that hold two opposing views. One is the European trend that puts the homeland somewhere in the southern Russian steppes or around the Caspian and Black Sea or even in north Europe. The other school (mostly Indian scholars) suggests it is actually northern India. However, the general belief is of a central Asian steppe homeland, from where later migrations took place. These proto-historic migrations took the Indo-European (IE) languages far and wide. One group went to western Europe and ended up becoming Germanic and Balto-Slavic languages. Another major branch took the IE speaking people to modern Iran and India where they gave way to old Persian and Sanskrit languages. All these major branches then bred their own daughter languages. There are also the Anatolian language in the Asia Minor region and the now-dead Tocharian languages in Chinese Turkmenistan which originated from proto-IE languages. Philologists believe that all these languages, spoken by most Eurasians, were once together in proto-history and manifested themselves in proto-IE languages. One can create important word roots that were once believed to be spoken by proto-IE people. However, whether they were the real language or not one may never know. //////It would be difficult to imagine a more breath-taking and disturbing novel than ////// by the widely-praised and award-winning writer, Nadeem Aslam. The beauty of the author's language, the lush descriptions that almost jump off the page, are set against the background of a plot filled with mayhem and characters so emotional and bitter about one another that they'd best not share the same room. It is no understatement that the author, who was born in Pakistan and currently lives in England, is one of the finest writers in the English language today. //////The first paragraph of A Bend in the Road begins in the words of the narrator of the story. The story is a first person narrative. However, the identity of the narrator is withheld till the last moment. The narrator begins with his view of the complexity of life. He writes, Where does a story truly begin? In life there are seldom clear-cut beginnings, those moments when we can, in looking back, say that everything started. Yet there are moments when fate intersects with our daily lives, setting in motion a sequence of events whose outcome we could never have foreseen. //////Craig Murray lives these days in quite pitiable conditions in London with his Uzbek girlfriend Nadira. In these past few years he has been a candidate for a parliamentary seat and then rector of a university. It was in Blackburn that he took on Jack Straw, the man he considers his nemesis, at the 2005 elections. He lost, but then he actually did not expect to win. It was his way of getting back at the man who he believes linked up with the mandarins in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Straw was then foreign secretary) to deprive him of his job as British ambassador to Uzbekistan.//////More than sixty years after his mysterious disappearance, Bose continues to exercise a hold on the imagination in South Asia. For all the research on Gandhi and Nehru, there has always been the feeling that the Indian nationalist soul was best exemplified by Bose. This work explains why he remains head and shoulders above the others.//////
