A fire drill system must be set up which must be practiced regularly so that in case of fire, all workers can be evacuated from the building quickly in a safe and organised manner. Most garment factories are poorly equipped with just a few "Hand-Held" fire extinguishers which are okay for small fires but barely sufficient if a major fire breaks out in the building. Another safety feature is an "Automatic Sprinkler System" which sprays hundreds of gallons of water in each floor of the building automatically if fire breaks out. It is mandatory in the USA and must be made mandatory here in Bangladesh.//////It is said that cloning a human being effectively means making an identical twin, and doctors would therefore simply be copying what nature has already produced. So any attempt to clone a human would raise a host of complex ethical issues. The biologists claimed people would soon overcome their concerns if the technique became medically useful. It may be mentioned that after the birth of Louise Brown, the first test tube baby, in-vitro fertilisation became widely accepted. But before was first developed, this type of fertilisation was regarded with extreme suspicion. We have learnt from a recent report of this daily that Sir John Gurdon, whose work -- cloning frogs in the 1950s and 60s led to the later creation of Dolly, the sheep by Edinburgh scientists in 1996, regularly asks his audience during his public lecture if they would be in favour of allowing parents, who are no longer fertile, to create another copy of their deceased child using the mother's eggs and skin cells from the first child, assuming the technique was safe and effective. The average vote on that is 60 percent in favour. The reasons for no are usually that the new child would feel they are some sort of a replacement for something and not valid in their own right. //////Sachin Tendulker, the world's greatest cricketer, has retired from one-day cricket. He is the most successful batsman in the history of one-day cricket as he has 49 centuries, 18,426 runs and 463 matches to his name with all the three being world records. //////I agree with the writer about the letter titled "Why didn't shot-taking reporters save Bishwajit?" Really, where were the shot-taking reporters and bystanders when Bishwajit was hacked to death? The reporters could at least take Bishwajit to the hospital, if they could not stop the attackers. Where were they when a rickshaw puller took him to the hospital? And why didn't the bystanders save him as the photographers were so busy taking photographs? Why were they so scared to save an innocent life? The police also didn't react. Why? Our country will have a bad reputation if this type of incident keeps taking place in Bangladesh.//////It was very shocking indeed to witness the spot interview of a cop on duty during the recently enforced hartal by the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) backed by the regime in power in support of banning religion-based politics in Bangladesh. The manner in which the cop responded to the question of a journalist is highly disappointing, by which he simply portrayed himself as an arrogant person.//////I got an invitation from Bangladesh Embassy to celebrate the Victory Day on December 16 at the Bangladesh Embassy to Sweden. In 1971, I was about 16. I clearly remember my active and energetic days, starting after hearing the historic speech of Bangabandhu over radio on March 7, 1971.... //////I wonder why the rich always look down upon the poor. It is the negligence of the owners of the garment factories that has caused so many fire incidences in the garment industries resulting in deaths and the consequent sufferings of the bereaved families. We must decide to be honest. Money will come automatically if we gather wisdom and take care of the working hands. Love brings both wealth and success. So love everybody, both rich and poor, and save our country from the impending danger.//////The recent gang rape of a 23-year-old female student on a running vehicle in New Delhi, India raised triggered widespread protests across the country. The rapists didn't just rape the girl viciously, they also attempted to murder her as they had beaten her up brutally and eventually dumped her on the road from the moving bus. We are traumatised by such ruthless behaviour of the rapists. The rapists, whoever they are, should get harsh punishment.//////A recent report of The Daily Star clearly says that the information ministry has instructed all government, semi-government offices and autonomous bodies to subscribe to only five national dailies, leaving out the top circulated newspapers. The dailies are Janakantha, Sangbad, Ittefaq, The Daily Sun and The Independent. These dailies are supposed to be in favour of the present government. The report also says that officials of these offices can buy other newspapers at their own expense. This is a clear sign of tyranny or we can call it misuse of power. We have not expected such ill-motivated move from our information ministry. I hope the government would change its decision immediately.//////Top Terror Bikash Freed//////A New York newspaper has sparked outrage by publishing a detailed map with thousands of names and addresses of gun permit holders in the wake of the Newtown school shooting.//////International peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi yesterday called for "real change" and a transitional government in Syria but the armed opposition swiftly retorted that that could not include President Bashar al-Assad or his top lieutenants.//////The son of Pakistan's slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto launched his political career yesterday on the anniversary of his mother's death, vowing to continue her fight for democracy.////// The Pakistani Taliban have outlined conditions for a ceasefire, including the adoption of Islamic law and a break with the United States, a spokesman said yesterday, an offer a senior government official described as "preposterous".//////Tea plantation workers torched the home of their boss, killing both him and his wife, following a labour dispute in the northeastern Indian state of Assam, officials said yesterday.//////Doctors in Singapore yesterday battled to save the life of an Indian student who sustained horrific injuries in a gang-rape, after she was dramatically airlifted from a hospital in New Delhi.//////President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit Mukherjee has tendered unconditional apology for his 'dented and painted' remarks on the Delhi anti-rape protesters, admitting his statement was 'outrageous'.//////Japan's new leaders yesterday was set to work on dismantling plans to rid the country of nuclear power by 2040, pledging to review a post-Fukushima policy.//////The cold wave sweeping through Uttar Pradesh in India has claimed more than 30 lives in a 24-hour span, officials here said yesterday.//////Former US president George HW Bush has been admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit "following a series of setbacks including a persistent fever", but he is alert and talking to medical staff, his spokesman said.//////Nelson Mandela has been discharged after 19 days in hospital during which he was treated for a lung infection and gallstones, the South African government said on Wednesday.//////Ailing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who is still in Cuba recovering from his latest cancer surgery, has delegated several economic duties to his vice president Nicolas Maduro.//////A massive Christmas storm that whipped up tornadoes, ice and snow from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes has killed at least seven people and grounded more than 2,000 US flights.//////Calling Sohrab Hossain one of the pioneering Nazrul Sangeet singers of our country would not be an overstatement. After the Partition (1947), except for Abbasuddin, Feroza Begum, Laila Arjumand Banu, Bedaruddin Ahmed and Sohrab Hossain, there were hardly any accomplished Nazrul Sangeet artistes here. Hossain had been an integral part of the revival of popularity of Nazrul's songs and maintaining the correct notations of the songs after they went through major distortion during the 1940s and '50s. A generation of talented Nazrul Sangeet artistes that include Shaheen Samad, Dalia Nausheen, Sadya Afreen Mallick, Sabiha Mahbub and Kamol Rodrigues trained under him.//////One thing that separated Sohrab Bhai from other artistes was his gayakee, his style of presentation.

Acting Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh has followed that dictum and called a spade a spade. He proclaimed on behalf of himself, his president and prime minister that India would never support the anti-liberation forces in Bangladesh. Forty-two years later a friend in need once again proved to be a friend indeed! Good to know that hasn't changed.//////When the Taliban blasted the famous Bamiyan Buddhas with artillery and dynamite in March 2001, leaders of many faiths and countries denounced the destruction as an act of cultural terrorism.

There were two gaps -- one was a 6-year gap between the NCs of 1957 and 1964 and again a 4-year gap between 1974 and 1978. Sheikh Hasina was made the party president in her absence in the 1981 NC.
