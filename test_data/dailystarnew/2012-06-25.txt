Only when a senior citizen (a lady) and a journalist Intervened that activities stopped and those doing the logging said sorry. But by that time many trees were cut. Is not Dhanmondi Lake a public property? Can anybody cut trees in this way? The contractor who was engaged to cut the trees said that those trees were for sell. Would it be wrong to term this as robbery in broad daylight? Our judiciary can order to punish those miscreants. I wonder whether they have any freedom to perform their duties properly. In the recent years, thousands of trees were felled by the so-called powerful people and no action, whatsoever, was taken against them. People's power need to be established in this country for an exploitation-free society and safe environment.//////All kind of people are found spending time in and around the Shaheed Minar area all day. It is okay to hang out there since open places are becoming rare in the city these days. But when too many people hang out somewhere, the place runs the risk of being overcrowded. The vendors sell badam, jhalmuri, fried chips and ice cream. People eat food and leave the packets of chips, chocolates, puffed rice etc there, and definitely Shaheed Minar is not a place for doing this kind of things! I don't mean to say that people should refrain from visiting Shaheed Minar. One can definitely visit Shaheed Minar any time with friends and relatives but they must not disrespect the place. The authorities concerned should take steps to uphold the dignity of Shaheed Minar.//////Today, throughout the world, around 215 million children work, many full-time.

However, we all have a duty to help children to defend themselves against abuse - and can do one thing - as family members, teachers, servants, neighbours or friends - and principals can say it in school assemblies! Tell them that a 'secret' can be nasty as well as nice - and that nasty secrets must be TOLD.//////The house rent in Dhaka city has been increasing irrationally in recent times. Most middle class families reside in rented houses in Dhaka. They are struggling to cope with the unbridled rise in house rents. Only about 20-25% of the total inhabitants of Dhaka have their own houses. The remaining 75-80% people live in rented houses. As the demand for rented houses is increasing with the city's rising population, the owners are taking advantage of the situation to raise their rents. In some cases, landlords are also pressuring tenants to leave the house in case the latter are unable to meet the demand. The authorities concerned must do something in this regard.//////Around 80% of our export earnings come from the garment sector. And this sector employs millions of workers. At present, workers of some garment factories are carrying out agitations demanding wage increases. But the employers are reluctant to raise the wages right now.

Over 500 workers including policemen were injured in the clashes and the agitating workers ransacked at least 30 factories and vandalised vehicles.//////As you are aware, IDB Bhaban at Agargaon housed major UN agencies of the country plus a good number of other offices.

Thousands of customers visit the computer city on business purposes. A government secondary school (which is also turning into a college from 2012-2013 academic session) is situated on the southern side of IDB Bhaban where a good number of students are attending daily. The road in front of it stretching to Mirpur and Pallabi is now getting extremely busy with vehicular traffic (e.g. rickshaws, vans, auto rickshaws, cars, buses, covered vans and trucks) and people find it extremely difficult and hazardous to cross the road to find transport back home after their office work, business and school. A number of accidents took place while crossing the road. //////"Government of the people, by the people, and for the people" --- unfortunately, Lincoln's quote is not true in case of Bangladesh. In our country political parties take decisions without considering the sufferings of the people. It is said that Awami League is consisted of some of the most experienced and intelligent political leaders. But this political party is working against people's interest which has already damaged its image. I am astonished how such decisions come from a ruling party just for creating hindrance to a political gathering called by the opposition. I am talking about the June 11th agitation programme of the opposition. //////Nato yesterday said it will discuss Turkey's accusation of Syria shooting down one of its warplanes in international airspace, as Damascus suffered heavy losses and violence scaled new heights.//////Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday said troops had responded "forcefully" to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip and could boost their response if a fragile truce announced on Saturday failed to hold.//////To his admirers, Pakistan's Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is a hero whose relentless pursuit of a money-laundering case against the president is teaching a generation of the country's leaders a long-overdue lesson in respect for the law.//////Thailand's "red shirts" turned out in force yesterday to warn the judiciary they will not stand by if a plan to amend the constitution is rejected, a rewrite critics say is aimed at allowing exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra to come home.//////Health and funding woes are threatening a flagship Khmer Rouge trial, experts say, kindling fears that the elderly defendants may never answer for the worst of Cambodia's "Killing Fields" era.//////Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr yesterday said there was "no hint" of a plan to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States should he be sent to Sweden.//////Australia's government yesterday renewed its call for a refugee swap deal with Malaysia after an asylum seeker boat sank off remote Christmas Island leaving up to around 90 people dead or unaccounted for.//////The imminent US Supreme Court decision on Barack Obama's signature health care reforms has major implications for November's presidential election and for the future of the United States.//////Turkey's military yesterday confirmed further air strikes against Kurdish rebel bases in northern Iraq.//////Bolivia's government yesterday signed a deal on new salary terms with striking police, Interior Minister Carlos Romero said, adding that the officers had agreed to end their mutiny in key cities.//////Paraguay's ousted president Fernando Lugo yesterday said that he had accepted his "unjust" impeachment in the name of peace, but accused lawmakers of "dismissing democracy" with the snap move.//////NDA backed presidential candidate PA Sangam began his campaigning for First Citizen of India after paying obeisance at Golden Temple yesterday.//////Greece's new prime minister and finance minister will for health reasons both miss a key EU summit where they were to launch efforts to renegotiate the terms of an unpopular austerity-centred bailout.//////Tunisia extradited former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's prime minister to Libya yesterday, a Libyan security official said, making him the first senior official to be sent back for trial under the country's transitional leadership.//////Adapting a Tagore poem Dui Pakhi, noted dancer Deepa Khandakar planned, compiled and choreographed a dance-drama of the same title.
