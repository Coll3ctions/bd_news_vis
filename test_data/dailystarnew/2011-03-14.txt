Addressing a public meeting at Nishtar Park in Karachi, he asked how democratic principles could be applicable to a country divided into two distant parts. He said that he advocated one Pakistan, but for the rule of the majority to apply over the whole country, the Awami League would have to drop its Six Point plan first. Bhutto denied that his party had placed any preconditions before it would agree to join the National Assembly. He said that the PPP had only wanted assurances from the Awami League that its views would also be heard when the assembly was finally convened.

For we want a full stop to killings rather than bringing down the number of firing incidents.//////The observance of the seventeenth founding anniversary of The Financial Express last week is testimony to the positive role the newspaper has played in Bangladesh's business journalism all these years. When it first hit the stands, it stood out not only for its look, which was at variance with the image presented by other newspapers, but also for the theme on which it meant to work. Fundamentally, it was --- and remains --- a publication geared to a presentation of news and comments on business, particularly in the national arena. In the years since it was founded, The Financial Express has worked quietly but passionately and in so doing has carved a niche for itself among Bangladesh's newspaper-reading public.//////The pressure was over for only two days, and now it is back on again. Just when a win against England seemed like it would buy the Bangladesh side some chances to relax, another must-win tie against the Netherlands beckons today in their first day match of the ICC Cricket World Cup at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong. The hype and expectation surrounding this match may not be as much as it was in previous encounters, but today's match is no less important to the cause. //////The mention of 'Netherlands' and the memories of 1997 come pacing back to everyone from that generation.

Our population was about 75 million in 1971, but within a time span of 40 years, it has now crossed 160 million. Such a huge population with a growth rate of about 1.5%, huddled up in an area of only 1, 47,570 sq. km, poses the greatest challenge to all of our development efforts. Acute poverty, widespread unemployment, food shortage, deteriorating law and order situation, illiteracy, environmental disruption etc are the main problems we are trying to solve, but we should always keep it in mind that our ever-increasing population is the mother of all these problems. Therefore, our govt. should immediately adopt a well-defined population policy having a time-frame for achieving zero growth rate within the shortest possible time. As one of the steps to reach the goal, a massive public awareness drive especially among the poor should be launched and continued with the help of all govt. and non-govt. agencies, NGOs, intellectuals and members of the civil society. //////The news item, 'low bridges choke rivers' published in your daily on 9 February, 2011, has drawn my attention. In fact, short bridges, shorter in length than the width of the rivers and canals on which they are constructed, are more responsible than the low bridges for the choking of the rivers and canals. It has become a practice in Bangladesh that when a bridge is constructed over a river or a canal, to save some money or whatever the reason, it is made shorter in length than the actual width of the river or the canal; then the bridge is connected to the road by earth filling on both sides, and thus choking of the river or canal starts. //////First of all, as a Bangladeshi I am proud of Bangladesh's victory against England. It was badly needed. Just one week earlier we lost to Ireland and a lot of people questioned about our test status. Today we have shown we can come back from any situation. One day or one match does not say everything. //////We are watching the happenings around us with deep anguish and dismay, it seems that sense and sensibility has departed. Those who are at the helm of the country are doing most outrageous things. Removing Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus from Grameen Bank is so deplorable that we are stunned and just cannot believe it.//////What is going on in Bangladesh? Where is our sensibility? The Attorney General says in an interview right after the petition, "If anyone is supposed to get a Nobel peace prize in Bangladesh it should be either Sheikh Hasina or Shantu Larma." What is happening? Is this a competition on buttering up?//////While reading Chinese writer Han Suyin's book "My House Has Two Doors" my eyes fixed on a particular sentence. Here, a Chinese citizen disclosed to the writer that he was not a communist but he loved his country and was willing to study Marxism. In our country, sadly some political leaders couldn't come out of their particular agendas. In fact, a large number of our politicians are busy with parochial agendas of making fortune and taking their respective parties to power. The mentality is in sharp contrast with the progress and development of the country. We have won independence about four decades back and it is high time for our leaders to give a serious introspect into the matter. If they change their mindset, only then people will see a tangible progress in the country. //////Motijheel Commercial Area is the commercial hub of Dhaka. Many high-rise buildings, hundreds of public and private organisations, offices, establishments, banks, insurance companies, export and import enterprises, mercantile houses and DSE are located here. Motijheel Commercial Area always buzzes with economic and monetary activities, trade and commerce.//////As a nation, we cannot evaluate appropriately a revered person. Probably this is one of the reasons why we are lagging behind. We have hardly any internationally recognised persons in our country. There are people who are talented in our country, but the irony is that they are not appreciated or acknowledged properly. Therefore, those brilliant people tend to lose interest in giving their best efforts in building the nation. The way GOB has played its role in removing Nobel Laureate Prof. Yunus from the Grameen Bank is nothing but a display of government's lack of prudence. Despite all the controversy, Prof. Yunus is our golden son and only individual to represent Bangladesh in international arena. My deepest gratitude to Muhammad Zafar Iqbal for writing such a humane article titled 'Prof. Yunus and Bangladesh' published in The Daily Star on 7th March, 2011.//////The sacking of Dr Yunus (OK, let us call it Removal) was 'justified' by the Hon'ble (?) Finance Minister before some worried members of the Diplomatic Corps as reported in DS on Friday, 4th March. Grameen Bank repudiated it on 5th, saying most of the FM's statements are inaccurate (would 'lies' have been more appropriate?). //////After Dr. Muhammad Yunus got the Nobel Peace Prize, I have observed an interesting attitude among some people of our country Phooo! Nobel Prize? Nothing very difficult to accomplish, it's so easy! When man like Dr. Yunus can get Nobel, why not me and you? Dr. Yunus got the Nobel Prize for his remarkable accomplishments towards uplifting the lot of the common people not only of Bangladesh but people world over. So, Bangladesh as a whole should pay due honour to Dr. Yunus to retaining the dignity of the Nobel Prize so that in future some other Bangladeshi can get such prestigious award in recognition of his/her contributions in the arena of science and the humanities. Under this reference, I would like to record here another observation of mine. Perhaps to develop new leadership and dynamism our present Prime Minister has absorbed some young professionals but less politically popular persons into her cabinet. I would also request her to include some senior and experienced Awami League leaders who have great potentiality to help government solve the existing problems and contributing towards realizing government's development goal. What I strongly feel is that qualification is important, but qualification plus experience works more effectively in smooth running of the state affairs.//////My sister-in-law Juthi had to break up with her husband who constantly belittled her. Coming from a respectable family, she was unable to stomach her husband's condescending attitude towards her. Her husband constantly reminded her that it was because of him that she led a rich life in a luxury condo in Dhaka. Only Allah knows how many girls are being humiliated by their husbands like this. //////Wastelands of mud and debris now stretch along Japan's northeast coast where towns and villages used to be, consumed by a terrifying tsunami triggered by Japan's biggest ever earthquake.//////* Yesterday an official at Japan's nuclear agency rates the incident at 4 on the 0-7 international scale of severity.

But still, Friday's tsunami triggered by an earthquake at the Pacific Ocean's floor more than 24 kilometres below the surface (hypocentre) wreaked havoc on the northeast coast of the country. The quake, with its epicentre located 130 kilometres off the east coast of Oshika Peninsula, Tohuku, measured between 8.9 to 9.1 on the Richter scale, which was the largest one to hit Japan and within the boundaries of North American and Pacific tectonic plates in the last 1,200 years. //////The concept of Commonwealth as a free association and the fact that the newly independent countries coming out of the clutches of the British Imperial yoke would like to stay on in the Commonwealth, facilitated transfer of power from the British Crown in the mid-forties. //////March 14//////
