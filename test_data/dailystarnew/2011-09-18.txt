A recent incident set me thinking about the "responsibilities" and the "opportunities" that come with friendship. Of course, the term "friend" is generic and doesn't always convey the true nature of the diverse relationships that one develops in the course of one's life. However, the most remarkable aspect of friendship is that it has undefined borders and is constantly evolving. A friend can assume any role: soul mate, confidante, mentor and, occasionally, just someone to share good times with. Yet the ties of friendship are fragile because there are no strings attached. It's a relationship built upon mutual respect and love. Also, one needs to work within self-imposed limits and boundaries and surf on a shifting tide, since life is in a state of flux for us all. But the most challenging part is that, more than other relationships, friendship tests one's capacity to accept, endure and make sacrifices. //////
