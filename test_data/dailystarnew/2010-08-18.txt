It has been observed for a very long time and especially since the beginning of Ramadan this year that traders have with impunity continued to raise the prices of goods, to the great discomfiture of citizens. At the same time, the fact that every so often reports surface about the adulteration of food items throws up the image of a situation which, unless it is handled firmly, will lead to a culture of impunity on the part of dishonest traders for whom nothing other than profiteering matters.//////Impulsive response to a deep-seated crisis, be it handling traffic congestion or suspending CNG gas filling for a big block of time appears to have been something of a signature emblem of governance. The ostensible purpose behind pre-mature closing down of educational institutions for the Ramadan and Eid and now behind the six-hourly daily prohibition of CNG supply at the filling stations has a ring of 'yureka' chant about it.

The selection committee neither agreed nor disagreed to the news item published recently.//////There is no sign that the present traffic jam situation will improve soon. And we can imagine the worst traffic jam in near future. The government has taken many steps to improve the traffic system in Dhaka. But the ultimate result is zero.

It is our major foreign exchange earner, largest employer, gives opportunities to women and generates huge revenue. Unfortunately, this productive area is going through increasing unrest and violent upheavals. Both workers and owners are unhappy. To a layman, with access to only what he reads or sees on TV, the causes are many and the old merry-go-round blame game is being played with full vigour by the three parties involved workers, owners and government.//////Most of the public colleges and universities have become mini cantonments which are full of lethal weapons and ammunition. It is a great tragedy for the nation that the sanctity of the campuses of our educational institutions is being marred by violence. Campus violence is a festering wound. The places of nation-building are now centres of terrorism. Invaluable time, talent and money are being wasted by campus violence. The violence often forces the closure of the institutions and further worsens the already critical, session jam situation.//////The tragic accident at Uthali, near Manikganj, where two top bureaucrats were killed vividly exposes our inefficient road safety system.

It's no way the fault of our students to think that way as every human being considers his/her future. The mindset of the students can only be changed if they find bright career prospects in the science courses. The policymakers of the education system of our country should go for an overhaul in this sector. Now, let's consider some backdrops of our science education on which they can work.//////In the month of Ramadan we expect a political trade off since the elders are extending invitation for Iftar. The opposition has already made a breakthrough in the process by making governance to a certain extent quite difficult for the present government. It is difficult to make any guess in the backdrop of poor performance in power sector and city management. To be straightforward, the AL is in power but the BNP controls the strategic areas of governance by their loyal set ups in trade, commerce, power, RMG and what not. //////It has become a tradition that in Ramadan prices will hike on a galloping scale comparable to other times. 'Increasing demand' may be a cause. But is this the only one? //////Once, I had a chance to go to Mumbai and I was amazed by their transport system. They have good rail network to travel in the city.

She has now arrived at the age of sixty six which, by any measure, is a point where experience translates into maturity and a clear appreciation of popular sensitivities. For an individual who has been prime minister of Bangladesh twice and has been a significant political figure for as many as twenty seven years, it is especially important that Begum Zia do all those things that will garner for her as much political support as possible. Celebrating her birthday on a day where Bangladesh grieves for its founding father is not one of those things. //////Aquestion was raised as to whether political parties based on religion could exist in Bangladesh after the verdict of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court confirmed the illegality of the Fifth Amendment Act of the Constitution (judgment was released on July 28).//////The High Court has expressed its deep concern about the over-population in the country.
