We wonder whether the forest department's order, issued in 2008 permitting the cutting down of the trees, had considered all the relevant pros and cons of the issue. It may be recalled that the order was held in abeyance (by then more than 1000 trees had been cut down) by the forest department in the face of opposition from the locals living in the area and environmental activists, only to be allowed again, this time with enhanced rate of royalty. //////K.G. Mustafa belonged to a generation we can rightly regard as pioneers in our world of journalism. His death at the age of eighty-four is therefore a harking back to a time when values underscored the presentation of news and with that a formulation of opinion in newspapers. Throughout his adult life (and it actually commenced in his teens), Mustafa made it a point to remain steadfast to the vocation he had opted for, a position he did not waver from in his long life. Following the partition of 1947, he clearly seemed to have decided that while the newspaper was going to be his preoccupation, both as a principle and as a profession, it would also serve as a vehicle for the promotion of political and social causes. The trajectory of his life shows all too well that Mustafa upheld the causes he believed in. In the chaotic politics of 1950s Pakistan, followed by the harshness of the decade-long Ayub military regime, Mustafa and a very large number of his peers saw little reason to suspend the battle for truth.//////The fate of the first Test was all but decided on the first day and nothing that happened on the third day changed they momentum of the game on the third day at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong. England were in complete control despite Mushfiqur Rahim and Nayeem Islam associating in a record 113-run eighth wicket partnership for Bangladesh to give the home team a decent total. The tourists could even afford to lose five quick wickets in the second innings, but still ended the day with an overall lead of 434 with five wickets remaining. //////England spinner Graeme Swann is a firm advocate of superstition. Which is why he always bowls with his sunglasses on, as he believes it will bring him better luck. And who would argue with the tall off-spinner, after he grabbed his fifth five-wicket haul in his short 17-match career in the first Test against Bangladesh at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium yesterday, with his sunglasses firmly in place. //////WFM Shamima Akhter Liza earned her first norm of International Master when she drew against Saif Uddin Lablu in the ninth and final round of the Parachute International Chess tournament at the conference room of Uni Resort in Cox's Bazar yesterday.//////Kasba High School of Rajshahi emerged champions in the Ecstasy National School Hockey Championship with a hard fought 2-1 win over Armanitola High School of Dhaka in the final at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////It wasn't as resounding a thrashing as Brendon McCullum's ruthless innings in the opening game two years ago, but it was still a massive win for Kolkata Knight Riders in front of a heaving Eden Gardens crowd. Angelo Mathews followed up his fire-fighting effort with the bat on Friday by starring with the ball to pin down Royal Challengers Bangalore, before fireworks from Kolkata's openers ensured Shah Rukh Khan's team began their campaign with victories over both of last year's finalists.//////Bangladesh spinners found England top-order wanting in the second innings after a record 113-run eighth wicket partnership between Mushfiqur Rahim and Nayeem Islam, but still the visitors were in the driver's seat at the end of the third day's play of the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium here yesterday.//////England looked ordinary for a while when Mushfiqur Rahim and Nayeem Islam added 113 for the eighth wicket but that could have been for the stifling weather.//////Some 250 tickets of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa have been allotted to Bangladesh Football Federation and the BFF has asked interested persons to apply for tickets to them.//////Defending champions Deccan Chargers got their first Indian Premier League victory of the season after their impressive 31-win over Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai last night.//////New Zealand have gone back to a familiar but inconsistent batsman in Mathew Sinclair as they attempt to challenge Australia in Friday's opening Test in Wellington.

Rajshahi University (RU) yesterday laid a siege to the pharmacy department office alleging secret liaison between a section of teachers and Shibir men. //////We have seen many a time photos published in The Daily Star with the caption 'Hello Mayor'. This was to draw the attention of the mayor of Dhaka to take note and to ensure some action in public interest. But we don't know if at all any action had been taken. When and after what 'grave' incident will his department wake up to redress the plight of the citizens, it is only to be seen.//////Once again, my friend Mr. Sikander Ahmed of Niketon, Gulshan through his letter dated February 21, 2010 has compelled me to respond. Mr. Sikander himself has accepted that he has been continuously trying his best desperately to 'shut' everyone down whoever speaks sense in favour of banning rickshaws from Dhaka metropolitan city roads (in phases). He has specifically mentioned that he has 'sent off rebuttal' to DS against Mr. Chisti's remark.//////The young generation (especially the students at the tertiary level) is being spoiled by the political culture, by encouraging violence and obstructions (hartal).

The notice disheartened me. I think it also disappointed nearly four crore educated, unemployed youths. //////Every Friday comes as a weekly Eid Day for Muslims. It is an important duty to listen to the sermon called Khutba in Arabic. The Imam always reads out some important lessons for the pious Muslims. It is for sure that most of the listeners do not get the point exactly made for their enlightenment. Though it is obligatory for Muslims to have a little understanding of the Arabic language for the sake of the religion, but it is neglected. Hence the important sermon is listened to but not significantly understood. And Muslim parents of modern societies attach less importance to religious teachings, regrettably though.//////A drowning man tries to remain afloat holding even a straw. The BNP's recent manoeuvre through the cocktail scare is much lighter than even a straw for such a big leader of the party.

But people are observing with concern that in the last couple of years, Wasa has miserably failed to supply safe water to its consumers. A surface water treatment plant was established in Sayedabad that is supplying contaminated water. //////Traditionally, Bangladeshis have a penchant for symbolism. Names, metaphors, slogans have always got precedence over substance. It is an integral part of Bengali psyche and history is replete with such examples. But the present cause of concern among the people lies elsewhere: it is the name changing of public places which worries them. Now people can easily understand that these are not done to show any respect to any of their leaders but to demean them.//////In Bangladesh, till now no political party has ever won an election; it has always been the case of the other party losing! What makes it worse is that irrespective of who the government is or what their election manifesto was during the campaign, once in power the strategy is always the same: //////The questions of English 1st paper for the students of Dhaka Board was really difficult to answer to the point. The authorities should have special consideration for this paper, so that the students can do well. //////Please refer to a letter by Kabir Ahmed published in your daily on 1 March 2010. It drew my attention. Renaming or assigning names to different establishments was not in the election manifesto of the Awami League. Rather, their pledge was to change the days by doing a good job for the people. This government took over power more than a year ago. During this period, what change the government has been able to bring ? //////A poll found that most Americans think Pakistan along with Iran and North Korea are among the most unfriendly countries of the world. At the bottom of the heap is, of course, North Korea, followed by Iran and Pakistan. About 90% of the Americans consider all these countries are a threat to the American security and must be treated as such.//////The capital experienced the first Kal Boishakhi storm which caused some damages and inconveniences to the city dwellers, one being the failure of electricity. I live within the jurisdiction DESA's Shyamoli Control Room. Soon after the rain stopped I started contacting the Shyamoli Control Room to lodge a complaint of electricity failure. The first problem I faced was to get the telephone line as the control room has only one number, i.e. 9146043. Anyway after re-dialling for about half an hour, I got the line and lodged the complaint. The officer on duty informed me that it might take a few hours before they could restore the power supply. Then after a few hours the electricity came but unfortunately the voltage was very low. Again after trying for quite some time I got the line and complained about the low voltage. This time, the duty officer told me that it would again take some hours to mend the fault as the number of complaints were so high and their men are attending one by one. Mentionable that the control room has only a limited number of technical manpower plus emergency vehicles. //////With the passage of time we are confronting day by day some inevitable questions. What can we do if the police compel us to give a false confessional statement? What shall we do if we are arrested and displayed before some illegal weapons and ammunition which actually belong to the police themselves? How can we tolerate when we see the police are being assisted by some terrorists in an operation against some innocent persons? What the police will do if they are compelled by some powerful directors(political big boss) to arrest someone illegally? How can we get the truth if the media supply only partial news and views? How can we continue our education if there is a wide cultivation of terrorism in every educational institution? What will happen to our sisters who are facing the constant threat of abduction and rape? //////In the Newtonian universe every 'action' elicits an equal but opposite 'reaction' (3rd law), and the current naming/ re-naming in Bangladesh is no exception.

On many occasions, the little dancer, aged six or seven, would have to be reassured by her teachers and friends that her mother was near at hand, but the adamant, nervous child would listen to no one, refusing to perform and holding back the show. Then her mother would appear, just a bit lower the stage at 90 degrees to where she was standing. Arpita would find back her strength and confidence and begin her wonderful performance, drawing a big round of applause from all. //////An assortment of the various blends of art in the country today were much in evidence at the Spring Art Fair 2010 in Lakepark, North Gulshan . The fair was organised by Bangladesh Art Council. On display were art works in such mediums as print-making, burnt clay, portraits, watercolour, sculpture, metal crafts, ceramics, glass painting, textile and photography, among others.//////A few miles off Jhenidah, at Barobazar, lies the 'dargha' (shrine) of legendary Gazi, Kalu and Champaboti, who according to popular myth, lived in the region about 700 years ago.//////As the clapstick hit the clapboard, the final sequence of the 11th International Short & Independent Film Festival, by Bangladesh Short Film Forum (March 4-12), began with the organisers presenting this years' award for Best Documentary, Best Fiction award to international entries and Tareque Shahriar Best Independent Short awards.

Consecutive suicide bombings in Peshawar, the bomb blast near Indian embassy at Kabul, and the Tehrik-e-Taliban attack on the army GHQ in Rawalpindi, one of the most sensitive places in Pakistan, raise questions on the effectiveness of military operations both in Afghanistan and Pakistan. //////In an international Conference organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) in connection with its Golden Jubilee Celebration few years back, my favourite teacher and world-famous economist Dr Azizur Rahman Khan (best known as AR Khan) revealed a few pertinent puzzles that he observed in our macroeconomic calculus. I strongly feel that his seminal observations, presented below and at times paraphrased - of that time are worthy of notes even now for teachers and students of macroeconomics as well as for policymakers.//////K.G. Mustafa was already a well-known name in journalism when I was in school. And the first time I heard of him and of other illustrious figures in the world of Bengali journalism was when my father reflected on what the newspapers in East Pakistan were writing in the era of Field Marshal Ayub Khan. There was no way I could read Mustafa's reports or his commentaries. In the first place, I was at the time yet to get a grip on my understanding of written Bangla. In the second, the newspapers Mustafa and his peers worked for in East Pakistan did not make their way to Baluchistan, where my family happened to be. That was in the 1960s.//////IT was such a relief to learn, from no less an authority than home secretary G.K. Pillai, that Maoists aim to overthrow the Indian state by 2050. That gives us four decades during which the plus-40 bourgeois can die in their beds; those blessed with first jobs in 2010 can retire in comfort, and hope for a ringside view of the revolution; and those below 20 can worry -- unless, of course, they have joined the revolution.//////
