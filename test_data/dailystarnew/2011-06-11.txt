Implementation of the proposed budget for the next fiscal year will face some risks, but those will be dealt with increased revenue earning, austerity in government spending, and reduction of government subsidies, said Finance Minister AMA Muhith yesterday.//////The priorities in the proposed budget for fiscal 2011-12 are apparently consistent with the ruling party's electoral pledges but practically they are not, Debapriya Bhattacharya, distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said yesterday.//////In aggressive promotion of pharmaceutical drugs the country's medical representatives invade hospitals during busy working hours in violation of marketing code and medical ethics, according to doctors and witnesses. //////The main opposition BNP and its key ally Jamaat-e-Islami yesterday called for a countrywide 36-hour hartal from tomorrow dawn, demanding continuation of caretaker government system and protesting at the recommendations of the parliamentary special committee on constitutional amendment.//////The Awami League has decided to tackle the opposition's 36-hour hartal politically and its government is to go tough on any violence during hartal.//////Financing the coming year's budget will be a major challenge for the government, the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) has observed.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged businessmen to keep prices of essentials within reach of commoners and the market stable during the upcoming month of Ramadan.//////Syfur Rahman Khokon, a steel mill entrepreneur who deposited Tk 40 lakh with Titas nearly two years ago for gas connection, is yet to get it.

The latest of these incidents occurred on Thursday last in the capital. The reason we are told is because the said factory was locked out, and the agitated workers, finding it so, ventilated their anger. And the victims were not even remotely related or responsible for their woes. //////That most of the NGOs have been playing an important role in the country's socio-economic uplift hardly needs an elaboration. These have been playing key role in micro credit financing; health sector; non-formal education; rights issues; environment and other related social development fields, enabling the marginal classes to engage in national development activities. In fact, major NGOs are supplementing the government in its efforts to accelerate socio-economic development programs. //////Sheikh Russel Krira Chakra were all but out of the race for the

He further added that their workers were not even allowed to stay on the footpath and warned that such actions would compel them to resort to longer //////The terrorist and the policeman both come from the same basket. This was proved again at Delhi this week when a religious leader, Baba Ramdev, was fasting before thousands of his followers. Policemen of different organisations belonging to the centre and the states came like tons of bricks on the sleeping crowd and dispersed them, using even tear gas. The Baba was physically removed, leaving many injured, some seriously.//////Some people holding high positions in society and the government often behave and talk most erratically and irrationally, lowering the image of the office they hold. Their public manner sometimes borders on stupidity. In our country, these types of people are not too few. They are always espousing policies they consider most viable and hold on to them, defying public criticism. They are always fulminating about enemies they perceive to see surrounding them.//////Let me start with a question: What are the candidates tested on in the BCS examination? A few days ago, a preliminary test of the 31st BCS examination was held across the country. I happened to look at the test items, which were all multiple-choice questions. I was wondering about whether or not the knowledge and skills required to pass the exam were worth knowing. I was not sure about how they would be useful in the "real-life" contexts in which the participants would need to perform in the future. //////Throughout history, important constitutional cases have had far-reaching and, at times, disastrous consequences. In 1857, in Dred Scott case, the US Supreme Court declared slavery lawful. The result was the American civil war. In 1955, in Tamizuddin Khan's case (PLD 1955 Federal Court 240), although the Chief Court at Sindh declared the Governor General's decision to dissolve Pakistan's Constituent Assembly unlawful, the Federal Court (with Justice Cornelius dissenting) reversed that decision. Chief Justice Munir was suspected of complicity with the armed forces. It is however widely believed that without that judgment, democracy would not have suffered that terrible fate in Pakistan.//////The alarm bells this time are not being rung by climate scientists or by environmental activists.

He was the first non-European to receive it. His coming by the Nobel created much excitement not only in India but outside it as well. Rabindranath, not at all known outside India before the publication of his ////// in its English version in November 1912 from London, made millions of people sit up and take notice of him through the prize. William Butler Yeats (1865-1939), a reputed Irish poet even before 1913 and eventually a Nobel laureate himself, in 1923, was a great admirer of Rabindranath during his ////// days, though he did not rejoice at the declaration of the Nobel Committee on November 13, 1913. A study of Nobel nominations will perhaps give us an idea of the process involved. On 10 December every year the year's laureate has to receive the prize and deliver a lecture. Very recently the web site of the Nobel Committee released a wealth of information that gives us a fresh perspective on the Nobel process itself. //////My mother often used to say that when you don't have a choice, dudher shad gholey mitao, i.e., satisfy your yearning for the taste for fresh milk with the taste of buttermilk. My wife Rumi and I would have loved to be in Kolkata or Dhaka to celebrate Rabindra and Nazrul Jayanti this year, but since that is not an option, we decided that we might as well take my mother's advice and celebrate these twin birthdays with gusto here in Boston and Connecticut, even if that leaves you with the taste of buttermilk. My letter today will offer my dear readers a glimpse of our efforts and I hope that you will see what we lack in scale and extravaganza we make up with our zeal, creativity and a little bit of bravado, not to speak of our boundless love for these two literary giants. //////Although there is cost effective intervention and treatment available, many children in Bangladesh are becoming unnecessary disabled. Many more children are living with severe form of disability whereas simple aid or support could reduce the severity and help them leading a normal life. Timely action can prevent many forms of disabilities, bring back childrens life from a state of handicapped to normal like other children.//////Bacterial meningitis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries like Bangladesh, but the duration of treatment was not well established.//////Vaccines are undoubtedly one of the best investments in health. Immunisation programmes have contributed enormously to reducing the burden of infectious diseases, and are responsible for much of the falling rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In December 2010, global health leaders committed to making the next 10 years the Decade of Vaccines  to ensure discovery, development, and delivery of lifesaving vaccines globally, especially to the poorest countries. This Series looks at every aspect of this medical technology, including the developments expected over the coming decade and what we can expect from translation of the latest vaccine science. Improving vaccine coverage and financing of both existing and newer vaccines together with how we communicate the benefits of vaccines and ensure public trust and confidence, are also examined.//////Combining omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, sea food, plants, and nut oils with blood-thinning drugs may reduce the risk of heart attacks in patients who have had stents placed in their coronary arteries, a new European study suggests.//////Jogging, swimming, biking or other moderate to intense physical activity may protect the brain from silent strokes or small brain lesions that can lead to mental decline and increase the chances of a future stroke, a new study from Columbia University suggests. Researchers revealed that moderate to intense physical activity cuts seniors' risk by 40 percent.//////Cancers of the gut, stomach and pancreas could be detected much sooner with a simple urine test, new research from Edinburgh University suggests. Researchers have identified key proteins in the urine of patients with advanced cancers. The findings could help in diagnosis much earlier, leading to improved survival rates.//////As the events are unfolding in the North African and Middle East region quite dramatically, there are talks as to whether the balance of power in the region would mark any shift. The changes and developments were so sudden and unexpected that it left little room for maneuvering; and intelligence agencies hardly had any clue whatsoever about what would happen in the next few moments. No one apparently imagined that a mere protest in Tunisia, which led to the collapse of Ben Ali's empire, would spark and engulf the whole Middle East. And the fall of Mubarak regime in Egypt marks the most striking development with huge strategic significance. This single incident may lead to further equations as to the future geo-politics in the region.//////The end of the cold war naturally expedites Washington to put on the crown of world politics unilaterally although a set of actors were mounting up from Asia especially China and India with their soft power i.e., the power to attract culturally and to get something done with attraction rather than compulsion. The intention of super powers is, as it was and perhaps will be, to stretch out the ascendancy all over the world and indubitably the US is no exception who sets a policy strategy for Asia fetching Pakistan closer both politically and diplomatically. //////Iran's navy has sent submarines to the Red Sea "to collect data," its first mission in distant waters, the Fars news agency reported Tuesday without giving further details.//////Amitav Ghosh puts it succinctly. 'We are a riverside people', says he. The obvious reference is to Bengalis. That Bengalis have dwelt, like any other historical civilization, beside their rivers is a truth made all the more poignant by an awareness of how constricted those ageless rivers have of late been getting. For Ghosh, Bengal is home, India is home. But America? It is a place where he lives, a spot he is nevertheless in love with. He opens his heart to Sunil Sethi, speaks of the dispersal of people, of the Indian diaspora he has always been keen to write about. And out of that sense of alienation-cum-belonging have come such works as ////// and ////// and //////. In his words, he is a //////, a term used for 'indentured labourers who left in the nineteenth century because they signed agreements which they call girmits . . .'//////It was a pleasant surprise to find Nighat Gandhi's evocative article, 'Landscapes of the Heart', in the Literature section of the Daily Star. This was because I had just happened to finish reading her book of short stories, 'Ghalib at Dusk and other stories'. I loved the article as much as I did her stories.//////
