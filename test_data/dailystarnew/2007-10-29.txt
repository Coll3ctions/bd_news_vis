It is appalling to see that roofs of rooms on some of the floors above have already collapsed thereby exposing yawning holes large enough for a grown up man to plummet to his death. And the sight of children living next to those holes makes one contemplate the plight of the little ones for which they had played no role. The said building is on the verge of total collapse and yet the inmates cannot move away as they have nowhere to go. Figuratively speaking, they sleep next to death every night! //////Efforts in the post-emergency period in Bangladesh appear to be directed at instituting electoral democracy; electoral democracy being defined as: "Any regime in which governmental offices are filled as a result of contested elections.

The value of this extra fish in dollar is roughly about 400 million, if we take the price of a Kg. of fish to be 5 dollars. If a wholehearted effort is made to increase the "Hilsa" fish production by taking various measures like imposing ban on fishing during breeding season, total ban on "Jatka" catching, increasing and protecting breeding ground, effectively checking smuggling, controlling pollution of rivers, especially the breeding fields and controlling the net size, we can double the "Hilsa" production. //////Visiting US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson urged India yesterday to quickly implement a landmark civilian nuclear energy deal with the United States.//////The main Hindu nationalist party was yesterday poised to take power in southern India for the first time after ending a political feud that had brought down the government in Karnataka state. //////Benazir Bhutto visited a family whose son was killed in the October 18 suicide blasts, as the former Pakistan premier Sunday kept up a tightly secured trip to her ancestral home. //////Five villagers have been shot dead by suspected Maoists in eastern India, a day after the left-wing rebels killed 18 people, including a former minister's son, in an ambush, police said yesterday. //////Pakistani politicians and officials have distanced themselves from the Sep 10 deportation of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on his return home, saying they were not responsible for the action.//////Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan on Sunday insisted Turkey was keeping open the option of military action against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and called for greater international support. //////Thousands of people called for a swift end to the war in Iraq as they marched through downtown on Saturday, chanting and carrying signs that read: "Wall Street Gets Rich, Iraqis and GIs Die" or "Drop Tuition Not Bombs." //////Israel will not begin cutting fuel supplies to the Gaza Strip until later this week at the earliest, officials said, delaying an earlier threat to start from Sunday. //////US forces will turn over security to Iraqi authorities in the southern Shia province of Karbala on Monday, the American commander for the area said, despite fighting between rival militia factions that has killed dozens.//////A US scientist is leading an international team of researchers using an army of blood-sucking mosquitoes to produce a potentially potent vaccine against malaria. //////The Minorities Commission feels that Godhra aftermath has left "too deep a wound" in Gujarat and healing it has to be "visible" in view of the scars left by the communal violence.//////Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the other half of the power couple credited with Argentina's rebound from an economic collapse, overshadowed 13 rivals as voting opened Sunday in Argentina's presidential elections. //////Three persons were killed in a bomb blast in Nandigram on Sunday, when a bandh was being observed in the area at the call of the organisation opposing land acquisition for industries. //////Negotiators working to end four years of violence in the western Sudanese region of Darfur ploughed on Sunday despite predictions of failure by host Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. //////Heavy clashes broke out in Mogadishu yesterday, prompting some residents to stage an angry protest against Ethiopian troops and others to flee as the Somali capital sank further into violence. //////Thousands of poor farmers, landless workers and indigenous people reached the Indian capital yesterday after a month-long protest march to highlight the plight of those marginalised by India's economic boom. //////Troops backed by gunship helicopters killed 10 militants loyal to a radical pro-Taliban cleric yesterday in northwest Pakistan in the third straight day of clashes, officials said. //////Chief UN nuclear watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei said yesterday he had no evidence that Iran is actively building nuclear weapons, despite recent bellicose rhetoric from US leaders. //////King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is to travel to Britain today at the start of a four-nation European tour, the royal court announced yesterday. //////A nonpareil exhibition by six major local artists is currently on at Gallery Chitrak.
