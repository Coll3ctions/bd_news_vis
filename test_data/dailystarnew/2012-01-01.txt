Some years leave a deep imprint on the future for the better. This one was certainly not one of them. The best that can be said about it is that it was a mixed bag of bold initiatives and miserable failures. This being the third of a five year term, it was the Awami League government's last opportunity to undertake important but unpopular reforms. For the remaining two years the ruling party is likely to be in the 're-election' mode and therefore more prone to populist and costly decisions. //////Bangladesh Railway yesterday unveiled a two-and-a-half-year roadmap to implement 67 projects to develop the long-neglected railway sector. //////The government yesterday increased fares of intercity buses by Tk 0.15 per kilometre less than 48 hours after increasing fuel prices.

As we welcome the advent of the year 2012, it is poignant hope and profound expectations which today form the core of thoughts among individuals across the globe. For us in Bangladesh, the hope is simply one of life taking a more progressive turn through a turning away from everything negative that held us back in the year just ended. //////The government has once again raised the price of fuel, and once again by Tk5 across the board for all types. This is the sixth time in case of furnace oil and four times in case of petrol, octane, diesel and kerosene, that prices have been raised in one year. The increase has come only after 48 days of the last hike. This is a record of sorts admittedly, but more importantly the spate of increases exposes the state of desperation of the government, for which it is in a large measure to blame. //////The Tigers got three chances to turn around their Test fortunes, but failure to save all three meant that they had a 0-4 record in five games this year, prompting awkward questions rearing their ugly head.//////Zahid Hasan Emily, Zahid Hossain and Mithun Chowdhury will have to sit out for at least the opening matches of their respective teams in the Grameenphone Federation Cup as the National team Management Committee decided not to waiver their suspension due to indiscipline which had been imposed on them last year. Emily and Mithun's current club Muktijoddha and Zahid Hossain's club Abahani appealed for a waiver of suspension of their players to the BFF as the Federation Cup starts tomorrow and these players are vital to their team's performance. But since the players have not yet paid the monetary fines imposed which expired in November, the NTMC meeting decided not to waiver the suspension on the players. //////Bangladesh Army beat Bangladesh Air Force by 76-37 points in the opening match of the Citycell 25th National Basketball Championship match at the Dhanmondi Indoor Basketball Gymnasium yesterday. //////Amol Roy and Biplob Ram moved into the boys' singles final of the Runner Group Victory Day Open Tennis Championship after they beat their respective opponents in the semifinals at the National Tennis Complex in Ramna yesterday. //////French Open champion Li Na has blamed her perplexing slump on her sudden celebrity status -- and her irritation at being yelled at by her husband.//////Batting great Sachin Tendulkar has termed the SCG as his 'favourite ground' outside India and hoped to continue his love affair with the stadium in the second Test against Australia, starting January 3.//////Australia's fast bowlers have the potential to be the best pace attack in the world, coach Mickey Arthur said Saturday as they prepare to take on India in the second Test.//////Ever since Sourav Ganguly hung his boots in the winter of 2008, the number six slot has got Team India in crosshairs and the problem continues with Virat Kohli failing miserably in the first Test against Australia.//////David Ferrer stunned fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal in straight sets on Friday to set up a final showdown with world number one Novak Djokovic at the 250,000-dollar three-day exhibition tournament here.//////Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher was one of three players dropped on Friday when South Africa named their squad for next month's one-day internationals against Sri Lanka.//////Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh Police emerged champions in the men's and women's senior groups respectively in the Popy Departmental Victory Day Taekwondo Competition which concluded at the Sultana Kamal Women's Sports Council Gymansium yesterday. //////Manchester United Club beat KMCC Club by 54 runs in their Beacon Group First Division Cricket League at the Shaheed Salam Stadium in Feni yesterday.

Bin Laden's body was reportedly given Muslim rites of burial and dumped into the Arabian Sea.//////James Nachtwey, an award-winning photographer for TIME who has spent years documenting the ravages of war, was awed by the destruction caused by the March 11 earthquake off the northeast coast of Japan and the cataclysmic tsunami it spawned. "The scale of this is beyond belief. It's apocalyptic," he said after visiting Japan in the quake's aftermath. Measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale, the temblor was one of the worst natural disasters in modern history, so powerful it knocked the whole planet off its axis by a foot.//////Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade-long dictatorial rule over the oil-rich North African nation of Libya came to a grisly end Oct 20, 2011, but the months preceding his death were similarly bloody. In early March, uprisings sparked by the Arab Spring unrest in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia exploded into full-fledged civil war, as barely trained militias rose up against Gaddafi's forces. Prompted by a rumored threat of genocide should Gaddafi overrun the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, the United Nations adopt a resolution in March that in essence legitimated a foreign intervention. Nato operations formally began at the start of April and steadily rolled back Gaddafi's forces. The war ended on Oct 20, after Gaddafi was seized by rebels and killed, his body placed on display in a meat locker in the port city of Misrata.//////Tunisia's president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali flees the country after 23 years in power.//////With the Mideast peace process as moribund as it has ever been, the leaders of the Palestinian Authority this year chose to appeal directly to the United Nations in their pursuit of statehood. //////Deepening the already crisis hit region, this year was a terrible drought -- the worst, by some accounts, in more than 60 years.

Thousands of people died in the Famine. //////Myanmar, which replaced a long-ruling military junta this year, freed democracy icon Aung Sung Suu Kyi and adopted a series of reformist moves to end decades of international isolation. The reformist pledge was awarded by US as its Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a landmark visit to a Myanmar.//////In a year with more than its share of protests worldwide, perhaps the most striking act of dissent took place in India, where the country's ruling coalition took flak for a host of corruption cases implicating a number of leading politicians. Anna Hazare, a 74-year-old activist with a Gandhian air, embarked on a series of hunger strikes in protest of the graft that his supporters say pervades all strata of Indian society. The anti-corruption bill, for which Hazare fasted, is still being debated in Indian parliament. //////On July 22, Norway experienced its worst single spasm of violence since World War II.

Different TV channels aired a plenitude of serials, as well as countless one-hour TV plays. Here is looking back at the past year: //////Noted classical vocalist Ila Majumdar, wife of late Barin Majumdar and mother of Bappa Majumdar, died on May 3. She died of stroke at her Maghbazar residence.//////Marking 150th birth anniversary (May 8, 2011) of Rabindranath Tagore, different organisations of Bangladesh had chalked out elaborate programmes throughout the year. Bangladesh and India had jointly organised a grand celebration on the occasion. The inaugural ceremony of a three-day programme was held on May 6 at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in Dhaka. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Vice President of India, Mohammed Hamid Ansari, graced the event as guests of honour.//////Action movie Fast Five was the most pirated film of 2011, according to file-sharing blog, Torrent Freak.//////If you ever happen to meet a North Korean government official and ask him about the size of his country and the population, do not be surprised if he gives the land area of the two Koreas combined and quotes the population that inhabits both North and South Korea. This is because he thinks that the division of the Korean peninsula into two countries is a temporary phenomenon and the two territories will return to be one country again.//////What precisely is the difference between ridiculous and ludicrous? With their inter-changeable syllables they even sound like each other. Philology is not very helpful. One word has a root, ridicule; but there is no "ludicre" in English. Why? Since language does not have a Pope whose word is law, we will never get an answer. My own view, that ridiculous is pathos and ludicrous is bathos, is probably no more than a literary conceit dredged up to justify the inexplicable.//////It's that time again: time to reflect on the year that has gone by. To hold on to the good things that life offered, to fondly remember the people we lost and take stock of missed opportunities. //////Nationalism was identified as a pillar of our nationhood because our founding fathers recognised that liberation was tied up with our struggle to establish our national identity as distinct from Pakistan. Our founders were also conscious about asserting our identity vis a vis India, our friend and neighbour, who had played such a critical role through their support of our liberation struggle. However, in the day to day affairs of nation building the issue of nationalism is more concerned with the need to recapture autonomy over our political as well as policy choices. Our founders were aware that their Pakistani rulers had surrendered autonomy over policymaking, in large measure, to international development partners on whom we had become heavily dependent for both military and economic aid. However, in a fast globalising world policy choices available to a least developed country such as Bangladesh are severely constrained. Regrettably, successive regimes in Bangladesh have made little effort to design our policies and restructure our economy so as to enhance our flexibility in coping with the challenges of globalisation. //////In 1945, a general session of the Council of All India Peasants was held in Netrokona. At that time, Netrokona town was no bigger than a bazaar. Thousands of people attended the session. A weeklong bazaar was organised on this occasion, and it created shortage of cash money. Papers signed by Comrade Moni Singh were used as currency to tackle the crisis. People had such unflinching faith in and respect for him.//////
