That the crash occurred even as the president and his team were on their way to mark the 70th anniversary of the massacre of 20,000 Polish soldiers in the Katyn forest by Soviet forces makes the tragedy doubly heart-rending. More important is the fact that the plane crash has left almost the entire Polish government bereft of its key figures. It is one of those tragic instances which, in hindsight, leave a good number of thoughts for people to mull over. Fundamental among these thoughts is whether it is wise for a large team of government figures, in any country, to travel together. The probability of disaster overtaking the entire team becomes very real. In the Polish case, a combination of weather conditions and an inability on the part of the authorities to consider the chances of a disaster has now led to unmitigated tragedy.//////Naeem Islam sizzled on a balmy night to force a six-wicket win for Rajshahi Rangers over the Cyclones of Chittagong in the opening match of the National Cricket League (NCL) T20s at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.

It is clear that the villagers did not suffer from food crisis at least. But at present, villagers are failing to meet the bare necessities of life such as food, clothing, education, medicine, housing etc. It is because the population is increasing at a higher rate than production. Besides, villagers are not getting modern technology, which they can use to increase their production. Moreover, only 28% of the rural people are literate and the number of educational institutions is inadequate. For the village people technical and vocational education is very important. Of course, it is a matter of hope for us that the literacy rate is now 65%, according to a government survey. All the mills and factories are situated in towns and as the people of the villages are moving towards towns, rural development is becoming slower. //////We appreciate the statement of the Honourable Finance Minister about the power shortage in the pre-budget meeting with the Honourable Chairmen of the Parliamentary committees recently.

'Tighten your water taps to fight the water crisis' published in your daily on Monday last (April 5). It graphically juxtaposes the fact that while the richest nation, America so jealously guards any wastage of water, we in Bangladesh, a rank poor nation do it with no qualms of conscience. What a bewildering irony! It is high time that the government enacts a water policy forthwith and puts it through urgently to prevent further wastage of this precious commodity--water. Perceptively, the brewing summer of discontent has much of its roots in water.//////According to Reuters report, published on March 31 in a local daily, scientists now have smashed sub-atomic (really small, or mathematically: smallX10 to the power minus infinity) particles of matter to re-enact the Big Bang, hopefully in a very small way!//////To apply for a job and so on, one needs academic certificates as well as photographs to be attested. Regrettably, one has to face harassment after going to a first class gazetted officer. Because most of the officers normally do not agree to attest our documents without a pre-familiarity.
