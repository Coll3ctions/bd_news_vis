Fazal initially began his career as an imam before starting to teach. In 1941 he joined Krishnanagar College as a lecturer of Bangla. In 1943 he was transferred to Chittagong College from where he retired as a professor in 1956. In 1973 he was made Vice-Chancellor of Chittagong University. In 1975 he joined the advisory council of the Government of Bangladesh as member in-charge of education and culture, but resigned on June 23 in 1977.//////Alliance Franaise de Dhaka in association with Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, High Commission of India, Dhaka organised a kathak dance recital by ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations) empanelled, accomplished French dancer Isabelle Anna at La Gallerie, Alliance Franaise de Dhaka on May 3.//////Indian National Award winning Bollywood actress Vidya Balan will now appear in a role dedicated to a social cause.

Political thinkers, who are reputed for their time and space-transcending relevance, have pointed to the inevitable insecurity and suffering consequent upon political instability. //////India and Pakistan are seldom on the same page. Partly, it is because they carry the baggage of tragic history and partly because they have no trust in each other. Above all, there is a general perception in India that since the army is a decisive factor in the affairs of Pakistan, it is not possible to foster any meaningful relationship until it becomes a democratic polity in the real sense. In fact, from the time General Mohammad Ayub Khan took over the reins of Pakistan in 1958, India has assumed that normalcy between the two countries is not achievable.//////The US Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is to visit three Asian countriesChina, India and Bangladeshfrom May 3 and is scheduled reach Bangladesh May 5.

The mangrove is a transitional territory between the freshwater rivers originating from the Ganges and the Bay of Bengal. The ecosystems of Sundarban react with the increase of salt concentrations. The environmental parameters with the direct influences on Sundarbans in terms of global climate change are sea-level rise, natural calamities like cyclones, rising temperature, salinity and drought. Salinity is more devastating than any other parameter in this territory. It is very difficult to manage salinity because of the lasting nature of its effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. //////Sylhet Division, in general, is marked for its variance in the nature, topography and geography with resource rich and spectacular sites.

As India test fires an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead keeping a close attention to China's military trend, it makes a major advance in its defense capabilities. Pakistan subsequently tested Hatf IV (Shaheen 1A) ballistic missile with a range of 2,500 to 3,000 kilometers, which would put almost all of India within reach. Shortly after that, India launched a rocket and put into orbit a microwave Radar Imaging Satellite (Risat-1). The security analysts ask if a new door opens for a new arms race in South Asia. The Agni-V missile fired by India has a range of 5,000km which would give India the capability to strike most major cities in China, Iran and South-East Asia. The word Agni comes from Sanskrit language which means 'fire,' the name given to a series of weapons India developed as part of its highly integrated guided missile upgrading project launched in 1983. V K Saraswat, the head of India's Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) which built the missile said, "I am announcing the successful launch of Agni V making history and making our country proud in the area of missile technology." He also said that India is now a "missile power." The Indian security analysts considered it as a big moment for them as they see it as a major step to India's effort to become a regional power that can counter China's influence in South Asia.//////The drama unfolding in Arab world resembles a classic tragedy. The fear part is that a bunch of weakened, nearly-failed countries in the Middle East and North Africa would be a severe strategic threat for the regional and international orders. In most cases when Arab Spring-inspired demonstrations erupted, the natural inclination of most of the regimes was to repress them with decisive force. But there were restraints. The death toll has consequently remained below the threshold that might necessitate international action, while the atrocities which include torture, mutilations and rape have been conducted in a manner that enables plausible deniability. Despite some protestations to the contrary, these atrocities are not incidental or mistakes but are an integral part of the regime's modus operandi. The international community was now better informed of the regime's actions, and it was capable of taking forceful corrective measures. While the diplomatic course has proven futile, moral and political clarity on the part of the transatlantic alliance may require some operational ambiguity.//////A report from the official Chinese news agency Xinhua in Beijing on May 2 stated that, "It is informed here Wednesday that Chen Guangcheng, a native from Yinan County of eastern China's Shandong Province, entered the US Embassy in Beijing in late April and left of his own volition after staying there for six days."//////For those who have remained focused on Bangladesh's history, particularly as it shaped up in the years after the partition of India in 1947, Justice Muhammad Ibrahim will always be a point of ready reference. It has been suggested, and not without reason, that a good deal of what came to be known as the Six Point programme of the Awami League in the mid-1960s was essentially what Ibrahim had stressed during his time in the political limelight. The judge was by no means a political figure nor did he have any pretensions to being one, but that he was deeply concerned about the future of constitutional politics in Pakistan has never been in any doubt. He was law minister in Field Marshal Ayub Khan's martial law regime, which in itself could turn into a question of why someone of Ibrahim's stature (he had been an academic and had served as vice chancellor of Dacca University) should have been part of such an extra-constitutional structure at all. The answer is simple: like so many others at the time, Justice Ibrahim believed a new, properly democratic era could indeed be inaugurated by Ayub Khan.//////Philip Hensher speaks as a young boy growing up in Bangladesh. He assumes the voice of a young Muslim boy fiercely observant of his surroundings at the onset of the birth of a new nation. //////
