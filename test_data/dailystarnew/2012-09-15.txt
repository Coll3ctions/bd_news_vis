However, not everyone can prove his/her efficiency in selecting interviews. Some translators can select interviews tactfully amidst eminent and influential authors. And Tusar Talukder is one among those translators, who has proven his capability of sorting out interviews amongst famous writers. His latest published book of translation entitled Nirbachito Nobel Bijoyeer Doshti Sakkhatkar (Selected Interviews of Ten Nobel Laureates) is an imperative collection of interviews. The collection is substantial in the sense that it juxtaposes the interviews of numerous writers who are remarkable in different genres. Tusar's selection may be personal but if we consider it from the perspective of substantiality, it is crystal clear that each and every interviewee litterateur is important. Some are important for their diction; again some are remarkable for their portrayal of stern reality in their works. Tusar has maintained compactness in translation. In addition, his facile and fat-free diction has helped him finish this project without any distortion. Therefore, eminent litterateur and storyteller Syed Manzoorul Islam has rightly said that no aspect of exaggeration is evident in his translation. Rather his language remains reader-friendly. //////Ken Follett//////Price: Tk. 700/=//////
