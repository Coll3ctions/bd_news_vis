One of course heaves a sigh of relief now that the alleged perpetrator of the crime, Porimol Joydhor, has been taken into custody. But the damage the incident has done to his victim and her family as well as to the reputation of the school itself is incalculable.

The 21-year-old athlete from Czech Republic has the most amazing tennis skills. Her unusually accurate forehands and the ability to hit the widest angels of the court remind us another Great of the bygone era, John McEnroe. Her opponent of the day, Maria Sharapova was completely confused by the long and accurate returns that the new winner inflicted on the Russian's usual long serves. Apart from a brief period at the early phase of the 2nd set, Sharapova had no answer to the relentless accuracy of the //////Dhaka University celebrated its 90th anniversary recently, which is good news. But I think Dhaka University authorities and teachers should be more concerned about publishing results in time, preventing session jam and political chaos in the campus. They should emphasize more on quality of education. As the university is an asset of the country, the government and all political parties should be concerned about its well-being. //////Domestic violence is a matter of grave concern that needs to be handled with strict law. Every day we are alarmed to hear the gruesome deeds of torture and physical abuse by the husbands on their wives. The recent story is that of Rumana. The assaulters remain frivolous about their inhuman behaviour just to satiate their perverse frustrations on thousands of unaccountable reasons or simply to show that they are IN CONTROL. Most importantly, they feel some form of satisfaction that they can get away with anything as the law enforcers can never touch them. It is indeed extremely shameful for the government and for us as well that we let these criminals go unpunished. //////Following the intense pressure from the United States and Israel, Greece has announced that they will prevent the sailing of Freedom Flotilla II. To date Israel has breached more than 69 resolutions of UN. It has more than 20,000 political prisoners, has killed more innocent civilians than any other country, has rendered more civilians handicapped. On top of that, it has continued building the Apartheid Wall, destroyed 350 mosques and churches and has got 468,831 new settlers on an occupied land.

Last year we also observed such mass killing by landslides in Chittagong. It is a common phenomenon in the hills but we have not done anything so far. The hills of Bangladesh are composed of soft earth, so when it rains for several hours landslide occurs. A TV channel has reported on 2nd July that at the bottom of 15 hills in Chittagong metropolis thousands of poor people are living with high risk of devastating landslides. Bangladesh is basically a country of plain land other than a part of Chittagong division and some areas of Sylhet division. But the weather, crop and culture are similar throughout the country. So, the government can consider erasing at least the 15 hills at Chittagong metropolis on urgent basis to save the valuable lives of poor Bangladeshis living at the bottom of those hills.//////Dhanmondi has become an area infested with educational institutions and private universities, which has not only created nuisance in the area, but also filled the hearts of the residents with terror as road rage has become a common phenomenon in the area. More and more youths are losing their lives as they indulge in this dangerous pastime. The police are at the receiving end for the failure in strict enforcement of laws to curb the menace. When you walk out of your home you will see the youths riding their bikes at least at 100- 120 km whizzing past you. You will also find some learners riding the bikes at highest speed. The police are tired of constantly devising new plans to deal with the issue as their every attempt to impart awareness among the bikers has fallen flat. Road no 4/A is a real threat to pedestrians during evening.//////Laylatul Bara'ah or Shab-e-Baraat is a very majestic night for the Muslims. Both the Arabic word 'Laylatul' and the Persian word 'Shab' mean night. And 'Barat' means freedom, relief etc. The preceding night of the 15th day of the month Shaban (a month of Islamic lunar calendar) is known as Laylatul Bara'ah or Shab-e-Barat. The almighty Allah accepts the prayers of this night. All sins are pardoned by Him this night. The month Shaban comes to us with the message of the arrival of the upcoming glorious month Ramadan. The great prophet Muhammad (pbuh) gave priority on the prayers of this night. The Muslims offer the prayers of Shab-e-Barat to be free from all sins and be graced by the Almighty. May Allah give us the opportunity to lead a pleasant life on earth and in the hereafter! //////We can just sit back and watch the mayhem going on which has erupted from the political unrest centering the caretaker government issue. People were suffering from acute shortage of electricity, gas and water; spiralling prices of essentials and criminal activities. The government, instead of solving the existing problems, added another one, which is so unjust and objectionable that the country has been jolted by the impact. People have become stupefied by the government's decision to abolish the caretaker government system. Why has the government done it, knowing very well the consequences of this wrong decision? The move is despicable; the government has disclosed how afraid it has become of losing the next general election. We urge the government to change its decision of scraping the caretaker government system and save the people from further distress.//////A senior Libyan official yesterday accused Nato of intensifying its bombing campaign and backing foreign mercenaries to lay the groundwork for an advance by rebels trying to topple Muammar Gaddafi's regime.//////South Sudan's legislative assembly has ratified the nation-in-waiting's new constitution, the information minister said yesterday, denying that it put too much power in the president's hands.//////A second Indian cabinet member resigned yesterday over allegations of corruption within government, dealing another blow to embattled Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.//////Up to 33 police and five civilians were killed in fighting after Taliban crossed over from Pakistan and attacked a remote region in eastern Afghanistan, an official said Wednesday.//////Days after Thailand voted for a new government led by the country's first woman prime minister, a determined doctor with a knack for rallying crowds is pursuing legal action to bring her down.//////The architect of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program claims North Korea paid bribes to senior Pakistani military officials in return for nuclear secrets in the 1990s, the Washington Post said Wednesday.//////The world is on course to miss United Nations hunger reduction targets set in 2000, despite successes in curbing extreme poverty, a UN report said yesterday.//////China's official media yesterday strongly denied the reports claiming former president Jiang Zemin had died after days of intense speculation about his health.//////Yemen's acting leader has put forward a new plan to end the country's political stalemate, which would keep President Ali Abdullah Saleh in power longer than outlined in earlier initiatives, an opposition source said yesterday.//////At least 10 passengers were killed and 20 injured when armed men opened fire on two buses in Pakistan's port city of Karachi, officials said.//////A young man carrying a revolver was detained yesterday while trying to move close to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during his padayatra to Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh.//////Thirty-eight people were killed and more than 30 were injured yesterday when a train slammed into a packed bus carrying a marriage party in northern India, local government officials said.//////Up to 13 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed in a Nato air strike yesterday in the eastern Afghan province of Khost, provincial police chief Mohamad Zazai said.//////UN chief Ban Ki-moon called yesterday on the Syrian regime to stop the killings in its crackdown on anti-government protests, stressing that "we cannot go on like this."//////Canada ended its combat mission in Afghanistan yesterday, closing the curtain after nine years and the death of 157 men, saying it was "extremely proud" of gains made against the Taliban.//////Nearly 70 miners were trapped underground and at least eight have died in a spate of mining accidents that have jolted China's dangerous mine industry in recent days, state media reported yesterday.//////Two prominent Kremlin critics said yesterday they had been barred from leaving Russia over a pamphlet attacking a billionaire gas trader and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

A couple of days back, another incident took place where a student of class X of Viqarunnisa Noon School and College was sexually assaulted by a teacher named Porimol Joydhor. We should take proper steps to stop this crime; otherwise it will spread like an epidemic in our society. I earnestly request the Honourable PM and the Home Minister to look into the matter and instruct the law enforcing agencies to investigate the matter immediately and give the scoundrel capital punishment.//////Our finance minister said during a post-budget press briefing that black money accounts for as much as 48 to 82 percent of the country's economy. His estimate is on a wide range because it is apparently based on the lower and upper limits of three separate studies. If we take the average then black money roughly controls 65 percent of the economy. That much of our economic activities are in the hands of people with dubious means.//////A number of dignitaries from our big neighbour are visiting Bangladesh, probably to sign a few deals, transit through Bangladesh being the prominent one. Indeed it is necessary to cultivate 'live and let live' relationship with the neighbours, it is also imperative that people's mood is assessed before concluding any deal that can fuel resentment and agitation. The nation is aware of economic advantages that we could reap when deals are signed. At the same time we are not too sure that we will not have to bear the same kind of frustration of witnessing gross violations of the agreements signed with our mighty neighbour since 1974.//////THE prime minister has unwound herself through a recent article published in some Bangla national dailies under the title "//////." This approximately translates as "merchandising for the better."
