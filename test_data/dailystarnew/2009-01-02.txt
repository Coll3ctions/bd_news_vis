She has sounded some specific positive signals. The victorious AL leader has offered the position of deputy speaker of the Jatiyo Sangsad and the chairmanship of some parliamentary standing committees to the opposition. While these are certainly signs of a fresh new beginning toward making Parliament functional, Sheikh Hasina could go a step better by proposing that the Speaker of the JS, once he or she is chosen, should resign from the political party he or she belongs to as a first, significant sign of the neutrality demanded of such a key position. Indeed, the idea was part of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party manifesto and if it is accepted by the Awami League, it will serve as a good signal to the opposition about the sincerity of the ruling party. Elevating the position of the Leader of the Opposition right after that of the Leader of the House will be another positive gesture to the opposition. //////By holding a free, fair and credible election under probing international gaze, Bangladesh has fulfilled the fundamental precondition to the functioning of a parliamentary democratic system in a decisive way. Setting aside the verdict at the polls squarely reflecting the popular will, the process through which the election was conducted and the outcome reached does stand out. Professionalism, transparency and credibility have been the hallmarks of the ninth parliamentary elections. The minor technical difficulties aside, the main election undertaking has been completed to the satisfaction of international standards. Such is the essence of the observations made by the foreign election monitoring groups at the end of their mission. Some of them have even privately confided that this was the best election they have ever observed.//////Now that we have had a few days to digest the magnitude of Monday's election result, the time has come to try to decipher what it all means for the future of the country. //////It was late British playwright Harold Pinter who said to a friend that people often speak in order to hide or avoid what they really feel or think. When people of this country spoke on December 29, 2008, they handed a landslide victory to the grand alliance. If we were paying attention, we should know. They left unsaid much more than what they have said. //////AWAMI League chief Sheikh Hasina's promise of change for a better Bangladesh has rekindled hopes among the impoverished masses, who gave her party 229 seats in the 300 member parliamenta surreal outcomewhich is comparable to the Democratic Party's control of both Houses of the US Congress and Barack Obama's winning the presidency. //////Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful, who had to leave the port city amid huge criticism in October last year, returned here yesterday with a smile on his lips.

You will get several verbose definitions, depending on the book you look up. To me, a brand means just one thing- trust. All activities done by an organisation will build up brand image, which translates to trust. Every time a customer interacts with anything related to an organisation, be it people, products or advertisements, it will create an emotional experience. And be careful, this experience will eventually translate into trust, whether the customer will trust spending their money by buying from you.//////The debut of two new issues pulled up the indices of

Thanks to the initiative of the Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training (BMET) of the Government of Bangladesh and International Organisation for Migration (IOM).//////To say that the roads are unsafe in Bangladesh would just be stating the obvious. Of course, despite all precautions accident will occur. The authorities can only try their best to minimize them.

Four men put a gun at my neck and a knife to my side and asked me to hand over everything. They said they knew that I work for the U.S. Embassy. My idea is that the muggers thought I am well paid because I work for the U.S. Embassy-Dhaka. While mugging, they grabbed my shirt's collar and hurled abusive words at me. They took away Taka 500.00 and my embassy cell phone (# 01713-062076). Then I rushed to the police station and described the incident to them. The most pathetic thing is that the police personnel suggested me not to file a case. Their suggestion was that if I filed a case then I would have to come to the police station several times; and consequently would have to be present before the court also. That means I would be facing great difficulties. After thinking all these, I did file a general diary (GD) with Pallabi Police Station on the same day. //////According to a transcript containing Iranian President's Christmas message on Britain's Channel 4 television released before the Christmas Day, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad observed that most of the world's problems stemmed from leaders who turned against religion, While offering seasonal greetings to Christians, President Ahmadinejad said If Christ were on earth today, undoubtedly he would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers, occupiers, terrorists and bullies the world over.//////The government is going to establish a public university in Rangpur.

So they try to assassinate the progressive political leaders. They are highly dogmatic and misguided. Actually, they are pursuing the mirage to materialize their plans in Bangladesh. They want to jeopardize the future of our dear motherland. //////It does not require a political genius to perceive that under consistent public and media pressure in the wake of most audacious November 26, 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack, the loud noises emanating from Indian media about the government of India being busy in serious discussions about selective strikes on Pakistan are merely not for public consumption. //////I am writing regarding The Daily Star's Victory Day supplement of 16 December 2008. One of the unique features of this year's supplement is that it contains articles by three female writers. All of them have written about their personal experiences during the War of Liberation.//////Today price spiral is becoming an unbearable burden on the common people in our country.

I was at work in my office on the second floor of the Palestine Tower in Gaza City, where I write for the local newspaper. Large explosions had been increasingly rare since Hamas and Israel struck their ceasefire pact six months ago. Still, I decided to stay put and keep writing. By the time the second bomb landed, moments later, I knew something serious was happening. The whole office broke into a panic. I ran as fast as I could, shouting to my colleagues to leave the building.//////DECEMBER 29, 2008 was a strange day. For me -- a first time voter -- it was like playing chess and making the right decision. Should it be the refreshingly novice advocate? Should the nation finally forgive the repentant general? Whether the disastrous dynasty should be given a second chance? Or should I just cast "no to all above" and vote them to oblivion? It was a day of dilemma and a day to decide.//////2009 promises to be yet another promising year for the world of Science and Technology. 2009 has already been declared the 'International year of Astronomy' and many other high tech gadgets, automobiles and electrical appliances, due to hit the markets all through the year, promises a great year ahead of us.//////Attention, Attention, Attention!!!
