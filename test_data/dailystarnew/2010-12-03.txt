It is true that the party is in disarray but it will be mistake to think that it has lost its capacity to play a major role in the future politics of Bangladesh. There is no denying that BNP is facing perhaps the most serious crisis in its short but eventful life. But it is a crisis that the party has enough internal strength and public support for it to recover from. //////The move by the Dhaka University authorities to recommend the dismissal of six teachers from service because of the latter's staying abroad and not reporting back for duty once more draws attention to an old issue. This is not for the first time that DU has spoken of action against academics who, once they go abroad, at some point decide not to return home. There have been recurrent reports down the years of many of these teachers (there are exceptions, of course) finishing their higher studies abroad and then taking up employment there. The fact that not all of them may be taking up jobs at the university level, that in fact they might be veering off into other kinds of work, is irrelevant. What matters is that by not returning to their actual places of work, in this case Dhaka University, they are certainly displaying a poor sense of responsibility to themselves and to their students.//////Mohammad Ashraful and Mahmudullah Riyad are likely to be dropped for the Tigers' second one-dayer against Zimbabwe at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium today.//////Everybody was curious to know yesterday how the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) would react to Shakib Al Hasan's post-match outburst after Wednesday's nine-run defeat to Zimbabwe.//////A third tour of Bangladesh in the space of two years has begun well for Ray Price.

Jamir Uddin Sirkar, the then Honourable Education Minister, amended the bill in the parliament in 1992. To date there are 51 private universities in our country.

Today, they have replaced unlettered and unskilled manpower of the country and become the income ladder for Bangladesh in the international job market. //////Provocation and persecution, seems to occupy the major time and effort of our two major political parties, AL and BNP; both headed by women at loggerheads with a "tit for tat" performance, based more on personal rather than political reasons. Engulfed in this environment, they do not hesitate to ignore the rule of law, whenever in opposition. Now one of the top BNP leaders, a lawyer of repute has advised and suggested to sort out all issues in street battles!//////There had been violence against women all over the world in all ages. Bangladesh is a developing country where most of the people are not educated. Moreover, political conflicts, ideological conflicts, poverty, etc. are some of the reasons behind this. Every day we find the sad and shameful news of violence against women in the newspapers. Acid throwing, domestic violence, rape and sexual abuse, abduction, etc., are very common incidents. Violence against women has become a never-ending issue. It is our responsibility to make people aware about this social evil.//////The recent visit by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in Muslim costume to Sheikh Zayed grand mosque in Abu Dhabi has added a new dimension to multi-faith dialogue and religious tolerance.

We are keen to know the fact behind the razing of the trees. If the university authorities act like this, what would others do? //////I am a student of The Aga Khan School, Dhaka, studying in grade-6 and I just want to ask- can't life be fresh and beautiful with clean air? Carbon-dioxide, nitrogen, methane and a lot of harmful gases are in the air. The cars, buses and taxis are using petrol and other harmful gases polluting the air. People are smoking everywhere. We have to breathe this polluted air!//////Is Gulshan / Banani a piece of Europe/USA in Dhaka? A handful of people are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer day by day.

I do not want to argue with these intellectuals on either the scientific compatibility of the Qur'an or the fallacy of evolution. Instead, I wish to take a different approach. If they are not concerned about religion, why are they the first ones to talk about it and spend time on it? Sometimes, it seems like they need people to agree with them so that they feel a little less guilty (and more confident) about their assertions. There is so much hostility in their remarks directed to the Muslims. Their remarks are just creating greater division among people.//////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.

No society has more firmly insisted on the admissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of other states, or more passionately asserted that its own values were universally applicable. That was precisely the foreign policy trend of the US in the twentieth century. //////The issue of transit has been given special emphasis in the joint communiqu signed by the premiers of India and Bangladesh in January.
