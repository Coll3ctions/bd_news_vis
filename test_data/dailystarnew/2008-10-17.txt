They demonstrate in front of the main bourse of Dhaka share market to register their protest over fall of share prices of different companies in which they invested. They brand the price fall of shares as a conspiracy being engineered by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) which regulates the market. The claim of small shareholders cannot be dismissed outright. When share prices rise once in a blue moon to the great advantage of small holders and continues for two-three days, the SEC becomes busy to correct the market by a mechanism not known to the common shareholders. But the SEC is not at all concerned when share prices fall which is evident from their activities. At the time of fall, they only issue a press note that there is nothing to worry about, the market will rise automatically. But their premise is not at all correct. The small investors want the SEC to correct the bearish market once it goes down and lift it up for the small shareholders. In this case also, the SEC can use the mechanism the way they use it to correct the bullish market. When prices of every item go up, right from green chilly to automobiles, then why share prices of different companies will not rise? Small investors invested in the share market to make some profit from buying and selling process of different shares. They do not have enough money to start large-scale business in other sectors which requires a lot of money. And that is why they entered the share market as a last resort to do clean business investing whatever capital is left with them. //////Results of HSC exams this year were published on September 10, 2008.
