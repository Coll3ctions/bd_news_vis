It is a historic visit and has all the potentials of becoming a major turning point in the bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India with wider implications for the region. For us there is every reason to look expectantly to the visit, and to what it might deliver for Bangladesh.//////THE Gaddafi era is over. The bigger truth is that the National Transitional Council is yet to be in full control of the country. With battles still being fought, especially around places like Gaddafi's birthplace Sirte and the town of Bani Walid, one is not sure if there will be a peaceful end to the struggle for power soon. The deposed Libyan leader has not been making things any easier by urging his loyalists to keep up their struggle against people he derisively refers to as rats. And the latest decision by the NTC to hold back on moving its interim government to Tripoli for a week only confirms the continued volatility of the situation.//////The wait is over but the excitement prevails across the country as magical striker and two-time FIFA world-player-of-the-year Lionel Messi and his Argentina football team land at the Hazrat Shahjajal International Airport this morning for their Tuesday's international friendly against Nigeria.//////When Kolkata set up a unique instance by selecting under-privileged children as mascots for the Argentina and Venezuela international friendly last Friday, Bangladesh Football Federation is all set to ruin an opportunity that could have been an inspiration for the budding footballers.//////Keeping the Argentina-Nigeria international friendly on Tuesday in mind, the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is going to stage a dress-rehearsal through today's open practice session of Argentina at the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS).//////Football, the beautiful game as is lovingly called around the global game is probably the game that most people can associate themselves with.

We have so much to learn, receive, exchange and share with India. This visit can usher in a big change in our economic and neighbourly relations, and pragmatic steps can follow, if we are sincere on both sides. Let this be a visit of developing more meaningful economic relations. If economy is in the right footing, all other areas will follow suit automatically, including trust. As a huge economy, and a strong country in many ways, and since we have good relations, we can really benefit in a massive manner. Areas we can take into account could include the following: //////The recent arrest of eight police personnel in Rajshahi paints the worst possible picture of the police. Not that all are bad, but this glaring event has put police corruption and misdeeds in the limelight. Let them be aware, and take strong corrective actions, so that they may become 'protectors,' not 'patrons of crime'. That would be a nightmare. But given the rising trend of lawlessness, this seems to be 'what is going on', in most places!//////We were surprised when we suffered load-shedding the day after Eid. We faced load shedding six times that day. The next day we could not sleep from midnight because of frequent load-shedding. And in the morning it was the worst. The electricity was gone for five hours, from 6 am to 11am. We never had such experience during Eid vacation before. This means we can never get relief from load-shedding for a single day. We hope the authorities would look into the matter.//////On September 2, I read a news item in the daily Arab News entitled Qaddafi wants Libya engulfed in flames. It appears from above news heading that he has no feeling for his own country and countrymen. In fact, he ruled his country for long 42 years as a stranger! If it was not true then how could he expect his own country to be engulfed in flames? We have witnessed enough of his charisma. Now he should quit. Thousands of innocent Libyans have been killed due to Qaddafi's whimsical decisions and autocratic attitude. Let the common Libyans design their own democratic institution for forming a fresh government of the people, for the people and by the people. Let peace and good governance be established in Libya.//////We all know 'health is wealth,' but in our country the proverb gets more accurate when I say wealth is health. Well, that is the motto of most of the shopkeepers. According to a report by The Daily Star, 90% food items contain adulterants. As a citizen I have the right to have fresh food but who cares? Chocolate, kids' favourite, is also not free from textile dyes. We don't even get fresh vegetables to eat which is very important for our health. We, the kids, the future leaders of Bangladesh, are hugely affected by food adulteration and so I think the government should take strong initiatives if they don't want the next generation to be a burden on the country! I urge all my fellow brothers and sisters, please plant vegetables on your rooftop because this is the best way to avoid adulterants.//////When people were feeling a bit consoled by the Awami League lawmakers' coming down heavily on the ministers who were responsible for the immense sufferings of the people, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ruined all those by asking them not to play into the hands of the enemies by pointing out a few failures of the government and concealing the success. We were deeply shocked at what she said. When the government portrays the opposition as enemy, the country is in real trouble.//////A few days earlier BNP leader Moudud Ahmed, in a talk show, compared Bangabandhu with Ziaur Rahman giving Bangabandhu's position before Zia. And the acting Secretary General of the BNP expressed his party position saying that Joj Miah was the mastermind behind 21st August grenade attack. The final probe report, based on confessional statements, has revealed the truth. But the BNP could not even maintain silence.//////Every day we get news of horrific road accidents from the print and electronic media. Many valuable lives are being lost in these road accidents. Actually, the highways have become the death traps in our country. Reckless driving, overtaking tendency, overloading, defective vehicles and dilapidated roads are mainly responsible for this. We all should raise our voice against this. The government should take pragmatic and effective measures to curb road accidents. Traffic police as well as highway police can play a pivotal role here. People should not travel on the roof of the vehicles and they should not encourage the drivers to overtake other vehicles on the highway.//////In education, both the teacher and the taught feel that imparting of too much information and doing a lot of things determine the quality of education. Most students in Bangladesh write pages and pages of answers, containing just a mere reproduction of class notes or notes from guides without any kind of analysis, synthesis, knowledge integration and application to practical situations. Our governance is ridden with heaps and heaps of paperwork, endless meetings and unimaginable formalities seldom found in progressive countries.//////Like the farmer in the Aesop's fable, the government has become very greedy and so has decided to kill the goose, the country, to obtain all the eggs at a time. The decision to give India tax free transit facilities, the white elephant of $1billion high interest loan to facilitate transit facility for India, keeping mum about India's continuous withdrawal of water from rivers flowing into Bangladesh and her atrocities across the border and maritime boundaries, and law enforcer's law of jungles, country's body covered with sores in the form of broken roads and highways- are squeezing the last breath from our beloved country. But I think the conscious and brave people of this country who fought so valiantly against the Pakistani atrocities in 1971 will hold the killer hand before it slits the country dead. I urge the government to learn from history that if one kills the principles, principles will ultimately kill him. Will you still kill the goose, our production capacity? Will you not come to sense? //////The August 21 grenade attack shocked the whole nation. Seven years have passed since then. But the progress, to establish justice, is going on at a snail's pace. The then government tried to stage a puppet show using Joj Miah who hardly had any involvement in that gruesome attack. The persons responsible for the crime had been behind the scene for a long time. Just days ago fresh charges have been filed to ensure arresting the conspirators. 24 people were dead and hundreds were maimed in that attack. The traumatised people may get a little consolation and the departed souls may rest in peace if the culprits get the punishment they deserve.//////A typhoon that pummelled western Japan left at least 20 people dead and more than 50 missing, reports said yesterday, after swollen rivers swept away buildings and landslides crushed houses.//////Washington has launched an effort to avoid a clash stemming from plans by Palestinians to seek recognition as a state at the United Nations, The New York Times reported on Saturday, citing senior US officials and foreign diplomats.//////Tiny clots in the brain may be the cause of some signs of old age such as stooped posture and restricted movement, say US scientists.//////Japan's new prime minister Yoshihiko Noda and his cabinet yesterday won solid backing in opinion polls, with respondents expressing confidence in his ability to lead the post-quake recovery.//////Turkey said yesterday that it will challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).//////Hundreds of thousands marched Saturday for lower living costs in the largest such rally in Israel's history, bolstering a social change movement and mounting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take on economic reform.//////In the Ukraine house where she grew up, Oksana Balinskaya's hazel eyes transfixed on television images of Muammar Gaddafi.//////About 1,000 chanting pro-independence activists took to the streets of Taipei yesterday, accusing Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou of surrendering the island's sovereignty to China.//////At least 20 people died in violence across Syria yesterday, activists and state media said, as the visiting Red Cross chief sought access to those detained in five months of anti-regime protests.//////Sudan on Satuday shut down all the offices of the country's largest opposition party, the SPLM-North, charging that it was not a legally represented political party, two of its members said.//////Dominique Strauss-Kahn returned to Paris yesterday for the first time since a New York hotel maid accused him of attempted rape in a sensational sex scandal that scuppered his hopes for the French presidency.//////Police clashed with English Defence League (EDL) members and arrested sixty of its in east London yesterday.//////Iran said its troops killed or wounded 30 Kurdish rebels in a fresh assault on the mountainous border with Iraq where witnesses reported fierce fighting and shelling on Saturday.//////Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in the southern US state of Louisiana yesterday, bringing with it torrential rains threatening floods in parts of the country, US government forecasters said.//////All 21 people aboard the Chilean air force plane that crashed into the Pacific on its way to a remote archipelago died instantaneously, the defence minister said Saturday.//////Nepal's new Maoist prime minister yesterday swore in 13 ministers, including seven from outside his party, as he tried to form a stable coalition government after years of political crisis.//////A suicide car bomber killed three Yemeni soldiers in an attack on an army post at the gates of the southern city of Aden on Saturday, a military official told AFP.//////The popularity of India's embattled Congress-led government, buffeted by corruption, high inflation and slowing economic growth, has fallen sharply among voters, a new poll said Saturday.//////A leaked US diplomatic cable says that "hundreds" of former employees of Blackwater, which was barred from Iraq over a deadly 2007 shooting, later worked with other firms guarding US diplomats here.//////Chanting to cure snakebites, claiming to be a reincarnated spouse to obtain sex, and charging for miracles could soon be banned by an Indian state seeking to stop charlatans preying on the vulnerable.//////Four Turkish engineers kidnapped by Afghanistan's Taliban more than eight months ago were freed overnight after intervention by tribal elders.//////Cuban Defence Minister General Julio Casas Regueiro, the right-hand man of President Raul Castro, died of a heart attack in Havana on Saturday, state media reported.

Other Indian Prime Ministers have since visited Dhaka but not for a bilateral summit. Over these years, Indo-Bangladesh relations have been caught in a time warp set sometime in the 1970s if not further back. This relationship needs to finally come of age by moving its discourse into the 21st century. Diplomacy embedded in the past means we are solving problems which were put on the table 40 years ago. Hopefully, the imminent summit between Prime Ministers Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh promises to move this relationship forward and in the process, resolve a number of outstanding problems which have constrained Indo-Bangladesh relations over these many years. //////THE growing bilateral trade deficit with India has risen from $774 million in FY 2000, to $1,933 million in FY 2005, and $2,910 million in FY 2010. Bilateral trade also takes place through informal trade between the two countries. As a consequence, the actual deficit (formal plus informal) would be significantly higher, notwithstanding the fact that, with tariffs coming down, informal bilateral trade has perhaps been on the decline in recent years. //////AN entente between India and Bangladesh on transit will encourage further cooperation on trade and transport, energy, environmental protection, development of infrastructure, and regional security and strategic issues.
