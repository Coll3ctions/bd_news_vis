Dhaka, once the hub of dream and optimism has descended into a nightmarish metropolis. //////Anew face of politics emerged in Bangladesh at Narayanganj in its epoch-making city election. The Narayanganj City Corporation election has shown to the world that the people of Bangladesh can defy dirty confrontational party politics and vote in a calm, clean and peaceful way, regardless of political intimidation, for the honest candidate and individual they trust -- whether it is man or a woman. The people of Narayanganj have done a wonderful job and deserve congratulations from the rest of the people of the country.

They have also shown that money has no place in elections and it is the people who decide.//////The Arab Spring winds of change face obstacles. History is testament to the fact that many revolutions that overthrew the then-existing ruling class ultimately failed to bring about governments of the people.

Toppling a tyrant is not the end of a struggle: it is just the beginning of another more enduring pursuit to establish good governance and a progressive society.//////It is now well recognised that impacts of climate change will have significant economic costs on the affected countries. Cost of inaction will also be enormous compared to the cost of mitigation and adaptation. Though there is controversy about the cost estimates due to the uncertainty on the magnitude of the problem, most studies indicate that the economic cost of climate change is very high. According to the famous Stern Review prepared by Sir Nicholas Stern on the The Economic Cost of Climate Change published in 2006, the cost of inaction is 5 percent of global GDP each year and the upper case estimate is 20 percent of GDP or even more. Poor countries will face in excess of 10 percent of GDP with 5-6C warming by the end of the century. On the other hand, William Nordhaus has estimated that due to 3C increase in temperature and precipitation there will be a cost equivalent to 3 percent of global GDP. //////Talking about faeces or latrine is neither romantic nor attractive for both politicians and media. But it is a reality in South Asia where more than one billion people simply don't have toilet to perform their natural functions. Many men, women and children still defecate in open places which are highly undignified. They are exposed to severe health risks, violence and adding to environmental pollution. Majority of schools in all the countries of South Asia don't have adequate toilets and hand washing facilities for students, hence a chance to change behaviour in next generation is missing out.//////At long last the ultimate accolade in literature-- the 10 million kronor award.

The award, however, is not past criticism, for highly acclaimed writers like Leo Tolstoy, Marcel Proust, James Joyce and Graham Greene were not found suitable for it. //////The plane would take off at 10 a.m. so we hurried for the airport right after breakfast. The others were still arriving. Everyone was wearing dark clothes to match with the flora. Minu and Shimul were chirpy. So were the others. As soon as Milon ////// called us to board the plane, the entire group of twenty began their exciting journey to the Sundarbans. //////She lies in her mother's arms wearing nothing but a pair of tan trousers. Her stomach rises and falls as her flesh expands and contracts with each gasp of life. A golden-brown child with a blue oxygen mask held over her mouth and nose. I sit in a corner with my elbows resting on my knees, hands clasped together in contemplation and eyebrows heavy with sleep. My mother sits next to me in a purple salwar kameez with light red marks around her neck and eyes. She says they burn. We are hypnotised by the baby's struggle to live. Her mother helplessly cradles the child while sitting in a plastic chair next to a black and white oxygen tank. She is not much older than I am. Her head and body are covered in a deep purple hijab. Her baby may not live. //////An event without a masquerade//////An episode without fraud//////A faith without surprise costs//////A deal without inducement//////An encounter without malice//////Praise without a purpose//////A campaign without deceit//////A promise without a shelf life//////An embrace without a camera pan//////A palm without a grab//////A zone without friction//////A breeze without the drift of the forgotten litter//////A land without greedy weeds//////A fragrance beyond the floral//////Spirits defying frames//////Spontaneity minus drafts//////Drafts without edit//////Ink without fowl spotting//////A conviction without dictation//////A history without complicity//////A pace without fear//////A vision without a tint//////A path with a promise//////A journey beyond a doubt//////A swim without delusion//////A charter without compromise//////A sea sans the famished waves//////A shore without betrayal//////A justice above prescription//////A defense without a plea//////Surrender without a bargain//////A howl for the truth//////A claim to the evident//////An aid without an agenda//////A dialogue without hesitation//////An election without a stage//////Votes freed from fear//////A victory crushing facades//////A border without a threat//////A Desh without squander//////A leader beyond bias//////A nation without a lie//////An end without an ouster?//////When twenty years old housewife Jamila went into labour, her mother-in-law decided the most common mode of delivery in Bangladesh  home delivery. Her family members called a local Dai (traditional birth attendant) to deliver the second baby of Jamila.

In spite of economic trouble, South Asia has significant potentialities for overall development. //////A stable and democratic Middle East is essentially vital component for global peace. The Arab spring has brought a historic moment of democratising this conflict-ridden region of the world. With the fall of the dictators previously suppressed Islamist parties are emerging in power. Question remains whether continuation of US policy of double standard in the region would destroy the fruits of democratisation and pave the door for emergence of radical forces in the region making the Middle East more unstable in the coming decade.//////In September, Anwar al-Awlaki, the alleged Osama bin Laden of the Internet, was killed by an American drone after he stepped out of his truck in the remote interior of Yemen. Last week, another American drone killed the brother of a top Pakistani Taleban commander and three other aides.//////Old values are what Syed Moqsud Ali speaks of in this narrative of what has been a fruitful life. In a work that encompasses an entirety of a family tale, the writer in essence brings forth all the traditions, as it were, that once were an underpinning of life in this country. These are the writer's memoirs and yet they could be interpreted as expressions of the sentiments that have bound Bengali families and clans together for ages. All history begins with the personal before broadening out to a wider swath of experience. And that is the point which Ali makes at the beginning of his narrative. He goes out in search of his roots and comes away from the density of tradition enriched in terms of his discovery. It is discovery that most, if not all, of us can relate to. There is that identification not just with class but with the accompaniments of aspirations which come with it as well.//////Nineteen Minutes is an overwhelming book. Although based on real-life incidents, the story takes off on its own course, the less-travelled one. Jodi Picoult (who never disappoints us), uses a school shooting as the plot for her book, and presents a whole new perspectivewith her usual pathos and poignancy.//////Aravind Adiga won the Man Booker Prize for his first novel, ////// (2008), a dark underbelly account of a master/servant relationship that, through violence, reverses the previous class order while simultaneously questioning centuries old beliefs and practices in his native India. A year later, Adiga published an equally dark comedy, also probing traditional roles of caste and culture. More a collection of linked short stories, ////// (2009), for me, was the stronger book. The prolific Adiga has now written a second novel, //////, returning to the same themes by ratcheting up the question that greed plays in destroying decades-old friendships while probing the place of violence in destroying those relationships once assumed to be sacrosanct.//////The shortlist for the second annual DSC Prize for South Asian Literature was announced at a prestigious gala event at London's Globe Theatre recently. Long-listed authors, publishers, London's literati, ambassadors from the South Asian region gathered together for the event, which was also the finale of the 2011 DSC South Asian Literature Festival in London.
