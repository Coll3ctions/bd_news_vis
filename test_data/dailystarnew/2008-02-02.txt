And 13 other doctors are posted in various other prisons across the country.//////With top criminals holed up in their hideouts, some believed to have fled to neghbouring India, petty criminal elements in certain localities are busying themselves with extortionist forays. They take the names of known criminals like Subrata Bain, Khandaker Tanveer Islam Joy and Shahadat Hossain who are absconding and throw their weight around. Over phone, they do such things, demanding money from businessmen, landlords and house owners threatening dire consequences if they failed to pay.

In some extortionist forays the thugs even shot persons who refused to pay leaving them injured, or even dead. //////The Constitution gives special emphasis on local government and the need to entrust its bodies with necessary support so that they can perform efficiently in their expected functions. Article 59 in particular highlights the role of such bodies in the preparation and implementation of plans relating to public services and economic development. Article 60 also stresses on the need for local government bodies to have the power to impose taxes for local purposes, to prepare their budgets and to maintain funds.//////Democracy is the same all over the world. What it means is that people rule through their representatives whom they elect freely and periodically. Pakistan is no different. Abraham Lincoln has defined democracy as a government of the people, by the people and for the people. The words "of the people" are the most important because they indicate that power resides with the people. They are sovereign and everything flows from them. When President Pervez Musharraf tells Europe that their kind of democracy is different and far advanced than that in Pakistan, he talks about the system where the military enjoys a pre-eminent position. It is not that the Pakistanis are lesser people. It is that they have been denied the right to rule themselves. Europe has a long history of democracy except the countries which were satellites of the Soviet Union during the cold war. The successive army chiefs in Pakistan nipped democracy in the bud. Why should Mushrraf say that Pakistan was not yet ready for a full-fledged democracy when he himself came through an army coup? The system was never allowed to operate in Pakistan. //////In view of the timely statement by Prof Kazi Zaker Hussain -- one of the veteran most zoologists and wildlife biologists of the country -- and Prof. Mohammad Anwarul Islam on the afforestation policy of the Bangladesh Forest Department I emphasize that government should immediately create a separate Wildlife Department/Authority/Bureau with the same status of the existing Environment and Forest departments of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF).//////There is apparently no great talent outside the national team for one to consider a change.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club did not falter like their fellow title contenders when the event hosts cruised to a 2-0 win over Youngmen's Club Fakirerpool in yesterday's Protiti Pharma Victory Day Club Cup football tournament.//////Australia crushed a lamentable Twenty20 world champions India by nine wickets in front of a huge crowd in the Twenty20 international here on Friday.//////Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik abruptly left a press conference after being bombarded with questions about fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar's sudden appearance in the national team's practice session at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore yesterday ahead of today's fifth and final one-day match against Zimbabwe.//////The three-day players' transfer for Premier Division Cricket League will start tomorrow but it is not still sure whether all the national pool players would get clubs before the bourse.//////The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) yesterday named a 20-member squad for the Bangladesh team which will play West Bengal in next months' 2nd Indo-Bangladesh Bangla Games in Dhaka.//////Some lusty late-order hitting by Jerome Taylor propelled West Indies to a formidable 263-9 in 50 overs in the fourth one-day international at Kingsmead in Durban last night.//////Barcelona reached the semifinals of the King's Cup on Thursday after a Thierry Henry header earned them a 1-0 aggregate victory over 10-man Villarreal at the Nou Camp.//////David Beckham was left out of Fabio Capello's first England squad on Thursday but reassured that he could still win the 100th cap he craves.//////Ronald Koeman and Frank Rijkaard were both hugely successful players with the Netherlands and Barcelona but the Dutch coaching duo are experiencing difficult times as they struggle to match the high expectations at Valencia and Barcelona respectively. //////With Cristiano Ronaldo in rampant mood, Manchester United's drive to retain the Premier League title is beginning to look as unstoppable as their Portuguese winger. //////European champions AC Milan will tackle Fiorentina on Sunday in a match which could have major ramifications in the race for a Champions league place. //////Chelsea striker Didier Drogba would still like to leave the English Premiership side to join Spanish giants Real Madrid next season, sports daily Marca reported Friday. //////Liverpool insisted Thursday they had yet to clinch a permanent deal for Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano. //////Michael Ballack has denied claims he cannot play in the same Chelsea team as Frank Lampard as the England midfielder readies his comeback for the weekend trip to Portsmouth. //////After the U-turn departure on Thursday of Brazilian defender Gilberto, Hertha Berlin have swooped for Czech Republic international Rudolf Skacel in a loan deal until the end of the season. //////Coach Luis Aragones named a 22-man squad on Friday for Spain's friendly against World Cup finalists France next week.//////The 2004 champions Tunisia and Angola sealed the last two quarterfinal places at the African Nations Cup on Thursday. //////The eight-day Grameenphone International Junior (under-18) tennis tournament starts at Rajshahi Zafar Imam Tennis Complex on Sunday.//////Sri Lanka's new cricket chief and former captain Arjuna Ranatunga has revealed his board has no money left and is banking on financial support from India to stay afloat.//////Australia and India will continue their recent bitter rivalry when the one-day triangular cricket series also involving Sri Lanka begins at the Gabba here Sunday.//////Ian Bell has emerged as a candidate to captain England during the one-dayers against New Zealand if Paul Collingwood suffers any injury problems.

They are quantity, quality, time, cost and organisation. A project's procurement activities start with examination of quantitative adequacy of raw material supply. Processing plants operating at less than planned capacity are all too common and costly in most developing countries. This is mainly due to inadequate analysis of raw material available to the processing plant. The quality of the raw material must satisfy standards of acceptability in the consumer market. Main factors considered affecting the quality of raw material are inputs, handling and transport, and storage. If the input affects product characteristics the quality will not be up to the standard. Handling and transport of the product can also affect its quality significantly. Poor storage facilities can be responsible for a sizeable portion of losses. //////Avian influenza or the bird flu was first suspected among poultry birds in Biman Bangladesh's poultry farm at Savar .

As a result in both the countries there is greater appreciation of each other's perceptions and actions at all levels.//////Bhutto's assassination on December 27, 2008, an act of cowardice perpetrated by Jihadists in the name of Islam, has again catapulted into focus the disfigurement of Islam and the misinterpretation of Jihad.//////Naxalism is a grave problem in Bihar. According to a March 2007 document of the Bihar Police, 30 of its 38 districts have been affected by Maoist activities. Maoist violence is endemic across the state's territory.//////Kabul The commander of the NATO force in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Gen. Dan McNeill, said at the weekend he was optimistic about stronger cooperation between Kabul and Islamabad in the fight against extremism.//////Taipei The timing could not have been worse for U.S. supporters of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.

The loss of heritage, the disappearance of land that was home is a theme that recurs in this work of intense devotion. But, then, Drong is not alone in the way he feels. Anyone who has watched the gradual assaults that have been made on the way, or ways, of life that Bangladesh's indigenous people or adivasis have suffered through since the British colonial period will empathise with him. His is not a partisan view of conditions. That he belongs to one of the tribes which have found Bangladesh to be home for long generations is a truth that does not mar the quality of the essays he presents in this work. There is, of course, anger in him as he narrates the tale of the tribal girl from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a young woman forced by poverty to take the road to the city. It is in the putatively secure confines of domestic employment in that urban centre that her virginity is taken from her.//////A mother's love can move mountains. The wonderful tales in Chicken Soup for the Mother's Soul hold this truth for every reader. They are all about how a mother's love can create miracles. The tales are life experiences told with wit and compassion that touch the soul. The stories have the power to bring tears and smiles to readers. The characters are so vivid that they seem to live and breathe with the reader long after a story is read. The writers with their skills make us feel distinct yearnings for the characters. The stories offer the readers a rare combination of intimacy and transcendence. The book holds 101 stories, each a treasure mountain, waiting to be read and discovered. The stories open with beautiful sayings that throw light on their themes. They open the hearts and rekindle the spirit in mothers.//////It is these days quite fashionable to consider oneself politically correct. Look around you. You don't have Red Indians any more, only Native Americans. Though you might consider Barack Obama as a black candidate for the American presidency, you must be extra careful in avoiding using the old, denigrating 'Negro' while describing him or any of his kind. It is African-Americans that you have today. On a lighter level, do you realise that there are no housewives any more today? There are only homemakers, whatever that means. It tends to remind you of a rather pernicious term, home-wreckers, one that you associate with men and women who have nothing better to do than making a mess of other people's lives by falling in love, or lust, with other people's spouses. And then there is the way you describe a child whose intelligence is obviously of a poor quality. But, no, you cannot suggest by any means that he is unintelligent. He is merely one who has an attention deficit disorder.//////Love is a symbol of truth and beauty and gives us insights into divine and spiritual life. Without love and affection, it is rather difficult to think about the existence of the soul in the body. Loving humankind and feeling empathy, delight and liberty are the four aspects of true love. Love is tranquil, quiet, honest, virtuous and based on conviction, esteem, confidence, support and truth. It does not have any room for jealousy, distrust, conceit, snobbery and unfairness. Love excuses all. Love happens when a wish is developed from an attraction, which leads to submission and then urges one to take the path to commitment. A deep attachment is felt for the person we love; we feel sensitive and are mesmerised by our love and thus seek devotion and regard. Love brings people together, as opposed to hate which separates people from one another. Love is refined and if allowed to flow naturally will smoothen the trail chosen after birth. Love makes life healthier and fuller. These constitute the essence of Mahadev Saha's poetry. Mahadev Saha is one of the leading romantic poets in our Bengali literary world. He is a poet of silence and mystery. Since the inception of his poetry, he has carefully kept himself removed from any disquiet and unsteadiness. //////A book that created quite a few waves when it first appeared, it remains a reader's delight. Frank brings new insights to bear on her telling of the tale of a woman who continues to exercise political imaginations not only in India but elsewhere in the world. It has been dogged by controversy, which makes its appeal that much better.//////
