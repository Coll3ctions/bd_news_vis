On the face of it, it was garments workers who seemed to be protesting against the new wage structure announced earlier. However, the rampage into which the protest degenerated showed clearly that the protests were anything but grievance-centred. The mayhem that was conducted in Gulshan and Banani was clearly aimed at causing maximum damage. It is something that is unacceptable and reprehensible. What is equally outrageous is that the police were nowhere to be seen during the first outbreak of violence. And when they did appear on the scene it was with belated action that really was ineffectual.//////The police force deserves accolade for being consistent in hunting down militant groups that are out to create anarchy in the country. In the recent past, a large number of militants have been apprehended by the police and Rab to keep the groups under pressure and on the run. On Friday, a contingent of metropolitan police unearthed yet another secret hideout of the militants in city's Mirpur area and seized firearms of various description including live ammunition, grenade cases and splinters, 35 books on jihad as well as 35kg of explosive-making powder. //////Bangladeshi golfer Siddikur Rahman is on the verge of a unique feat as he maintained the third-round lead at the Brunei Open in Bandar Seri Begawan yesterday. //////Fourteen-year-old Belal walks all the way from Asad Gate to practice cricket on weekends at the Abahani ground.

The euro hit an 11-week high against a broadly weak dollar on Thursday as month-end demand for the single currency helped push it beyond a key barrier.Market participants said some Asian central banks were buying the euro, helping to push the dollar to a three-month low versus a currency basket. Data showing a slide in Germany's unemployment rate to 7.6 percent in July, adding to other recent upbeat data on Europe's biggest economy, also helped to support the single currency. Other analysts added that investors who had been wary of buying the euro before last week's bank stress test results had resumed picking up the single currency before the month ends, while position adjustments would also work in the euro's favour. Analysts said ongoing optimism about second-quarter U.S. corporate earnings would add to the view of an improving global economy, which would support shares and keep euro demand intact. European stocks rose 0.5 percent in early trade. The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 87.16 yen, and posted bigger losses against sterling , which hit a five-month high, and the Australian and New Zealand currencies. Some in the market said that an announcement by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that the US state was in a state of emergency over its finances was another reason to dump the dollar as it highlighted fiscal problems in the country.

Each card holder will get 20 kilograms of rice a month at the rate of Tk 22 per kg under this programme. Though many city dwellers are yet to get their fair price cards, I have been asked by higher authorities to take necessary preparations in this respect, said District Controller of Food Md.

The appointment of new dealers would be completed by Sunday, he said. There are 33,400 metric tons of rice in stock in two central food godowns in Khulna. He said that two foreign ships reached Mongla Port last Monday carrying 6,380 metric tonnes of rice imported from Pakistan.//////RMG sector is the vital sector for our economic growth. It earns about three-fourths of the country's earning from export of goods. Approximately 3.5 million people are directly employed in this arena. Ipso facto it is a very sensitive sector.//////I am just ending my varsity life. I had some painful experience along with lots of happy and impressive events. The most painful experience of my university life is the state of our dormitories. I think after coming to university, every student needs motivation and facilities relating to studies. Most of the students reside in dormitories. These dormitories are in very poor shape. //////It seems that the traffic congestion is going to be a typical feature of urban life in Dhaka city and it is getting worse day by day. The ever-increasing number of private cars is evidently responsible for this situation. On the other hand, with the upcoming Ramadan, the invasion of unauthorized rickshaws has already started. In this situation, can we consider some of the following measures?//////While appreciating the various improvements initiated by SEC and DSE to lessen the difficulties of general investors, (the small, aged and women investors), I would draw the attention of the controlling authorities to some anomalies that remain, especially those relating to the refund process.//////Over the last few days this subject has been brought up by Sir Frank Peters, and I believe his views must be seriously considered. Climbing Mount Everest is one such achievement, accomplished by a self motivated Bangladeshi climber Musa Ibrahim! Giving him national recognition and award is the least that he deserves; and it has rightly been given to a real adventurous spirit, that he had really earned, without any official encouragement, backing or support!//////Recently good news came to us. That is Dhaka-New Delhi are finalizing the modalities of implementing the $ 1 billion Line of Credit that India offered to Bangladesh last January. The government is going to sign a deal with India's Exim Bank through which New Delhi will route the credit line. The Exim Bank would possibly sign an agreement with Bangladesh government within a month for utilization of the credit line. That is good news for our country.//////Recently an unidentified flying object (UFO) was seen flying across the sky in Hangzhou, China. This caused massive flight delays in Xiaoshan airport on July 09, 2010. The mystery of the UFO has yet to be revealed.//////It is very sad that almost every day innocent Bangladeshis are killed by the BSF. According to statistics, about 38 people were killed by the BSF in the last six months.//////I refer to the picture news published in the DS on 21st July, 2010. There it was said that Prof Yunus and the Japanese Prime Minister had discussed application of the concept of the social business in Japan and other countries. So far other countries are concerned, the idea may look good because the other countries like the Third World ones are poorer. Any good idea to help the poor in changing their lots for good would be a welcome proposition. But I am at a loss to understand what good it 'd bring to the Japanese people who are already rich even by European standards. Suggesting this idea to them, at least to me looks like carrying coal to New Castle, a phrase we 'd learnt in our school days. //////The killing of three policemen in Pabna is really shocking news for us. Killing of law enforcers is a very serious matter, as people expect security from them. According to the reports, 29 law enforcers died this year. Naturally, the question arises whether we are safe. Local people claimed that they were killed by the members of the banned Sarbohara Party. //////Germany was defeated in the semi-final of the World Cup, till then the performance of the German team was brilliant; the young players captivated the world with their agility.//////On 21st. July I was a bit pleasantly surprised seeing SBA'S very well written article captioned "Politicians and generals--". Usually we know that our newspaper editors don't feel comfortable to publish these sorts of topics!!! SBA is very correct in his observations. But I would like to add a bit that the Bhuttos in Pakistan were the civil faces of the military.//////Are we a violent people or a sick people? Whenever there is something wrong people go wild and violent. Please refer to the death of a garment worker from a rooftop fall at Mirpur. Does this constitute sufficient reason for the people to agitate and vandalize, destroying public and private property. What is the motive behind such agitation? Who are responsible for all these agitations resulting in the loss of property worth millions? //////The fact is that no single particle in the world can be defined as perfect, similarly, no single country can be modelled as PERFECT...so is our beloved motherland, Bangladesh. The very last day I was in my business studies classes, my respected teacher said that a friend of his had narrated a story, where there was an eminent man from Bangladesh visiting a hospital abroad with pain in his ear. The doctor affirmed that the tests he had done in Bangladesh were perfectly alright and his very minor ear difficulty was not that serious. To this, the man began bellowing, that doctors in Bangladesh are not reliable and not much qualified and trustworthy. After hearing this incident the doctor commented "Believe me, Bangladesh will never develop, because no single country can develop when people of its very own soil undermine it! //////It is noted with grave concern that more and more foreign management level staff is being recruited by different companies of Bangladesh. The simple excuse is that competent manpower is not available in BD! Have the companies put any ads in local newspapers? Have the local available resources been tapped? It is pathetically negative.//////A couple of weeks back, on a discussion of health matters, in the TV, our Health Minister and Dr. Prangopal Dutta (BSMMU) were taking part. A questioner asked Dr Dutt, the reason why the top doctors give so little time to their patients. Is it really possible to diagnose a patient in a couple of minutes?//////I have read with great interest the post-editorial of Mr. Shahnoor Wahid appearing on Tuesday in The Daily Star. His idea about underground transport system as a positive solution to the existing terrible Dhaka traffic jam is a subject worth looking into. The fact is that it is a tested device in many countries, I do not find it as an absurd and unfeasible idea. Certainly, the idea deserves to be taken up seriously. As regards his apprehension about the capability of a civil govt. which is always under stress and strain and often fails to implement any worthwhile project because of conflict of interest of various persons within the govt, I can not agree with him more. But I often fail to understand as to why an elected government with more than three-fourths majority members in parliament fails to appreciate a good idea and why the existing traffic problem and for that matter other affairs like energy problem or similar other issues cannot be tackled by the govt. If the author has meant that it is difficult or impossible for an elected civil govt. to solve its burning problems, it is really a pity. //////Rescue workers and troops in northwest Pakistan struggled yesterday to reach thousands of people affected by the country's worst floods in living memory, as the death toll rose to 800.//////A diplomatic spat with implications for international counterterrorism escalated yesterday after Pakistan's spy chief cancelled a visit to London following comments by the British leader suggesting Pakistan exports terrorism.//////Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said his country will never compromise on its nuclear program.//////Violence continued to rage across Indian Kashmir yesterday with two people shot dead and five wounded after police in two towns opened fire on protesters who attacked their camps and pelted them with rocks.//////Osmania University here was tense yesterday as yet another student committed suicide in the campus demanding formation of a separate Telangana state, and hundreds of students joined in the funeral procession.//////Washington is holding up the formation of a new Iraqi government by insisting the two main election winners form a coalition, allowing Iraq's neighbours to meddle in its affairs, a top Shia politician told Reuters.//////US officials are worried about what other secret US documents the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks may possess and have tried to contact the group without success to avoid their release, the State Department said on Friday.//////More than three years after he was arrested on vague allegations, Saudi political detainee Suliman al-Reshoudi who has yet to be tried or even charged with a crime is now taking on the system.//////Hamas vowed revenge yesterday after Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip killed a senior militant and wounded eight other people.//////Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Friday stepped up criticism of the United States over its treatment of five Cuban agents imprisoned for more than a decade for spying and said one of them was in a cell so small it amounted to torture.//////Sgt Thomas Riordan didn't want to return to Afghanistan after home leave.

At stake in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case is not the religion of the individual, or his preferred means of sustenance [in this case, crime], but the rule of law. //////THE first World Cup I saw, in quality footage, was the competition in Britain in 1966, which was won by England defeating West Germany, 4-2, in the final at Wembly. I saw the film of this competition when I arrived in London towards the end of 1966 and in later years, videos of some individual games such as the final. I cannot say that I was particularly impressed with the skills of the English football team. Geoff Hurst, the West Ham striker, who scored a hat trick in the final was hardly a top class player, nor were other members of the team, except for Bobby Charlton and their world class goal-keeper, Gordon Banks. I thought England were lucky to defeat the Portuguese team in the semi-final, with Eusebio, who was the star of the tournament, in top form.//////WHO could have predicted that Brazil and Argentina would be out of the World Cup within a day of each other, without even making it to the semi-finals?//////THE national parliament has finally passed a new law for private universities. It has taken almost eight years, spanning three governments, and a divisive process to arrive at this law. Sections of the government, public intellectuals and the media have argued throughout this process for a very strict law to ensure quality and to rein in alleged irregularities by some universities. A majority of the trustees were opposed to the new law, fearing excessive government controls. Frankly, there can be little doubt that a new law was needed. How it can be best used now to bring about a new reality, and whether enforcement of the law alone is sufficient, is the question.//////LESS than a day after Andres Iniesta brought to a close a month-long festival of flag-waving with a thumping strike past Maarten Steklenburg, most hard-core football fans were already looking forward to the next season of club football. //////GANDHI not only spent his childhood among Muslim neighbours who were frequent visitors to his house, six generations of Gandhis had also served as ministers of the ruler of one of the principalities of Kathiwara where Gandhi was born. //////
