The unfortunate man died, having waited, not one, or two, but six long agonizing hours, for medical attention, which he did not get. A doctor did see him at last, but half an hour after he had passed away -- to pronounce him dead. One wonders whether one could find a better example to illustrate the miserable conditions of our government hospitals. This is an act of criminal negligence.//////THE BIMSTEC ministerial conference on poverty alleviation in the region is certainly a timely move. And it is so because of the very crucial issues which the region in particular and the world in general happen to be confronted with at the moment. The Chief Adviser has pointed to some of those issues. We may note that tackling those issues are important if the programme against poverty is to have any meaning. In this context, it would be well to recall the very reasons for which the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) was established in 1997; and of course those reasons are all self-explanatory. At a time when regional cooperation around the world on fundamental economic and political issues has become something of a norm, and necessarily so, it is only natural that BIMSTEC too will be expected to throw up the results one desires of it.//////IMAGINE for a moment what it is like to live your life in fear. You are 12 years old, studying in class seven, enjoying spending time with your school friends, watching your favourite soap operas and reality shows instead of doing homework, listening to new artists on the radio, slipping out of the house to spend time giggling and gossiping with your friends, pleading with your parents to buy you a mobile phone, your whole life ahead of you.//////WILLIAM Shakespeare writes in Romeo and Juliet that if we call a rose by any other name, it would still smell as sweet. But is that true for words in the realm of language? If we fail to use the right word or write it in wrong spelling, would it still ring the same sweet meaning to a listener or reader? Just think of one example. If you say "wart" and the doctor thinks "nose," would you care to ask him to remove a wart from your face?//////WORLD oil prices have risen by nearly 50% since the beginning of 2008, and nearly doubled over the past year. Both economic and political factors have driven this unsettling rush in oil prices. However, some recently proposed remedial measures here in the US appear nonsensical. President George Bush and presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain both have recently proposed withdrawal of the 1990 federal moratorium on offshore oil drilling. //////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is looking for a sponsor who will support its 9-figure budget for one year and the quest is likely to be accomplished within this month.//////South Africa hit back with three wickets in quick succession as they started to justify captain Graeme Smith's decision to field in the first Test against England at Lord's here Thursday.//////A corporate five-a-side indoor football competition kicks off at the STM hall premises in Uttara today.

children. The same newspaper reported on July 01 that the honourable CA of the present CTG had taken the matter into cognisance and asked for explanation from the officials concerned. We hope that the matter will not end, like many other matters of the past, in paper correspondence only. This time we would like to see that the NCTB is reformed to perform its sacred duty to the nation with full professionalism. For that I would like to submit some comments from my 38 years of formal experience as a teacher and as an educational administrator. Before I put my comments it may not be out of context to briefly explain the functions of the NCTB for the general readers of your daily.//////The Food Adviser had reportedly ruled out the possibility of increase in fuel prices which could upset the move towards attaining food security as reported by UNB and published in the dailies on July 2.//////On an average about six natural calamities of great magnitude visit this land every year. These include floods, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides and so on. These disasters cause heavy loss of life and property. In most instances, these calamities catch the people unawares.

Disapproving the existence of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU) inside the capital city, Dhaka, Prof. SAM has suggested to correct the mistake of setting up SAU at the present location. Well, for his information I would like to say that it took nearly 20 years for the charismatic leader, Sher-e- Bangla A K Fazlul Haq, to make this costly mistake of establishing the SAU, the then Bengal Agricultural Institute in the heart of Dhaka. It was in 1938 that Sher-e-Bangla A K Fazlul Haq, //////It is needless to mention that the Election Commission (EC) is free to hold election anytime, anywhere if it is due and necessary for the country. It can be during any govt., either elected or interim. //////No election was held at upazila level since the system was disbanded during the early the nineties by the then BNP government. It was one of the root causes of BNP's defeat in the parliamentary election in 1996. The Awami League also faced a debacle for not reintroducing the upazila system during their tenure. The upazila system was popular and accepted by the local people as their government within the people's reach. It is not understood why the major political parties were apprehensive of the move taken by the caretaker government to hold the local government election in October or earlier. By and large, people are supporting the present government's initiatives in holding the election. //////Women workers in Saudi are forcibly confined, exploited and abused by their employers. There are at least one million expatriate women working legally in some of the lowest-paid jobs in Saudi Arabia. The overwhelming majority of them are domestic workers in private households. Others are employed as hairdressers, beauticians and maintenance staff in gender-segregated public and private facilities. In case of women workers, exploitative labour conditions such as workdays stretching to twelve hours or longer, unpaid salaries, denied benefits, and threats and intimidation from employers are common. Employers demanded their passports when they arrived in the kingdom, and in most cases did not provide them with an official residency permit, the only document valid in Saudi Arabia for identification purposes. The evidence also demonstrates that many exploited women workers in Saudi Arabia suffer one gender-specific abuse: forced confinement. //////I was reading the write up A nation for sale.

The 'am janata'. I pay tax. I am told that taxes should be paid so that the government can provide us different services. Yet, every time I need something from the government I have to pay for it. Call it bribe, ghush, the oil that keeps the wheels of the government moving or whatever. I don't claim to be exceptional in any way. I lie, I cheat, I get into fights over trivial issues, but no way can I be held responsible for bringing the country to the brink of the abyss that we find ourselves in.//////Every year Bangladesh is losing a lot of trees.

Abood, 21, could only get close enough to see the two-door Opel engulfed in flames, incinerating 57-year-old Hafd Abood and two women colleagues from his office in an airport bank. //////EVERY time the wet season comes, I ask myself the same question.
