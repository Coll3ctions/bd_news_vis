The army chief has only echoed the popular expectation that the existing political vacuum should be filled with a democratically elected government.//////A declining trend in FDI flows into Bangladesh has been depicted in World Investment Report-2007 of the UNCTAD released by the Board of Investment (BoI) in Dhaka. The FDI in Bangladesh declined by 6 percent against the previous year's level instead of 9.6 per cent as stated in the report.

He had just said farewell to the Bangladesh Observer and was already running the show at a new newspaper. In the end, that newspaper had an early, premature journey into the twilight. For Obaidul Huq, too, there was that beckoning twilight, the mingling of light and shadow we call dusk. And yet he would go on to serve at other places, in other positions.//////
