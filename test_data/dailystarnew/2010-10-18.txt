With reports of a marginal increase in the supply of gas in the face of growing demands, our attention has long been riveted on the exploration issue. As a report in this newspaper yesterday makes it clear, not much of a headway has been made in gas exploration in order to ensure a smooth, uninterrupted supply of gas well into the near future. Contrast that with the praiseworthy initiatives the government has taken in recent times to augment the supply of electricity. Moves are on to generate 2,500 megawatts of electricity. Such moves are yet to be seen in the gas sector. That is where our concerns come in.//////If pictures are supposed to speak a thousand words then the two photographs front-paged in this newspaper yesterday speak more than a thousand words. They depict a manifest malady, but which, regrettably, remains outside the radar screen of the agencies concerned to be attended to and remedied. The pictures are fairly representative of the state of safety of workers in almost all kinds of work places, from high-rise buildings to construction sights to garment factories to road construction to ship-breaking yards, you name it. //////At one point, words just no longer cut it.

The Tigers have been called super, they have been dubbed sensational and sublime, some have even stretched as far as magic, and magnificent. In between there have also been some wows thrown in for good measure.

Dhaka's railway system is primarily designed to serve inter-city traffic. Why not use it by adding one or two extra lines to run fast track intra-city light metro rail, say every twenty minutes? This will be cheaper, faster, much greater in capacity, and much more environment friendly than any number of battered buses trying to do the same job. All we need is to create a few underpasses at the road intersections (or overhead railway bridges) to avoid rail-crossing jams. //////Sending a meritorious student to the medical profession is a huge investment for a nation like Bangladesh with its limited resources.

We humbly request the authorities concerned to take immediate steps to prevent spread of this disease before Eid-ul-Adha.//////The owners' association of the CNG supply stations recently threatened the government with an indefinite strike from November 2010, if their demands were not met before the stated time. Presently we are not getting gas regularly in our area, and if we get it for sometime, its pressure is very low. The electricity supply is also inadequate and the water supply is erratic mostly because of irregular supply of electricity as electricity is also generated from gas. With this backdrop, the shutting of the CNG stations for 6 hours daily is quite logical and proven to be realistic. //////Recently the Communications Minister Syed Abul Hossain announced that, fastening of seat belts, wearing helmets while riding a motorcycle, using the footbridge and underpass while crossing the road, would be made mandatory, and talking on the phone while driving would be banned. These new rules will take effect from November 1, 2010, and if these rules are not followed, drivers and commuters will be fined, and even jailed. Majority of the people don't follow these rules. If we change our bad habits, we can change the whole country. //////People are being killed in broad daylight, vehicles are being damaged, journalists are being beaten and their cameras taken away by the ruling party cadres, emboldened by the virtual immunity, while occasionally the natural phenomena like cyclones, tidal bores, floods are lashing the country, making life miserable for the vulnerable. //////There are too many holidays in the educational institutions in our country. We enjoy more holidays than the other SARC countries. In America, Muslim teachers are working even on the Eid days. In Bangladesh, a teacher's salary is very poor compared to a clerk's and even a day labourer's. The governments are indifferent to quality education. When we raise the issue of teachers' salary increase, the govt. rejects it showing fund crisis. We don't hear of any fund crisis while increasing the salary of the MPs and buying luxurious cars for them.//////It makes me laugh when I hear the government has taken a BOLD STEP to do something.

But till today they could not stop river encroachment. //////The Secretary General of BNP held a press conference on 6th October regarding the newly passed bill that allows awarding of power generation work without tender.

Bangladesh also observed the day with the theme, 'Recovery begins with teachers'. Teachers' associations have undertaken a variety of programmes to commemorate the day along with the rest of the world. //////One of the major indicators of development or industrialisation of a nation is the level of its per capita commercial energy use. The three most important commercial sources of energy today are natural gas, oil and coal. Natural gas is Bangladesh's only significant source of commercial energy, with 2002 production of 384.9 billion cubic feet (bcf). Production of natural gas in Bangladesh began in 1960 from the Chhatak field. There is much uncertainty and debate about the level of natural gas reserves in Bangladesh. Estimates from Petrobangla put the net proven reserves at 15.3 tcf as of mid-2004. The US Geological Survey has estimated that Bangladesh contains an additional 32.1 tcf in additional undiscovered reserves.//////Megasthenes memories of Azam Khan, published in your October 7th issue, was a moving account of a rare and noble person who was in Dhaka in the troubled 1960s. If there were another five persons like him in those days, the history of this part of the world could have been less violent and painful. Even the creation of Bangladesh would have been a peaceful political process, without the widespread killings and destruction, let loose by Tikka Khan (the antithesis of Azam Khan)! //////The verdict of the Allahabad High Court has proved the old adage, If you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one.

And such a general notion about bus mishaps in the public mind is not unfounded. //////How should India's Supreme Court treat the appeals certain to be filed before it against the Allahabad High Court judgment on the Babri Masjid issue, which dismisses the Sunni Central Waqf Board's title suit and says the site was the birthplace of Lord Ram?
