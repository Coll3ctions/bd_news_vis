Now we have the powerful local groups who have despoiled 30,000 Jhau (Tamarisk) trees on a 10 kilometres stretch of greenbelt in Teknaf along the Cox's Bazar seacoast within the span of a week. By their act, they have not only looted forest resources illegally, but also have exposed the coastland vulnerably to the cyclones and tidal bores from the sea. The speed with which these vandals have completed their mission is a telltale sign of their limitless greed, power as well as organisation vis--vis the total inaction of the forest department and the administration. As if emboldened by the way that looters of forest have gotten away with their vile act, the influential grabbers of land have appeared on the scene to encroach on the 100-kilometre Cox's Bazar and the 17-kilometre Kuakata sea beaches. That the quarters so involved in illegal seizure of the sea beaches are no respecters of law is made glaringly evident from the signboards unabashedly declaring that patches of khas land of the beach are their private properties. //////WE, in Bangladesh, are used to waiting. We have been waiting to find out the perpetrators of the BDR massacre, who were really behind the August 21 grenade attack, or who killed one of the most brilliant sons of our soil, Shah AMS Kibria. Our waiting does not stop at that -- even for cases for which we know who the perpetrators were, we wait for them to be brought to justice. Some of the self-declared murderers of Bangabandhu and his family are still at large. So are the "war criminals" who attempted to eradicate the intellectual backbone of the nation in 1971, only to be riding cars bearing our national flag in less than a generation, as no less than ministers. We live in this 'strange' country where one can emotionally survive this uncertain and excruciating wait only if one knows how to wait, wait and wait only to see the reason for the wait becoming a distant memory at one point.//////THE recently concluded Presidential election in Afghanistan hasn't reduced anxiety over Afghanistan's future. It's also unlikely that it will usher in much-needed stability in that war-torn country. In fact, the scenario has become more complex. Her path to democracy has been overshadowed by poor turnout and fraud. //////MANIPULATION of laws or Acts for one's own interest has become very common in Bangladesh. Even in the Parliament we have experienced that several successive governments have made amendments to various laws for serving their own interests. If we think about bureaucracy we would find that laws have permitted bureaucrats to use discretionary power. Like many other organizations, authorities of public universities in Bangladesh have manipulated the University Act of 1973 form time to time. Sometimes erroneous elucidation of different clauses of the Act was given only to offer gratuitous privileges to the teachers loyal to authorities. //////Boxer Nadim Hossain, who reportedly went missing in Milan after taking part in the World Boxing Championship in Italy, is said to be keen to get back home.

Conducting foreign affairs was then relatively easy. One had to choose between the two super powers to assist small nations achieve their interests in international politics and more often than not, they obliged. At the time of liberation, Bangladesh joined the Soviet Camp to which India was aligned.
