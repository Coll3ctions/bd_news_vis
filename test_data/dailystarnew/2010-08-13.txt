Curse, because most part of the city was engulfed by ankle to knee-deep water. As the city lacks proper drainage system, large swathes of the major arterial roads including lanes and by-lanes went under water thereby bringing the entire city to a standstill. And to make matters worse, one could find digging going on in different areas either by the City Corporation, or by Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA), or Telephone authority. Small wonder, the city witnessed the suffering of the pedestrians as well as commuters as they had to wade through rainwater mixed with stinking muck from the overflowing drains, the vehicles incapacitated on the roads submerged under knee-deep water and tailbacks longer than the usual ones.//////There is no ticket available online for the opening match between Bangladesh and India as all

When the bus reached the bus terminal some transport workers severely beat up a student of the college leaving him injured. As the news spread other students they came out from the campus and barricaded the highway.//////It came through that today's education a highly competitive and lucrative business where schools compete to produce impressive results by creating an atmosphere of exam frenzy through the year and resorting to corporal punishment of sinister dimensions is driving students even to suicide. Narrations in the Enquiry by children and parents of inhuman incidents of violence and humiliation were heart-rending. What seems to embolden the school authorities to convert schools into prisons seems to be the fact that many parents are in tune with such punishment regimen; they are not against physical violence as a tool for disciplining, but only against excesses. And teachers fear that their job security depends on the performance of students. //////My friends and I made a plan to visit the ancient places of Bangladesh. A few months ago we went to Mymensingh. We went to see Mymensingh Agricultural University and other beautiful places in the city. We also went to the river Brahmaputra. Finally, we went to see the Muktagachha royal palace which is a treasure of Bangladesh. It is an age-old witness of history. When we walked inside the castle it was like we were entering the ancient world. One would start thinking that once upon a time people walked around here, there were king, queen and royal personnel, a whole different piece of world. The palace is really magnificent. Apart from the living places for king and queen, the palace consists of an in-house bungalow, a round stage for entertainers, a weather house, a jail for the convicts, a secret locker for keeping treasures and many other things. Many old temples are there around the palace. Some temples were built by the Hindu kings centuries ago. //////I guess at least 30% gas is being wasted, especially in our houses and restaurants. People keep the burners on even when it is not necessary. I have seen in many houses that even educated housewives keep the burners turned on for hours to save one matchstick. A similar thing happens in restaurants.//////Our south-east neighbour Myanmar is a mysterious country whose military junta has turned this once well-off country into a poor and separate nation. Neglecting the other world, its junta has been managing to hold the power for decades breaking all democratic norms, albeit it gets patronage from China, Russia and even India. These countries are wooing the Myanmar's junta for getting only economic profits.//////In a news conference on August 5, 2010, Mr. M. K. Anwar stated that he would not have objected to the loan had it been obtained from an international bank, namely, ADB, or WB where the interest rate on similar loan could be obtained at 0.25% with no fees added where the Indian loan has an interest rate of 1.75% with an initiation fee of 0.5%. It has to be paid within 25 years, and has a penalty of 2% per year there after. As per Mr. M. K. Anwar, the loans from the international banks do not have any such penalty. The fact is, all loans from ADB or WB are based on LIBOR rate, plus an add-on fee. The LIBOR rate is a composite interest rate on a basket of bonds. The current WB lending rate is 6-month LIBOR + a fee of minimum of 2.00%. On the top of this lending rate, there is a one-time fee of 1% of the loan amount. For the loan amount $1 billion, the one-time fee will be $10 million. If the loan needs to be renewed after its original maturity, there is a renewal fee of 0.5%. In a recent loan from the ADB for fixing natural gas distribution problem, the government of Bangladesh obtained a loan of $266 million at an interest rate of LIBOR rate + 0.60%, plus a commitment fee of 0.15%. For the current loan amount of such a large size ($1 billion), the add-on could be much higher than 2.00% that the WB charges on normal size loans. The point is, it is wrong and misleading to claim that the lending rates on loans from international banks, such as ADB and WB are lower than the interest rate secured in the Indian loan.//////I am horrified to see the police atrocities in dealing with the students in Dhaka and Chittagong, who were protesting against hike of tuition fees and imposition of VAT on their tuition fees in private universities. The students' demands were in connection with higher education, some of which the government has already accepted. But it is astounding to see how heavily the police came down on the students in both cities. The students were not criminals, neither were they demanding any illegal things. So, the way police treated them with their truncheons is not acceptable. //////The word 'secular' has many meanings to many persons. To insert such a word in the constitution of any nation is really a meaningless lip service and a perennial bone of contention and agitation. What is required is a positive assertion in the constitution to the effect that 'equality before the law' for all citizens including minority and disadvantaged groups is guaranteed (no matter what is the official religion of the country, or what words are used for preamble). To effect such equality, criminal laws ( if it is not there already) must be brought in to prevent discrimination on the grounds or race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, physical disadvantage, etc and for incitement of hatred on any such basis. Prevention of such discrimination is the true meaning of 'secularity' in the constitutional and legal context. Laws to prevent such discrimination exist in all secular western countries, although they have a national church, or religion, or religious preambles to any prescribed laws. The word 'secular' is not used in their written or unwritten constitutions as it is superfluous.//////The article Historic Dhaka city: Past glory and present crisis by Md Mashrur Rahman Mishu suggests by all means that Dhaka is dying.//////In a recent letter I had praised Gulshan Society for the order they had brought to traffic on Road No 2, Gulshan- 1 and Niketon approach road EVEN WHEN THE ROAD ITSELF WAS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION.//////August 6th and August 9th mark the anniversaries of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.

Many questions in the Bangla, General Knowledge, Science and Math sections did not have the correct answers among all the four given alternatives. In one of the sets the instructions and the questions were all mixed up, confusing the examinees and preventing them even from attempting to answer, as there was negative marking for wrong answers. //////Post government decision to increase wages by 80% , we are observing quite a few economists, intellectuals stating that even this is not enough & it should be Tk 5000 minimum.. Workers' demonstration, I can understand, given their lack of education , plus not to mention some politicians' & NGOs' instigation ... but hearing such comments from the country's elite group really puzzles me...

Initially college and university students were the main users. But now people from different age-groups are increasingly using it. At the same time, researchers, scholars and teachers are thinking of how this tool can be used in academic purposes. Teachers can utilise Facebook in the classroom for engaging students in a manner that might not be entirely possible in traditional classroom settings.
