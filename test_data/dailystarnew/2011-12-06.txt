It consisted of very precise, short and rapid pulse of radio waves at regular intervals. She and her team locked down four of such cosmic sources and thought that the extra-terrestrials from a distant alien civilization were sending the Earthlings such systematic signals in an attempt to communicate with them. They were so sure of this explanation that they named these strange sources as LGM 1-4, where LGM stood for Little Green Men. But soon it was realized that these signals were actually coming from rotating neutron stars (the collapsed core of a supernovae, which takes place when the outer region of a star gets blown off in a tremendous explosion). And these neutron stars were emitting pulses of radio waves because of a complicated interaction between their magnetic fields and surrounding matter. The researchers later noticed that the signals coincided with the position of a flashing star located at the centre of the Crab Nebula, the very locale where the remnant of a supernovae that was seen from Earth in 1054 AD.//////What do you really know about your blood types?
