Genes, the basic unit of information for the living systems, are the guide to create thousands of different types of proteins in a particular cell type to enable the cell to carry out its assigned function. It is the protein molecule that makes the different cell types different by having been created in certain combinations in a cell type specialized to perform a particular task. Hence, we get our arms, legs, eyes different from one another. Scientists, for long, have believed that the proteins need to have a rigid structure to play their roles inside the cell. In fact, the biochemistry text books will tell you that the genes encode proteins, which are simply the chain of different amino acids linked together by peptide bonds and after the formation of the polypeptide chains, they need to get a definite three dimensional shape which will react with the target molecules by lock-and-key system. However, recent research is revealing a new architectural design of the proteins. A host of proteins carry out their biological tasks without ever completely folding; others fold only as needed. Perhaps one third of all human proteins are intrinsically disordered carrying some unfolded or disordered regions.//////After the spectacular discoveries in Madagascar, it is now the turn of New Guinea to display some of the magnificent arrays of new species of floras and faunas that the world has ever known.
