It is now our expectation that the recommendations made by these experts will be adopted at the conference of Saarc ministers that went underway in the capital yesterday.//////THE directive of Chief Adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed to the ministries that they immediately put a stop to any further road digging in the capital in the monsoon could not have come a day later. How much the public suffering enormously through the indiscriminate road digging activities of the utility organisations craved for a break! They wondered what really happened to the commitment of the Dhaka city mayor during the BNP-led coalition rule that thenceforward no road digging would take place during rainy season. //////CORPORATE raiders are notorious people. They orchestrate hostile takeover of companies and break up their assets to generate huge profit. This time a similar raid is being launched on this country. Private companies are taking it apart piece by piece to make more money. I don't oppose their right to do business, but what their business is doing to our rights as people is appalling.//////GEORGE W. Bush is fond of describing himself as a "war president." And he has made many decisions involving soldiers and battle. But does this make the description an appropriate one? For many people the answer is obvious. We're engaged in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, after all. But Bill Clinton initiated hostilities in the Balkans twice, George H.W. Bush invaded Panama and Iraq, and neither president ever described himself as a "war president."//////A saying in Bangla goes ////// -- which roughly translates as those that are successful in their studies will be successful in life.

Many columnists from top national dailies define it as a business friendly budget, while some others explain it as populist.

Finally, the finance adviser, the budget maker himself, said that even though it seems to be full of short-term protective measures, it contains many long-term directions as well.//////Once we were proud of our oldest university.

Majumder, and many more very high calibre academics. //////The Shishu Park at the northern fringe of Suhrawardy Udyan was set up in the late seventies in order to provide children with amusement and fun. However, with the increase in the number of visitors, the park is unable to cope with the extra demand. The mindless parking of vehicles and the presence of vendors have rendered the area dirty and chaotic and added to the woes of the city dwellers. Over the years, the various games items have become old, worn out and the risk of an accident is always there. In the first place, setting up of a children's park in the heart of the city lacked visionary planning. Ideally, such a park should have been set up on the outskirts of the city .The area earmarked for the Shishu Park should be brought immediately under the overall development of the Udyan--the lung of the city. Moreover, setting up of the park was a deliberate attempt to wipe out the memories of our glorious history of independence. This was the very place from where the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, gave the clarion call for independence. //////The Election Commission announced last week that it had registered 99% of the voters. It implies that around 7 lakh voters are yet to be registered.

Of late, sub prime house loan disaster in the USA is a hot topic of discussion in the financial circle. The sharp downturn of the housing sector along with the sky-high oil prices and huge deficit due to the phenomenal increase in war costs in different world theatres have precipitated recession in America's economy. Since the housing sector has a substantial share in GDP growth of the US economy, its downturn triggers a chain effect in other sectors too. Manufacturing activities dwindle down along with consumer confidence. Many industries cut down their capacity. Due to the oil price hike, a good number of airlines grounded hundreds of their carriers, cut down number of routes, a few sought bankruptcy protection etc. Automobile industries shut down some of their facilities. A large number of employees have been given marching orders with a pink slip in hand. Unemployment rate has swelled. Common men's suffering knows no bound. The economic slump in the USA has a simmering ripple effect on world economy in general inasmuch as the US economy is considered to be the growth engine of global economy, other developed European economies are also hard hit by US recession. Developing economies like that of China, India, Brazil, Indonesia etc. are also in the fray. About the least developed economies like that of Bangladesh, the less said, the better.//////It is not possible to move in Dhaka city.

Nobody is thinking about it. Newspapers are presenting news and we are reading it. Not only the government but also the NGOs should come forward to address the issue. //////I am talking about the Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University(SAU) which is just now being located at the heart of a burgeoning capital city. How a farm varsity could be established just at the heart of a very densely populated city? A farm varsity is supposed to be in the countryside or around the farm lands/ farm households. //////Not too long ago the budget for 2007-08 fiscal year was announced. No budget is flawless, it comes with its merits and demerits. Unfortunately, we have a bunch of economists who are always highly critical of any budget, irrespective of whether it is prepared by a democratic government or a caretaker government. //////Four hundred doctors signed up for the release of Khaleda Zia and her two sons. Why? Do they deserve it? Did they apologise to this nation for the corruption they did during their tenure? Our doctors are more involved in politics than their professional development. Can DAB give a single example that contributed to the development of medical practices in Bangladesh? Shame on these doctors. Don't mislead this nation any more.//////No doubt, most of the police officers perform their duties with honesty, sincerity and, above all, love for the country. But what happened on 27 June is quite humiliating not only for the police, it is also a great embarrassment for the nation. "A police officer was found guilty of stealing a mobile phone set ."-(The Daily Star, 29.06.2008)//////Once my relative took my cell phone and he did something without informing me. Since then, every day I get a message in my cell phone on horoscope coming from the number 022667. I tried my best to stop it, but failed. At last, I called up 121 (GP Customer Centre) to solve my problem. When I called up 121, the computer-based system automatically received my call and I came to hear a voice. She gave me a number, 2667, and told me to write off in message option and to send it to that number. I tried my best to send the message but it could not be sent because it was an invalid number. I talked with her but the problem was not solved. //////On June 4, 2008 Begum Khaleda Zia was brought to a magistrate's court with many other VIP accused. But when sick Koko was brought in a wheelchair into the room, the former prime minister rushed to her dear son with tears and an emotional scene was created there. Although Begum Zia was the PM, she is a mother as well. So her behaviour was completely natural. //////Helen Keller International (HKI) Bangladesh and Bangladesh Shishu Academy jointly organised a children's painting competition as part of celebrating the 30 years (1978-2008) of HKI in Bangladesh. The art competition held at the Shishu Academy Art Gallery was on the subject: "Field, Food and Family." The purpose of the event was to involve children in unfolding their creativity around some of HKI's core focal points -- food production, nutrition and women's empowerment. //////We citizens depended on the political regimes and we suffered losses running into billions during the past decades due to non-transparent tender procedures.

To be honest, I was at a loss recently, coming out from the Experimental Theatre Hall.

How could anyone but locals develop such a flawless dialect? Does it pay to be a stage actor?//////Many theatre-goers are unaware that the first stage play for which tickets were sold was Bahubachan's production ////// (written by Farhad Mazhar and directed by Motahar Hossain).

Those who knew him, his colleagues and students alike, have consistently recalled the human qualities that endlessly underpinned his philosophy of life. //////INTEREST in common people's wisdom and resource use technologies have moved to centre- stage in the recent years.
