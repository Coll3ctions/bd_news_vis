It has a 20-year repayment period on a rate of interest at 1.75 percent which in the commercial category is considered to be rather moderate.

A few brave-hearted and noble men have shown our indomitable spirit. Noble Laureate Dr Yunus, Averest hero Musa Ibrahim are among the few names who spread the news of average Bangladeshis' pride.//////Corruption in Bangladesh has assumed such large proportions and variegated forms that large numbers of the public have come to believe that it is impossible to get rid of this malaise. In such an atmosphere of pervasive cynicism, one of the things that the guide repeatedly emphasizes - and quite correctly - is that the scourge can be managed or controlled. Other countries have been notoriously corrupt in the past but have succeeded in tackling the problem through a mixture of administrative and electoral reform. But in a country which buckles under the gigantic burden of corruption and struggles to find a way to overcome its oppressive weight, any step towards giving the still-nascent anti-corruption movement a fillip deserves to be warmly commended. The media reports and editorials acknowledge the need for a variety of strategies to fight corruption, ranging from general measures such as the simplification of rules and procedures and the application of information technology to specific steps such as trapping corrupt public servants. While agencies such as the ACC can play a vital role, any comprehensive strategy to combat corruption would have to involve other bodies such as NGOs and the print and electronic media. //////While I was browsing some Bangla dailies on Aug 2, I found a headline reading "Khaleda demands Tk.10/- per Kg rice during the month of Ramadan for the people. This call from a popular and a compassionate leader like her has got wide media coverage. I believe people of Bangladesh must have been very happy to see her compassion for them. I also thank her for her sympathy to the people during the fasting month and also her religious feelings. My thanks to her are pre-judged and may not hold good if her call is not found genuine and has not been done out of real feelings for the people.//////The preliminary test of 30th BCS was held on July 30. There were three sets of questions. The set number 2 was full of errors. But on August 01, the Public Service Commission (PSC) claimed that it was not their mistake and they would be careful about students' rights. There were more than 50 thousand students who answered the questions of set number 2. There was no trace of creative questions in the question paper. We don't understand why PSC is wasting our time. They are too careless to think about 148 thousand candidates.//////Heavy monsoon rains triggered a devastating flood in Pakistan.

The Anglo-Persian oil company, guaranteed itself, or won the right to own, all of Iran's oil.

China, EU-27 countries and Turkey, said the report."//////Hats off to Mohammad Badrul Ahsan for presenting the real-life philosophy in a very lucid manner (The Daily Star: July 30/10). However, to me it's not the Slot Machine Philosophy. As a matter of fact, it's the Philosophy of Fate. No one knows why a rich man becomes poor all of a sudden despite his hard labour coupled with intelligence and capability; no one also can explain as to why a poor person without even much effort becomes affluent almost overnight. Of course, "Behind every riches, there is a crime." But no riches are permanent. If the father and the grandfather are rich, there is no surety that their descendants would be as rich or they may even reduced to stark poverty. You may also call this the philosophy of change and in the cosmic perspective, it is said that "the change is always better."//////Hats off to Mohammad Badrul Ahsan for presenting the real-life philosophy in a very lucid manner (The Daily Star: July 30/10).

But the number of tourists visiting is very few because of lack of modern facilities, and most importantly, lack of advertisements . The Sundarbans is one of the largest mangrove forests in the world which is enriched with 334 different species of trees. This is another hot spot for Bangladesh to earn huge amount of money. Kuakata is blessed by the Almighty, where the sun rise and sun set can be seen from the same place.The Saat Gombuj Masjid is a masterpiece and a brilliant example of old architecture. There are many mosques, temples and old castles which need renovation and preservation. These places should be made attractive for the tourists. //////The initiators affirmed that they have undertaken the project of building a mosque near the Ground Zero site as a part of the Cordova Complex with a noble intention to improving Muslim-West relations and to promote integration, tolerance of differences and community cohesion.//////A few days ago I read a reader's letter about the auto bike, electricity powered tricycle, in DS. It focused on the environment friendly aspect of auto bike. Indeed, it is neither environment friendly nor energy efficient. On the other hand , it is increasing our electricity problem. I am a little worried about it as its number is increasing very rapidly because of its low price and subsidised price of electricity. //////Sudden death of an able and earning member of a family brings not only endless sufferings to the concerned family but it also causes a great economic loss to the nation. Moreover, the passengers become reluctant to move through two way roads jeopardising economic activities of the country including tourism. Rough statistics show that more than 10,000 people die in accidents in Bangladesh every year. Most of them are able and earning persons. Only the economists can figure out the national loss of the country out of their immature deaths. Since long, Dhaka Aricha road has been marked as a death trap . However, after opening of the Bangabandhu Bridge the number of incidents on the road has diminished as the pressure of traffic has been reduced . But the recent accident which took the lives of two top bureaucrats (Mrs. Razia Begum, Secretary to the government and Mr Siddiqur Rahman, Chairman, BISCIC) jolted the whole nation. We have seen that the number of accidents from Gabtoli to Savar has come down because of the road divider. Many hoped and demanded that the whole road be marked by a divider, but it did not happen. If there had been a divider on the road, we might not have lost our two top bureaucrats ( of course, God is the only saviour). //////Every organisation needs money for conducting its activities. Political organisations/ parties need a huge amount of money, no doubt, for different functions and activities. //////This is in response to a letter published in 1st August issue of The Daily Star entitled Foreign Managers by Syed Imtiaz Ali. Mr. Ali stated that most large MNC's operating in the country have foreign managers at the top level of management. He also was surprised that local business schools aren't producing good managers who are at par with their foreign peers. It's true that we have foreign staff at the helm of most of the big multinational corporations and consultants operating in the country. Before I begin I would like to state that I have completed my business degree in one of the reputed private universities and internship in one of the large telecom companies.//////I was a passenger of Volvo AC bus that departed from Cox's Bazar on 31 July 2010 at 12.15:pm for Dhaka which reached Dhaka at 2.00am on 01 Aug 2010. The driver drove the bus recklessly and roughly throughout the whole journey. His driving was threatening to other smaller vehicles and even pedestrians on the highway. His overtaking of other vehicles was dangerous. Many times he crossed the middle line demarcation and drove the bus on the right-hand side track of the road. He compelled the other vehicles coming from opposite direction to go out of the road while he was overtaking others. He always put us at a vulnerable situation and at life risk. He raised my heart-beat. The supervisor did not prevent him from reckless driving even after repeated requests. Once I requested the driver also, but he did not comply.//////It has been found that Traffic Congestion causes Tk.19,555/- crore loss a year, besides mental and physical sufferings of the people.
