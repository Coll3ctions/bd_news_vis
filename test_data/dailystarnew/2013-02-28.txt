The latter is what a country does; the former is how it does it. Diplomacy may thus be assumed to be a dependent variable of foreign policy.

How a country manages its economic diplomacy relies on how it oversees its foreign policy objectives. Thus, nexus between economic diplomacy and foreign policy is irrefutable.
