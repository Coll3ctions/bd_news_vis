Finance Minister A.M.A. Muhith clearly puts matters in perspective when he notes that a quick import of the items --- pulses, edible oil, sugar, grams, onions and powdered milk --- means that the government wants to be ready for Ramadan, obviously a time when consumers are generally put to great difficulties owing to an unnatural hike in prices. The fact that the TCB is once again being brought into the picture indicates a proactive role for the body after a long interval. That the government has embraced the idea of the TCB getting robustly involved in the task of ensuring market stabilisation speaks of the seriousness with which the authorities view the existing market conditions. //////It is unfortunate that several hundred RMG workers vandalised more than a dozen garment factories at BSCIC industrial area in Fatullah on Monday, thereby causing extensive damage to the units.

If you have had cause to follow events, you just might recall the various incidents in which students of one private university have engaged in skirmishes with those of another. The reasons have been pretty petty and certainly peculiar. A young woman, pursuing studies at one university, is harassed by a bunch of young men putatively coming by education at another. The brother of the young woman protests such behaviour, justifiably. Soon after that, you run into these unsettling images of running street battles between large bodies of young men emerging furiously from the confines of their classrooms. It is not until those truncheon-wielding policemen swoop on them that matters somewhat get under control.//////SINCE the last caretaker government took almost two years instead of three months to allow the Election Commission to hold the 9th parliamentary elections, questions have been raised as to whether the system should remain or not as it failed to achieve the desired objective.//////THIS month of May marks the eleventh anniversary of the eventful year the South Asian Nuclear genie got out of the bottle, with both India and Pakistan overtly conducting a series of nuclear tests.

Yes, in our desperation for a new world order, Obama symbolises hopes of majority of the human race for a safer world-- a vision shaped more by a scientific global outlook for a positive changes in the new millennium than by self-defeating dogmas of the right, left, neo-cons and religious fundamentalists of all hues. //////We joined the World Red Crescent/Cross fraternity in paying homage to Jean Henry Dunant, its founder, on the occasion of his birth anniversary on May 8.

Extremists are getting themselves heavily armed. Their capability of producing fatal weapons  came to light  after the law enforcing agencies unearthed  a madrasa cum ordinance factory in  Bhola.

Even foreign help has been  sought.  Rumours of probable attack by the extremists   are also afloat in the country. Has our govt. achieved any real success in extirpating those headstrong elements from our country? //////When the JMB was operating in the northern part of the country,  the BNP govt kept their eyes closed. A team from the US came and visited that area and they also failed to smell anything fishy. But the media kept on reporting dispassionately. And at the end the JMB announced their presence by exploding bombs in 64 districts within a span of 30 minutes.  Any way.... this made the govt  wake up. And they launched an all out drive to nab those terrorists.//////All citizens [in any nation/country] are [supposed to be] patriots embedded, from childhood, with the spirit and philosophy of nationalism.

It needs patience and accumulated wisdom to guide the masses, and the succeeding generations.//////His presence was seldom felt but he was there. In Bangladesh any person distantly related to any power, radiates so much that some time he or she supersedes the source. Dr. Wazed Miah perhaps was the only exception. Being the husband of the chief executive of the government, he lived the life of the most ordinary person. But he was not an ordinary soul, rather a meritorious student, an eminent scientist, a responsible husband and a caring father. He steered the whole family most efficiently when crisis loomed over. Again when the family came to limelight he took shelter behind the wings. Such selfless persons are rare not only in our country but also all over the world. //////Barack Obama's greatest   breakthrough  was not in Berlin before election or in London in the G20 summit after his poll victory. It was in Port au Prince in Trinidad in the summit of Americas. Here he stood with eleven Afro-Caribbean heads of state, showing that change has come to the Americas, The people of Afro-West Indies have the same root as  Black America has. But they were separated and divided creating mini states. They are the worst affected poor states whose citizens  often try to smuggle themselves  to the  USA.//////Former prime minister  Begum Khaleda Zia recently said that the country is now free from militants,  and militancy does not exist any more.

I  think  that those who like and love cricket must have seen and felt totally disappointed at the management style of the BCB.

But the reality  is something different  for  us. //////Bangladesh is an agrarian country inhabited by 150 million people in a meagre land of 56,000 square miles.

When a general citizen dies at a public hospital due to negligence, there is no one to complain to since certain quarters are much too powerful. When a female student in a university gets harassed by a local hooligan, she keeps silent since even the teachers do not want to ruffle feathers. When an ethnic minority leader dies during interrogation, no one raises questions since the answers are buried too deep.//////TEA, the second most popular beverage in the world, is believed to have first been popularised in China. For thousands of years the Chinese farmers had the monopoly of cultivating tea. Its cultivation in tropical and subtropical areas is a recent phenomenon.//////M. Alauddin, an officer of the CSP of 1952 batch, breathed his last in a Lahore hospital on April 18. He was commissioner of Dhaka division when the Pakistan army cracked down at midnight on March 25. He was taken to Lyallpur and ordered by the Pakistanis to depose against Sheikh Mujib, who was under trial for treason, and suffered untold miseries for not co-operating with the prosecution. Alauddin was an intellectual, a bohemian and bachelor, and left behind only a handful of friends to mourn his death.//////
