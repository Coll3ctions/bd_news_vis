No doubt the turbulence created by this railwaygate scam will add a new dimension to her worry.//////The recent eviction of slum dwellers from Karail slum without thinking where all these poor people would go and its effect on city dwellers put a big question mark. //////The recent scandal involving seventy lakh being carried purportedly to the railway minister's house is an issue that should be seriously addressed. Are there any government jobs available without paying bribes to the relevant authorities? Here in Bogra, over the years and under successive administrations, I tried to help people obtain government jobs for peons, hospital workers, sweepers and so on. My success rate has been zero. In every case, the candidates came back to me to say that a large amount of money has to be paid before their application could be accepted. I approached higher authorities, but their response was: "Signed approval must be brought from higher authorities," preferably ministerial approval.

Shahbagh bound vehicles coming from Jhigatola have to take a u-turn in front of City College since there is no straight road. This is the major reason of traffic congestion here. Passenger busses need more space to make a u-turn. So for providing the free space Mirpur bound vehicles are barred from accessing the left lane in front of City College. Again Shahbagh bound vehicles coming from Mirpur have to wait a long time in the signal. Thus severe traffic jam arises there. //////For long two and half months, my T&T phone (number 9669967) has been out of order. I lodged complaint to the T&T authorities several times. But they did not take any effective measures to restore the connection. I am paying the monthly bills regularly. Whenever I lodge any complaint, they do not want to hear anything, rather they behave very roughly. It is very unfortunate that in Bangladesh we are paying bills but do not get expected service. Rampant misuse of power has made the T&T officials inefficient. //////Please, will all (and not just some) of those who read the news in English on the Bengali media practice doing so beforehand, preferably with a tutor?//////An opinion on the matter of Padma Bridge project, published in the pages of a local English daily on 10th. April, was intriguing, to say the least! In my view, the saga of the 'Bridge' is more a mirage than substance. It is being planted in the public mind; more as a prop for re-election if anything else! That is possibly the main 'thrust', the rest 'bakhwas' or high decibel election chatter!//////Men in our society still believe that they have the right to be 'angry' as they work harder and play the key role in maintaining a family. A study has revealed that violence against women has a lot to do with uncontrollable fits of temper that their male counterparts experience from time to time.//////The above mentioned article by Dr. Abdul Matin in DS (02-04-2012) is, to say the least, very unfortunate. As a matter of fact Dr. Matin has been consistently writing on the subject with pragmatic ideas. If anybody or for that matter any authority with a serious mind to implement the project under reference, has gone through those articles they must have thought those as very relevant and that down to earth points have been raised in these articles. //////The UN Security Council has ordered tightened sanctions on North Korea over its failed rocket launch and warned of new action if the isolated state stages a nuclear test.//////Israel's defense minister yesterday said that Israeli military action against Iran remains an option even while nuclear negotiations are under way, and voiced strong doubts whether the talks would succeed.//////UN military observers acknowledged that they face a "difficult" job firming up a shaky ceasefire in Syria as five civilians were killed in fresh violence as it entered its sixth day.//////Agence France-Presse and the news websites Huffington Post and Politico each won their first Pulitzer Prizes Monday as the prestigious journalism awards highlighted global issues and online reporting.//////The United States has said that it will continue to press Islamabad to "squeeze" the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, as Afghanistan blamed the Pakistan-based group for the latest brazen attacks in Kabul.//////The man who killed 77 people in bomb and gun attacks in Norway last July yesterday boasted of his actions in a statement at his trial in Oslo.//////Australia said yesterday it would bring its troops home from Afghanistan a year earlier than planned with most soldiers withdrawn in 2013 after significant security gains over the past 18 months.//////The International Criminal Court could soon drop its demand that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi be transferred to the Hague for trial, officials told the BBC yesterday.//////Hollywood star Angelina Jolie will step up her work for the world's refugees following her promotion to United Nations special envoy, the UN refugee agency said yesterday.//////Osama bin Laden's family is expected to be deported from Pakistan early today, their lawyer and an intelligence official said, 11 months after the US raid that killed the al-Qaeda kingpin.//////Former guerrilla Taur Matan Ruak has won East Timor's presidential run-off by a wide margin, preliminary results showed yesterday, in a pivotal year for the nation almost a decade after independence.//////At the inaugural function of the three-day 11th Chittagong Hill Tracts Indigenous Cultural Festival, chief guest Chakma Raja Devasish Roy said that the 11 ethnic communities living in the hill tracts have distinct cultures and languages.

We want to share these fantastic Olympic and Paralympic Games with the people of Bangladesh and that's why my message to you today is this: "Welcome."//////Moudud Ahmed is not satisfied with Suranjit Sengupta's resignation from the government. If he had his way, he would have the entire government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina leave office for reasons of corruption and bad administration. Now that is an interesting point Moudud Ahmed raises. And it becomes all the more interesting because it is Moudud Ahmed who makes it. He began his career as part of the defence team for Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the Agartala Case in the late 1960s. Then came the great falling-out after the liberation of Bangladesh between the government and Moudud Ahmed. //////On April 8, President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari travelled to India. This was the first visit by a Pakistani head of state in seven years, and given the prickly bilateral relations the visit assumed a high profile. Ordinarily, in Europe a visit by a head of state/government to a neighbouring country is a routine matter but not so in South Asia.//////A number of leaders in the two main political parties -- Awami League (AL) and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) -- have taken us for granted. What else would explain their arrogance and complete disregard for the democratic values and wishes of the people. //////The budget for the next financial year will be placed in the Parliament, as a matter of regular practice, on the 2nd Thursday of June (June 14) and will have to be passed by the 30th. Generally Parliament sessions are not held on Fridays and Saturdays. If this practice is followed this year the Parliament will be left with ten working days only. Ten days for budget discussion in the Parliament, as well as consideration of comments from experts, professionals and stakeholders outside of Parliament, before finalising the proposals for both revenue and expenditure, will be too short a timeframe for such a nationally important and vital matter affecting each and everybody of the country. //////Twenty seven months have passed, but only about three percent work of a highway widening project in Chittagong have been done due to fund constraint, as the government so far has released only about two percent of the total allocation for the project. //////Around one hundred people who have got appointment letters for trade apprentice posts in Railway's east zone yesterday protested the suspension of recruitment process. //////Former Director of National Security Intelligence (NSI) Brig Gen (Retd) Enamur Rahman as a prosecution witness in the 10-truck arms haul cases submitted his deposition before a Chittagong court yesterday.//////
