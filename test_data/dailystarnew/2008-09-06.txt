A few weeks ago, agitation by students in the university area as well as Dhaka College led to mindless violence which resulted in the death of an innocent trader. And now come reports of the vandalism let loose by students at Pangu Hospital because of what has been described as a non-fulfilment of their demands. It may well be that the students were provoked into violence. But the point is that students being the enlightened people they are ought not to succumb to such provocation.//////The latest series of incidents centring around overseas Bangladeshi wage earners' demands has been reported from Jordan. They having resorted to strike since Sunday in an apparel factory protesting cutback in salaries and irregular payments were baton-charged and debarred entry into the premises. //////We have, over the last few days, been inundated with news about destruction being wrought by the Koshi River in Nepal and Bihar. The international electronic media has highlighted the plight of millions of flood affected people throughout this sub-region. Our domestic electronic media has also telecast reports of Teesta, Brahmaputra and the Dharla rivers crossing danger marks and marooning more than a quarter of a million people inside Bangladesh. Our Water Development Board has recently indicated that there is a possibility of 'moderate flooding' but most analysts consider such a prognosis as an under-estimation. There are already suggestions that a major flood may be underway by the end of the first week of September. On the other side there are more reports of draught in Ethiopia and Darfur.//////How cruel is the coincidence that the birthday of Mother Teresa, who embodied love for Indian children, should have fallen in the same week of August when two Christian children and their mother were burnt alive by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) at Khandmal district in Orissa. True, the naxalites have claimed that they have killed the Hindu mahant (priest), Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, because he had indulged in crimes against the Christians. But the naxalites' statement is taken with a pinch of salt. The Hindu extremists are said to be the real culprits. //////This is a third eye view of the fast developing political situation around the election process initiated by the caretaker government. Contrary to criticism in the media and in public mind, the present caretaker government has progressed well towards its main objective of holding a free, fair and credible election before the year is out.

Howsoever difficult and disconcerting it may be to punish the corrupt, we have to remember that punishing the bad hats is an urgent priority because we have to once for all put a stop to the rise of half-educated arrogant predators in the political arena. Surely we do not wish to see the return of the likes of those criminally disposed young members of parliament of Dhaka city and its periphery of the not-too- distant past. These fellows are now behind the bar and the sense of relief consequent upon their absence is there for anyone to see and appreciate.//////There are some persons in this planet of ours who do not need direct acquaintance for you to know them. I am not talking about a famous statesman or a celebrated writer or even a big artist. Rather I am talking about a professor who was truly educated, a real connoisseur of learning with high ethical standards. That a man of letters would prove a connoisseur of learning is not to be taken for granted in our given social context; because, for most of the educated class here, education is only a means to make a living. But the professor I am referring to here was a man of learning as well as a connoisseur of education; though he was not the one to make newspaper headlines. He was a renowned man, one who was and continues to be, honourably enshrined in our hearts.//////It's hard to imagine a balance sheet where the accounting matters more. In Asia, despite an ongoing boom, hundreds of millions of people still subsist on such meager incomes that any shift in the official poverty line can make conditions suddenly look brighter or bleaker -- at least on paper. //////When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the then US President George H.W. Bush proclaimed the start of a "new world order." Now that unbounded feeling of optimism perhaps has gone with the wind with the recognition of breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia of Georgia by Russia a couple of days back. This dramatic decision came following a big demonstration on August 20 by over 50 thousand people in Sukhumi, capital of Abkhazia province, demanding its recognition as an independent state by Russia. This demonstration was followed by the decision of the Parliament of Abkhazia to request Russia for recognition. The situation has been further complicated by Georgia breaking diplomatic relations with Russia.//////All over northern Bangladesh the practice of planting fruit trees in and near homestead and other lands is being undermined in recent decades. This has happened soon after the campaign of Social Forestry Programme publicising planting of certain quick-growing trees supposedly having higher timber-value. Earlier, many fruit-bearing trees have been the sources of extra income as well as of supplementary food and nutrition during the Monga crisis for many households. In particular, for example, seeds of jackfruits and creeper potato (Gachh Alu or Machh Alu)) stored earlier were used in case of food scarcity during the Monga period. The timber of jackfruit trees is also of great value for furniture making as well as for house construction. During the last three decades or so there has been a rush for planting cheap trees of foreign origin under the Social Forestry Programme of the government with the help of a number of NGOs and commercial nurseries in northern Bangladesh (also elsewhere in the country). //////China decided to continue measures adopted to tackle air pollution in Beijing on the eve of the Olympic Games to address environmental challenges despite recent improvement in its air quality. According to Du Shaozhong, Deputy Director of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, the treatment of heavy polluting vehicles and in some cases their removal will be accelerated. Authorities have plans to reduce dust from construction site to curb air pollution. //////The latest round of United Nations climate change negotiations took place in Accra, Ghana, from 21-27 August. The Accra Climate Change Talks took forward work on a strengthened and effective international climate change deal under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as work on emission reduction rules and tools under the Kyoto Protocol. This is part of a negotiating process that will be concluded in Copenhagen at the end of 2009. Over 1600 participants attended the Accra meeting, which was the third major UNFCCC gathering this year.//////Lunch called out the umpire as he delicately tipped one bail from on top of the wickets to the ground. The batsmen walked off the field with the fielding team and the two umpires following them. //////A film festival in a city like Dhaka is not a big deal for its dwellers, be it ////// or ////// or any other month. But when such a festival finds its way to a small town like Bagerhat--however small the monetary resources and funding for advertising and mass gathering!--it is quite an event, a breakthrough in the context of a small town. Especially when one considers that even Khulna, the divisional city, has no such venture. To fully understand the impact of the film society, one has to take into account the context. Bagerhat's filmgoers, much like other parts of the country, gradually shifted over to commercially-oriented Hindi films on the back of the gradual degradation of our national movie industry over the past two decades. It was during this critical time, in 2002, that Bagerhat Film Society, the brainchild of Abdullah Boni, was formed.With the slogan 'Better film, better society', a committee was formed on August 30 with S. Zakir Hossain as president, Abdullah Boni as secretary, and Mahmud Rahman as chief organizer. It has arranged five successful festivals so far, all held at the auditorium of Bagerhat Cultural Foundation located in the center of the town. June 2003 saw the first festival where Bagerhat's inhabitants were given a chance to view movies that till now were seen perhaps by only Dhakaites: Charlie Chaplin's 'The Kid' and the Polish Oscar-winner 'No Man's Land' as well as Bangla classics like Satyajit Roy's 'Gopi Gyne Bagha Byne'. However, as expected, turnout of an audience addicted to Hindi movies was poor.//////This special poetry issue of ////// reportedly has gone into its second printing, with reader demand outstripping supply the first time around.

But many of them can not perform it as there is a risk of an assortment of complications like hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, dehydration and thrombosis.//////Millions of Muslim started fasting with the advent of the holy month of Ramadan. During this month, health and diet issues are very important for all of us specially for the ailing and people living with specific health complications.//////Ibuprofen is better at alleviating childhood fever than paracetamol and should be the drug of first choice, say U.K. Researchers.////// Constipation can cause piles (haemorroids), fissures (painful cracks in anal canal) and indigestion with a bloated feeling. Too much refined foods, too little water and not enough fibre in the diet can cause constipation.//////Probably, the health benefits of fasting were known to our forefathers several centuries ago. For this entire month, Muslims will eat a pre-dawn meal and fast until sunset as they observe the holiest of months  Ramadan.//////Using the stairs at work instead of taking elevators could be a life saver.//////If you are a smoker, you can take the necessary steps to stop smoking this Ramadan.

Is political instability that was endemic in the pre-Koizumi era, coming back to Japan?

The emergence of urban poverty in Europe in the eighteenth century in the wake of industrialisation drew initial attention in a formal sense. Even till recently some people used to believe that the affluent West succeeded in striking out this evil even as it came to be revealed that at the fag end of the last century poverty still kept sticking out its ugly head, in no less a highly industrialised country than the United Kingdom. //////Nicholas Evans comes up with ////// with a picturesque description of life in the far outback of Montana, USA. The book begins with a heart-breaking accident showing how abruptly life can change. The realisation comes that we cannot expect life to be an endless calm sea. Sudden winds can set the sea to pounding with deadly waves. One fine crisp winter morning, Anne Graves finds her life in turmoil when her daughter Grace and her horse Pilgrim hit a 40-ton truck. Grace loses one leg and the horse is gravely injured. Grace had been riding with her friend Judith and her horse Gulliver. Judith and Gulliver, also hit by the truck, die on the spot. But the emotional and physical trauma of Grace and Pilgrim paralyses Annie's life. A morning that Annie had welcomed as the beginning of a beautiful day turns to a catastrophe. A mother cannot rest in peace until her child finds peace. And so Annie, a journalist, decides to believe in the healing of a mystic and heads out to Montana, to a horse whisperer. Horse whisperers are said to have the gift of healing troubled horses. Annie believes that Grace's recovery depends to a great extent upon the recovery of Pilgrim. She is ready to do the impossible and take the girl and the horse to the other end of the world in the hope that the horse whisperer will come up with miracles. //////
