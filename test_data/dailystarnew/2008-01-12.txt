Since 2008 must be the election year, as charted out in the roadmap of the Election Commission, the initiative for political dialogue must be taken immediately. //////The race for the US presidential nominations has suddenly turned rather electric for both Democrats and Republicans. With Hillary Clinton managing to scrape past Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary after her humiliating third place finish in the Iowa caucuses and John McCain beating Mitt Romney, the battle lines have clearly become more sharply drawn. The Republicans will yet have many more triumphs and tumbles amongst themselves to go through before anyone emerges as a clear frontrunner for the nomination. It is, however, the Democratic contest that has without question become the major focus of interest at this point.//////For quite some time there has been a clear felt need for re-assessing the numerous regulations that control the business environment in Bangladesh. Different surveys over the years have repeatedly re-affirmed that business activity in this country has been held back because of inherent unnecessary complexities. They have and continue to cast long shadows on our reputation as a business and investment destination.//////Our history will be what we make it. If we go on as we are, history will take revenge. This is as much truer of India as of other countries. Fear has got hold of us and we have compromised with the harshest laws and the blatant human rights violations. Our focus on security concerns actually generates repression. Terrorism has made us cast our society in such a way that we justify the excesses of state police or central forces. We are giving up too much.//////The Headmaster of our school used to assert the old adage, Where there is a will, there is a way.

On January 3, it even crossed the threshold and surpassed the $100 barrier. Although it almost immediately retreated to under $100, the record high price sent shockwaves across the economic world. The price of a barrel was $11 in 1998 and below $25 as recently as 2003. Even in the summer of 2007, the price had fallen to $60 a barrel. So, why is this sudden surge in the price of oil? //////Even after one month and a half the grim memories of the super cyclone Sidr that hit the coast of Bangladesh haunt the people there.

The car we owned was a small one, a Morris Minor, which my father had purchased second-hand when he was stationed in Dinajpur. However, Abba did not drive; and, while he had six sons, we were all very young when the Morris Minor joined our family. Soon thereafter, my older brother and I got our learner's permit--nonetheless, keeping a driver was still considered a necessity to take Abba to work and take us places. After I got my driver's license, I would always be on the lookout for an opportunity when the family car might be available, and take it out for a spin. Initially, I'd have an escort, the family driver, but soon I would take the car out all by myself and drive around in the Ramna area where we lived, or in the Dhaka University area where I was studying. //////To be or not to bea Nationalist!//////I was patted down expertly. Security was tight at the Indian vice-president's residence. Which, fittingly enough, since he was a Muslim, was on Maulana Azad Road -- Maulana Abul Kalam Azad having been the most prominent Muslim Congressman opposed to the 1947 partition. Our names were checked off against a list cleared for entry, after which came the metal detector gate. Only then were Ritu Menon (publisher of Women Unlimited, a Delhi feminist publication enterprise) and I free to walk on the long driveway curving towards a classic Raj-era bungalow set amidst croquet-quiet green lawns. //////Nurul lives in Feni//////near the //////It is difficult to pin down the real nature of the crisis in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan.

It is an empirical treatise on the history and monuments of Sonargaon.//////Thirty six years ago Bangladesh started its journey as a nation-state with great promise of a common national identity, democracy, social and economic justice, and religious non-discrimination or secularism. Soon the high ideals of the War of Liberation were vitiated by the seizure of state power by counter-revolutionary forces. The country went under military rule for 15 years following the coup d'etat of August 1975. It experienced changes of the governance system a number of times multiparty parliamentary democracy (1972-1974) to one-party presidential system (1975); military rule (1975-1990); again, multi-party parliamentary system (1991-to date). Democratic institutions, values, traditions, practices and procedures can hardly grow in such an unstable situation. The re-introduction of the multi-party parliamentary system in 1991 did not improve the overall situation much. For five consecutive years, both under the BNP and Awami League government, Bangladesh topped the Transparency International list as the most corrupt country in the world. Elections scheduled to be held in January 2007 could not take place because of disagreement between the two major power contending parties around the composition of the caretaker government, Election Commission and necessary electoral reforms. //////The blurb of New Europe could not have introduced the book better. It is classic Palin in action, Palin the writer that is. I would assume that Palin is well-known as an actorremember Monty Python's exciting comedy, Life of Brian? In Britain, however, Palin is acclaimed also as a TV presenter. His travel documentaries for the BBC ('Around the World in 80 Days', 'Pole to Pole', 'Himalaya', to name a few) have been great favourites. In fact, New Europe is based on his travels for the BBC to the East European countries, newly freed from Cold Wars and Iron Curtains. No need to mention that like the other ones, this documentary ended triumphantly; to be specific, the last episode created a record of at least a million viewers. Palin the writer is no less entertaining. ////// is a collection of three prose poems that will give the readers a real taste of modern, that is, modernist poetry. The work is a sharp evaluation and focuses on the past, present and future of the United Nations. After a close perusal of Sinha M A Sayeed's works, one does not find much of an uncomplicated task tracing the exact shadow of the poet's mind. It is quite clear that he is a modernist in a complete sense. His poetic style is undoubtedly very distinctive, individualised and enlightening. In the book, Sayeed has tried to concentrate on the present and past images of the United Nations. He shows up a vision as to what the image of the United Nations can mean for us all. The UN is an international organisation whose avowed aim is to facilitate cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress and human rights issues.//////A well-researched, thoroughly readable book on the Mughals.
