She has prescribed the time limit of the plan as 'not more than 15 years'. She has suggested that the plan should start with excavating river Gorai as its work progressed much during the last AL regime (1996-2001). Unfortunately,4-party government stopped it along with other dredging projects on political consideration completely ignoring the fact that economic and humanitarian consideration should always remain above political consideration, particularly in a poor developing country such as Bangladesh. Such a whimsical decision of the said government resulted in increase of people's misery and wastage of huge public money. //////In third world countries the judiciary evokes a god-like faith.

It is interesting to see, though, how he evolved from a common man, from an uncle or father, into a literary giant in the eyes of his close relatives and friends. //////The year: 1972. The month: February. The place: the main entrance to the Dhaka University Arts building hallway. The time: afternoon. Three or four of us, all students of that institution, were lounging on the long brown wooden bench that was placed adjacent to the high left wall of the entrance. All the three gargantuan heavy wooden doors with elaborate carvings were wide open, symbolically announcing that the massive building, looking more like an enormous lump of concrete rather than exuding any aesthetic aura, was open to entry and egress. The late winter sun, giving off wan rays, would, before long, be disappearing over the horizon in a blaze of red glory.//////I see a young woman walking alone at midday//////through the alley's sun-drenched silence.//////Standing with a hand on the window grill//////I wonder where she will go.//////A complete stranger//////yet for an unknown reason//////a shadow of affection for her,//////redolent of the scent of rain on dry earth//////descends on my soul.//////I wonder if she will walk like this//////one day and enter a slimy darkness//////or if unfathomable moonlight//////will rain on her the rich pollen//////of passionate love?//////But let her rest//////for the moment//////in the serai of these lines.//////Articles, critiques, short stories and poems may be sent by e-mail, fax and post to the Literary Editor.

The rising number of cases every day and increase in death rate in some countries made it a serious concern. But experts in influenza and infectious disease are still saying the exact level of danger from the virus is still far from certain.//////For the last few days swine flu is all over the news. Especially parents are really worried about their children, as childrens immunity is unlike a healthy adult. They catch normal flues easily. They also closely mix with each other when they are in school. And once they get infected or start undergoing treatment, sometimes they cannot express their symptoms properly.//////Information on the effectiveness of facemasks and respirators for decreasing the risk of influenza infection in community settings is extremely limited. In the absence of clear scientific data, the interim recommendations below have been developed on the basis of public health judgment, the historical use of facemasks and respirators in other settings for preventing transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses and on current information on the spread and severity of the novel swine flu virus.//////* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick//////* Swine flu is a misnomer and should not be used to describe the current H1N1 outbreak in the human population.

In an initial reaction to the pressures thus generated on Pakistan, the then Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed was quoted as claiming that Pakistan would not be coerced into signing CTBT in disregard to its vital security interests. However, in an attempt to deal with the political backlash of nuclear testing in the form of sanctions by the international community, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif while addressing the 53rd session of the United Nations General Assembly stated that, Pakistan has consistently supported the conclusion of a CTBT for over 30 yearsIn a nuclearized South Asia, CTBT would have relevance if Pakistan and India are both parties to the Treaty. However, Pakistan's adherence to the Treaty will take place only in conditions free from coercion or pressure.//////The soldiers of the Pakistan army had their job cut out for them on the night of 25 March 1971. When they reached Gobinda Chandra Dev's quarters in the residential quarters of Dhaka University within hours of the commencement of the genocide, they wasted no time. They simply pumped their bullets into Dev. The philosopher, revered all over Pakistan for his insights into life and all that it symbolized, collapsed. There was no chance he would live. The life had already gone out of him. Dev's corpse would soon be dumped into a mass grave the Pakistanis had some of their victims dug. In a matter of moments, the man who had spent his living years going through one sacrifice after another --- he did not marry, he did not opt for India when the partition of the country took place --- was dead and gone. In death, he assumed a new symbolism, that of a nation suddenly pounced upon by a horde of men masquerading as politicians and soldiers come from what was then West Pakistan. Dev died that night, or in the first light of the next day, as did thousands of others, as millions of Bengalis would in the months to follow.//////Only a few textbooks in Bangla are available in the field of genetics and plant breeding and biotechnology.
