It has been amazing watching the unfolding drama initiated recently by comments made by Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, the Secretary General of the Jamaat-e-Islami political party. His claim that 'anti-liberation forces never even existed' was not only a classical example of distortion of truth and denial of history but also a slap on our national conscience and the glorious struggle that eventually led to our liberation and independence. This demeaning assertion also reflected total disrespect for the countless martyrs who lost their lives, the tens of thousands of women who were dishonoured and the eleven million people who were displaced and became refugees during 1971.//////The best ////// is to speak the truth before an unjust ruler.

Among them a vast number are absolutely landless not even having any homestead. And the number of this landless people is gradually on the rise, never decreasing. Yet no effective or dynamic step has been taken to establish the right of the landless on all kinds of khas resources including agricultural land and waterbodies to check this disastrous trend. Even if some demonstrative steps were taken sometimes, its continuity, too, was not maintained, on the otherhand the land grabbing circle is continuously occupying all kinds of khas resources of the country under different garbs. In some cases the problem is extreme indifference of administration, in others, non-neutrality and unfavourable mind-set, which have kept this grabbing process going. As a result social discrimination and deprivation have spread further instead of diminishing. Thus have increased rich-poor gap, food insecurity, man-woman disparity and many other problems.//////Barisal have a chance to sneak up on league leaders Rajshahi and Khulna who face each other in the fourth round of the 9th National Cricket League at the Shaheed Birshreshtha Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna today.//////Twin centuries to Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey gave Australia's scorecard a familiar look for their first Test innings of the home summer, which Ricky Ponting finally closed at 4 for 551.

One stroke of brilliance from India could have ended Pakistan's challenge but Younis stood firm. He added 102 in 12.4 overs with Misbahul Haq, who has one of the coolest heads in run-chases, and the partnership drastically reduced India's victory hopes.//////The appointment of Anil Kumble as India captain for only three Tests is too short to serve as a proper stop-gap arrangement, former Indian players say.//////The Los Angeles Galaxy have hired former European Player of the Year Ruud Gullit as their new head coach, the Major League Soccer club announced Thursday. //////Michael Hussey shook off his fears over a short Test lead-up to register his sixth Test century and continue an impressive rebuild of Australia's team after the loss of three greats.

This happens in a country where agriculture is the mainstay of people's living. The country has till now 70 per cent of its workforce in farming though agriculture's contribution to GDP has dropped from about 30 per cent in the '80s to about 15 per cent now. The crisis was brewing up long before but in the uproar of banal politics dominated by self-serving politicians, all such bad signals were not taken heed of. The country only woke up to this crisis when food prices started rising up in the market.//////In the international arena unfort-unately the negative side of Bangladesh's image gets prominence. Bangladesh is more recognised as a country of hunger, poverty and natural disasters abroad. And above all these, during the recent years Bangladesh has put on the black seal of widespread state level corruption while religious fundamentalist groups also have made an awful rise. Too much negative statements about Bangladesh have appeared in foreign media. Despite all this, often praiseworthy activities of some organisations and individuals from Bangladesh on foreign soil have significantly contributed towards building a positive image of the country and brightened its face. Here the microcredit programme deserves special mention.//////The rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT) and the spread of the internet have ushered in unprecedented changes in industry structure around the world, changing principal constituents of every business.//////The United Nations (UN), Google and Cisco has recently unveiled a pioneering online site that tracks progress towards decreasing global poverty by 2015, a global campaign known as the Millennium Development Goals, or MDGs. //////The Commonwealth Secretariat in association with Bangladesh Enterprise Institute (BEI), Bangladesh Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BWCCI) and Digital Knowledge Foundation are currently implementing a pilot project to spread the blessing of ICT among rural people. //////Facebook on Tuesday began delivering ads to members based on what they do and who they know, following in the footsteps of social networking rival MySpace and triggering Internet privacy concerns.//////Orchir was born on the 24th of //////. It was just after noon that the rain came pelting down. In that rain the mango trees at the bend of the road at Shantinagar and the single-storey house dissolved to become as one. By the time one came to the verandah on this side from the other side it was like the Meghna-Jamuna crashing headlong into each other. A household's daily life supposedly has its portion of tears. Compared to human tears the raindrops were like well-buckets. And in the month of ////// came Agniborna--Orchir's daughter. The sky was clear the day she was born, when Bangladesh had bloomed. That day was the day Bangladesh was born. That girl is now four years old. She can smell the rain's scent. Suddenly she'll sniff the air and say, I smell rain. Even the ants know about the coming rain. Even when all around is nothing but a desolate sunshine, when not even scraps of cloud can be seen in the sky, one will spy columns of ants marching on floors or up walls. Sure enough, not even an hour goes by when suddenly a shadow settles on the earth, darkness walks in from all sides, and then the dense rain. Are they twins, these children and insects who can foretell rain? Or do they simply sense it, pick up the scent or some change in the wind or in nature? Our Tara Miah, on the other hand, can't foretell a damn thing. Like the bullock tied to a stake beside the hayrick. Even as the rain slants down Tara Miah would muse, Ah, I suppose it's finally coming down, eh? The bullock would be placidly chewing cud with the rope slung around its neck -- but then, was it its job to explore life's boundless mysteries?//////Some readers may be disappointed when they realize that Manil Suri is not in the process of penning the last part of a trilogy.

This includes ultimate control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which tankers ferry about 40% of the world's daily oil needs. In the USA, both the Republican and Democratic Parties share the same view as regards the Middle-Eastern oil producing nations. Any oil-rich country in the Middle East that refuses to sufficiently cooperate with US economic and strategic designs in the Middle East will face punishment in the form of isolation and militarily threat. An armed confrontation between the United States and Iran, and an Israeli entry into the conflict, may embroil the entire region in a state of war. Consequences of such a war will be catastrophic. //////The return of 54-years-old Benazir Bhutto, former prime minister of Pakistan, from self-exile on 18 October was marred by bomb attacks and bloodbath and raises the question: who was behind these acts? Will the current political equation be result oriented? Both leaders being archenemies having personal animosity, it is beclouded for the moment with Musharraf having an edge.//////One of the questions asked by the West for sometime is Whither Islam?meaning where the Islamic world is going. This has become an accentuated issue after Professor Samuel Huntington published his book Clash of Civilisations in 1996. //////The development process at fundamental levels presupposes the existence of skilled personnel and effective management to ensure that the personnel involved can put in their best efforts toward achieving successfully the targeted development objectives. But Bangladesh seems to be unfortunate on both counts. The assumption that Bangladesh lacks skilled personnel is becoming increasingly clear because of its persistent inability to get out of the low growth trap. This is largely due to the inefficiencies of public sector officialdom and workforce, and their inability to plan and manage the development and service delivery process. //////The ////// is a properly illustrated, lovely book on the Rakhaines of Bangladesh.

The book has a number of coloured photographs on Rakhaine life at the end. Qayyum Chowdhury has designed its appealing cover.
