Can't the authorities do anything about this? People wasting water by washing cars with hosepipe or spraying the road on a dry, hot day are common sights in the city. It is disturbing to see such wastage, especially when the city is reeling under water crisis. When few buckets will suffice pipes fixed to taps are used with uninterrupted flow of water. This is done even when people in the adjacent building are without water. Why is there such scant awareness about vital issues though they may seem trivial? The authorities must step in and take up measures regarding such issues so that our irresponsible acts do not have negative impact on society.//////These days drug addiction is the new menace in Khulna city. Day by day this problem is increasing . Many youngsters like school and college going students are falling victim to addiction. Young students take drugs just to find a temporary pleasure. They are caught in the death trap. Slowly but surely they are led to death.//////Life has become a living hell to the old Dhaka dwellers due to constant load-shedding. It occurs every hour, even at night. Sometimes I am just forced to think is it really load-shedding or discrimination? Because, in the newer part, it happens hardly three times a day, whereas in older areas it takes place 11 hours a day. This is the reality.//////The AL government's announcement to try war criminals is certainly a milestone in our history. The people of Bangladesh, especially the young generation of the country, have been eagerly waiting to see the punishment of those criminals (they are not only collaborators, criminals too!). We can justify the punishment for a variety of reasons, but I particularly focus on two reasons for this://////It had to happen sooner rather than later. Dhaka has achieved its questionable 'goal' as the dirtiest, most difficult and unliveable major city in the world. After being the most corrupt nation 5 years running, did we deserve this as well? Is the government solely responsible for this 'accolade'? Not at all, in a way we all, Dhakabashis, have contributed our mite by our senselessness, insensitiveness, indiscipline, dirty habits and our headlong rush towards easy money.//////Over the past couple of week, we have witnessed a significant number of terrible crimes, in the name of peer-rivalry, rejection in love relation, committed by youths who are even below 25. While the government is responsible for the over-all deteriorating law and order situation of the country, for these particular incidents, I want to hold parents responsible. What are the parents doing these days? Don't they have any control over their children? Especially with respect to a male child, our family culture is always terribly biased. Even as a little child when a boy becomes angry, we pamper it, and find a kind of pleasure seeing our sons' turning into the proper 'Masculine'. And most of the time, these children see ,within their households, that their mothers or sisters are dominated and dictated by the male members, without giving a slightest care about what they want. Therefore, the boys of our society grow up with a terrible sense of superiority, we credit them for what they are not, and we are afraid of their anger when they should be taught basic human nature of tolerance and respect. All these malpractices within a household produce disarray and confused children who become easily gullible to project the worth in the most appalling manner. To end my letter, I want to request all the parents of today, instead of teaching your children (irrespective of boy or girl) that when they grow up they need to be doctors, engineers or barristers, please teach them the basic human qualities, set example before them of love and respect for all. Otherwise, it is not that far that we will find young people, going to such and such schools, colleges and universities to be enlightened, but taking lives and committing crimes as if they belong to the age of darkness. //////My attention was drawn to the letter written by Mr. Pradip Das on the above mentioned subject. Sarat Chandra, the great novelist of 20th century with a 19th century mindset, made female characters suffer unnecessarily! I first read the novel when I was in grade 7 or 8. I felt for Devdas and probably cried for him. Then I read the same book again after completing my masters degree. This time around I did not feel anything for Devdas. There is nothing manly in this weak character that could attract me. Rather my heart was filled with sympathy for Parvati! She was the last person who could be blamed for the unfortunate events that unfolded in their lives.//////It is almost 40 years into independence. It is high time to ask what have we achieved over the years apart from an identity and tons of problems. I do not mean to say that things would have been better if it were still Pakistan. The situation in Pakistan is rather worse than in Bangladesh, the nature of problems being different. //////Following apprehension of some unlawful activities, operation of certain wireless fixed phone companies has been put on suspension. As a result, the subscribers to these wireless phone services have been thrown into unjust sufferings for no fault of theirs. In these days of hassle-prone fixed land phones as the lines mostly remain inoperative, cross connected, and there is the additional problem of cable theft, wireless fixed phone came as a boon for the telephone users.//////The government as well as the authorities concerned have given due importance to learning English.//////Recently BTRC started to take actions against illegal VoIP operations and in the process closed down five land phone operators. Well, if any operator does anything illegal, it is liable to be punished. But, how justified is it to close down the whole operation of the land phone operators? The land phone operators were given licence to offer services for fixed line operation, although the wireless technology they use allows them to offer mobility to the customers. As far as I know, these operators do not offer mobile service to customers. They try to make business by offering fixed line services to places and customers where BTCL is unable to provide satisfactory service or connections. As per the regulation, they can face competition from BTCL, but not supposed to face business competition from the mobile operators. But, in reality, is it so? The Public Call Offices (PCOs) in the rural areas and mobile phone shops in the cities offer fixed phone service using mobile phones from the mobile operators. As far as I know this is illegal. So, the fixed line operators are losing business heavily. But, BTRC is allowing this business of the mobile companies. Is it fair? When mobile operators were found with illegal VoIP, they were fined heavily, but their switch rooms were not put under lock and key. Instead of imposing a heavy fine as punishment if the fixed line operators are found guilty, why their switch rooms are closed down? I am not sure whose interest BTRC is serving by closing these fixed line operators, while thousands of their customers are suffering.//////As the nation celebrates the 39th anniversary of independence, of freedom from oppression, of standing up against a significant 'them', of a call to unite and fight for our motherland, one may wonder where 'we' are now, or if 'we' as a concept exist in present day Bangladesh at all. On 26 March 1971, it was 'us' against 'them', a fight for our freedom, a fight for respect. On 26 March 2010, it is 'us' against 'them' all around, but, unfortunately, now it is nothing but a fight for political supremacy, power and the systematic annihilation of each other.//////Every morning I travel by Khulna town service bus to my college. There I see the helpers and driver smoke frequently. Passengers sitting behind the driver suffer most. Helpers also cause the same problem to the window side passengers. I complained a few times, however, they didn't care. Smoking in public vehicles is illegal.//////Holy Week is a time when we fast with joy, submitting ourselves to spiritual struggles in preparation for the sorrowful Passion and joyful Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ. //////Sri Lanka placed nearly 20,000 troops on alert to reinforce police as violence escalated ahead of parliamentary elections, a police spokesman said yesterday.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai has slammed Western backers for the second time in a week, accusing the United States of interference, The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday.//////Accusing "regressive forces" of conspiring against the timely drafting of new Constitution, Nepal's opposition Maoists chief Prachanda yesterday said it must be promulgated by the May 28 deadline to save the country from those opposing federalism, republicanism and secularism.//////Security forces killed 38 militants in two separate operations yesterday in an area near the Afghan border where the army recently launched an offensive targeting the Pakistani Taliban, a local official said.//////In an attempt to garner public support, US Marines engaged in an intense battle with the Taliban in Marja, have been offering thousands of dollars a week to the local residents as compensation for property damage, but the move has backfired as the insurgents are using the same money against the international forces stationed in Afghanistan.//////Southeast Asian nations on the shrinking lower Mekong River began talks with China yesterday over fears that its dams are further depleting the waterway, which is at its lowest levels in decades.//////Delhi Police yesterday carried out mock security drills at the India Gate and the Supreme Court complex here to check operational preparedness and review security in the capital.//////On his first visit to the heart of Naxal territory in West Bengal, Union Home Minister P Chidambaram yesterday ruled out involvement of military in anti-Maoist operations and made a fresh offer of dialogue with the left-wing extremists.//////Indian troops yesterday shot dead two suspected militants after they sneaked into Indian Kashmir from the Pakistani-zone of the disputed region, an army spokesman said.//////Rejecting as "preposterous and completely unwarranted" the allegations that it is stealing Pakistan's share of river waters and waging a water war, India has said it is "scrupulously" providing Islamabad its share of water in line with the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.//////Three suicide car bombs targeting the Iranian and Egyptian embassies rocked Baghdad yesterday, killing 30 people in a surge of violence as Iraqis struggle to form a government four weeks after elections.//////Iran said yesterday it will host a nuclear disarmament conference this month to be attended by China, which has been resisting new sanctions against Tehran over its atomic ambitions.//////Thailand's government yesterday said it would seek a court order to force anti-government protesters, loyal to ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, to end their crippling rally in Bangkok's tourist hub.//////A bomb blast derailed a freight train in Russia's North Caucasus republic of Dagestan yesterday, a police official said.//////The United States has announced new security measures to replace the mandatory screening of air travellers from 14 countries, imposed after the failed attack on a flight in December.//////Scores of protesters in Kyrgyzstan have clashed with police in Bishkek as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, visited the Kyrgyz capital.//////North Korea's Kim Jong Il hosted a weekend dinner in Pyongyang for the new Chinese ambassador, state media reported yesterday, indicating the reclusive communist leader has not embarked on a much-speculated trip to Beijing.//////It's just another day at Khilgaon Model High School.
