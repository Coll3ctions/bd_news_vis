The loss takes place in various ways -- but most of all due to the connivance of some of its corrupt officials and employees who dispense illegal services to those willing to pay for illegal benefits. //////HUMBUG is what has often been the BNP's forte. During her fairly long years in polities and two stints as prime minister, the party supreme mastered well the art of gobbledygook and developed a malignant arrogance that borders on paranoia.

As we have seen, Bangladesh cricket is not attracting spectators these days (The tri-nation tournament is an example). The main reason is poor performance. As a cricket fan of the Tigers, I believe and agree with the rest of my fellow cricket fans that our performance is nose-diving. But there are many reasons behind it too. I would blame Poor Team Selection & Excessive Publicity among many reasons for the nose dive. //////It is a matter of great concern that the quality of the air of the big cities of our country is deteriorating at an alarming pace. Fumes from the industries, vehicular emissions, smoke from the brickfields--all contribute to the degradation of the quality of air. According to a study the amount of lead in Dhaka's air is 463 nanograms per cubic meter---the highest in the world. The very smell of the city's air is sickening--to say the least.//////In the latest development, the CID has submitted report to Dhaka Metropolitan Court implicating 22 persons in the gruesome attack.

It is indeed a very reasonable approach, which should be a lesson for our city planners and the people at the top. They should read, understand and implement the ideas put forward in the article.//////The people of the United States should elect a man as their president who will have the energy and sagacity to deal with the challenges of our times.//////I am writing this letter in response to what eminent jurist Dr. Kamal Hossain and convener of the newly formed Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) Dr Quershi had to say regarding the temporary release of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Although I have tremendous level of respect for both of these house-hold names in Bangladeshi politics, but it disheartens me to see that none of these leaders see the reality of the situation. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in his book quite rightly put it, when he said that it is very difficult to integrate idealism with realism. It seems to me that his saying can hold true for the statements and comments made by these two eminent politicians. It is sad to see that they have not been able to see the reality of the situation and rather has stuck by their idealistic nature. Now let us face the reality, the release of Sheikh Hasina and also that of Begum Khaleda Zia is needed to ensure that their respective political parties take part in the upcoming elections and also to lend credibility to the election process. Simultaneously, we would also like to see the return to democracy in Bangladesh. Keeping that in mind, I therefore urge our politicians to consider the reality of the situation. The people of this country want a return to democracy which is only possible through a credible, free and fair election. //////To pave the way for smooth implementation of the election roadmap, the govt is opening up all roads for politicians to participate in the election.//////The caretaker government has freed Sheikh Hasina, seemingly for better treatment abroad. It's fine with us. Most likely, it will also let go Khaleda Zia in the coming days on a similar pretext. That would be fine, too. What is baffling, and perhaps not right, is that our envoys greeted her in London and Boston. It sends a wrong signal. Here is a nation that accuses its leaders of serious wrongdoings and the next day treats them as VVIPs! We understand that there may be reasons to make deals with the two ex-prime ministers to secure a safe exit, but this is not the way to go about. We also hear about other measures on the card, such as releasing confiscated properties of politicians serving jail terms, and letting them participate in elections.//////It is heartening news that the much-talked about construction of the direct link road from Bangladesh up to the national road of Myanmar is going to start next year. //////Reference to the report published in The Daily Star on 25 May 2008.//////Corruption had been a buzzword. It is now widely believed that due to the anti- corruption drive led by the interim govt, corruption has decreased. The government's crusade against corruption has succeeded to a great extent as they nabbed notorious criminals. Among the corrupt, many politicians are now languishing in jail. //////An estimated 158 million children aged 5-14 are engaged in child labour - one in every six children in the world. Millions of children are engaged in hazardous jobs or conditions, such as working in mines, working with chemicals and pesticides or working with dangerous machinery. They are everywhere but invisible, toiling as domestic servants in homes, labouring behind the walls of workshops, hidden from view in plantations. Children living in the poorest households in rural areas are most likely to be engaged in child labour. //////Recently, there was an article by a Professor of BUET (?) on the future of Dhaka city NOT being via any of the expensive but ineffective proposals to 'improve' its transport systems but via a government policy to empty the city of many of its inhabitants by moving many government offices to some major provincial centres around the country that should be encouraged to develop a life of their own. //////First of all, I would like to thank the higher authorities for taking a wonderful step, that is, the counter-service for all transports. Most probably, it has been introduced for the first time in Chittagong. It has been introduced for ensuring better passenger service. It was our expectation that we people would enjoy a more comfortable transport service. We want to reach our destinations in due time. At the same time, it will partially stop traffic blockage here & there. But it is an irony that in our country it is very tough to implement the rules & policies. //////In the primaries Change is the jingle that Obama has stamped in the American mind. His winning the Democratic presidential nomination against the impressive Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady, confirms an aspiration to see life differently among many of his countrymen. When the Republicans are beset by countless messy affairsboth internal and international, of the Bush administration, what could be better for a Democratic presidential hopeful than gaining precious electoral currency by pressing for a change? Mr. Obama is wise enough not to miss it and so finds himself in the position to become the 44th American president. //////Nato launched a pair of artillery strikes across the border into Pakistan after attackers hiding there fired a barrage of rockets into Afghanistan that killed a woman and three children, officials said yesterday. //////Dozens of Palestinian lorry drivers waited to load their goods in the scorching sun on Sunday as Israel said it had started to ease its blockade of Gaza on the fourth day of a truce in and around the territory.//////India has signalled to Sri Lanka that it wants to see an end to the island's military campaign to help solve the decades-old Tamil separatist conflict, diplomats and officials said yesterday.//////Pakistan's nuclear programme will continue unabated and it will not be compromised, according to President Pervez Musharaf.//////The Pakistani Frontier Corps has been heavily infiltrated and influenced by Taliban militants, according to classified US documents appeared in a daily here yesterday. //////Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai quit the country's bitterly fought run-off election on Sunday, saying the vote cannot be free and fair.//////Early general election is a mere possibility in India despite the standoff between India's Congress-led government and its Left allies over Indo-US nuclear deal and sudden withdrawal of support by Mayawati-led BSP.//////Pakistan will hold talks with Kashmiri separatist leaders before starting the next round of the Composite Dialogue with India later this month, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said.//////Indian troops shot dead four militants on Saturday in revolt-hit Kashmir after the rebels snuck across a militarised border from adjoining Pakistan, police said.//////Iran yesterday dismissed reports that Israel had been practising for air strikes against its nuclear drive as "psychological operations" but warned of a limitless response to any attack.//////More than 10,000 British soldiers are unfit for frontline duty as the pressure of supplying troops for years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan takes its toll on the army, the Sunday Telegraph reported.//////A Harvard University dropout who ushered in the home computer age and made billions of dollars along the way will have his last official day of work at Microsoft on June 27.//////The number of girls to boys in India has hit a record low, British charity ActionAid said on Saturday as it urged the government in New Delhi to take "sustained action" to prevent a lost generation of women.//////Pakistani authorities yesterday reported a new outbreak of avian flu at a commercial poultry farm in the country's northwest, killing thousands of birds, officials said.//////Tamil Tiger rebels yesterday set off a roadside mine killing two police commandos in eastern Sri Lanka, the defence ministry said.//////Safiuddin Ahmed, whose exhibition is currently being held at the Bengal Gallery to celebrate his 86th birthday, is the oldest celebrated artist alive in Bangladesh.
