Such measures are exactly what the economy needs at this moment, and there can be no substitute for them if we wish to survive the current world-wide food and oil price hikes.//////MORE than a thousand students of Dhaka University have a hard time finding accommodation, or sleeping space, in their residential halls. And more than five hundred of these students are forced to make do with sleeping on the floors of mosques and corridors. That, briefly, is a hint of the predicament that the young engaged in academic pursuits at the nation's most significant institution of higher learning go through on a daily basis. Indeed, the situation appears to have worsened progressively over the past few years. While one reason is the increasingly higher number of students getting admitted to the university annually, another and a more worrying one is the allegation that a good number of former students continue to occupy residential seats they ought to have vacated a long time ago. //////THIRTEEN is an arithmetical number, but for various reasons 13 is considered a number carrying a special significance in many cultures. It is the number of participants at the Last Supper; Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, was the 13th to sit at the table. Since then, 13 has been regarded as an unlucky number.//////ONE often wonders how a country like the US, that has been the beacon for freedom in the twentieth century, could have become so unpopular and illiberal. The framers of the US constitution, John Quincy Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and their successors, FDR, Jack Kennedy, Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, shared the liberal tradition not only in their own land but were also inclined to promote and preserve human rights in other countries. //////WITH the Indian mujahideen claiming responsibility for the bomb blasts in Jaipur, the three main countries of South Asia have acquired the distinction of having their own Islamic militant organisations. In Bangladesh, they operate under the name of Harkat-ul-Jihadul Islamiya (HuJI). In Pakistan Lashkar-e-Toiba is one among the many. This will at least obviate the necessity of playing the blame game that militants coming from across the border indulge in sabotage. //////Bangladesh will heavily miss the absence of a genuine playmaker in the side when they compete in the SAFF Football Championship early next month.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) yesterday announced the ticket rates for the upcoming tri-series involving Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.//////The first leg of the Green Delta Premier Hockey League concludes today with a mouth-watering top-of-the-table clash between defending joint champions Abahani and Usha Krira Chakra.//////Bangladesh women's handball team lost their first match against India by 7-28 in the 3rd South Asian Women's Handball Championship in Lucknow yesterday.//////The Tigers practice will resume on Wednesday for next month's tri-series involving India and Pakistan.//////A fantastic century from Sumon propelled Narayanganj to the semifinals after a clinical 53-run win over Nilphamari in the 28th National Cricket Championship in Sylhet yesterday.//////New Zealand dominated the second day's play at Old Trafford with Ross Taylor's magnificent 154 providing the backbone behind a solid first innings of 381.

For the first time a special session on a thematic issue is being held at the Council. Bangladesh, a co-sponsor of the session, reckons that there could not have been a more worthy subject for this maiden special session, i.e. the state of Right to Food in the face of brewing global food crisis. //////In the last couple of months I have faced a barrage of questions on call centres that range from 'what are they' to 'how do you set them up'. But interestingly nobody asked the obvious 'how do you make money at it', indicating that most people are convinced it's a money spinner and they are destined to claim a share of this cyber (read virtual) bounty in no time. Well, whether call-centres can make you really rich or leave you with a bag of airy day-dreams really depends on your due diligence before you start one, but then again tell me for which business it is not true.//////Dhaka stocks maintained a bearish trend last week with all the indices gaining amid irrational price hike in mutual funds, insurance and leasing company shares.//////Standard

But, that very desired democracy is like the golden deer to us. We dream of it but cannot materialise it.

How would you really define the event? A simple case of anarchy? An usual agitation? Or something which carries an immense impact and does make you concerned? I don't know how you have considered the occurrence and it does not really matter in this country what someone thinks, wants to express etc. Because this country is simply run by something which I define as 'Black Magic', and of course this Black Magic lies far away from the hands of common innocent people who have already deleted the word 'human rights' from their lexicon. //////Hirsh's article is an open encouragement to set Israel upon Iran, with the blessings of US, the only aggressor nation along with Israel, in the world today. Naturally in military might, the odds are against Iran with Israel having total access to US weapon technology, and with nuclear weapons to boot! Hirsh, an anointed US warmonger, is openly pushing Israel to strike Iran before it can increase its weaponry, albeit through Russian blessings!//////This refers to a news item along with the photograph of a student leader being chopped by his party men on DU campus published in a Dhaka daily on 13.04.2008. //////This refers to the letter on 15 May on the above subject. The content of the letter is indeed disturbing and is a matter of shame that a high official of the government of Bangladesh could steal hotel items on his departure and was caught at the KL airport, Malaysia. May we expect the government to investigate the matter immediately and take punitive action against this officer-turned-thief. We presume that it is his habit and he may have committed many such offences at home and has now dared to venture abroad with his act!//////Radio Aamar Fm 101.6 Fm is airing a weekly special programme 'Aamar Bhalobahsa' on every Thursday from 12:00am to 2:00am where people get the opportunity to share their untold love stories with the listeners. It is a unique programme, especially in Bangladesh context since for the first time in our electronic media's history, people here are getting the chance to directly express their love related affair. Sometimes people share their sweet love stories, while most of the times people share their bitter experiences. The host of the show, namely Love Guru gives valuable suggestions to his guests. This programme is helping a vast majority of our population about the true essence of love and how we should keep a relationship in an honest and proper way. These days quite a lot of teenagers of our society are involved in various sorts of crimes after getting rejected by the opposite sex. Sometimes they are even committing suicide because of getting rejected. This programme is motivating those youths to live their life to the fullest. It is inspiring them to take the correct decision which will be beneficial for them and for society. Thus this programme is helping our society a lot. There is no denying that this programme has gained enormous popularity within a short span of time and therefore some people are trying to stop it. They are reportedly putting pressure on the Radio Aamar authorities to stop broadcasting of the show since according to them, it is not the right kind of show for our country & culture. They feel that people here are talking directly about love which is still a taboo in our society. But I think if Radio Aamar stops broadcasting the show due to outside influence, than it will be a shame for all of us. Our country is keeping pace with the modern world but that doesn't mean that we are not respecting our own culture and tradition. //////On May 12, 2008, I experienced some trouble as a commuter because of the privilege the so-called VIPs have. I was on the VIP road and soon the road became standstill, because an adviser came from the wrong side of the road, to avoid traffic on the side his car was supposed to be on. I, along with many common people, had to make a path for the adviser's car, coming from the wrong side. This is something travellers face each day due to the VIPs. Being a taxpayer of the country and more than that a citizen, I do not want to face these troubles on the road. Why should I make way for a VIP, that too coming from the wrong side of the road? //////Women in our country are still living in darkness. In our neighbouring country India, it is seen that women are more educated and they have established themselves in some leading sectors such as IT, finance land marketing. These sectors are blooming in our country with lots of opportunities for women. //////Except a few small political parties or groups, all others are demanding lifting of the state of emergency before the next parliamentary election scheduled to be held in the 3rd week of December 2008. Most of them will presumably make this one of the major issues in the coming political dialogue with the government. But I understand that general people will feel safe if the state of emergency continues for the following reasons until the next general election is over and an elected government takes over the state power.//////I congratulate Mr Andaz for his excellent thought provoking letter 'The flip side' (Letters, 18/05/08). I could not resist the temptation to add further.//////It would be nicer to write about something else than writing about my brother. But I could not keep myself silent when I see a miscarriage of justice is being carried out against a very decent man. This man would not confess any wrongdoing nor pay any ransom money. My brother has been the chief accountant for BRTC for nearly thirty years and has survived much political turmoil just by being an apolitical and honest man. He was threatened many times in the past but in the end people had realized that the man was strong and they could not replace him. He complained to me many times that he had enough of it and would like to move on rather than carrying marching orders from political bosses. //////This is good news that recently the Bangladesh government and its South Korean counterpart signed the agreement to export manpower to South Korea under the employment permit system (EPS). First of all, we would like to thank the Bangladesh government, the South Korean government, Bangladesh Overseas Employment and Services Limited (BOESL) & HRD Korea. So far 6600 candidates appeared in the Korean language test (KLT) and 2915 passed the test. After the medical test, so far 2500 candidates submitted their job applications. //////We fully support a rickshaw free capital. But why blind our eyes to other parts of the country where too we do not need rickshaws as a means of transport. We urge that rickshaws be withdrawn as a means of transport from the whole country as it involves immense rigor to the pullers and makes them physically and financially incapable. Let's have alternative means of livelihood than pulling rickshaws. Needless to mention that all rickshaw pullers live in slums and all these slum dwellers are used by our political parties as means for all illegal activities like drug peddling, observing hartals, and name what have you. We should certainly put an end to all these. //////I am writing this in response to the news regarding the clashes among workers, police and students in Khulna. I am a student of Khulna University, which is the only university that is session jam and politics free. Our varsity was closed on Thursday for a 4-week long summer vacation. We already had our vacation plan. We were leaving our campus one by one by buses and trains. But as it happens regularly, the workers of bus terminals behave roughly with us(not only students but all other people). But I saw it for the first time that students were beaten severely by the transport workers.//////I should like to make a few comments about Dr. Ashraf Z.

His incomparable writings, in a very short spell, established Nazrul as a genius in the arena of Bengali literature.//////In 1926, the "rebel poet" visited Sylhet for the first time. In his memoirs, Dewan Mohammad Azraf narrates how the idea of bringing Kazi Nazrul Islam to Sylhet developed. While studying at the Sylhet Murari Chand College (commonly known as MC College), Azraf came up with the idea and one of his classmates named Aziruddin inspired him in this regard. One fine morning, Nazrul was spotted on a train at Kulaura station. Starting from Gauhati via Lamding, he was on his way to Chandpur as part of his trip to Calcutta. Despite repeated requests from many, he could not make a stopover, as it was urgent for him to reach Calcutta on time.//////National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam had contributed immensely to shape our culture and literature. His works remain popular and as esteemed as they were decades ago. On the occasion of Nazrul's birth anniversary, ////// spoke to a few renowned singers of the country, who shared their views on Nazrul Sangeet and steps that are necessary to preserve and continue the legacy of Nazrul.//////I sing of them//////who deliver to the earth//////the message of harvest.//////Under whose hardened, blisterous palms//////from merciless labour//////the earth offers the gift//////of baskets full of fruits and flowers.//////Under whose rule this earth//////abounding in ferocious, wild beasts//////and awful death and decrepitude//////transforms into a beautiful,//////blossoming garden!//////As the nation celebrates the 109th birth anniversary of our National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, the market of Nazrul Sangeet is going through a gradual decline. Over the last few years, the number of albums featuring Nazrul Sangeet was few and far between. However, production houses are trying to find a way to deal with this issue. //////On the occasion of the birth anniversary of National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, Banglavision will air a single episode TV play, ////// on May 25, at 9:05 pm.

But this was not going to last long. //////IN Bangladesh, student activism dates back to the 1950s when some students died when police fired upon them. They were demanding the recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages of Pakistan. Subsequently, with the pro-autonomy Jukta Front (United Front) sweeping the polls in 1954, student activism subsided. //////THE future does not seem to bode well for Bangladesh. In a rapidly changing global economic scenario of soaring food and energy prices, and the uncertainty with climate change, our survival as a functioning sovereign state depends on unity. Without unity, it will be impossible to manage our resources in respect to food and energy security amidst a political environment that is totally corrupt, divisive and dysfunctional. //////I want to introduce readers to the Huckleberry Finn of the 21st century. Most readers of this column will have read all or parts of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, the story of a remarkable young man in revolt against his society. Huck is a truly free person managing to escape such matters as going to bed when parents dictate, smoking if he wants, going any where at any time that crosses his mind, and avoiding school. //////Stamp collection, once a favourite pastime for many, is now struggling for survival with the advent of modern technologies like email and cellphone.//////The Dhaka University authorities are going on with the distortion of some landmark architectural works on the campus for commercial gains, disregarding objections by noted architects and academics.//////
