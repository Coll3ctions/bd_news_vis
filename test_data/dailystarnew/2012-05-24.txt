She was Dr. Maliha Khatun. It would be pertinent to remind that very few Bengali Muslim women were active on the social scene of erstwhile East Pakistan. It was a time when even educated women did not really venture out of the confines of their homes. In such a scenario Dr. Maliha made her mark as a distinguished educationist, writher and social worker.//////
