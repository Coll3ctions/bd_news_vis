halt its nuclear enrichment programme.//////THE ultimatum of the RMG factory owners of Ghazipur, to close down all RMG factories in that area unless adequate security was provided to them by September 25, is surprising. But this is reflective of the state of desperation they are in, with the situation going out of their control. To say the least, the owners' response is least expected, come as it does from the captains of this industry. It amounts to an attitude of chopping off one's head to cure the headache. //////AFTER nearly a decade of autocratic rule of Parvez Musharraf, Pakistan has got a democratically elected president in the person of Asif Ali Zardari. He secured 281 out of 426 parliamentary votes, and won a majority vote in three of the four provincial assemblies forming the presidential electoral college. Jubilant as they are, his close aides lost no time in saying that it was a historic win, a victory for democracy. Zardari's sweeping to victory provides an occasion to reflect on 'tides in the affairs of man' in the Shakespearean aphorism. A man not having many credible years as a politician, and someone who has left an indelible trail of controversies behind, it is indeed worthy of note how he rose to the most powerful position enduring jail terms for nearly 11 years as well as a long exile. There were charges of wide-scale corruption and even murder against him. Ironically, an amnesty signed by Parvez Musharraf last year had cleared him of all the charges. And this ought to be remembered that his remarkable turn around happened only nine months after the assassination of his charismatic wife, Benazir Bhutto. //////FOUR with six zeroes looks tidy as a figure, but it gives us an uneasy feeling when the World Bank says that four million people in the country have been pushed back further below the poverty line, due to abnormal rise in food price. The WB on August 26 said that the food price shock is projected to have raised poverty rate by around three percent from the baseline poverty rate of 40 percent in 2005.//////HIS laugh was always a little less than a laugh, and his smile much more than a smile.

This month is devoted to fasting and observed by the Muslims throughout the world as one of the five pillars of Islam.//////The performance of our national cricket team seems to have hit rock bottom. Such a disastrous Australian tour wasn't really expected. We are definitely better than our latest performance suggests. After such a performance even the most ardent supporter hangs his head down in shame and others take out their sharpest knives for further sharpening. In the midst of all this we seem to have overlooked a few things. A genuinely neutral umpire (which Peter Parker is not) would have given Michael Hussey out caught behind when he was trying the reverse sweep, and allowed Ashraful to have the benefit of doubt (the ball had pitched a shade outside the leg stump, part in, part out). Ashraful would probably have been out the very next delivery, but that is not the point that I am trying to make. The point that I am trying to make is that umpires automatically favour the top teams and the top batsmen. This was made clear in the recently concluded Test series between India and Sri Lanka. If the referral system had not been in place, the Sri Lankans would have been in deep trouble. In the ODI series, without the referral system, the result was reversed. Put your mind back to the time when the South Africans came to Dhaka to play their first Test series. Six decisions went against us. Khalid Manhood Sujan lost his match fee for protesting. The underdog has a chance of winning if the referral system becomes mandatory.//////The previous Pay Commission took almost a year to suggest a new pay scale for the employees in the public sector. They needed this time to study the pay scales in neighbouring countries, the calorie requirements of employees and their families and such things. The highest pay suggested by them was Tk. 27,000/= per month. However, the international donor agencies warned the government of the negative impact of this pay hike, and the proposed pay-scale was discarded by the government, and a modified pay-scale with Tk. 23,000/= p.m. as the highest monthly pay was finally adopted. //////We, the city dwellers, always condemn the city corporation for not building foot overbridges, speed breakers etc on city roads. But sadly enough, there are several foot overbridges on every busy road in Dhaka city which a few people use. //////Knowing that this subject was much too important to be kept under the rug, I am glad to see letters and articles on the subject reappear in the DS after a gap of nearly two months-- MZ Haider's article on 20 Aug, Sohel Ahmed's on 27 Aug. and Asadullah Khan's article on 30 Aug. We are pleased to read that the DMP has an action plan to streamline traffic, but filled with consternation at the concessions given by the NBR to car importers and lo and behold, a 'tiny' sum of $ 5.52 billion (Taka 40,000 crores) to be spent on STP over 20 years to make traffic congestion history!!! //////The majority of Bangladeshis, especially in the rural areas, do not have access to the Internet. Nowadays the world is moving very fast and the number of Internet users is increasing rapidly, but in our country most of the people are still deprived of this opportunity. Internet service, a new horizon, has been opened in the field of education, research, business and entertainment. With the expansion of online Internet facilities, various institutions and organisations have started to release their self-introductory web pages. For scholarships, admission to foreign universities and also business, one can find all the necessary information through the Internet. So it's necessary for all. //////The permanent mission of Bangladesh to the United Nations in New York covers a wide range of the activities undertaken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs-- peaceful settlement of disputes, promotion of human rights, protection of environment, sustainable development and so on. The permanent mission with support from other government ministries represents Bangladesh in every negotiation that takes place at the UN in New York, ensuring that Bangladesh's interests and views are taken into account by UN bodies and the other member states. Hours are long and negotiations can be tough and intricate. But playing a key part in achieving a successful outcome can be very rewarding. Bangladesh as a UN member state plays a key role in providing information from the Bangladesh's diplomatic network, negotiating, and lobbying for right actions and resolutions. //////In a shocking statement, the government has announced that shops and markets can remain open till 09:00pm in the first week of Ramadan and the government will review the power situation after a week of observation. //////The split between Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif will not surprise anyone. Both of them are corrupt beyond comprehension. They are so greedy that they don't even want to share the rewards with their coalition partner they both want to have everything alone! Naturally, there is a split. (Readers are recommended to watch the classic, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly)//////It is really very alarming that after sunset mugging in passport office to Shisu Mela road area is taking place on a regular basis. //////Now that a case has been brought to the HC by an interested party, the legality of the Commission is for the court to decide. I would only draw attention to the fact that unless such an interested party raised the issue in court, the court was powerless to decide anything in respect of it. Similarly all criminal cases are brought before the courts for judgement and sentencing in the interest of the nation by the government prosecutors throughout the civilised world, and the government has an inherent right to 'plea bargain' with the 'accused' to get voluntary disclosures and admission to reduce the work load of the police and courts. And the timing and modus operandi of such 'plea bargaining' or any formal charges are entirely up to the government prosecutors ( i.e. the Ministry of Law).//////It is a sad truth that our meritorious students are not eager to become political leaders. If we go back to our history, we will see that we had a glorious tradition of student politics. It was because of the youth that they were full of spirit and courage to protest against all social injustice. The leadership during the Language Movement in 1952, the mass upsurge in 1969 and the War of Liberation in 1971 was supported by students.//////This refers to Sumon's letter from the UK on September 1 in your daily. We have seen democracy in our beloved Bangladesh. Misguided politics, bombing, killing and looting of national resources are part of life in Bangladesh. We don't want to see those things any more. During the last 18 months, many good things happened. //////The prevalence of disturbing calls is a disgrace which demands immediate remedial action. The aim of phone stalkers, 'to make friendship' or even to find a spouse, is an indictment on the institution of arranged marriage and threatens to unravel the moral fibre of our nation.//////NBR chairman's observations about container loads of rubbish imported at Chittagong port deserve continuous press follow-up. The reasons behind this could be far more than what meets the eye. However, I do not go along with the suspicion about sabotage! Was it the sabotage of the country's image, where even rubbish can be imported?//////I am a student of Shahjalal University of Science & Technology. I live in a rented house at Madina Market under SUST. The majority of the university students live in Madina Market area. But it is a matter of great regret that there is not a single university bus for Madina Market area. //////The Holy Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is a blessing from the Almighty to mankind revealed through Prophet Muhammad (SM).//////Recently, the government directed all the schools to start at 07:30am just to avoid traffic jam. Well, the attempt to solve the traffic jam problem is appreciable. But have the authorities thought about the consequences of such order about school timings? A kid of KG or class I to Class V will have to get up at 6:00am in the morning to reach the school by 7:30am! Is it possible and if possible how much pain they will have to bear? //////Hurricane Gustav is the seventh tropical cyclone, third hurricane and the second biggest major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season.
