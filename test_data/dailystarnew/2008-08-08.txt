globe. And that is the idea that has of late been advocated in this country, thanks to the relentless efforts made by conscious sections of the population. We are happy to note that at this point of time, the conditions in which our indigenous communities live and the positive change that ought to come into their lives are a subject that has drawn the attention of broad sections of our society. Evidence of such interest in the well-being of the indigenous communities comes yet once more through the launch of a book on indigenous people on Wednesday. Moreover, the Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission has been at work, with Britain's Lord Avebury being in Bangladesh at present to get his own perspective on the situation. It is such manifestation of interest that can go a long way toward strengthening the social bonds which unite people of various communities in this country.//////THE colonial, age-old, early warning system, unfortunately still in vogue in our country, has had its focus on safety of ports and river and marine vessels. This is for the first time that the Disaster Management Bureau (DMB), awakened by the huge losses wreaked on human life and property by disasters, is thinking outside the box. It wants to place protection of man, material and means of livelihood at the top of the disaster forecasting and management agenda.//////IT started innocuously enough with the first reports trickling in from Kuwait last week. Thousands of Bangladeshi workers had gone on strike and taken to the streets, demonstrating for their rights. //////I hope it doesn't run the risk of being misunderstood as an Indian sympathiser to say that Rahul Gandhi's visit to Bangladesh was a breath of fresh air. We saw a 38-year-old dapper young man, scion of the longest ruling family in the largest democracy in the world, whose great-grandfather, grandmother, father and mother, all have been the leading lights of Indian politics. It was impressive to know that he was taking interest in poverty alleviation and rural development. So far, our experience has been to the contrary. Young leaders and their cabals of sidekicks have ruthlessly plundered this country. //////WITH the Beijing Olympics starting at the end of this week, you might think this would be an occasion for

But Zia International, Shah Amanat in Chittagong, and Shahjalal in Sylhet all have one major runway each. Granted that the latter two's international arrival and departures are negligible, but what about Dhaka? We have seen in more than one instance the whole airport becoming dysfunctional when a mishap happens on the runway (Malaysian Airlines some years back, Saudia recently, and our own Biman DC-10 crash landing in Chittagong) for hours a together , creating a ripple effect in the flight traffic in the region.//////We came to learn that the United Nations, on the request of the present PM of Pakistan, has agreed to investigate the former PM Benazir Bhutto's assassination. We are indeed cheered at the news because crimes of such magnitude in Pakistan usually go unpunished. //////The bloodletting game is a common spectacle in some Muslim countries. After the US invasion in Afghanistan and Iraq, it has been frequently proved that both the countries are pretty vulnerable to violence. Almost every day we find news of suicidal bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the statistics of slain people depict the spectacle of inhumanity!! Mostly Muslim countries are exposed to violence as some of them have become breeding grounds of terrorists. Needless to mention, people of Iraq and Afghanistan are leading their lives amid great fear. Since the US aggression took place in these countries the hellish days began. //////Saarc has so far achieved no remarkable success except holding meeting after meeting at different levels. Although, we cannot find any remarkable success of Saarc in terms of expectations of the huge population of the eight member countries, the inherent problems are well identified by now. Ideological conflicts, economic imbalance, big brotherly attitude, external influence and lack of leadership qualities are some of the major hurdles standing on the way of achieving any significant progress. The future is not bright either.//////There was never any lack of understanding amongst the physicians regarding the usefulness of this particular drug oral morphine in treating severe pain. This is particularly true and more useful for cancer patients of whom many are at the terminal stage of their life. It is cheap, affordable and essential drug recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) and International Narcotic Control Board (INCB) for cancer pain. Granted that opioids, the substances from Poppy plant which includes morphine also, are looked upon with scorn due to their addictive nature, but as a medication, these may provide a window of respite, a pain free existence and peaceful exit from life.//////So far my memory goes study seemed to be like an agony for me. Instead of pleasure and amusement it turned into pain and burden. If my memory does not betray me, I can recollect the events of my school life. I think most of the students in our country, have such kind of experience as I had in the past. Our education system, particularly at the secondary level is divided into three parts (i.e. English medium, Bengali medium, madrassa). I think it is a sign of discrimination. In the age of capitalism education is no longer a right, rather a privilege. In case of school level students education appears to be a matter of stress and burden. I think our so-called teachers are partially responsible for this stress.//////This letter is in response to the news item published in your daily on August 03, 2008 regarding Rajshahi City Corporation election candidates' reluctance to express a firm stance on militancy issue during their campaign.//////When I heard my mother was sick, I went to Bangladesh for two weeks but I stayed a little longer than four weeks. My last visit was in 2005 and I noticed after three years that there had been a lot of change. First of all, at the airport everything was good, no hassle, quick service, all in order and everything on schedule. No hartal and no violence and I was able to use and enjoy all my valuable time. The bad politicians were all in jail or outside the country. Most of the people are happy. Factories, industries and ports, all institutions are working in order. The only complaint is that the cost of living has gone higher. Is all this for rule of Emergency? Long live Emergency! People have high expectations of the caretaker government, especially for system development. For example, the police still serve the government instead of serving ordinary citizens. Politics is becoming more open, most of the old political actors and actresses are going back to the stage. //////Just after skimming through the headlines I tucked the FORUM, a supplementary of The Daily Star, into my office bag while heading towards my office. It was kept on my desk, and suddenly I bumped into the one of the early cover pages of the SWM portrayed on its back cover as an ad for SWM. In fact that cover page with a banner heading JCD UNLEASHED compelled/inspired me to write this. //////It is with great sadness that we took the news of the recent death of former chief of Army Staff General Muhammad Mustafizur Rahman, Bir Bikram(may his soul rest in peace). General Mustafiz was, among other things, a fine gentleman, a knowledgeable person, an expert in his field, a pleasant personality, a good orator, a good host and a good listener. Ms. Sarwar Sultana - a former acting cabinet minister (internal administration) of the United Nations administered East Timor and I have had the opportunity to meet the General and his family on a number of occasions during his life time. //////Recently, I went through a new hassle in a govt. office. I had to open an account in any branch of Sonali Bank. So I went to branch close to my residence-- Mirpur Industrial Branch, Sonali Bank. To open an account, the bank official asked for my national identity card (NID), commissioner certificate, testimony from my office-boss, my academic papers and attestation from any account holder of Sonali Bank's that branch. I got everything ready spending at least three days. And at the last moment, when all the procedures were going to be complete a bank official ordered me to go to any branch nearer to my office. I informed him that my office was located in Gulshan but I reside in Pallabi, Mirpur. I need an account with this branch. With due respect, I questioned him whether there was any rule, regulation or restriction to let me have an account in that branch. To be noted, I was very polite and sober in my dealing with him. But he was rude from the very beginning. I was astonished. Being disappointed at that I went to another Sonali Bank branch in Mirpur-12 the next day. That branch asked for nothing but NID card and allowed me to have an account number. Completing all the procedures took me near about four hours. I think it was too much and such hassle is very commonplace in almost all government offices. Nowhere we can blame or report against these irregularities and inconveniences. So our suffering has no end. //////Fakirhat is a union of Palasbari in Gaibandha district, which has the proud memories of 10 martyred freedom fighters. Local people are expecting Fakirhat to be a new upazila, which has been their demand to the government from a long time.//////A few days back one of our freedom fighters was insulted by a war criminal. I think it is our national shame. But our government did not take any action. If our freedom fighters, who sacrificed a lot for the sake of our country, are not safe, how can we live with dignity?//////We all know that smoking in public places and any kind of publicity of any tobacco products is prohibited in our country. But people are still smoking in public places and some shops have again started using banners of cigarettes. So, the law is not being implemented properly. That is why, people feel emboldened to smoke openly.//////When an incompetent person runs the government and fails, we don't mind. But when Dr. Fakhruddin's administration fails we do mind. People are very much disappointed about the poor performance of the CTG. Although they had all the logistic support and necessary tools to run an administration smoothly and efficiently, they have failed to deliver.//////We, who are in the private sector and working in manufacturing industries, need to interact with VAT & customs offices on a regular basis.//////An ageless saying states "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"! Corruption in this case does not refer to financial corruption. Corruption covers a vast range of things; in thoughts, words and deeds. It could well be the power driven blindness, based on the principles of "might is right"; which is getting its day at regular intervals in Bangladesh!//////Israel is building up its strike capabilities amid growing anxiety over Iran's nuclear ambitions and appears confident that a military attack would cripple Tehran's atomic programme, even if it can't destroy it. //////Afghanistan is keen to work with Pakistan to fight Islamic extremism, but Islamabad must rein in elements in the government that are "out of control," the Afghan foreign minister said Wednesday.//////The Afghan government said yesterday that seven policemen were killed when militants stormed their post in the troubled south, while nearly three dozen militants died in various clashes.//////Hundreds of Taliban militants attacked a checkpost in a Pakistani tribal area bordering Afghanistan, sparking fierce clashes in which 10 troops and 25 rebels were killed, officials said yesterday.//////A key US lawmaker threatened Wednesday to hold up a landmark US-India nuclear agreement unless nuclear supplier states adopt a provision terminating the deal if India conducted a nuclear test explosion.//////President Pervez Musharraf is "irrelevant" to Pakistan and its people did not appreciate the US' support for the country's military dictators, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has said.//////Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom signed and adopted a new constitution yesterday that allows multiparty elections and a number of other key democratic reforms after decades of authoritarian rule. //////The military generals who staged a coup in this desert nation announced Thursday they plan to hold free and transparent elections "as soon as possible." //////President Bush praised the spread of freedom in Asia while training a harsh spotlight Thursday on the region's democratic laggards, sharply criticising oppression and human rights abuses in China, Myanmar and North Korea. //////South Africa's government said yesterday power-sharing talks aimed at resolving Zimbabwe's political crisis were "progressing extremely well."//////Nepal's president has extended a deadline for ex-rebel Maoists to form the new republic's first government, an official said Wednesday.//////Iraq yesterday postponed provincial elections originally set for October after MPs failed to agree the necessary legislation in time, in a blow for US-backed efforts to consolidate national reconciliation.//////Diehard Hillary Clinton backers stepped up a campaign Wednesday to get their heroine onto the nominating ballot alongside White House hopeful Barack Obama at this month's Democratic convention.//////Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni yesterday strengthened her bid to lead the ruling Kadima party and possibly become premier after a senior minister announced his support.//////The Pentagon has described Pakistan's problems with its intelligence services as a "historical issue" and said the US and Pakistani governments are working together to overcome these problems.//////Malaysia's top opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim pleaded innocent Thursday to a sodomy charge, dismissing it as a "treacherous" accusation as he was freed on bail to campaign for a key by-election to Parliament. //////India said Wednesday there had been serious security lapses during a visit to Sri Lanka by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh despite the island nation's promise of "ultimate security."//////The only Bengali Nobel laureate in literature, Rabindranath Tagore, does not get his due respect in the government level, though he is the lyricist and composer of our national anthem. Only his death and birth anniversaries are celebrated through 'run of the mill programmes' at the national level. However, so far no institutional initiative has been taken by the government, complained Dr. Nurul Anwar, one of the discussants at the programme observing Rabindranath Tagore's 67th death anniversary at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA).//////Elaborate programmes were chalked out on the 4th day of the ongoing 5th Rabindra Natya Utshab here on Wednesday (August 6) to mark the 67th death anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore.//////As the youngest son of Maharshi Debendranath Tagore, Rabindranath delved in theology and metaphysics at an early age, though at that time he was keener on prose and poetry. Rabindranath's elder brother Dwijendranath was more interested in philosophy than him. Despite being reputed as a poet, lyricist, composer, dramatist, artist and novelist, Rabindranath was also a profuse theologian and philosopher.//////With a two-day musical programme, Bangladesh Rabindra Sangeet Shilpi Sangstha (BRSSS) observed the 67th death anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. Veteran artiste Kalim Sharafi, president of BRSSS, inaugurated the event on August 6 at the Shawkat Osman Auditorium, Central Public Library.//////August 6 is observed as "Hiroshima Day" all around the world. On this day in 1945, in a desperate effort for a quick win against Japan, US air force dropped an atomic bomb, "Little Boy", on the city of Hiroshima, followed by the detonation of another nuclear bomb "Fat Man" over Nagasaki on August 9. The death toll from the immediate blast at Hiroshima was roughly estimated at 70,000 and in the decades that followed many more died from illnesses caused by severe radiation. The death toll at Hiroshima and Nagasaki totalled at 3,45,000. They are the only instances of the use of nuclear weapons in warfare. //////A one-hour play, //////, will be aired tonight on ATN Bangla at 8pm. Written and directed by Russell Ashequi, the play follows the plight of a courageous, self-sufficient mother called Jebunessa Hashi who is also a widow of a freedom fighter. //////INDIGENOUS peoples have contributed the least to world greenhouse gas emissions and have the smallest ecological footprints on earth. Yet they suffer the worst impacts from not only climate change, but also hardship in education, employment, health, human rights, social and economic development, and everyday life.//////GLOBAL warming, climate change and their ilk seem to have become buzzwords for our intelligentsia in recent times. At any given time, we have several conferences, seminars and projects that give us the same bad news in different packages. This is, no doubt, fueled partially by generous funding from donor agencies and developed countries (guilt does loosen up the purse strings!). The upshot of this flurry in scholarly activity has been the clarification of a few facts that I will now proceed to bluntly state://////WITH the universal acceptance of the concept of basic human rights, experts and social reformers are getting more and more concerned with the physically and mentally disabled people who are generally considered as burdens on the society. They have all along been neglected because of their inability to participate in normal social and economic activity, and very often fall prey to harassment and disgrace. Disability may be of different types, such as, visual, hearing, speech, physical, intellectual and multiple impairment. In this article, I will dwell upon intellectual disability in the Bangladesh context.//////I once met a guy called Jim Smith who didn't like his name. What's not to like about Jim Smith?//////E-commerce has become a second name for the internet. Shopping, for most, has always been characterised by tired feet, crowded markets and desperate searches for a good parking spot. All these factors put together take all the enjoyment out of shopping. But with the advent of online shopping, buying and selling is no more a matter than a click of a button, that too from the comfort of your home.//////In an attempt to hold on to its popularity, Facebook, the fastest growing Online Social Networking site, has recently introduced a complete 'new look'. Whether the new look is here to stay or not still remains to be answered, but let's have a sneak peek into what the new look is all about and its share of pros and cons.//////D.Net (Development Research Network) and Relief International (RI) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on July 26 to collaborate their activity on 'Enhancing computer learning programme along with Internet connection'. //////Fashion and technology have always inspired each other and are both at the hub of today's pop culture.
