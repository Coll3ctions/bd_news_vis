While I wholeheartedly express my condolences, I strongly urge all, who are involved in promoting women rights in South Asia to use her death as a message to reach out. The anger and the frustration felt by the general public should be used to press authorities and law enforcement agencies to take effective actions. Thousands of women are being raped all over the world each year, and many sustain long-standing physical trauma. The death of the Indian girl is not an issue to be confined within the border of one nation; it's a regional and global issue. Something has gone fundamentally wrong in the social fabric and national law enforcement systems of the region. The spirit of the deceased student should motivate regional NGOs to establish a joint task force to share information, resource and legal supports to help rape victims and prevent violence of any sort against women in South Asia. I wish, purely a wish, though, the culprits were left to the mercy of a mob to decide their fate! But I know civilised society won't, also shouldn't, allow such thing. Yet, I sincerely hope India passes swift judgment of death penalty to those criminals who raped and murdered the girl, and execute them at the earliest possible time.//////Usually, I go on a morning stroll at the Ramna Park where a lot of other people of the city also come to walk, jog and do physical exercises. The whole park is very poorly maintained with only the exception of a few spots. These spots are well kept with regular sweeping by cleaners. I wonder who appointed these cleaners. The cemented benches around the park remain dirty with bottles, papers, empty cigarette packets, etc., around them. I asked some of the regular walkers about this and came to know that some group of walkers pay the cleaners to clean those spots regularly. I even saw the cleaners cleaning one of the spots on several occasions while I was sitting on the next bench expecting that they would clean the garbage around my bench. I request the authorities to keep the whole park clean. //////Biting cold wave is sweeping across the whole of North Bengal, affecting especially the poverty-stricken people of Thakurgaon, Panchagarh, Kurigram, Dinajpur, etc., as usual. Daily activities have almost stopped in this region due to severe cold. Stray dogs and homeless people have accepted the lot of coexisting together on the roadsides and at the railway stations. The steps being taken by the government apart, the rich may come forward and extend humanitarian service to poor victims of cold, donate warm clothes and arrange for distributing those among them.//////This is in reference to the article published in The Daily Star dated 29 December 2012 in which Mr. Ershad said that "Beautification of Dhaka city is urgently required". I believe he recognised a real problem of our country about which no one else seems to be bothered. I believe he has hit the nail on the head and is thinking about addressing some major problems of our country. If Mr. Ershad is really serious, then he has my vote because I truly believe we finally need a change in leadership that will make a difference.//////Your December 31 editorial congratulating the ruling party's re-elected leaders aptly expressed the disappointment that many of us feel at the utter lack of democratic norms within political parties. The Awami League is hardly unique in this regard since just about every political party of any significance is little more than an extension of personal dynasties. That the law of the land, as enshrined in the Representation of People's Ordinance, is so brazenly flouted by those who have taken oaths to uphold and execute those very laws, says plenty about the state of our 'democracy'. Journalists, civil society leaders, and intellectuals may not like to hear the truth, but facts speak for themselves once we come out of our emotional trappings: political parties in Bangladesh neither understand nor particularly care for the ideal of democracy as it is understood by the civilized world. Of the four major parties in the country, three are little more than personal dynasties: one believes in being the earthly vice-regent of the Almighty, two have been spawned in cantonments, and one has given us a one-party, four-newspaper state that Stalin would have envied. The fact that all these organisations scream themselves hoarse as martyrs for democracy when in the opposition. The irony is they become tyrants. Such shameless hypocrisy goes on before public glare. Personality cult and religious absolutism have no place in democracy, nor in a political party preaching democracy. So the question is if Bangladesh is truly a democracy?//////I cringe at the sight of litter when I go in and out of the streets in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. Why do we litter? And why can we not as an individual citizen of Bangladesh take care of our own litter? Yes, I mean keeping waste papers in own bags until we reach home and can put it in the waste basket or bin. Why can't we keep our city clean? Littered premises are detrimental to one's mental health and creativity. I cannot function mentally unless my table or room is clean. The same goes for the streets of Dhaka and other cities. A few years back corporate bodies were asked to beautify their surroundings and streets with flowers but that effort seems to have fallen apart. It would be a nice New Year's gift to the country if these corporate bodies renewed their city beautification activities. All eminent personalities who are in the public eye could also come forward and raise awareness about us becoming responsible city residents and not littering! Let us all help some of our youngsters who have started a campaign of anti-litter under the 'green channel' by installing metal bins in many streets of Dhaka. Their success, however, depends on our awareness about anti-littering. //////It is terribly shocking to learn that the 23-year-old Indian woman, a medical student who was a victim of gang rape in New Delhi, had died on Saturday after courageously fighting for her life at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. There is no word to condemn the barbaric act which finally killed the woman.//////In 1999, in a brief week of learning Bengali before going to Haluaghat to teach English (for I had only come for a year, hadn't I?) I checked the Bengali for expressions I needed, like Think for yourself! but, when I used it, in front of Class 7, their blank expressions told me this was a concept unknown to them. This need for THINKING was echoed in William Westgate's article concerning English-medium education - and also, indirectly, in Md Nurul Huda's article on 'Towards an apathetic electorate' in which he feared that the state was 'dwarfing its citizens to make them docile instruments' - the very opposite of what education should do! Oxford's motto - 'Dominus illuminatio mea' - 'The Lord is my light' - indicates that education should be a light turned on in the mind and heart, an Arab's (and everyone else's) spring, the realisation that 'I am worth it' - and can have an opinion worth expressing - thoughtfully and fearlessly. We see signs of this happening everywhere, in the teeth of the pressures for it not to happen. The disadvantaged - including women - refusing to feel powerless; people asking, Why? Why not? and I do not agree and I love you BUT... - and people working for less than they deserve, because they have a calling to do something important. It is the very spirit of hope and liberation...Of course, the uncontrolled idiots, the pathetically greedy and the brain-washed are all around - along with victims who, even if the light has come on for them also, await their liberation. //////Violence ravaged Syria into 2013 with the gruesome discovery of what activists said were dozens of tortured corpses in Damascus, clouding end-of-year efforts to end 21 months of bloodshed.//////Ailing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had something to smile about from her hospital bed Monday when she was named the woman most admired by Americans, for the 17th time.//////India yesterday rolled out an ambitious plan for a cash payout of subsidies to the poor in 20 districts, officials said.//////North Korean leader Kim Jong-un yesterday called for an end to confrontation between the two Koreas, technically still at war in the absence of a peace treaty to end their 1950-53 conflict, in a surprise New Year speech broadcast on state media.//////Six women and a man working for a health and education charity in northwest Pakistan were killed in a drive-by shooting yesterday, police said.//////2012 was the "deadliest year for journalists", said the International Press Institute on Monday, with the highest number of deaths recorded since the media watchdog began its annual tally.//////Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas pledged on Monday that the coming year would see the implementation of Palestinian independence.//////The UN Security Council slapped an arms embargo Monday on M23 rebels and their alleged Rwandan allies, the FDLR, amid a flare-up of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern region.//////Japan's population logged a record drop in 2012, health ministry estimates showed yesterday, highlighting concerns that an ever-dwindling pool of workers is having to pay for a growing number of pensioners.//////Pakistan has released eight Afghan Taliban prisoners, including senior former administration chiefs, in a bid to aid its wartorn neighbour's peace efforts, officials said yesterday.//////Sabina Yasmin is a household name in Bangladesh.
