With reports coming in of 8,500 people, perhaps more, dead and as many as 10,000 others badly injured from a tremor on a Richter scale of 7.8, we can only imagine the terrible destruction that such a disaster can have brought about. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has described it as a major disaster, a view that we fully share. In such circumstances, it becomes the responsibility of the Beijing authorities to go full steam into the job of ensuring the rehabilitation of those affected by the earthquake. It appears, happily for everyone, that such measures have already been taken by the authorities, with the result that the risks of a bigger fallout from the earthquake have been appreciably minimised. This is in contrast to the slow, rather indifferent approach taken by the Myanmar authorities towards tackling the consequences of the recent cyclone in their country.//////POLICEMEN in Saudi Arabia have been tearing up work-related documents of Bangladeshi migrant workers in that country. And they have been doing that without any thought to the predicament such action can and will cause to these hapless people. That is impunity of the highest order, especially when you think of the sheer high-handedness of people who are unwilling to abide by norms, by the general standards of civilised behaviour we expect from governments everywhere. And then there are the many instances in which Bengali workers have been and are being mistreated in Malaysia, with really no one to speak up for them. //////AMERICANS are glum at the moment. No, I mean really glum. In April, a new poll revealed that 81 percent of the American people believe that the country is on the "wrong track." In the 25 years that pollsters have asked this question, last month's response was by far the most negative. Other polls, asking similar questions, found levels of gloom that were even more alarming, often at 30- and 40-year highs. There are reasons to be pessimistica financial panic and looming recession, a seemingly endless war in Iraq, and the ongoing threat of terrorism. But the facts on the ground -- unemployment numbers, foreclosure rates, deaths from terror attacks -- are simply not dire enough to explain the present atmosphere of malaise.//////WHILE the election of a civilian government in Islamabad has been universally welcomed as part of Pakistan's democratic transition, the new government's approach to counterterrorism has evoked misgivings in Washington. Reacting to what is viewed as President Pervez Musharraf's US-backed militarised effort to defeat terrorism, the elected government headed by Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani has sought a more balanced policy, combining force with a "civil dialogue" with misled extremists. Instead of dismissing this as yet another bound-to-fail approach, Washington should be patient and let Gillani recover the legitimacy of Pakistan's counterterrorism policy. //////The final preparation camp for the fifth SAFF Football Championship will begin today at BKSP but the number of players to be in the squad was not finalised even last night.//////Former national football coach Diego Cruciani would consider returning to Bangladesh if the newly elected executive committee of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) wants him back.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board's working committee on Tuesday has decided to take a few more days before finalising the title sponsor for next month's triangular series involving India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) yesterday renewed its ties with Prime Bank as sponsors of the coming B.

and mineral deposits, have not been planned on regional basis--the northern districts are less developed than the South and SE. Is the extraction of coal in the North being deliberately delayed by vested groups? The record of the political regimes since 1991 has been dismal (too much lobbying through the backdoors).//////Cyclones are always devastating. They create havoc over the areas they pass throughdestroying houses, trees, cornfields and killing hundreds of thousands-- a dark scar in the socio-economic condition of the people of those areas which takes time to heal.//////The insurrection of the radical Islamists to protest the new Women's Development Policy has disappointed me extremely as I viewed the violent agitation as an impediment to the general progression of our society. It's regrettable to see that when the entire civilized world is prepared to uphold the principles of equal rights for women by giving up the egregious practices of gender discrimination, a few mullahs are raising voices against it in a country where the establishment of women's rights is absolutely imperative for the general socio-economic development. //////The world is going to face an acute food crisis as the production of food grain is not adequate to feed the population. Because of the shortage of food the third world countries may face a famine-like situation.

My bus reached Paturia ferry ghat and it needed more than six hours to cross the Padma river in a ferry. That's why I missed my class test and attendance. //////The CTG and the people behind them are trying to give an idea to the nation that politicians and student politics had created all the economic and political problems of the country. This might be a clever distraction and may not be the whole truth! Our constitution is not working from 1975 onwards and we know the consequences of that. //////Generally speaking, individuals themselves may not be able to take any significant steps about resisting the great threat of global climate change on health. Therefore, in this case, as in many other cases, the national and international policy-makers should think globally and act locally and there is only one suggestion for facing such problems: seek divine mercy. //////It was reported in The Daily Star on May 01, 2008 that a total of 201 white panel teachers of Dhaka University (DU) demanded immediate release of the detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia and other political leaders. In that statement DU teachers said "Reconstitution of the Election Commission (EC), withdrawal of emergency and, above all, holding of the parliamentary election are needed for the welfare of the nation".//////This is in response to the letter of Mr. Nazmus Saquib in DS on May 12, 2008 regarding the above issue.//////The methods and practices of corruption (used in a wider sense) in Bangladesh have apparently been undergoing changes in qualitative, quantitative and other terms, besides the continuation of old methods and practices - where feasible - relative to time space and other variables. The questions now are: Are those developments in the domain of corruption being triggered and guided by the doctrine of necessity or the principle of survival of the fittest (in a sense) or a change in the phase of corruption cycle or otherwise - under the present day changed circumstances? Will those developments lead to eventual repositioning of corruption - as a modified product with a new look - in the market of Bangladesh and elsewhere? What will be the future of corruption and anti-corruption in Bangladesh, per se? //////We the small land owners owning property up to 10 katha in Dhaka city were very hopeful after the declaration published in the national dailies dated 28th march,2008 by the ministry of housing and public works that the government had accepted in principle the idea of allowing the small land owners to build houses after giving up 30% instead of 40% of the total land area for the sake of creating better environment in this mega city.//////I wrote various letters in your daily in the recent past scientifically queering the 'blind bandwagon following' of climate change adherents and the purported perils facing the world and Bangladesh from climatologists and economists. //////The most debated issue is electoral boundaries reshaped by the Election Commission. Last night we had the opportunity to hear a former BNP lawmaker and a retired bureaucrat in gp-t-matra. DS has published an editorial promoting the idea to look at it from demographic consideration and arrive at an acceptable agreed solution. //////I have read your editorial regarding global food crisis. But I think we should think about our food crisis, rather than global food crisis. Our main food is rice, not potatoes or bread. The main reason behind the food price hike, especially rice, is the irresponsible behaviour of the businessmen. Our businessmen are trying to be as non corporative as possible with the present non-elected government. The situation of our business field has always been bad. There is a lot of middlemanship in our present business. Businessmen can do anything with the price rate of their products, especially food products because they are united. I know the present government has imposed some impractical decisions which have gone against the interests of businessmen but that doesn't mean they have every right to do whatever they like. Our businessmen should import some limited sense of humanity for themselves. //////Well, one fine morning, Thursday, May 1, 2008 through the daily Prothom Alo, we came to know out of the blue that one hundred and thirty-three constituencies had been reformed. We understand a constituency can be changed for many reasons. There may be rationale for administrative account or may be for transportation or agricultural block development or anything else which are beyond the discernment of general people like me. But one thing comes to my mind that the Election Commission has just finished their pre-discussion meetings with different political parties, and arguably they got the opportunity to share their idea about constituency reformation. If they shared their views regarding this reformation there should be no objection from the political parties, while they publicly published it. But we know the situation is completely different as just after the publication of the new constituency definition, the Awami League, a large political party, rejected the new constituency reformation. Some other parties also raised objections. Now the question arises as to why the Awami League does not agree with the reformation. Do they find it some kind of gerrymandering? If so, gerrymandering for whose benefit and against whom? Why the EC is silent? //////I am writing with reference to letter by Nokib-e-Kibria (May 10).//////The United Nations said yesterday that only a tiny portion of international aid needed for Myanmar's cyclone victims is making it into the country, amid reports that the military regime is hoarding good-quality foreign aid for itself and doling out rotten food. //////Efforts to form a new government in Nepal suffered a jolt yesterday with two leading mainstream political parties setting fresh conditions to join a Maoist-led dispensation in the Himalayan nation.//////International and Afghan troops forged ahead with an offensive against the Taliban near the Pakistan border yesterday, with a governor insisting 150 rebels had been killed in the past week.//////World powers and Asian neighbours rallied around China with sympathy and pledges of help after a massive earthquake that left tens of thousands dead, missing or trapped.//////Rescuers scrambling over the twisted metal and concrete of this devastated Chinese city said Tuesday they can still hear voices from the rubble more than 24 hours after it was hit by a quake.//////US President George W.

"This is one of the popular residency programme and so I applied for it," says Andaleeb. "The reason why I like to attend such programmes is that if I stay in Dhaka and work, my feelings and emotions become stereotyped. If I remain in one place for too long I sense a lack of creativity. The diverse cultures and customs and the varied environment inspire me.

The successful candidates appear for the viva voce examination and the best candidate is selected for the post of the president or the prime minister, the chief executive. The scenario is ludicrous, not because it is illogical but because it is not seen anywhere in the world. //////RESIDENTS of Dhaka city, and others across the country, see daily lines of hundreds of people in fixed price shops in various neighbourhoods. Being lucky enough to still be insulated from food inflation, I ventured into one of the shops to obtain first hand information. //////ALTHOUGH the balance of power in Asia is stable, the balance of influence is shifting in favour of China. Will China's rising influence translate into political domination, forcing Asians to choose between Beijing and Washington and undermining their national autonomy? Can the United States accommodate China's legitimate interests and compete peacefully for influence? What can other Asians do to recapture lagging US attention and ensure a stable, peaceful and prosperous environment? //////WESTERNERS reacted with outrage to my claim that Asian dumb criminals were dumber than American dumb criminals. I got a large number of reader emails, both of which insisted that US thieves were stupider. One said they were "the dumbest in the world bar none." I hadn't realised what a matter of pride this was. Ownership of this title is clearly among the most deeply held beliefs of intellectual Americans.//////Bad news for the jaywalkers.
