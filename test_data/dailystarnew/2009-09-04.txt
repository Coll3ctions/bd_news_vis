And the practice gets worse when, in order to quell such protests, the law enforcers resort to a baton charge of the protestors. That precisely is what happened on Wednesday when a procession organized by the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports was pounced upon by the police. As so often happens in such instances of harshness demonstrated by policemen, no fewer than thirty people were left with various degrees of injuries on their persons. Among these thirty were ten policemen. It has been given out that the marchers, who were trying to reach the head offices of Petrobangla in Karwan Bazar to register their disapproval of the lease of three offshore gas fields to foreign companies, ended up vandalizing quite a few vehicles as a result of the police action. Vandalism, of course, is always to be condemned. If some of these protestors resorted to violent action, we cannot but unambiguously tell them they did themselves no service.//////THOUGH it is about two months that the first swine flu virus-infected case was detected in the country, a full-fledged public awareness campaign against the pandemic, as promised by the government, is yet to take off. And as if to match it, the level of preparedness to fight the disease, so far as it has been reported in the media, too, leaves much to be desired. //////BACK in 2003, the History Channel in the United States aired a 9-part documentary titled //////. When the documentary directly implicated former U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in its last episode, it stirred an outcry in the political circuit. The Channel apologised to its viewers and to Mrs. Johnson and her family for airing the show. The moral of the story is that conspiracy theories are like a minefield. Even the most cautious step can land on a pressure plate, exploding in outrage. //////GRADUALLY we are getting used to the initial covering up and subsequent disclosure of criminal cases. Under one government, we learn how an apparent killing or a bomb blast is either just an accident or deep-rooted political conspiracy. And then after the change of government, we learn how the criminal cases were distorted during the previous regime to cover up the truth. From "media created" Bangla bhai to the attack on Humayun Azad, or from the Ramna bombing of 2001 to 21st August 2004 grenade attacks -- it's the same story.//////AGAINST the backdrop of increasing incidents of extra-judicial punishments inflicted on underprivileged women in the rural regions, leading to whipping and caning in the name of //////, the High Court (HC) has ordered the law enforcers and local government bodies to take immediate measures against such penalties.

A cat and mouse game is being played.//////The news was published in most dailies on the 20th and 21st August. The decision does not seem to be technically transparent as discussed below.//////The ideology of secularism has come to the forefront again after assumption of state power by the Awami League led grand alliance as this government strongly advocates secularism which is one of the major policies of the AL. But a vast majority of the Muslims think that secularism contradicts the basic faith of their religion Islam. It is not very difficult to understand the reasons if anyone closely observe the definition of secularism which normally means  An ethical system founded on the principles of natural morality and independent of revealed religions or supernaturalism.//////With the expansion of technology and effect of globalization the demand of external education/ distance learning is growing rapidly. Especially, the institutions which have global reputation attract large number of students. The University of London is such an institution and most probably attracts maximum number of students from Bangladesh who intend to attend external programmes. But in sending different fees like application handling fee, registration fee, examination fee the students here face a harsh and painstaking reality. No bank is willing to process the bank draft for distance learning saying that there are restrictions regarding the matter from Bangladesh Bank. They also say only two branches of Sonali Bank are empowered to handle this kind of bank draft. But going to that branches it has been learnt that only the fees of the students who are recommended by two particular institutions are processed through those branches. If their version of the statement is true we must say how bizarre the situation is that the students who directly want to be admitted to London University cannot send their fees without taking the help of any tuition provider, even when it is not necessary for them. To make sure whether the money is going to London University, is it not enough to ensure that the bank draft is crossed in favour of London University? And even after that if it thinks that an invoice letter is necessary it may ask the local British Council or British High Commission but it can in no way compel students to be admitted to a local coaching centre.//////For the last few years we are observing that there is heavy movement of traffic in the Dhaka city during the holy month of Ramadan causing an unbearable situation for the commuters. This can be attributed to two main reasons. 1) The shopping spree for the ensuing Eid starts right from the beginning of the month 2) Most of the English medium schools remain open almost throughout the month. A rough estimate has it that more than 10,000 students in the English medium schools like Scholastica, Sunbeams, Sunnydale, Southbreeze , Mastermind, BIT and others move with cars to and from the school. If their movement is totally stopped during this month it will come as a big relief for other citizens. The school authorities, however, can complete their syllabus by adjusting this with summer vacation. Unless this is made mandatory by the government most of these schools will try to follow their own curriculum / academic schedule.//////The death of Senator Edward Kennedy has robbed Bangladesh of a great friend who came to her side in times of her need. He opposed the position of the then US President Nixon who supported the genocide launched by the Pakistani military regime. Ironically, Nixon stated in his own handwriting, To all hands: DON'T squeeze Yahya at this time. Thus he blessed General Yahya Khan of Pakistan to continue the killings of Bangalis and to push several millions into India as refugees. //////Indigenous children and youth are particularly vulnerable to human rights violations, as they often find themselves caught between their indigenous language, customs and values and those of the wider community. //////It appears the government is being run by the car dealers of the country. They knew that import duty and taxes were going to rise before the budget was announced. So they imported a huge number of cars and released them before imposition of taxes. Customs officials worked day and night to clear the cars in time! But because of high price and economic downturn the car market is slow, at least not up to the satisfaction of car dealers. So, a new devices are adopted to speed up the sale of cars. They will push the 15 years old cars off the city streets. BRTA in anticipation of such design stopped giving fitness certificate to such cars. Many such car owners deposited requisite fees including income taxes as advised by the BRTA officials. //////Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's advice to the people, particularly government officials and executives of different offices to wear casual dresses and avoid suits from March to November to save electricity is another knee-jerk response to power management. It is not easy to control people's lifestyle. Some people always need comfort to work better. There is no holding them back. What we have to ensure is that the government officials enjoying AC are not busy looting people's money and energy.//////Mr. Fazlul Karim Selim, a presidium member and some other AL leaders have demanded interrogation of the former Prime Minister, her son and State Minister for Home, Minister Lutfuzzaman Babar to find out if they were involved in that gruesome killings of many AL leaders and attempted killing of Sheikh Hasina on 21st August 2004. I think they have some valid points for making such a demand.//////Hopefully, the investigation into the BDR mutiny digs deep and identifies the root causes behind the ugly incident. Otherwise, any shallow or glossing over of issues will only leave the root of discontent to germinate in future! Investigation is needed into the utter failure of various intelligence units whose incompetence is one of the major, if not the only real failure in this case. //////The blessed month of Ramadan is for Muslims to renew and practise the lesson of siam or restraint, in eating, drinking and other worldly affairs which give pleasure. It is a month to learn self-control. I am therefore surprised that during Ramadan food prices go up which according to economic science must be because the demand for food items go up, and although Muslims fast assiduously I have not seen anyone actually lose weight in this month by this process.//////In many newspapers & magazines nowadays, horoscope ("rashifall" in Bangla) is printed. These predictions or fortune-telling may be interesting and funny to read, but everyone knows that these are baseless. They do not have the slightest connection with truth or science. How could possibly the movement of planetary bodies and stars effect the regular events in human life? Some uneducated people or distressed persons tend to believe them, giving a chance to mislead themselves. //////The South Asian(SA) Games will start from the 29th January and our swimmers have already started their preparation under the guidance of their Korean Coach Park Taegun.
