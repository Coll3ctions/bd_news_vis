concerns expressed about border-related issues in an internal security report on the post-BDR mutiny conditions. Like everyone else apprehensive about such conditions, we too are worried and for obvious reasons. We note, though, that the new director general of the BDR has been sounding upbeat about matters being under control in the border regions. He states that cross border crimes have been declining, even though the security report does not appear to substantiate his claims. We hope, however, that his optimism is well placed. Overall, though, there are very plausible reasons why the country's borders today arouse our collective concern.//////THE Bangladesh railways, which have for years been performing well below expectations, are now doing even worse, virtually limping with a number of problems.

Mashiur Rahman -- a career civil servant and now an advisor to the PM -- has written a book titled: "Democracy in Crisis," published by The University Press Limited (2008). The 250-page book consists of the articles that the author had published in newspapers and journals, especially during 2002-2007, when political turmoil impinged heavy tolls on the society. Historic and contemporary events, as observed through the eyes of an experienced civil servant, add to the beauty of the book. In the following paragraphs, I shall briefly highlight few of the observations, at times paraphrased, that sounded interesting to me.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has brought seventeen players including five new faces on the payroll and approved allocation of ten per cent of the national team sponsorship money to the players and five per cent to the welfare fund.//////Bangladesh national football team will play a practice match in Nepal ahead of the AFC Challenge Cup, which starts on April 26 in Dhaka.//////Despite his success as an opener, Virender Sehwag has said he still belongs in the middle order and would love to bat there if he got the chance.

Since beating Australia late last year India have been on a roll, with their confidence right up, and Tendulkar felt Kirsten's allowing the team to be themselves was key.//////He may have represented South Africa at the Under-19 World Cup in 2004, but prior to the 2007-08 domestic season, not many cricket fans would have been familiar with the name Roelof van der Merwe.//////Palermo potentially breathed life into the Serie A title race with a gritty comeback in a 2-2 draw with Inter Milan at the San Siro on Saturday as Italian football mourned the victims of the Abruzzo earthquake.//////Harbhajan Singh has said the main reason why India have been able to build on the winning momentum in the recent past is that the players are no more insecure about their place in the side. According to Harbhajan this separates the previous teams he was part of from the one led by MS Dhoni. Harbhajan, who finished the recent New Zealand series as the leading wicket-taker with 16 at 21.37, felt the team management's belief in the players has helped them counter all sorts of conditions.//////So unprepared was Stuart Clark for selection on Australia's limited overs tour of South Africa, he did not have a passport when the call came. "I've just spent the day organising another one," he said.

They keep the atmosphere cool and bring down rain. Yet some people are so ungrateful that they recklessly cut down trees to draw quick profit. The little forests in Chittagong, Khulna, Dinajpur, and Tangail areas are shrinking day by day owing to increase in population. As a result, our forests cannot meet our timber requirement. To make our country prosperous and to check air pollution and to save our earth from greenhouse effects, we should plant more and more trees. Trees make the earth beautiful.//////The main problems of Dhaka city are traffic congestions, scarcity of water, load shedding and lack of accommodation, since there are too many people in Dhaka. //////Much has been said about load shedding. Many initiatives have been taken so far, but no remedy is in sight. It is intolerable for us as the frequency of load shedding is growing higher day by day. We all know that power is indispensable for the overall development of a country, but we have done nothing in this sector. Consequently, our country is facing acute power shortage.//////Honourable prime minister and her cabinet members give answers to the questions asked by members of parliament. I think it is one kind of accountability and transparency of the democratic government to the nation. //////Within 24 hours we suffer 6-10 times from load shedding and there is no electricity supply for 4-8 hours daily.//////The generating capacity of power as assured by the present government will be increased up to 5,000mw within three years from the date of their taking office to run the government. But the Honourable Finance Minister's statement that it is not possible within three years because of financial as well as various other reasons has disappointed the whole nation.//////It is alarming to see that those students having A+ both in SSC and HSC don't get admission in a public university. The quality of teaching is falling day by day. The method of giving extra numbers in exams sheet should be changed. The number should be given according to the students' merit. //////Honestly (!) we are very happy. We have won the battle against the toughest enemy of our beloved (!) corruption. The government should declare a one-week vacation to celebrate it as we are proceeding well to win back our lost place in World Corruption Championship!//////A bill of criminal procedure code titled 'Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 2009' is now on table of the present session of parliament to empower the executive magistrates. That creates great suspicion and confusion, whether the present government really wants to separate the Judiciary from the Executive. It is our ill-luck that in the year 1972 our heroic people framed a constitution where it was clearly stated that the Judiciary must be separated from the executive and our political leaders including the father of the nation Bangabandu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman said in parliament, Judiciary shall be separated from the administration to ensure Justice for people. People of this country are still waiting after long 38 years for real Justice and effective separation of Judiciary from the Executive. One of the framers of our constitution, Mr. Suranjit Sen Gupta MP, is now also the Chairman of the present parliamentary committee and the daughter of Bangabandhu is now the leader of the house. It is very much clear that some vested quarter is working for undermining the spirit of the historic Supreme Court verdict on separation of judiciary on a lame argument, that without the Magistracy power administration cannot run effectively, which is not true. //////Red Rose Films Limited, a UK-based film producing company, has completed pre-production stage of making a full-length English film on the eventful life of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with an estimated cost of $10 million. //////May 5, 1971, is a red-letter day at the famous North Bengal Sugar Mills Ltd. at Gopalpur in Natore district, where about one hundred innocent people including my beloved eldest brother, then General Manager (Administrator), Shaheed Lieutenant Anwarul Azim, MA LLB, officers and employees of the mills were brutally killed on the staircase of a pond in the main mills premises with machine-gun burst fire, by the barbaric Pakistan army, during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.//////The news of your resignation made me sad like many others in Bangladesh. However, we all knew it was coming. I am sure you also know that your resignation has relieved many of our corrupt politicians. Thanks to our State Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs for making it crystal clear in an interview.//////I think the growing use of digitals in our daily lives will be a serious problem for mankind as a whole. In future the growing use of digitals will create unemployment problems. The humankind will be mechanized and they will forget to talk with each other. They will forget to learn languages from actual real teachers in classrooms. //////I saw a report a few days back in most of the national dailies that the government is planning to have metro rail or subway at Dhaka city. Indeed this is very good news for 125 million city dwellers. But if I am not wrong the then 4 party government also initiated this mega project to save the commuters of Dhaka city from the trouble of long traffic congestion. Lots of studies have been carried out in the last five years to ease the traffic jam & a Strategic Transport Plan has been chalked out to get rid of this acute problem. Experts observed that metro rail or subway would be the best solution for the huge population. I would like to draw a few points on a recent statement made by our communications minister in parliament on this mega project. He has informed the Jatiya Sansad that the government is planning to implement this project, which must be appreciated. In Bangladesh, this is a completely new concept & I am afraid whether proper feasibility study has been carried out or not. To the best of my knowledge, this subway train requires uninterrupted power supply to run to & from. On the other hand, a local firm has put forward a proposal for Letter of Intent to the government. It is not clear whether this local company has any previous experience of this sort of job. Our honourable communications minister has also informed parliament that they are going to start another mega project "Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project" by next year which will cost around Tk 11, 000 crore approx. So far I have seen that the government has by this time got commitment of about Tk 7,000 crore from donors like World Bank, ADB, JICA & Kuwait Fund for Development , the rest 4,000 crore is yet to be collected from other sources. As we all know that global recession is persisting & the effect of it has already been felt in the USA, Europe and South East Asia. "Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project" is also an election pledge of this government & we hope that this government will try to implement this project as 75 % of funds has already been committed by major donors. But the subway or metro rail would require another approx Tk 7,000 to 9,000 crore to complete the whole project.//////The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) Chairman Lt Gen (retd) Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury stepped down from his position on April 2.//////I believe the people of this country must know the present value of Begum Khaleda Zia's house. The value of 2.7 acres of land in cantonment area at one crore per khata is Taka 165 crore and 1.5 bigha of land on main Gulshan Avenue is worth Taka 60 crore at least. Till this issue came to public knowledge, I did not know that such huge houses can exist in a most land starved country on this globe. //////I have an intimate friend who comes form a well-to-do family. Once I asked him how many brothers he has. He replied four. Then I further asked what their respective businesses were.
