It has been lived up to by the fact that two agreements were signed by India and Bangladesh during the minister's visit. Of course, one of the two deals is basically a renewal of an old one. It is, however, the new agreement, the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (Bipa), which can be considered as a distinctly forward-looking move in relations between the two countries. The benefits that will accrue from the deal will be of a mutual nature. But what is certainly important from Bangladesh's perspective is that Bipa allows Dhaka to invest in the Indian market, particularly in the northeast of that country. For a nation that has for years been endeavouring to have its goods gain a market in India, Bipa should make a difference. Besides, Bangladesh's need to have India cutback on the negative list involving Dhaka's exportable goods to Delhi may finally be met, hopefully a good part of the way. The reality is that from here on, India and Bangladesh will enjoy Most Favoured Nation relations with each other. That is surely a good augury. //////APART from falling far short of the demand, water supply is often erratic, and over the past two weeks, residents of Dhaka are finding Wasa water to be smelly and dirty.//////IT is often a good thing when someone in the corridors of power, or one who has enjoyed being in power, comes forth with a book. The general feeling, though, is that when men who no more happen to be in power or around it get down to the business of writing books, they arouse our genuine pleasure in reading what they have to tell us. By that measure, so the consensus goes, General Moeen U. Ahmed should have appeared before us with his new book quite sometime, or a long time, after he had departed from the position he happens to occupy at this time. His new book has generated quite a good deal of talk, especially in the drawing rooms of the urban elite. For obvious reasons.//////A debate has been raging in the country on whether transit facilities should or shouldn't be given to India. Some argue that it shouldn't be given unless some core bilateral issues with India are resolved, while some have advanced the view that transit is an economic issue for trade facilitation and should not be politicised. Some have argued that what India wants is not transit but a corridor.//////The spotlight will be on the battle between defending champions Abahani and Gazi Tank when the second round of the Premier Division Cricket League starts today at the three different venues.//////Brothers Irfan and Yusuf Pathan plundered 59 runs off 25 balls as world champions India posted a thrilling three-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the one-off Twenty20 international match here on Tuesday.//////David Hussey's 79 was the top score as Australia cantered to a six-wicket victory in the fourth match of their one-day series against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.//////Tillakaratne Dilshan smashed a maiden half-century to help Sri Lanka post 171-4 in the one-off Twenty20 match against India here on Tuesday.//////Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt has dismissed calls for his resignation by members of the Senate Standing Committee on Sports, claiming that he continues to have the backing of PCB chief patron Asif Ali Zardari.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) kept its promise to keep the game on field for at least ten months every year but the partial domestic calendar (till December 2009) published for the season 2009-10 shows that the country's top footballers will get very little action in six months.//////Guus Hiddink will talk to Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich over the managerial vacancy at the club following the sacking of Luiz Felipe Scolari, his agent said Tuesday.//////Bringing his unique blend of feisty bullishness and a combative nature to the table Diego Maradona will mark 100 days in charge of Argentina with Wednesday's friendly away to France.//////After his public spat with coach Joachim Loew last October, Germany captain Michael Ballack will win his 90th cap in Wednesday's friendly against Norway with the issue forgiven - but clearly not forgotten.//////Brazil national coach Dunga spoke out in support of Luiz Felipe Scolari following his dismissal by English Premier League side Chelsea on Monday.//////David Beckham will steal the headlines if he wins a record-equalling 108th cap for England in Wednesday's friendly against Spain, but Rio Ferdinand hopes the match proves far more significant for the long-term development of Fabio Capello's team.//////The women's cricket team of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka reached Khulna yesterday evening from Bogra to participate in the second round of matches of the GrameenPhone Tri-Nation Women's Cricket Tournament.//////Pakistan's humiliating defeat against Sri Lanka in the one-day series last month forced the removal of captain Shoaib Malik, rubbished as a "loner" who lacked leadership, a report said Monday.//////Khelaghar continued their good form into the longer version of the game after winning the T20 title, when they beat Orient in the Dhaka First Division Cricket League at the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium (DCS) yesterday. //////England great Geoffrey Boycott has slammed the current side for "spinelessly" collapsing during their innings-and-23-run first Test defeat against the West Indies in Jamaica.//////Shantinagar and Mirpur XI recorded identical 1-0 wins in the Citycell 3rd Division Football League at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur yesterday.//////England opener Alastair Cook claimed there is no need for radical change ahead of the second Test against the West Indies in Antigua on Friday.//////Chittagong Mohammedan kept their slim hopes alive for a fourth-place finish in the Citycell B.
