Outside, the blaring drone of a hundred makeshift trumpets held testament to the thousands who had queued up outside the stadium. Inside the Bangabandhu National Stadium, however, an explosive festival of colour, music, dance and unceasing noise signalled the start of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 which will be jointly held in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India. Amidst flashing strobe lights, fluttery LED kites and a thousand irresistible cheers both in and out of the stadium, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 officially open, thereby checking another box in a long list of achievements for a young nation.//////Are we witnessing a deadly concoction of political compulsion and personal intent in the latest government move to prop up the share market? //////Former Irish president Mary Robinson has joined the development partners, prominent personalities and corporations in vowing to protect Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus from politically orchestrated attacks.//////BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia did not attend the inaugural ceremony of Cricket World Cup 2011 despite invite from organisers. //////Three people were killed and two injured after a passenger train rammed a sand-laden truck on an unguarded level crossing at Sreepur in Gazipur yesterday morning.//////Police recovered the body of a 15-year-old girl from the Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) dam on Wednesday night.//////Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus said Thursday he would not be forced out of the pioneering microfinance bank he founded despite pressure from the government.//////Posing as buyers, forest officials have arrested a member of an organised gang of poachers with four skulls, three hides and 138 bones of tigers at Sharankhola upazila of Bagerhat.//////Tragedy struck Dhaka, indeed the whole of East Bengal, on February 21, 1952 when the police fired on the student demonstrators gathering on the Dhaka University campus (Details relating to the happenings of the day will appear on this page of The Daily Star on February 21).//////Muggers stabbed two people to death and injured another in the city's Jatrabari, Gendaria and Sabujbagh on Wednesday and made away with their cash and valuables.//////The Bangladesh portion of Sundarbans is the best habitat for tigers as this beast of prey here can hunt within the radius of only 15 square kilometres, one of the smallest home range in the globe.//////A number of houses of indigenous people were burnt allegedly by Bangalee settlers at Rangipara village under Longudu upazila yesterday, a day after a Bangalee settler was killed by unknown criminals. //////While it was a common phenomenon to wade through a sea of book-lovers at the Amar Ekushey Boi Mela, it was a rare sight to find it almost devoid of people yesterday evening.//////The British government has toughened work visa requirements for jobseekers outside the European Union, doing away with the provision for them to settle in the UK. //////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced concern over unrest in US Gulf ally Bahrain and urged restraint when she spoke yesterday to Manama's foreign minister, a US official said.//////With much pomp and in remarkable grandeur, the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 got underway at Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka last evening.

It had faded a bit when cricket was transferred to the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in 2005, but all the passion came roaring back as the revamped venue hosted the opening ceremony of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011.//////Hundreds performed in the gala opening ceremony of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, but fourteen, were simply exceptional for their roles in the show as they entered the field with 14 captains of participating nations on their rickshaws after the welcome song performed by singers Arnob, Mila, Balam, Elita, Hridoy Khan, Kona and Tipu.//////Cricket's uniting power in Bangladesh is tremendous and as a proof of how much the game, through its premier event, has touched the hearts of millions already was for all to see a few miles away from the Bangabandhu National Stadium.//////Some twenty-five thousand spectators enjoyed the gala opening ceremony of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 from the galleries of Bangabandhu National Stadium, but nearly 50 national sports awardees missed the chance to watch the ceremony from those yesterday.//////A few of the fireworks launchers caught fire near the media centre during the opening ceremony yesterday.//////Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan strode in a bit later in the line of the fourteen captains, causing a mild flutter for a few who were waiting for the youngster.

We, the common people, are facing the irrational price hike of commodities every day. We want to say to the government- Look at us!".//////The party in power was planning to build an international airport on an area comprising wetlands. As a layman I wonder how the experts failed to evaluate the importance of wetlands in maintaining the biodiversity of the country. These wetlands work as water reservoir or retention bodies during monsoon. The country has already lost a great chunk of it to the greed of the people. If this process of destroying the water bodies continues unabated, sooner or later the country would turn into a desert. Instead of standing against it, the government appears to participate in the process of desertification.//////This is to thank the HC bench for its order to evict the illegal shanties and other establishments from Cox's Bazar sea beach and also the authorities concerned for leading the drive in this regard.
