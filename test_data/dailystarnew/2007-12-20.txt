Prayers will be offered for world peace as well as prosperity of mankind.

The Almighty, in His infinite kindness and being satisfied with the prophet's resolve, finally withdrew the decree and permitted him to sacrifice an animal. So, it was much more than an act of sacrificing an animal -- a triumph of belief in the Almighty's endless beneficence over any earthly possession.//////MEDIA, both electronic and print, have on and off highlighted the shortcomings of the relief efforts.
