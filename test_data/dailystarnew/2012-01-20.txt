His death occurred when Pakistan's security forces, on instructions from the government, fired into the crowd. It was a crowd of Bengalis raising the very legitimate demand for a restoration of political liberties in a country long dominated by the military under dictator Mohammad Ayub Khan.

It shows a depraved mentality. The Indian TV channels deserve compliments for exposing the brutal side of the BSF behaviour at the borders. The pictures were a shocking and outrageous narrative of how one cattle smuggler was tied hand and feet after being deprived of his clothes and mercilessly beaten up by the BSF jawans, apparently for not paying up the BSF for plying his trade, smuggling cows. //////The recent encroachment of the Gulshan Lake is yet another stark instance of how the capital city's wetlands and canals are facing constant threats from land grabbers. A news item carried in a leading Bengali daily shows that a dam over five bighas has been put up across the lake without any permission from concerned authorities, dividing it in the middle. Worse still, several tin-shed houses have been erected along the dam, that too, by claiming land ownership. We express our grave concern at such malpractices in the face of the city's shrinking water bodies. //////The hype might have been about Twenty20 superstars like Shahid Afridi and Chris Gayle being sold for the highest prices, but it was the handful of local cricketers who walked away happiest from the players' auction of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) that was held yesterday.//////The usual suspects among the foreign cricketers hogged the limelight in the players' auction of the Bangladesh Premier League yesterday, though there was the fair share of surprises.//////Securing a berth for the final will be the only objective for newcomers Team BJMC when they take on the star-studded Muktijoddha Sangsad in the first semifinal of the Grameenphone Federation Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////Bangladesh golfer Jamal Hossain Mollah lost his way in the middle of the third round of the American Express Bangladesh Open to concede his three-stroke overnight lead, ending the round in joint top position with Indian R Murthy at the Kurmitola Golf Club yesterday.

Buses shou7ld not use the flyovers since all motor vehicles are not supposed to stop on them except in case of emergency. Bus drivers break rules, they behave as if the roads belong to them. They must be stopped from doing so by the authorities. I request the authorities to kindly ensure that buses stop only at designated bus stops. They must also pull over at the kerb instead of stopping on the middle of the road, sometimes diagonally, causing serious traffic jam.//////First of all, accept my sincere thanks and New Year's greetings to your distinguished readers.

For the same reason, hatred was a difficult emotion to summon when one saw this bespectacled bug-eyed octogenarian prisoner whose flowing beard is white as the driven snow. This nation took a close look at Ghulam Azam for the first time in many years, and suffered from that quiet confusion. His imposing bearing scornfully betrayed our knowledge of his infamous background when television cameras zoomed in on his face on the courthouse steps and inside a prison van. //////After the army chief met his putative boss last week after a long interval, presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar assailed accounts of what had passed between them with what could be described as a quadruple whammy: "The reports, without quoting [a] source, are hypothetical, based on conjecture and in the realm of speculation."//////When politics is derailed, a peek into history can give us a break -- both refreshing and instructive. //////Food security plays an important role in social and political stability of a country. But sustaining agricultural growth and food security is a challenge for the present day world, especially for developing countries. Climate change and disasters aggravate the risk further. International organisations are warning about hunger and food insecurity risks in many countries. In this context, the Bangladesh government is considering the issue with utmost priority because Bangladesh is one of the most disaster prone countries of the world. The disaster-hit people need emergency food assistance, as their capacity to access to markets falls drastically. Increasing population, poverty (31.5% of the population is still poor), decreasing availability of land resources and seasonal umemployment in agriculture sector compound the problems. Thus, ensuring food security and effective disaster management are the two enormous challenges for the government.//////Those of you who visited Wikipedia's English page, Google, Mozilla, Wordpress or Reddit on January 18 might have thought that they have changed the outlook and black was the in thing in web designing, but these major websites censored their own sites to observe the blackout protest against two online anti-piracy US bills SOPA and PIPA- currently under consideration on Capitol Hill.//////Rokomari.com, an online shopping portal, was launched in the city yesterday with a view to help both readers buy books without physically visiting any store and pay the bills upon receiving the delivery.//////Huawei, a leading global brand in the mobile broadband and convergence device field, on Wednesday for the first time unveiled a suite of world class mobile devices including Android smartphones, Android tablet, touch phones, messaging phones and music phones in the country, which are designed to give users a simple and enjoyable mobile experience.//////SoftExpo 2012, the largest exposition of software and ICT enabled services (ITES) will be held on February 22-26.
