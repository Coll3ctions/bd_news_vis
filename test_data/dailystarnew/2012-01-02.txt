Although remittance inflow was weak in the first half of the fiscal year, it started to pick up since February 2011 with a rise in overseas employment.

There was a general consensus among all political parties including the ruling Awami League (AL) on CTG. Our apex court in its verdict also recommended CTG for the next two terms of general elections. But the ruling AL-led government suddenly and unnecessarily amended the constitution annulling the CTG system. BNP-led opposition parties have been vehemently opposing this unexpected government move and demanding the restoration of the CTG system. As a result, a dangerous confrontation between the two political camps is looming large. If this situation worsens further, the repetition of the 'one-eleven'-like situation may become inevitable. Taking advantage of the volatile situation, an undemocratic and unconstitutional 'third force' may try to grab power. In consideration of the above, it appears that democracy in Bangladesh is in serious jeopardy.//////May Abdur Razzak's soul rest in peace. In a country where there are few good political leaders, the death of Razzak is a great loss to the nation.//////1st January is the beginning of the English New Year. A new year comes with abundant possibilities. We have celebrated the 40th anniversary of our glorious victory, but apparently we have failed to eradicate poverty and hunger and protect human rights. Let us promise to do our best for the betterment of the country. Let us build a country where there will be no hunger, poverty and injustice. Let this New Year be meaningful for all and bring peace and happiness to the people of Bangladesh.//////The government, especially with Nurul Islam Nahid as the Education Minister, is undeniably sincere and endeavouring to better the education at the primary level. It claims that it is making all out efforts to offer better teaching and learning and to bring the dropout rate to almost zero. But many government primary schools are reportedly running without headmasters. So how the above goal could be achieved remains a big question. As a retired official settled in village, I am rather dismayed to see that Auliabad Government Primary School with enrolment of 500 students under Dohar Upzilla, Dhaka has been running without a headmaster for more than nine months. The previous headmaster was transferred to a place of his choice, but no new headmaster was appointed in his place. The school now has four teachers, of whom three are women, and two of them are currently on maternity leave, each for six months. Now think of the plight of the students! The School Managing Committee met the local education officers on many occasions to arrange the appointment of a headmaster. It also finally met the high officials at the directorate, but to no effect. The local education officers do not seem to pay any attention to solve the problem. //////The other night, the death of a small dog got a prominent coverage on the local electronic media. It was reported that the ill-fated dog died as a result of consumption of unhygienic food imported from China. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is considering of imposing a ban on import of that particular brand of food from China after necessary investigation into the case and the importing company has pledged to compensate the loss. How does this sound to the readers back at home? //////Every country celebrates the New Year in its own manner and customs. The tradition of welcoming the New Year is an age-old practice. The English New Year is particularly celebrated by urban people and the Bangla New Year is celebrated by all the people of the country, irrespective of religion or social status. In Dhaka, people celebrate the English New year by arranging parties for their friends, families and acquaintances. But the young people sometimes create chaos while celebrating the occasion. So the law enforcers must remain alert so that no unwanted incident happens. But the Bangla New Year celebration is quite different and I love to watch people thronging the fairs wearing colourful dresses. As a child, I used to wait eagerly for the Bangla New Year because it would bring lots of sweets and yummy foods. I request everyone not to forget our culture of modesty while celebrating the coming New Year. Happy New Year to all.//////A few years back, I read in the newspaper speech of a leader of a radical political party. It said that the day was not far away when they would be reaching the policymaking level at Washington. Today seeing the lack of US support for nascent democracies worldwide, I find that his prediction was correct. In the backdrop of US reluctance to support the democratic struggles in North Africa, smaller powers such as France and UK had to step in. Here in Bangladesh, we see that US policies are only strengthening the hands of the terrorists, war criminals and fundamentalists.//////Bangladeshi filmmakers have to go abroad to do the post-production work for their films because there is no such facilities in the country. We do not have the equipment; neither do we have technicians in Bangladesh to do the work. There are some production houses in the country, which are not enough for making quality films. As a result, our filmmakers are going to India, Thailand, and Singapore to complete their films' prost-production work. Now it is time we established a number of good quality film production houses in the country. //////Recently, the Border Security Force (BSF) of India killed four Bangladeshis in the border areas of Dinajpur, Kurigram and Meherpur districts. These incidents occurred just after a conference was held between deputy director general-level BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in Shillong. At that conference, BSF again assured Bangladesh of stopping border killings. //////After the death of the president of North Korea Kim Jong-il, his 20-year-old son Kim Jong-un has been given his father's post in this mysterious 'socialist' country. Is there no other person than this 'boy' to run the country? Actually, it is a system of monarchy in a so-called 'communist' state.//////BRAC has taken an admirable step by opening a training centre for creating skilled drivers. I think this was a piece of greatest news of last year. It has long been the demand of the general public. Anyway, it is never too late. Very few issues can be as serious as that of road safety in our country. I strongly believe BRAC will be successful in its endeavour to check frequency road accidents.//////Iran said yesterday it tested a new medium-range missile during war games near a vital Gulf oil transit channel, hours after US President Barack Obama signed a law tightening sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme.//////The first of two Nasa lunar probes on a mission to study the Moon's inner core so as to better understand the origins of planets went into orbit Saturday, the US space agency said.//////President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency on Saturday in parts of Nigeria plagued by a violent Islamist insurgency, and ordered shut the borders with Cameroon, Chad and Niger in the northeast.//////Pakistan and India yesterday exchanged lists of their nuclear sites under an accord which prohibits both sides from attacking these locations, the foreign ministry in Islamabad said.//////A seven-year-old Indian girl was murdered in a tribal sacrifice and her liver offered to the gods to improve crop growth, police in the central state of Chhattisgarh said yesterday.//////UN peacekeepers remain on high alert in South Sudan's flashpoint town of Pibor where escalating tribal violence has prompted thousands to flee, a senior UN official said yesterday.//////Anna Hazare, who has been admitted to a private hospital in Pune after suffering from a viral infection, is recovering and he should not fast at least for the next one month, doctors attending on him said yesterday.//////Alleging that the Congress did not want the Lokpal Bill to be passed in the Rajya Sabha, the Bharatiya Janata Party yesterday said it will launch a week-long campaign across the country to expose the ruling party.//////Non-euro nation Denmark takes over the European Union's rotating presidency yesterday, voicing determination to solve the eurozone crisis by promoting consensus among all 27 EU members.//////British Prime Minister David Cameron is going to miss his target of reducing annual net migration back to the "tens of thousands" by 2015, a think-tank warned yesterday.//////North Korea called on the country yesterday to defend the new leader, Kim Jong-un, to the death, in a New Year message.//////A major 7.0-magnitude earthquake rocked Tokyo yesterday as Emperor Akihito led Japan's New Year celebrations by urging people to work together in rebuilding the nation from March's quake-tsunami disaster.//////Iraq's death toll from violence in 2011 fell sharply from previous years, figures showed on Sunday, as Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called for the country to kick-start rebuilding with US troops gone.//////Dear Fans, //////To mark the 83rd birth anniversary of Mohammad Kibria, Dhaka Art Centre (DAC) has organised a three day printmaking festival titled Kibria Chhapchitro Mela at Dhanmondi.//////'Filmy-Bahas' presents Berlin -based Russian Master Filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky in Dhaka as the first Master of the 'Tareque Masud Master's Class' (TMMC) Series 1.

Known for being fiercely independent in spirit with a strong focus in poetics and reality, Victor is a big favourite on the international film festival circuit as an influential figure in the world of documentary.//////The constitutional commitment to secularism was grounded in our long struggle to rescue Bangladesh from the abuse of religion for political gain. Throughout the phase of Pakistani rule, greedy, corrupt and immoral political elites quite cynically attempted to use religious slogans to mask their anti-democratic rule. The abuse of religion reached its most degenerate form in 1971 when genocide was committed on large numbers of innocent Bengalis, in the name of religion, by a leader and his forces who were totally irreligious in their personal character and motivations. The founding fathers of Bangladesh were, thus, determined that in an independent Bangladesh no scope should be provided to similarly abuse religion for purposes of political gain. Secularism, as it was interpreted in our constitution, was thus never designed to interfere with the practice of religion by any individual or community or to discourage religious education. Nor did we go so far as to discourage any reference to religion in our public educational institutions or public sphere as is the case in some countries such as France with a strong commitment to secularism.//////As 2011 comes to a close, the economic state of affairs in the United States is frightening. The economy has slowed considerably, many people have lost their jobs. Companies are cutting back in the face of declining consumer demand. Consumers are spending less because they are losing their jobs or fear losing them. It's a vicious circle.//////
