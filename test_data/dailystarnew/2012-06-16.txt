The track curls around a lake and is surrounded by lush foliage and tall trees, the blend creates a sense of deep forest. Above, the sunrays touch the green canopy creating a composition of light and shade of a variant hue of tender green.

Research has found that those who lost at least 5-10% of initial body weight and exercise regularly (best is walking) reduces the risk of diabetes almost 60% in 3 years. Lets have some more tips to defeat this disease://////You should not stop exercising during the summer months, just because the mercury has jumped to uncomfortable heights. But you should take precautions to protect yourself against heat-related illness. The American Council on Exercise offers these guidelines://////A 10-year-old girl has had a major blood vessel in her body replaced with one grown with her own stem cells, Swedish doctors report.

Panetta addressed at IDSA in New Delhi. According to him, the defence relationship has done much for ensuring security and stability in the Asian region; various aspects of cooperation such as joint exercises and the defence dialogue have resulted in closer co-operation and co-ordination in areas ranging from fighting piracy and terrorism, to increased inter-operability between the two forces which would be crucial during natural disasters. With non-conventional threats becoming more the norm than the exception, the US Defense Secretary listed out what he described as new and ever more complex threats that the two countries were faced with, in particular, cyber security and space security. //////Quite simply, periodic elections are an integral part of the philosophy and process of liberal pluralist democracy. Election is the mechanism by which modern representative democracy operates. Yet, at least in Bangladesh, it has been treated as a poor cousin of the political ideology, as an afterthought of the process, only to be placed in the spotlight come election time.

His best friend Victor seems to have an explanation and says that the photo is a lucky charm. //////The prevailing situation is really very funny--- the interest of MPs in discharging their parliamentary functions has been declining alarmingly while donors' interest in the strengthening of parliament is still on the rise.
