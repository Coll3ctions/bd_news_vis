The state of lawlessness which Somalia has been going through, particularly in the absence of a credible government, has spawned all this piracy which is today a menace before every nation engaged in shipping. In the past, these pirates have seized not only ships and their crew but have also abducted individuals who were simply on excursions on small vessels. It can be easily surmised as to what torment hostages go through at the hands of the Somali pirates, who hardly have any inclination, other than demanding ransom, towards demonstrating decent and civilized behaviour.//////England crushed Australia by an innings and 71 runs after a spectacular collapse of wickets early on the final day in the second Ashes Test at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.//////The 1992 World Cup, the fifth cricket World Cup, was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand.

Locals rescued Moni and admitted him to Jessore 250-bed General Hospital.//////At least 20 people were injured in a clash between two factions of Awami League over illegal toll collection at Sreepur village in Tahirpur upazila on Sunday. Locals said AL activists Akbar-Motiur Rahman group of village Sreepur Kurerpar and Shoyeb Mia-Mohibul group of Shibrampur village had been collecting illegal tolls from coal and limestone laden cargo ships and trawlers in Patlai river in the area since long.

The deceased was identified as Habiba Begum, 20. Family sources said Tofazzal Hossain married Habiba, daughter of Suruj Miah of Karimpur village three years back. Tofazzal since then used to torture his wife for dowry. On the fateful night, he asked Habiba to bring dowry money from her parents. An she refused to do so, he became furious and beat Habiba mercilessly leaving her dead on the spot. On information, police recovered the body yesterday morning and sent it to Sadar hospital morgue for autopsy. Tofazzal and his mother were arrested in this connection. A case was filed.//////On 12th December 2008, Awami League leaders declared election manifesto and electoral pledges by announcing Charter for Change. On the following day i.e. 13th December 2008, all the newspapers carried out special news features about AL's declaration of new vision and mission. It is hoped that the honourable editor and readers of The Daily Star can recollect it. We, the general people, were very optimistic about the future golden days to come. We thought that the evil things of the past would disappear and new era in our life would come if AL was voted to power. There would be no lie, no conspiracy, no false statement, no hypocrisy, no vandalism, no session jam in the educational institutions, no extortion by the political leaders and activists and so on. We were dreaming that the prices of all essential commodities would be within the reach of common people. In brief, the past with bad things would be replaced with many good things for us.//////The construction work of the much talked about and controversial Jatrabari flyover has started. How many people and motor vehicles would use the giant flyover from one end to another and help lessen and solve the traffic jam in Dhaka city? The flyover would not be able to help the people of the important, busy and crowded areas. The huge waste of time in Dhaka roads is due to frequent halt of motor vehicles at innumerable road crossings, road squares, road turning points, road intersections and traffic signals of important and busy roads. Construction of a giant flyover will not reduce the traffic jams in Dhaka. We can neither reduce the growing population of Dhaka nor do away with its increasing number of vehicles. Further we cannot ban holding of meetings, rallies and processions; and hawkers and vendors will stay on the streets. //////The year 2011 has been recognised by the UNESCO as the International Year of Chemistry (IYC 2011) in an attempt to increase the general interest in this field of science. This Year of Chemistry will commemorate the achievements of chemistry and its glorious contributions to science and mankind. The resolution of IYC was put forward by Ethiopia, co-sponsored by 23 nations, and the declaration from UN came in 2008. To make the year a success, different national organisations such as Royal Society of Chemistry, American Chemical Society, Brazilian Chemical Society, and regional federations like European Association for Chemistry and Molecular Sciences have taken many programmes. The events arranged will surely try to involve the public and the young generation for making them aware of the significance of chemistry in our everyday life. //////Nowadays, we see that many parents get their kids admitted into schools as soon as s/he turns three. At an early age, it is natural for the kids to play and learn the ways of life from their parents and the surrounding environment. But the kids are compelled to take the load of studies in these days. This is harmful for their mental health. So, I request all parents not to admit their kids into schools until they reach the age of six.//////Incidents of harassment are taking place one after another. The usual way of handling the cases by the law enforcing authorities is not enough any more. In the usual way, after the first few days of hue and cry the matter subsides.//////The recent news in media on misuse of Norwegian aid by Prof Yunus drew my attention. This is simply vilification of a man whom they honoured with a Nobel Prize very recently. I am not a supporter of microcredit or any NGO activity. Microcredit helps, in certain cases, some people and some time, but not a poor society at large and never. But Prof. Yunus firmly believes that microcredit can be a good way for poverty alleviation in poor countries. I do not doubt his sincerity. I strongly believe that Prof. Yunus is an honest man and trying to do something for poverty alleviation. I disagree with him on the benefit of microcredit and I don't believe that microcredit can make any society well off and poverty free. Only a good government and massive investment aiming poverty alleviation can help a country to uplift from the curse of poverty. Don't the Norwegian and Western world know it? Why this hue and cry now? //////Quite frankly, the performance of the Bangladesh cricket team against New Zealand took us all by surprise. Except for a few instances, they were quite professional in playing the game. There was a marked difference in their body language, especially in the fielding department; earlier we've seen countless times the good work of the bowlers being spoiled by shoddy fielding. And it should be mentioned how Shakib Al Hasan has grown over the years and led the team from the front. We've seen him providing crucial breakthroughs, steering the team out of danger when wickets fall consistently at the other end, and of course, winning games for Bangladesh almost single-handedly. Bangladesh team is performing brilliantly in the five-match Micromax ODI series against Zimbabwe.//////Musa Ibrahim, the first ever Bangladeshi to conquer the Mount Everest, did not get the honour, recognition, any grant or even an award from either the government or any private organisation for his outstanding achievement. The government is still a silent spectator. Why the government or any private organisation is not coming forward to encourage him is still a mystery to me. I have come to know that he is undertaking more challenging missions in future. He should be supported by the govt. and other agencies as well.//////Bangladesh has a population of over 160 million. The area of Bangladesh is too small for this vast population. As a result, we are facing many problems. The government should launch awareness raising programmes along with other measures to contain this problem which is the root cause of all other problems. The authorities should implement the plans of the government. People should be made aware of the gravity of the problem so that they will consider taking two children only. Proper education is the key to succeed in reducing the birth rate. Campaigns would be very effective in the villages and urban slums. The country will not develop in any sector unless population problem is contained.//////Bangladesh is a country with a lot of possibilities. But we cannot utilise these because of our leading political parties' bad practices. Political environment was never in a stable position in our country. One statistics shows that Bangladesh has suffered about three years of hartal in thirty-nine years. //////We are living in a city where there seems to be more vehicles than people. Apart from the private cars, which are fairly in good condition; taxi cabs, CNG auto-rickshaws, public buses (except for the BRTC buses) are in a dilapidated condition. These public transports, as I might put in my own words, 'have died a natural death many years ago.' But they are still plying the roads of Dhaka. I wonder why the government is not taking any steps to get these 'dead vehicles' off the road. May be the authorities concerned to check the fitness of these 'dead vehicles' are offered a good amount of bribe to keep their eyes closed. It seems like BRTA's motto is - see no fitness, and a pocket full of richness! //////The government has completed its mission, eviction of Khaleda Zia, not caring about people's views, feelings, and likes or dislikes. The manner in which it was settled is very disquieting. It seems that the government does not care about the people. //////Readers may well be familiar with the term "chariots of fire" fondly used by the famous French writer Dominique Lapierre in his novel "City of Joy." Dominique Lapierre used this term to describe the rickshaws of Kolkata.//////Dewan Farid Gazi, Mir Shawkat Ali, and Lutful Hai died one after another recently. We are greatly shocked at these deaths in such a short time. It is said that the only permanent thing in this universe is 'change'. Death is one kind of change. Every death makes a vacuum. All the citizens of this independent country mourned the deaths of these freedom fighters. I express my condolence to the bereaved family members. //////People of Khilkhet area were shocked when they saw a real estate company named "Home Stone Limited" occupied the maximum portion of a footpath near the local police station and the foot overbridge. A police box was also built by occupying the footpath. This time, the footpath grabbers used the name of the police. Hundreds of students, office goers and local people of Nikunja-1 and Nikunja-2 are suffering every day. It will definitely tarnish the image of the whole police department.//////Dear readers, //////British Prime Minister David Cameron said yesterday that next year must show "irreversible" progress in the anti-Taliban war, expressing hope that British troops could start leaving Afghanistan in 2011.//////French President Nicolas Sarkozy condemned Pakistan yesterday for allowing extremists "safe havens" in its tribal border areas, as he paid tribute to the victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks.//////Climate negotiators hailed a brighter mood as global talks enter the home stretch yesterday, with China voicing flexibility on issues of global cooperation that have dogged past sessions.//////A powerful explosion tore through a crowded religious place in the Hindu pilgrimage town of Varanasi, killing a young girl and injuring 24 people, including two foreigners.//////Key points in the latest secret US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks://////The husband of a woman murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa plotted his wife's death, one of the men charged with her killing has told prosecutors.//////The International Criminal Court chief prosecutor on Monday launched an inquiry into whether North Korea should face war crimes charges over attacks on the rival South.//////A senior US diplomat arrived in Myanmar yesterday, officials said, for the first high-level talks with the government and democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi since her release and a controversial election.//////A Japanese probe reached Venus yesterday and prepared to enter orbit on a two-year mission that would mark a major milestone for Japan's space program and could shed light on the climate of Earth's mysterious neighbour.//////A major WikiLeaks donor is in trouble in Germany for not filing its accounts on time, but authorities insisted yesterday this was unrelated to its ties to the under-fire whistle-blowing organisation.//////Six world powers wrapped up two days of "substantive" talks with Iran on its contentious nuclear programme here yesterday, with the two sides agreeing to meet again in Istanbul next month.//////China yesterday hit back at the United States and its Asian allies for their refusal to talk to North Korea, saying dialogue was the only way to calm escalating tension on the divided Korean peninsula.//////Iyad Allawi, who won the most votes in Iraq's elections, threatened to quit a power-sharing government in an interview with Britain's Times newspaper yesterday.//////The UN's former top climate official Yvo de Boer has accused developing countries, such as India and China, of trying to rewrite the Bali Action Plan.//////As you step into La Galeri of Alliance Francaise de Dhaka in Dhanmondi, you might get a shiver.

And that is precisely what the Awami League-led administration appears to be bent on doing. In the name of bringing in amendments to the law relating to Upazila Parishads, it is actually busy trying to devise the ways and means by which it can strip the upazilas and indeed all forms of local government of their very essence. //////In 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited India without his partner.

Through such change teachers make people more productive. However, the responsibility of teachers is not limited to skill development only, but also extends to producing responsible, ethical citizens. The graduates provide leadership in accelerating economic, social, political and moral development. This implies that quality assurance of higher education is a function of the appropriate roles of professors. //////International news headlines have recently been dominated by an action taken by the US Federal Reserve, its central bank, and cryptically known as QE -- short for quantitative easing. QE has many other names. The simplest and the most politically charged name for it is "printing money;" however, QE has a more exalted pedigree, and a more meaningful one since it owes its origin to the Japanese-language expression for "stimulatory monetary policy."//////IT'S vital to keep children abreast of current affairs, which was why I used the recent WikiLeaks affair as a bedtime story. //////
