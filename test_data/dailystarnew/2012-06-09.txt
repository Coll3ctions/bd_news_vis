Thus happened a union of nature and my mental preparedness to read the book that became so close to my heart. This book sings to you, recites to you, it tells you stories, narrates essays and reads letters to you. The wholeness of Tagore's writings against the backdrop of the monsoon -- his most favourite season is near complete in this work compiled by Muhammad Habibur Rahman. It is enriched further with a preface written by him in a marvellously scholarly way. It is a treatise. One cannot expect to find each and every write-up of Tagore on the same theme to be included in one book, for obvious reasons, and, therefore, a sampling is done to represent Tagore's feelings, thoughts and messages through careful research. It is not only his erudition and love for rich literary work that are so well-known but also the fact that in the preface, Rahman emerges as a consummate musicologist, which is some discovery to cheer ourselves up. //////On April 7, 2012 nearly 124 soldiers and 11 civilians were buried alive in an avalanche.
