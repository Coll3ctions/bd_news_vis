With the Secondary School Certificate examinations beginning this morning, it is estimated that as many as 42 per cent of registered students at the SSC level will be dropping out even before the exams get under way. By any standard, such a huge number of examinees staying away from examinations which are regarded as a decisive stepping stone to higher education is not only surprising but also raises questions about the direction in which education is headed. As to the matter of why these students, more than 5,00,000 in all out of a total of nearly 13,00,000, will not sit for the examinations, a number of reasons have been cited. Included among these reasons are some fundamental social problems like students' inability to clear their dues before the examinations, failure of students to get promoted to class ten from the preceding class, inability of many to emerge successful at the qualifying tests for the exams, early and sudden marriage in the case of girl students, et al.//////WITH the deteriorating crime situation in the country, especially in the capital city, Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) announced plans for the second time in the media to carry out raids to apprehend listed criminals. We are aware of very little result achieved by them in the last week's drive as the top terrors or their godfathers remained out of the dragnet. In the first phase of the drive they only succeeded in apprehending some drug addicts, small-time peddlers or muggers. When the crime network apparently remains one step ahead of the police, we wonder why should DMP send wrong signals to them by making its plans public? It is only likely that immediately after the announcement, thugs flee to take refuge in some safer areas and remain there as long as the hullabaloo lasts. //////WHETHER or not Bangladesh should devalue its currency is a question that has assumed some prominence.

On top of that, they are dying at the hands of people when hunger forces them to go beyond their locality. //////Albeit having some flaws, "democracy" is the best among the different doctrines in politics.

Federer was ready before the game to take himself to the elite group of maximum number of grand slam winners Pit Sampras was alone before him only. On the other hand, Nadal had to make a mark there in Australia winning that trophy --- it was his maiden Australian grand slam. //////Occupying a big chunk of land of immense value, the police control room at Shahbagh, Dhaka serves no purpose. There is no reason to have a separate police control room in the heart of the city and depriving the city dwellers of a breathing space. Moreover, the police control room is not situated centrally either. The city has expanded far and wide. With modernization and expansion and increase in the number of the police stations in the city, each of these police stations should be developed separately to serve as control room. In case, the police authorities feel the necessity of having a central control room, it should be located elsewhere. Possible sites could be Sher-e-Bangla Nagar or Nilkhet. The entire area presently occupied by the police control room should be vacated and the area developed and beautified under the overall development of Suhrawardy Uddyan. Outside the police control room premises are few shops and billboards. These should be removed immediately to give the landscape a cleaner and greener look. As of now, the entire area looks chaotic and clumsy and needs refurbishing. //////As we see for transparency of government actions in various disciplines, an instrument or institution for check and balance is necessary as a watchdog. I offer my humble opinion here as follows://////Thank you for publishing pictures taken from the recently concluded Bishwa Ijtema in your daily (February 3, 2009). It really helps readers to understand the magnitude of participation of Muslims in this congregation. However, I differ (though I am not a scholar in the field of Islam) from the way you described the Ijtema in the page. The Bishwa Ijtema has been referred to as 'the second largest Islamic congregation in the world'. Obviously, the reference was made in comparison with the Hajj, a compulsory congregation of 'financially and physically capable' Muslims. My view is that Hajj is a congregation where it is compulsory to participate only for a 'capable' Muslim, whereas necessity to participate in Bishwa Ijtema is voluntary ('nafal'). I think it is not proper to compare a voluntary Islamic event ('nafal') with a compulsory Islamic event like Hajj ('farz'). I would appreciate if you verify this view of mine with qualified Islamic scholars. If my view is valid, then I would recommend everyone to refer 'Bishwa Ijtema' using the phrase 'the largest voluntary Islamic congregation'. //////Since this new government took office, this is the best news for the power starved and fuel import dependent country as reported in most dailies on February 3. Congratulations to the government for a pragmatic policy decision, taken in the overall interest of the country.//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina rewarded her loyalists and handed favours to certain members of her party. //////Recently, I was reading an article on agriculture written by eminent media personality Mr. Shaikh Siraj in a national daily while my four and a half years old toddler was playing beside me. A photograph of Mr Siraj was attached in the inset of the article. When I asked my son to name the man, he instantly recognized him. Mr. Siraj has emerged as an icon of Agricultural Information after decades of persistent service for creating awareness in the agriculture arena. This story asserts that if some one dedicatedly and devotedly serves the nation for a good cause he can reach so deep in people's minds, even in the minds of kids. //////While giving the inaugural speech in an international seminar on jute, the jute minister aptly remarked that the collaborators of the soil along with World Bank and IMF policy caused the golden sector's demise.

We have to import the major part of such essentials from abroad and people are already groaning under pressure of high prices of basic necessities! //////I read with interest the letter under the above heading published in your issue of 4th February written by Prof. Zahedul Haq. //////We find this incredible that ministers can think that a bilateral transit or a corridor is only an economic issue and is beyond any gamut of political considerations. We, as a nation, are surely headed for a disaster if this mindset persists. We urge our respected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to intervene and to request her ministers to get up-to-date on issues of political economy and regional cooperation. We are speechless to see that currently our ministers are speaking along the same line of argument that is being advocated by the Honourable High Commissioner of India on bilateral corridor/transit, purely from an economic perspective without any political consideration whatsoever. While we surely need a friendly relation with India, we must not forget that on this particular issue, we are two contending parties engaged in a sharp diplomatic discourse, trying to maximize our respective country's interests. //////The above is an economic as well as political issue. When we want to politicise it, we turn it to our benefit. Primarily it is an economic issue .If transit is allowed it will benefit the stakeholders of the Chittagong Port and service providers. Their income will rise and scope of business will rise. Transit ICDs will mushroom with the influentials trying to get part of the cake. Some of the customs brokers will specialize on transit cargo. Transport companies will be routing containers through Bangladesh to the entry points in India. Franchise holders of the toll roads/bridges will be happy to have additional trucks on the highway meaning more income.

We, the Bangladeshis, have renewed our faith in democracy in spite of disappointments that have haunted us for more than one and half decade. The office of the presidency has been repeatedly belittled by partisan and reckless politics of successive ruling parties. Since AL has come to power with promise of change, for a change, let's propose the following presidential vow for the ruling party.//////CRITICS of Zionism and Israel -- including a few Israelis -- have charted an inverse exceptionalism, which describes an Israel that is aberrant, violates international norms with near impunity, engages in systematic abuse of human rights, wages wars at will, and has expanded its territories through conquest. This is not the place to offer an exhaustive list of these negative Israeli exceptionalisms, but we will list a few that are more egregious. //////
