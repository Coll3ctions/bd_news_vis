In an important way, that was indeed what was done across the country. Aside from the usual rituals and mouthing of platitudes, certain factors related to the population issue were brought to light. And it is these factors, or realities as we know them, that we must now handle.

This time it was in Jahangirnagar University. It appears they went on their 'cruelty show' to facilitate land grabbing by their paymasters. A few weeks back their fellow compatriots of Barisal Polytechnique even played a more harrowing drama perhaps for similar pecuniary gains. The government has shown profound anger and annoyance, but to no avail. Can we suggest the ruling party to disband the Chhatra League for the next two years ? Even forever? I would like to remind here that in Awami League's 7 years struggle against BNP-Jamaat and the army backed caretaker government, the BCL had little contribution. Even in the last election BCL workers were hardly active. The Awami League has got such a vast number of workers in the field level that they have no need for such unruly student activists. What they need to do is to organise genuine workers in ward, union and thana level.//////An important and investigative report was published in the front page of a local English daily on June 29.

She also needs a place to sleep (at least a tin shed).//////After the recent bombing of a Sufi shrine in Lahore by the Taliban and their acolytes, Yasser Latif Hamdani, a columnist for Lahore's Daily Times, wrote on July 4: "The purpose was not to create fear. The purpose was to target the soft traditions of Sufism traditions that have influenced Punjab's social milieu for centuries. This popular Islam is the reason why there is a Muslim majority in Pakistan." It is the Sufi tradition of non-violence and toleration in the sub-continent that attracted many low-cast Hindus to convert to Islam. Moreover, Sufism allowed Sunnis and Shias in the subcontinent to live in relative harmony.//////I was reading a write-up duly published in the Medical News Today and learned that Obesity is not just a problem for the USA, it is not just limited to other developed countries either - it is a problem that has spread throughout the globe, and is now recognized as an insidious killer and the major contributing cause of preventable diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease - according to Professor Paul Zimmet, chairman of the 10th International Congress on Obesity, Sydney, Australia.//////After the Netherlands won against the mighty Brazil, some people said that it was an upset. In this sense, it must be the biggest upset when you saw how Spain ousted the Germany from World Cup semi-final. Germany is three times World Cup winner and also thrashed the mighty England & Argentina in a row whereas there is nothing in the history of Spain except 2008 Euro Championship. So, beating Germany should be the biggest upset. Credit must go to the Netherlands not Spain as they beat Brazil from behind (0-1 to 2-1). Some small teams score first than defend during the whole match or score more in counter attacks but they do not win from behind. If they do so, they are not the small team. //////The gruesome murder of the minor boy Samiul, a student of nursery class, reportedly at the hands of his mother and her paramour has surpassed all known tragic incidents in the world. The cursed mother allegedly committed this barbarous crime to continue her illicit love with another criminal without any hindrance, as the news goes. This is simply beyond any normal human being's capacity of thinking. Words fail to express our disturbed and shocked mind when we read the news of the murder of the innocent boy. We strongly abhor and resent such kind of inhuman and brutal acts. //////The volcanic eruption in Iceland has resulted in dark clouds all over the European continent; as hundreds of air flights stood cancelled day after day.//////The Daily Star carried an editorial on 5 July under the headlines "Rumours Leading to Unmitigated Violence".

I heard that in the night Brazil was defeated by the Netherlands violence occurred in some places in Bangladesh. Today, I noticed a small news item in a Bangla daily that a person had committed suicide after the defeat of his favourite football team, Argentina. A few years back there was a street procession against a dramatist who in his drama punished a villain in his drama story.//////I read with great interest the recommendations of Sir Frank Peters of honouring Bangladesh's newest hero Musa Ibrahim with a postage stamp (Daily Star 5/7/10).

I will go to USA/CANADA/AUSTRALIA/ENGLAND/SPAIN etc. There I will complete my post graduation and then I will take a very good job Then I tell them that BANGLADESH is going to lose you. But tell me why don't you want to come back? They say Bangladesh is a place of poverty, natural disaster, terrorism .Who will give me a good job, a handsome salary to run my family wonderfully? Who will give me a secure life? Moreover, there are no enough palaces to use my brain and my education. Even there is no place for experiment.
