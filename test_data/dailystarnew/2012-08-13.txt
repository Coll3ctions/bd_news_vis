An amending clause in 1991 however, required treaty involving national security to be placed in a secret session of parliament. This somewhat diluted the original provision, yet the operative necessity for tabling it in the JS has remained intact. Although even the definition of secrecy is debatable, the overarching need for an elected democracy is to subject a treaty to perusal, discussion and scrutiny in the House of the people. Because such a government is obliged to let the people know what it had signed up to.//////Granted, CNG drivers' refusal of service to passengers on demand or their charging arbitrary fares are genuine public irritations.

What is incredible is that it also runs at midnight, at 1am, 2:30 am, or at any hour, and is strong enough to pull down an old building. This is happening at Banani road 11, near Moms and Kids shop. There ought to be some civic laws governing uses of such heavy machines in the homesteads.//////Although post offices in the advanced countries are facing closure due to the development of email and other quick electronic services, I have enough reason to justify the importance and promotion of our post offices.

But Enemy Property Act-1965 still persists and continues to make Hindu minority homeless. Sadly enough, after the independence of Bangladesh, all the elected governments wanted to repeal this black law but none of them took pragmatic steps to materialise it. Finally this government passed Vested Properties Return (Amendment) Bill 2011. But the new legislation, however, does not clearly address how the previously seized properties will be returned and it is uncertain whether the Bill will be effectively implemented. In addition to that, the time period set is too short for them to understand and apply to reclaim their property. According to the bill, in the event of death of the original owner, rights of inheritance shall apply in accordance with Hindu religious personal laws. Hindu women would therefore be automatically excluded from inheritance. This latest Bill may thus become yet another in a series of laws that have failed to return confiscated properties and end the ongoing encroachment of Hindu owned land. So, the government should give highest importance to this to ensure the return of the property by maintaining transparency in the legal procedures for the survival of this minority group in Bangladesh.//////Clashes between Bodos and minority immigrants in the lower Assam districts have caused panic within the Indian government.

There were grammatical mistakes in statements made by our prime minister while replying to Stephen Sackur but that is not a problem because many heads of state cannot speak in English at all.

So when on July 25, the Spanish ten-year government bond yields shot up to 7.75% (the Italian bond yields were not far behind), he realised that something had to be done quickly to lower the borrowing costs of the fourth and third largest economies of the euro area. Otherwise, there would be no economic recovery in these countries. He also felt that the euro itself was in grave danger. Next day, he appeared at a press conference and pledged to "do whatever it takes to preserve the euro zone." That meant buying Spanish and Italian debts on a massive scale. No wonder, the financial markets rallied immediately.//////This summer has been unusually hot in Washington, with temperatures flaring up to 100 degrees or more.
