Ten readers were selected through lottery from the numerous responses to the programme announcement, and they engaged in a lively discussion with Farooki over a wide range of issues. Excerpts from the discussion: //////Those, who are familiar with Nazia Ahmed, know of her ability to render ragas and semi-classical compositions to western instruments.

In particular, the infraction committed by state agencies, as reported by a rights body, is considered very worrisome and thus requires positive action. It is in the context of such a scenario that a discussion on the imperative to correct the alleged situation assumes added significance.//////Pakistan's fragility, as a state and as a tenuous democracy, has been made manifest yet once again. In bizarre fashion, its military and its judiciary, aided not a little by a rabid cleric, have now joined hands to send an elected government packing. No one has any argument with the notion of the Zardari-led government being corrupt as well as incompetent. Whether it ought to go into a spell in opposition, or whether it needs to take that path at all, is for the people of Pakistan to decide at the next election. And the election is not too far off. If the government manages to finish its five-year term in line with the constitution, Pakistan's people can take justified pride in their determination to promote political pluralism in the country.//////Bangladesh remains bogged down in abysmal poverty that thwarts development in all sectors. In rural areas, there is desperate poverty mainly because of bad politics and uncaring governments. Government efforts to eradicate poverty lack vigour and planning. Policy makers indulge more in rhetoric than taking action. Only when such pronouncements are replaced by serious analysis and bold action will the government discover what has gone wrong in the past years. Given that the time at the disposal of the government is very short and the task is colossal, it has to shake off the past, abolish the corrupt practices and begin a process of renewal.//////One thousand eight hundred extremely poor women in Rangpur are not only lifting themselves out of poverty but also contributing to our national foreign currency earnings through the export of their goods to high-end shops in Canada, Australia, France and England. //////Watch out.

Frequent floods, cyclones, river bank erosion, water-logging, drought and tornadoes significantly disrupt Bangladesh's economy and lives and livelihoods of its people. Climate change has added a new dimension to the risk environment with global predictions suggesting that the country could expect more intense cyclones, storm surge and flooding and that a rise in sea level could have a significant impact on the lives and livelihoods of up to 15 million people. //////It is estimated that 135 million people in Bangladesh have been affected by natural disasters, and while many have lost their lives or been injured, many millions have also lost their homes, land and livelihoods in the past 20 years. Bangladesh also has proven capacity of handling disasters like cyclone, flood and river erosion. But changing climate is also changing the disaster pattern of the country. International Climate Change Risk Assessments, published in 2010 identified Bangladesh as the world's most vulnerable country to negative impact of climate change and high intensity of natural disasters. //////Industry continues to pose a potential threat to environment, both globally and locally. It accounts for approximately one-third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and a large percentage of generated hazardous waste.//////When Tagore came to Rajshahi and Kushtia (1890) to take charge of his property, it seemed miles away from a life he was used to. The setting was a sharp contrast to Kolkata. But shortly he settled down to the different lifestyle, and spent long stretches of time watching the panoramic scenery from his boat on the river Padma. The seasonal variations enthralled him. On a rainy day he would watch the lightning darting across the dark clouds, listen to the thunder echoing over the plains. In summer, the unruffled peace and tranquility, the truant boy who played the flute on the sultry afternoons, all enchanted him. And most importantly, the young 30-year old zamindar became increasingly fascinated by the folk melodies of the bauls, fakirs and bhaisnabas (folk artistes).//////I looked at the magpie outside my flat window in London, looking for food in the wet grass. It was December in London and I was getting ready for my trip to India. I kept thinking of the days I had spent in Kolkata and the friends I was about to spend time with.//////It's cold, not the kind that makes you frozen but the one that touches your bones, makes you shiver from the bottom of your spine.

Some observational evidence suggests that vitamin D supplements might slow progression of the disease. But a two-year randomised placebo-controlled study found that vitamin D did not reduce knee pain or restore cartilage, according to an article published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.//////Late one night in the summer of 2009, four improvised 107-millimetre rockets arced over the Pul Kanjari border outpost in Punjab, and exploded in the fields outside the village of Attari. For the first time since the war of 1971, there was an attack across the India-Pakistan border. In September that year, four more rockets were fired; then, in January 2010, there was a third assault. //////Aquiet Chinese challenge to India's pre-eminence in South Asia through diplomatic and aid effort has now been extended to small island nations dotting the Indian Ocean. While China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asian nations fight over specks of islands and reefs in East and South China Sea, mainly because of undersea resources, islands in the Indian Ocean are emerging as a new focus for struggle. The latest hotly contested arena: Maldives, a chain of 26 islands about 1000 kilometers due south from India. With just 320,000 nationals, Maldives has assumed a disproportionately large profile primarily because of its geopolitical position astride strategic sea lines of communication and China's attempt to win influence.//////Zounds! It seems ideas really do matter in international politics and strategy. The South China Morning Post carried a long article last week confirming the influence Alfred Thayer Mahan now exercises in China. Someone should run with that topic -- forthwith! Not that Chinese scholars or practitioners of a nautical bent are bashful about advertising their enthusiasm for Mahanian theory. America's sea-power prophet has been a fixture in Chinese strategic discourses about the sea for at least a decade.//////Ron Suskind's //////Men is not a calm first draft of history. It is not an impartial or unbiased look at the Obama administration's first two years. Rather, it is an investigation. The crime is homicide, and the victim is the promise of Barack Obama's presidency. //////Rabindranath invariably believed in a religious view which is directly related to the greater welfare of humanity as well as human beings. He was neither an atheist nor a great believer of conventional religions. In one of his poems he asserted that he was not interested in leaving any view because he was complete through consuming all the beliefs into himself. Tagore philosophizes that truth always merges into a unified whole. While writing the book Rabindranath: Dharmabhabna (Tagore: Thoughts on Religion) Professor Kajal Banerjee, an influential Bangladeshi essayist and poet, portrays Rabindranath would perhaps believe in a God of humanity. He brings out multifarious perceptions of Tagore regarding religion through a number of quotations from different sources. He has also added his own comments to clarify Tagore's points of view, thus adding a new dimension to this literary piece. //////In Mehrdad Baladi's disturbing novel, Houri, there's a brief moment at the beginning that is emblematic of much of the subsequent story. As the narrator returns to his native Iran and the airplane enters Iranian airspace, Flight attendants hurried to remove wine and whisky from trays. Men rushed to rinse the stink of alcohol from their breath. Women donned dark hejabs to hide their hair and curves, scrubbed makeup from their faces. Passengers were bracing for an inquisition, or something worse. Even from thousands of feet above, and an hour before the plane landed, I caught a sense of the intolerant terrain waiting below.//////
