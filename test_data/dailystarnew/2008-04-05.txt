We welcome the move.//////There are 75 lakh ultra poor households in the country. Of these, 50 lakh are covered by some kind of social safety net including VGF programme. If the remainder 25 lakh families are serviced by a new programme, their hardship in these days of skyrocketing prices will be somewhat alleviated. In this context we welcome the Tk 100 crore employment scheme taken in hand by the food and disaster management ministry. Its implementation is envisaged in the current month.//////CRISIS is nothing new to this nation. In fact, it's hard to think of a time when we Bangladeshis, have not been faced with a crisis. With that said, there are always a few problems, which in my opinion deserve immediate attention. //////Bangladesh and the United States of America are likely to go to polls at the end of this year. In the USA voters might be in the mood to try something historic. It is hard to remember a time when a black American has been in such a prime political position. Barack Obama is the first black American candidate to have serious chance of winning the presidency. Unsurprisingly, in Bangladesh we are perhaps going to witness business usual once again. A majority of our politicians from both the major parties are considered loyal sycophants. Perhaps they are waiting in the forlorn hope that their leaders will be released from prison soon and make the politics of Bangladesh business as usual. Their excessive optimism and naive idealism suggest that they are still in love with the past politics. They are interested for next election only, but not for next generation.//////Since my stint as Permanent Representative to FAO, while being Ambassador to Italy, I have been involved in keeping track

Reportedly, many individuals took solemn vows to resist corruption in personal and public life, and to educate their fellow citizens about the ill effects of this virus. The doughty ACC chairman led some such processions. It could not have happened at a better time.//////Biofuel emerged as an alternative fuel to benefit the biotech companies and the trans-national corporations (TNCs) which claim that biofuel is a unique `green innovation' of the modern technology sensitive to the environment, ecology and the poor. Refuting this TNC claim, reputed and established scientists of the world are saying that the TNC claim is contrary to the reality as biofuel production causes food scarcity and environmental degradation. That by propagating this, they are rather committing crime against humanity.//////The war in Iraq enters its sixth year this month with death toll of US troops exceeding 4000. The war in Iraq, which began in March 2003, will continue into the foreseeable future if Republican candidate Senator John McCain is elected President in November this year. This is the impression the people in the United States get from the political campaign. //////Seen as the most violent days of war in Iraq, recent days have witnessed unprecedented violence in many Iraqi cities, particularly Baghdad and Basra, but this violence comes in many guises and objectives, while allegations are spreading about the return of relative calm to Iraq.//////St. Martin's Island -- the only island in Bangladesh supporting coral reef-like ecosystem and coral-associated flora and fauna -- was declared by the government as an Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) in 1999. The island has undergone dramatic changes in recent years particularly in the development of local tourism and sale of landed properties. Even after almost ten years of getting protected status the island has yet to see major interventions by the government to protect and conserve the ecosystem and ecological functions that govern the island and near-shore marine ecosystem. Corals and coral-associated flora and fauna form a unique and vital part of this near-shore marine ecosystem. The National Conservation Strategy Implementation Project-1 (NCSIP-1) developed a management plan for the island in 1996-97. As a follow-up St. Martin's Island Biodiversity Conservation and Eco-tourism Development Project (SMBCEDP) was implemented by the Ministry of Environment & Forest during 2000-2007 by the government's own revenue budget. The SMBCEDP collected huge information on the island and near-shore marine biodiversity and also initiated several activities for the conservation and management of the fragile island ecosystem. The results of the said project still remain to be made public.//////Bhawal National Park is located at 2401/ N latitude and 90020/ E longitude, about 40 km N of Dhaka on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway, encloses a gazette notified area of 5,022 ha (inclusive of 584 ha transferred for army and air force bases), and is under the territorial jurisdiction of Dhaka forest division. The park was established by the forest department in 1974 and formally published in gazette(1982) to protect the near complete depletion of vegetative cover and wildlife in the area as well as to halt the process of acquisition of land for other purposes because of its close proximity to Dhaka. There are both privately area of 950 ha within the gazette notified national park area which is divided into recreational zone and a protection zone. There are about 202 ha of private land in the identified core area and about 650 people live within this core area. //////Environmental pollution is one of the most talked about topics and alarming issues in the ecologically threatened world of today. Pollution of different environmental components is leading to terrific environmental degradation that ultimately results in the deterioration of ecological balance. Radioactive substance is a highly toxic material, a fatal environmental pollutant. The magnitude of its mischievous effects is in a range that might be said figuratively to represent a 'quantum jump'. //////Do I look very weird?//////The thought sickens me as the bus shakes while taking a turn.//////It was the first day of spring, but the cold and damp air that hit me as I stepped out of my house this morning at 6:00 AM reminded me that it's anything but spring. New England winter can be sometimes harsh, compared with Bangladeshi winter, but we use the season to good use: Christmas, New Year and of course, Ekushey, all happen in winter. In the true Bangladeshi tradition, we never miss a chance, come snow or blizzard, to show off our costumes (read sarees for women and kurtas for men) and to get together to chat, sing, and dance, or just reminisce. //////The present title alludes to W.H. Auden's poem Petition' in which the poet-turned-Oxford-professor urges to 'publish each healer that in city lives'. The recent issue of ////// on 'the new architecture' has a similar conviction. In a brisk survey of the recent architecture in Bangladesh, Kazee Khaleed Ashraf--//////s guest editor for this issue--and his co-writer Marina Tabassum forward a petition for an 'urgent architectural intervention' to stem the rot in our urban landscape. The lack of vision on the part of the city-fathers as well as the profit motive of owners and developers is duly blamed for the 'catastrophic nature of the urban environment'. In addition, Ashraf and Tabassum frankly admit that the 'large scale building enterprises triggered by a globalized economy and vying for an international standard' has become 'the order of the day'. The new generation of architects mentioned in the article offers a pleasant respite from the 'real- estate equation'. The construction of 'the gardens in the air' by the green architect Rafiq Azam, the poetic adoption of space after ////// by the Urbana architects Kashef Mahboob Chowdhury and Marina Tabbassum, the creation of 'Bengali moodiness' by Uttam Kumar Shaha are mentioned among others who manifest the new styles of architecture, heralding a change of heart. //////It is hard to believe that the fifth anniversary issue of Kali O Kolom is out, that five years have rolled by since the country's premier literary journal started its journey. Congratulations are in order, not only for having displayed the stamina required to prevail over such a period (a year is usually an eon in terms of a literary journal), but for the continuing excellence of its issues. Kali O Kolom goes from strength to strength, as is amply demonstrated in this volume. It begins with Hasan Azizul Haq's poignant account of his childhood in the depths of rural Bengal that provides an unforgettable picture of the country as it was during the 1930s and ends 335 pages later with an essay on Rokeya Begum. In between is the usual cornucopia of articles, short stories, poems (a section which is particularly strong in this issue, with some major poets weighing in), novellas, nonfiction, in memoriums which will occupy the Chaitra days (and extending well into Boishakh) of its devoted, intelligent and responsive readership. //////My lamps in the lighthouse never blaze at nightfall//////I don't know who keeps them snuffed out,//////Who creeps up stealthily to snatch away my lamps!//////Your male forefathers would rub their favorite tobacco on the palm of their hands//////My female progenitors would know they must leap into the flames//////Nowadays, however, they are complacent in their tribal skin,//////And sing melodiously in the mountains of Khagrachari and Bandarban.//////World Health Day  7 April, marks the founding of the World Health Organisation (WHO).

IAS President, Pedro Cahn, referred to Mr Jias sentence as a failure of justice.//////GOVERNMENT is the tool to implement the wishes and aspirations of the people mandated through the election under the stern eyes of the opposition and the accountability institutions of the state. With one tier steel-framed government the reality is Bangladesh has no democracy. It is abused and reduced to bribe-taking and toll collection; check and balance is simply missing. Accountability is only in the rolling tears of the hapless victims. //////THE short answer is: yes. In war, the side losing the initiative risks defeat, especially when momentum shifts to the enemy. Despite Germany's spectacular victories from 1939-1941, Paulus's surrender at Stalingrad in February 1943 combined with the US entry into the war in December 1942 spelled Hitler's doom. //////BHUTAN or The Land of Thunder Dragon (Druk Yul in Bhutanese language) is a tiny land locked kingdom of 47,000 square kilometers nestled in the laps of pristine landscape of Himalayas, wedged between giant neighbours India and China.//////Rehman Sobhan's role in Bangladesh's history has by now certainly been assured. As one of the young economists who identified themselves with the growing calls for regional autonomy in East Pakistan in the 1960s, he was one of the figures who played an instrumental role in the formulation of the Six Points. The rest, as they say, is known history. In post-liberation Bangladesh, Rehman Sobhan played a significant role in the formulation of economic policy, a task that was certainly not made any easier given the politically and socially disturbed conditions following the end of the nine-month war in late 1971. Those were tumultuous times, a period that tested the mettle of the political leadership as also of the intellectuals associated with the powers that be. Sobhan was certainly a significant pivot in the Bangladesh wheel at the time. He was, and remains, a formidable intellectual force in the country.//////As the name suggests, it is a book about the Islamic community in Britain. The West has long been intrigued by the Islamists of Asia and the Middle East. Set in the 1980s, the book will definitely quench the desire of those who wish to be enlightened about the radical Islamists of Asian origin. It is about a young Muslim of Bangladeshi origin, a British boy brought up in the UK. It aptly deals with his dilemma of being a Bangladeshi as well as a Briton at the same time. We have seen writers like Monica Ali, Zadie Smith and Manzu Islam dealing with Bangladeshi second generation immigrants being torn apart by their need to hold on to the traditional values and the need to be assimilated in their new-found home. A very few writers have shed light on the history of young Muslims turning into radical Islamists.//////Censorship of creative works, especially fiction, is alive and well in much of the non-Western world. That said, it is no surprise that ////// has been a threat to authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Yousef Al-Mohaimeed's native country. What a pity that this imaginative writer's novel cannot be read by the readers for whom it was intended. What a blessing that the translation into English is at least available for many of us, following the original publication of the Arabic text (Fikhakh al-ra'iha) in Beirut. Perhaps there is no better way to understand the zeitgeist of a given country than by examining the way it treats its artists.//////Hashem Khan is known as a reputed painter in our country. He is also the author of quite a few informative books. Most of the books are related to art and painting. Zainul Abediner Sharajiban is one such work, where we are brought in touch with Zainul Abedin's life and the circles within which it moved. The book, in addition to focusing on the artist's life, looks at Zainul Abedin as a teacher, organiser, patriot, curator and above all a good human being.//////The narrative is in the third person and speaks of the mysteries and experiences the author went through what was an observant boyhood. In more than one sense, it is also a depiction of geography which soon expands into an exposition of heritage in times that are no more. A strong whiff of the fictional is here.//////
