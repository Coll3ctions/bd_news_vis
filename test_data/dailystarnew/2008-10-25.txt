Indeed, the incident took place in the presence of the vice chancellor himself, which was clearly a sign of the limits these admission seekers were ready to go in order to make themselves heard. Such behaviour on the part of the young, indeed on the part of anyone for that matter, calls for stringent disciplinary action. Unfortunately, though, not only has action not been taken; but now a group of teachers known as the white panel at Dhaka University have echoed the demands of these admission seekers. Something of disbelief comes with such action on the part of the teachers. It is these very teachers who were earlier involved with finalising the admission procedures. In an about turn, they have now warned the vice chancellor that unless the rules are relaxed, they will have nothing to do with the admission process this year. There is certain whiff of an attempt to politicise matters here. If that is the case, it will be most unhealthy.//////SOMETIMES a simple event can have a ground breaking significance.

Responsible people in such quarters are of the view that the villains of our public life have not been punished in sufficient numbers and that we are very steadily reverting to wherefrom we started on 11th January 2007. The question is should we lose heart as quickly as we do? Is it not time to dispel the gloom?//////CLIMATIC disruption, barren fields, dried up wells and hunger on a scale never before known by humanity are now a reality. The prospect is horrifying, and this is what Lester Brown, president of the World Watch Institute in Washington predicts for 2050, when the earth's population will have more than doubled from the present 6 billion and the capacity of science to devise methods for coaxing more food out of the soil will, in his view, be greatly diminished. The situation may be too alarming as Brown calculates, with specific mention of the dire economic situation in some Asian countries. Look at the figure : the population of Bangladesh at the time of liberation in1971 was 75 million and in less than 40 years it has crossed 140 million mark. With 953 people living in a space of one km and the present birth rate standing at 1.43 percent as said by the Chief Adviser Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed while inaugurating the World Population Day programme in the city in the recent past, (although the figure revealed by other sources puts the growth figure at 2% ) there would be 30 lakh new mouths to be fed every year. Consequently the agricultural land in the country continues to decrease by one per cent every year bringing the present cultivable land to 60 lakh hectare from 90 lakh hectare in 1980. With population increasing even at this rate, we will become more populous and impoverished than many other Asian countries bigger than our size.//////Greenhouse gases naturally blanket the Earth and keep it about 33 degrees Celsius warmer than it would be without these gases in the atmosphere. Over the past century, the Earth's temperature has increased by about 0.5 degrees Celsius and scientists believe this is because of an increase in concentration of the main greenhouse gases namely carbon dioxide (76%), methane (13%), nitrous oxide (6%), and fluorocarbons (5%). People are now calling this climate change over the past century the beginning of 'Global Warming'. Fears are that if people keep on producing such gases at increasing rates, the results will be just negative in nature, such as more severe floods and droughts, increasing prevalence of insects, sea level rising, and Earth's precipitation may be redistributed. These changes in the environment will most likely cause negative effects on society, such as lower health status and decreasing economic development. //////Yet another expatriate Bangladeshi has been gaining prominence slowly but steadily in the international arena. He has been working on renewable solar energy for more than a quarter of a century. This particular area of science has come to the forefront in view of energy crisis and global warming. Recently he has won Boston Mayor's Green award for community leadership in energy and climate protection.//////Whoever has experienced the sweltering summer days of Dhaka will agree that average temperature of Dhaka City has increased over the decades. The scorching heat during daytime and hot, see thing nights coupled with load shedding are the bane of the city dweller's life. But why the temperature is so high in Dhaka? The answer can be attributed to a unique feature of the urban climate known as Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect. The urban heat island phenomenon was first discovered in the early 1800s in London. But it is not clear yet whether it is related to global warming. //////Satyajit Ray's film Shatranj ke khilari satirises two determined chess-playing nawabs who are so engrossed in their game that they ignore the evaporation of their princedoms by the British. //////That's him, Simon.

However, the vicious power struggle between Mujahedin factions led to a civil war that devastated Afghanistan the second time. As the Mujahedins were busy fighting a new force composed of young Madrassa students, known as the Taliban (Students), came sweeping from Pakistan's border all the way to Kabul in 1996. The Taliban were recruited from Afghan refugee camps, indoctrinated in Pakistani madrassas, and trained and equipped by the ISI. Darul Uloom Haqqania, a madrassa in Akora Khattak, about 40 miles west of Peshawar, run by Maulana Samiul Haq, a JUI leader, claimed to have provided most of the Taliban recruits and the leadership. Meanwhile, the Madrassas across Pakistan had no shortage of students especially from poor rural background for whom free lodging, food, as well as some education was far better than being jobless and hungry at home. Many of these students have routinely been recruited by the Jihadi organisations to go to Kashmir or inside India to spread the Jihad. Some of them are now turning against their own government as suicide bombers or assassins. It has been reported that the poor parents with a number of sons are pressured to give one or two sons in the way of the Allah i.e. become a Jihadi. The parent's refusal could bring shame and harassment, and if they agree, financial inducement follows. Interestingly, the Mullahs or their children never decide to become a Mujahid or a suicide bomber; always the poor are sacrificed on the altar of God.//////IN a campaign not going well for Senator McCain, there was more bad news this week. Gallup Poll taken on October 20th gave Senator Barak Obama an 11% point lead in the presidential vote preference of all registered voters, 52% to 41%.

That future will include something of a change in mind-set for Air Force intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), said Colonel (select) Scott Murray, the Air Force headquarters special assistant for ISR transformation.//////After the Royal Marines, the US marines will also be holding a joint military exercise with the Indian Army in Ladakh. US Army Chief General George Casey along with his Indian counterpart Deepak Kapoor visited Ladakh and its adjoining areas to select the location where the Indo-US military exercises would be held.

"The ship has enough endurance to remain there and provide security to Indian flagships carrying cargo till another warship is sent there to replace it," a sources said. The government on Thursday had approved the deployment of an Indian naval warship with helicopters and marine commandos on board in the Gulf of Aden to carry out anti-piracy patrols of the route followed usually by Indian commercial ships between Salalah (Oman) and Aden (Yemen) in west Asia.//////The Indian Air Force (IAF) is planning to host its own version of the US Air Force's (USAF's) Red Flag' exercise, in which it recently participated for the first time.

That he was a brilliant writer of prose too is manifested in his novels and short stories, however few they may be in number. His best work in prose is, however, Smritir Shahar, his memoirs of Dhaka written for adolescents but liked by adults even more. The book was first published in 1979 and later reprinted in 2000 by Jatiyo Grantha Prakashan. It was first serialized in the late sixties in the monthly Tapur Tupur, perhaps the finest juvenile magazine ever to be published from Bangladesh. Shamsur Rahman and Dhaka are inseparable entities. He spent the whole of his creative life, in fact the whole of his life, in Dhaka. While singing Dhaka's glory in Smritir Shahar, he declares his unconditional love for the city and reaches great heights as a narrator. //////It is said that great and lofty ideas can only be expressed in parables (Oslu).The epic poem Masnavi of Jalal al-Din Rumi is a book of such parables. Masnavi means rhyming couplets. Its original Farsee name is Masnave Manavi, meaning spiritual couplets, which has an immense influence on Islamic literature and thought. It is the greatest masterpiece of Moulana Jalaluddin Rumi who lived in Persia (modern Iran) during the 13th century (1207-1273). For the last 800 years, Masnavi has been considered an invaluable treasure of human civilisation, a beacon of light in philosophy and religious literature. As a recognition to this unparalleled contribution of Rumi, UNESCO declared 2007 as the year of Rumi. Worldwide programmes were chalked out in the same year to commemorate the 800th anniversary of Rumi's birth where Rumi's contributions to world literature were highlighted. Against such a backdrop, Isa Shahedi, a well known Farsee scholar in Bangladesh, embarked on translating Masnavi from original Farsee to Bangla in order to meet the long awaited thirst of Bengali readers. //////Rabindranath Tagore's visit to China in 1924 must have been a moment of realisation for him. There were those in the country, scholars as well as students, who saw in him an august presence already made famous by the Nobel Prize for literature.
