It took me some time to realise that he was not a Bangali by origin (he and his family came from Gazipur, Uttar Pradesh, India), because he was so fluent and flawless in Bangla and injected so much of colloquial corruptions into his Bangla conversations that it was difficult to discern any non-Bangali trait in his origin. It is only when I came into personal contact with his parents, his four elder brothers and one younger brother (who remains the only surviving brother till today) that I came to know of his roots. Later he told me that he started in infancy his elementary education in a toll run by a single Gurumashai under a banyan tree at Hilli, Dinajpur where his father had a business.//////THE recent survey report by the National AIDS / STD Works Programme on the spread of HIV infection in a section of the intravenous drug users ( IDU ) in a certain area of Dhaka city is alarming.

With prevalence rate of 5 per cent or more considered as epidemic for any disease, the large incidence of HIV infection in a concentrated population in the city is a chilling message to all vitally linked with the development of the country. //////THE term 'white elephant' is said to originate from Thailand where the ancient Siamese King punished problematic members of his court by presenting them with the animal, the upkeep of which would ruin the courtier. Providing our poor with only housing, as limited to a house as a place to live, is such a stiletto dressed in veil of sugar, and designed by a higher echelon.//////DHAKA, a city of teeming millions, requires improvements in housing situations. Persistent housing shortagethe gap between demand and supplyis one quantitative aspect of this housing situation. Sustained delivery of affordable and liveable dwelling units and land to all people, then, becomes a priority in housing. A recent initiative for housing delivery is the Proposal for Comprehensive Housing Development for Dhaka City, presented at a seminar on 19 June 2008 by Prof. Nazrul Islam and Ms. Salma A. Shafi. They authored 'a vision for housing programme by 2025'; the 'philosophical stand' concerns housing for all, satisfying affordability, equity and environmental sustainability. The proposal was prepared as an 'immediate response' to the desire of the Honourable Chief Adviser to suggest a comprehensive programme for housing development in Dhaka city. Noting several recent events focusing different housing issues, including PRSP 2 initiated and REHAB participated ongoing discussions, a review of this proposal is felt due to contribute to a public debate. //////I was taking in John Lennon's psychedelic sky while standing off the highway leading from Rangpur to Kurigram. It was October 2005. The late autumn afternoon sky was painted in vivid green, orange, marmalade, red, and maybe even violet and indigo against a backdrop of soothing blue. If that, indeed, was what induced his psychedelic vision, the Beatle really did not have to be galvanized by any hallucinatory drug to have it. The view was, to use a hackneyed word, breathtaking. //////Theatre-related activities in this southern part of the country date back to the 19th century. But the practice in the form of modern theatre kicked off only after our liberation in 1971. Since it would be an arduous task to cover all those events together with an account of the rich cultural tidbits, tThis letter therefore includes only those events and influences that have significantly shaped theatre activities in Bagerhat. In fact, recent upheavals and some obvious changes in this field gave me the idea for writing this piece.//////While the cover art of////// tends to be chosen from among the works of some of the leading artists of Bangladesh, even by those high standards the cover of the current issue of our premier literary journal acts like a magnet for the eye.

Every smoker has the right to know the health consequences associated with smoking.

You could therefore ask if there is any particular need at this point for a new interpretation or presentation of the case for the Bengali language. Of course, there is, if the work you have in hand is AMA Muhith's. There is a particular charm in reading this book, and it is that the writer goes to extraordinary lengths to examine the political situation obtaining in Pakistan before and after the tragic deaths of Bengali young men on the streets of Dhaka on 21 February 1952. In conditions where much of haze yet dominates our understanding of the nature of the movement that reached a climax in 1952, Muhith does an exemplary job of researching the micro as well as macro aspects of the old struggle.//////Times were, and this I remember from my childhood though I probably shouldn't say it since it is revealing of my advanced age, when cooking was a mystery wrapped in enigmatic colours and smells and was the sole monopoly of our mothers. Cooking signalled its presence every day with the ritual trotting off of either the household help, (a small tart-tongued boy in our case), or in more traditional households the head of the household, to the market with a //////. The day's middle passage was garnished, marked by sounds of activity, along with the occasional din of pots and pans and slices of old-fashioned tongue-lashing at ham-handed kitchen help, emanating from the kitchen which in those days was so eminently women's domain.

Does every individual have an address, an abode, a house, a shelter, a home of his own? Is Mr Biswas a vagabond, a rootless identity with no place of his own? It is a man's quest to free himself from the social shackles, to break away from tight traditions of joint family and conservative community customs and find a place and an identity of his own.//////Creative writing gurus say the title of a novel or a book always matters to readers. If a book has an attractive or meaningful title along with good content, the book has all the chance of being gleefully accepted by the audience, readers as well as critics. Many opine that the title tells half the story of a book, even a collection of short stories. //////
