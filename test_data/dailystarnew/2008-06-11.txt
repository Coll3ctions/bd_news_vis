But when chips came down at the end of the year, the mismatch between calculations and achievements proved to be rather glaring. This truism might hold good even more with the present budget. For, apart from the mega-size of the budget of Tk100,000crore, even though partly explained by inflationary erosion of money value, what is really jarring is the sheer extent of the budgetary deficit exceeding well over Tk30,000crore. How is the money going to be garnered or the deficit met?

In securing the presumptive nomination of the Democratic Party, he scored a slew of firsts.//////WHAT does a dictator look like? I don't think it's an easy question to answer. More because of the fact that the two dictators many of us have the unhappy memory of encountering in our brief history look so different makes this easy question a much more difficult one to answer. One had an inborn inability to smile, and the other, though keeping a smiling face most of the time, had a foxy cunning look full of deception and dishonesty. So, if anyone is looking for a facial expression of a dictator that might resemble or symbolise Gabriel Garcia Marquez's patriarch in his twilight by looking at our own dictators is bound to be disappointed.//////Back in May 2000, India played Pakistan in the Asia Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium.
