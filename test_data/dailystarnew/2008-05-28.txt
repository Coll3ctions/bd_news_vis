and general elections unless party chief Sheikh Hasina is freed introduces a worrying new element into the political dynamics of the moment. The concern is fundamentally that if the AL sticks to its decision to boycott the voting, a situation will likely arise that can only complicate an already fraught political atmosphere. We at this newspaper have stated earlier that our politicians and our political parties must put the national interest above any other considerations. It is especially at a time like the present that such maturity is called for. //////AGAINST the backdrop of intermittent food crises in the country, the government decision to allocate funds to the tune of Tk. 622 crore to carry out agricultural research is a timely step. The research endeavours will be directed towards finding ways and means to increase production of essential agricultural commodities to meet the need for food. The burgeoning population and growing demand for food make such research all the more pressing at the moment. Reportedly, the fund under the project titled National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP) will be distributed in two phases, one for research and another for extension services. It has also been said that a sizeable portion of the fund will be spent for building an effective marketing system for farm products, project preparation and coordination. According to the government, the implementation of NATP would raise production of crops, fish and livestock by 10 percent and increase farmers' income by 20 percent.//////THE reformists, if they are really that, in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have clearly fallen on bad days. Saifur Rahman has made a safe exit out of the country. How he managed to do that and who let him go remains a mystery. Mannan Bhuiyan is in jail.

This is of course a great day for everyone of us who can feel the meaning of citizenship.//////Recently a letter was published in The Daily Star drawing the attention of all with comments on the Ethical Aspects of the medical profession. He is right that medical profession is different from others as a human service within the framework of strong ethical guidelines. It is not a mere provider of service commodities in exchange of money or price, rather beyond that. Advertisements on medical practice and service that are common today are more reflective of general trading. There is dire lack of agreed consensus based moral code of conduct or guidelines in any arena where human interactions take place. Moreover, the little which is there is fast evaporating. Medical practice is one of them. It has been expected that a government should be the prime mover of this matter. But the government of Bangladesh has endorsed the present commercialisation process of the medical practice by imposing VAT on specialized medical practice. //////Democracy is a government of the people, by the people and for the people (Abraham Lincoln). Democracy is the ruling system by which the will of general citizens gets priority in governmental activities. Democracy helps to foster or sustain the process of good governance which is the latest element of development in the third world countries. //////The respected Senior Assistant Editor of DS in the above titled piece mentioned that the PWD, RHD and WDB carry out the task of construction of bridges, in places not necessary, due to political desire of the local MPs. There are factual errors in it. First, the PWD is not concerned with construction of bridges, it is mainly the job of RHD and sometimes WDB. Both the organisations are not in the good books of the MPs as they conduct comprehensive feasibility study requiring much time before taking up any project, especially projects like construction of bridges which generally involve high costs. LGED, however, is the eye candy of the MPs as it is famous for its quick implementation with no or little feasibility study and donors also like it as it can spend funds very fast.The finance ministry and the line ministry of the engineering department concerned is responsible for timely disbursement of allocated funds in the four quarters of a financial year. Sometimes progress of work may get hampered as funds are not released in time. //////The city usually has about 20 million people during daytime and 12 million at night, as about 8 million people rush to the city and leave it after the day's work. Of the inhabitants of Dhaka city, about 25% people live in unhygienic places and without any good civic facilities like water, gas electricity. It is a matter of great regret that each and every day people are facing serious traffic jams. //////We need more power to develop faster. //////Private universities are free of student politics. But, are we to assume that they are free of corruption too? There is a sinister side to the issue that seldom gets mentioned.//////Since childhood I am well aware of Sylhet's prominence as 'A land of a bud and two leaves', which refers to the tea, of course. We all know how tea is embedded in our Bengali culture and heritage. No meal, conversation and hospitality is complete without this hot beverage.

Right?//////I particularly loved Mr. Naeem Mohaimen's article on May 19th, entitled 'the usual suspects'. He made some great points (with a great deal of wit as well) about the tendency of the Indian administration of treating Bangladesh as its scapegoat for everything that happens to go wrong. I greatly appreciated his reasoning in the article and it truly was a delightful read!! //////It was the responsibility of this government to warn the Myanmar authorities that hurricane Nargis was going to hit them. It was very odd to witness the government being relieved to watch that Nargis was heading towards Myanmar. This is not the way to develop good neighbourly relations. But couldn't this government warn the Myanmar authorities? Maybe such a high cost in life could have been avoided. Cooperation in weather forecasting was necessary.//////Two teams have participated in the BFF election held recently and nearly an equal number of contestants from the two sides have come out victorious. Salahuddin, the country's best and legendary striker, is the new president. On the other hand, Salam, another popular striker who has the record of scoring the maximum number of goals in a single season in Dhaka League, was elected senior vice-president. Not only Salahuddin and Salam but also Aslam, Badal Roy, Helal, Babul, Rupu and many other popular footballers have won this year.//////The govt. banned the use and production of poly-bags all over the country on March 1, 2002. But it is a matter of great regret that poly-bags are still available in the market. Both shopkeepers and customers are unwittingly using poly-bags to carry goods. //////Obviously Dhaka is choking due to its size. Pressure must be taken off this monster. //////In recent decades, economics studies have gotten us used to seeing our shared property - the atmosphere, the water, natural resources, fauna and flora - as something to be taken for granted. Land and water used in the past to grow food have been allocated for crops used to produce different types of biofuels, and the result has been an increase in food prices that today threatens quite a few countries. Feasibility studies of these projects must take into account the costs which, in the past, we used to overlook. We must decide what we want to consume - automotive fuel or food? Biofuels are a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional transport fuels and are climate-friendly. "Not all renewable energy is totally 'green," Wind turbines, for example, disrupt scenic panoramas, are often a source of noise pollution and harm fauna in their vicinity, such as birds. When calculating costs, a zero cost is affixed to birds, but it should not be forgotten that animals are part of the food chain, and the elimination of one species affects other species of flora and fauna and thus ecological balance is disrupted. Many countries are converting rainforests, savannas, or grasslands to produce food-based biofuels. They are just thinking about the economic benefits and environmental impacts are not taken into consideration. //////I was gratified to offer my expertise on preventing drug abuse among the young kids in a drug awareness programme for parents in a reputed English medium school in Dhaka. We were a four member team who were involved in developing and facilitating the presentation. By the way I am not one of the seasoned social workers or an expert on the public health issues. And being an amateur, I, out of passion, opted to participate. In the back of my mind I always kept a strong wish to synchronize my passion and prior real life experiences to build a professional carrier in this field.////// The finance adviser while addressing a seminar recently on agricultural credit reminded the farmers that there is no free lunch. It was a misplaced accusation and at the same time very derogatory to the farming community. The farmers not only feed themselves but all of us by producing enough in all adversities. This year's bumper boro and potato harvest is a testimony to the above mentioned fact.//////I had to visit the Dhaka Education Board office a few days ago. While waiting there, I went to the canteen to have a cup of tea. To my horror, I found the (so called) waiters filling water jugs directly from the Wasa tap, in front of everyone. Immediately that jug went to a table, and the water in someone's stomach.//////As far as English teaching at the SSC and HSC levels is concerned the motto has been communicative English. It emphasises communicative competence whereby a learner is able to produce meaningful sentences in different contexts. In other words, in communicative method, two skills-- listening and speaking --get the priority. The irony is that in our country the students of those classes have to sit for a written test where the two skills--reading and writing---are tested.//////Chinese authorities yesterday ordered the evacuation of 80,000 people as troops scrambled to hold back a dangerously swelling lake formed by this month's devastating earthquake.//////Iraq's national security council has asked Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to ensure that a pact under discussion to extend the US troop presence beyond 2008 will not harm the national interest.//////Sri Lanka's president vowed yesterday to press on with a military campaign to crush Tamil Tiger rebels, a day after guerrillas set off a bomb inside a train killing nine and wounding 84 people.//////Iran may be withholding information needed to establish whether it tried to make nuclear arms, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday in an unusually strongly worded report. //////Foreign aid workers yesterday pressed into Myanmar's Irrawaddy Delta, testing the junta's pledge to open up areas where one million people have yet to receive aid three weeks after the cyclone.//////Pakistan should strike back at terrorism or it will see more attacks like the one that killed Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, United States Homeland Security head Michael Chertoff said on Monday.//////Twelve people including three policemen were killed yesterday in two bomb attacks in Afghanistan, officials said, pinning the blame on Taliban extremists.//////al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden is hiding in the Karakoram segment of the Himalayan range, Arabic television network Al-Arabiya quoted its sources as saying on Monday. //////Britain today called on Pakistan and Afghanistan to work together to face the challenge posed by the Taliban, saying a "committed regional approach" alone could help build on progress made so far in tackling militancy.//////Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told MPs on Monday that Israel was left with no choice but to launch indirect peace talks with Syria, a top Israeli official said.//////Children as young as six are being sexually abused by peacekeepers and aid workers, says a leading UK charity. //////A US millionaire who is the key witness in the latest corruption probe against Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert admitted in sworn testimony on Tuesday that he gave large sums of cash to the premier.//////Israel has "150 or more" nuclear weapons, former US president Jimmy Carter said at a press conference over the weekend, a spokesman for the literary festival at which he was speaking confirmed.//////The United States held "constructive" talks with China on a wide range of human rights issues, a US envoy said here Tuesday as he praised the communist government for its earthquake response.//////An alabaster head of Cleopatra and a mask thought to belong to her lover Mark Antony have been found near Egypt's Mediterranean city of Alexandria, antiquities chief Zahi Hawass said on Monday.//////Department of Music, University of Development Alternative (UODA) arranged a cultural programme to mark the birth anniversaries of Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam at the National Theatre Stage, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on May 26.
