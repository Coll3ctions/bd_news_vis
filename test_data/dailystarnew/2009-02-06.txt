[Online Glossary of the British Institute for Learning & Development]. And, on the flip side, E-Inclusion is overcoming the digital divide using systems developed to lessen the risk of 'e-exclusion'.//////Last general election of Bangladesh was really an exciting experience for me. I was able to vote for the first time. That is why I made sure I did not vote for the wrong party or candidate. I searched for my answer in the past records of our country. Both the leaders of the most powerful parties have been involved in corruption. So choosing between two was a dilemma for me. It was as if I had to choose between a snake and a crocodile as a pet. That is why I went for the so called NO VOTE option. I urged my friends to do so. Literally, I ran a mini campaign for this option. Despite my decision I had sub-consciously hoped that if Awami League came to power, things might change. People change and learn from their mistakes. But now I think that I was right all along. As soon as they came to power JCL, the student wing of the ruling party, took over the Chittagong University as if it was some kind of a business. Awami League must be forgetting the promises they had made before the election. They are underestimating the power of the general public. I guess just like BNP next election will mean end for Awami League as well. //////I have just come across a news item published in your esteemed daily on 28 Jan 09 titled "'Six bus operators eye Digital Ticketing' seek govt spaces for stations". //////I would like to draw the attention of the prime minister of Bangladesh to the fact that there are two immediate apparent reasons that student politics should be banned in our country.//////Bangladesh is a developing country in the world where the majority of people live in the villages in poverty. The population stands at 5 million people. According to a data of World Health Organization (WHO), 10% of the people are with some types of disabilities in Bangladesh. Of this disabled people, 50% are disabled women.//////When people fall ill or meet with an accident a doctor's helping hand is just like a lamp in a dark tunnel. People throughout the world respect the physicians from their core of heart for their services. But these days we see that doctors in our country are only running after money and service is not the first priority to them.//////Top of the news of this week is the trial of the war criminals of 1971. Undoubtedly, it is a great decision of the government. We the Bangladeshi people have been waiting for the day for 38 years. This process was strongly supported by the CTG, and for this reason I want to give heartiest thanks to the CTG. We know that most of the senior Jamaat leaders are blamed for this war crime. How the trial will be directed? My question is, if an AL leader is found involved in this incidence then whether the trial would be fair or not? According to "SUJON" an AL leader was also involved in the crime.//////Suddenly there has been a change in the law and order situation in the country. //////It is bad news for us, that though it is winter season we face load shedding. Not only in the villages, but also in the cities we see this problem. Load shedding is a national problem. At the time of the caretaker government this problem was acute. They could not ensure electricity. Now a new govt. is in power. They promised to solve electricity problem.//////The problem at Baitul Mukarram remains unresolved. The Khatib was appointed by the outgoing caretaker government. We do not know on what basis a Khatib is appointed and by whom? Why was it not possible for the CTG to confirm the acting Khatib? I think the shadow of deliberate misrule (?) of the CTG is still haunting our society and might eventually spread all over. The activities of the then law and religious ministry needs to be reviewed and made public.//////After the national election of December 29, most of the campuses of the public universities of Bangladesh have become very turbulent. The rank and file of BCL have become desperate to establish their supremacy. The tug of war has destabilized the congenial atmosphere of the prominent educational institutions of our country. Actually, student politics is a great setback to the educational progress in our country. The general students cannot carry on with their studies smoothly due to nefarious student politics. //////Human rights groups are seeking to build a case that Israel and Hamas violated the laws of war during the fighting last month in this tiny coastal territory a charge both combatants reject.//////Sri Lanka's prime minister said yesterday government forces will not suspend an offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels, rejecting calls for a ceasefire by donor countries concerned by reports of growing civilian casualties.//////The Israeli navy yesterday intercepted and boarded a Gaza-bound Lebanese aid boat at sea and was escorting it to the Israeli port of Ashdod, Defence Minister Ehud Barak said.//////A United Nations investigation into the killing of former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto will expose her assassins "and bring them to justice," the organisation's chief said Wednesday.//////Pakistan must go "further and faster" in prosecuting those suspected of being involved in November's attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Wednesday.//////Passengers on the New Delhi-Ranchi Garib Rath express, which witnessed a high voltage drama after it was 'hijacked' by a drunk driver, heaved a sigh of relief after the train safely reached Ranchi railway station yesterday. //////International rights group Amnesty International Wednesday condemned the cluster bombing of a hospital in northern Sri Lanka, where government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels are locked in combat.//////At least 12 people were killed in a suicide attack on a restaurant in the Iraqi province of Diyala, northeast of Baghdad, on Thursday, local officials told AFP.//////Pressure from a dam, its reservoir's heavy waters weighing on geologic fault lines, may have helped trigger China's devastating earthquake last May, some scientists say, in a finding that suggests human activity played a role in the disaster.//////He won't say his name, hides his face, and hands cash to anyone who asks in the middle of New York.//////Referring to the epic "Mahabharata," Abu Sayeed's latest film "Rupantar" follows 'the film within a film' genre.

In fact, the tagline of the landmark election victory of Awami League was a promise of digital Bangladesh by 2021. BNP also promised to implement digital Bangladesh sooner than 2021. Our intellectuals have started advising the government about how to implement digital Bangladesh, and opposition rhetoric locked horns with the government about who can make Bangladesh digital faster. //////WE have a lot of democracy loving people these days waxing eloquent on how Hasina and the government could have earned political mileage if they had been more accommodative towards the opposition in the parliament. The speakers in a talk show on a TV channel sounded so committed to democracy and constitutional rule. The issues discussed left me with the impression that perhaps Hasina and her government have fallen short of the democratic behaviour expected of them. //////THE government has put together a team of key players in various ministries to bring change to the people of Bangladesh. Like Obama, who promised sweeping changes, the Bangladesh government has also pledged many changes so that the dividends of development can flow to the grassroots level. Notably, new faces have been brought into the cabinet, replacing the old guard tainted with various allegations. Impressively, important portfolios have been given to women: a remarkable and desirable development indeed, and a tribute to their long-ignored capabilities. //////Bangladesh film and television industries have long been deprived of many digital advancements going on in the world. A technological change was badly needed for the industry. Well, the wait for change seems to come to an end as 'bioscopewala' a digitised filmmaking solution claimed to be the first of its kind - has started giving solution with its Digital Intermediate (DI) house in Bangladesh.//////Chittagong Customs House earns the country a huge amount of revenue as it deals with tax and duties on the products exported and imported through the country's largest maritime port in Chittagong.//////Laptops are taking over desktops in Bangladesh.
