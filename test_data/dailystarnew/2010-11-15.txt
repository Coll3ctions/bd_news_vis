It exhibited a total disregard for public convenience, particularly the millions who travel home for Eid holidays. //////The release of Aung San Suu Kyi from her long confinement is truly a triumph for people who have held faith in democracy not only in Myanmar but also across the world. It is also a tribute to the resilience and determination with which Ms. Suu Kyi has upheld her politics and her values since returning to her country in 1988. That she and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD) were not allowed to take power after their massive victory at the elections held in 1990 remains a dark chapter in Myanmar's history. Had Ms. Suu Kyi been permitted to form the government, the face of her country would be a whole lot different, and positively too, by now and Myanmar would be playing its due role in the international community. Unfortunately, the people of Myanmar, despite the inspirational leadership provided by Aung San Suu Kyi even in her imprisonment, are yet to see pluralistic politics reshape the image of their country.//////Underrated all-rounder Elias Sunny played possibly the innings of his life to lift Dhaka as the National Cricket League one-day champions yesterday.

The successive governments in the face of protests by the locals took a massive task of rehabilitating the tannery industry elsewhere with all modern amenities. //////Another building built on the foundation of corruption is tilting, teetering on the brink of falling on the adjacen buildings. It seemed to me that it is not the building but the edifice of our nation, achieved through so much sacrifice and blood, is tilting dangerously, thanks to the ruling party's wanton disregard for the national security, safety, sanity and solidarity. //////There is something dreadfully wrong with this society when we can't even say 'thank you' appropriately to those who deserve it.

It was earlier agreed that eight American reporters would be allowed to cover the meeting. This had seriously angered US President's Press Secretary Robert Gibbs who strongly protested the Indian Officials' decision by threatening to pull Obama out of the talks if all the eight US reporters were not allowed to cover the bilateral talks.

This time again two cattle traders have been killed as reported in your esteemed daily. Has anyone ever heard of a drug peddler being killed by the BSF? At least I have not. It does not mean that the drugs do not come from India. As a matter of fact, all most all the drugs used by the addicts of Bangladesh are made in India. So why does not a drug peddler get killed by the BSF? The answer is very simple, the neighbouring giant does not want so, for reasons best known to them. I am rather sure their intention is definitely not good. That is the reason why only the poor Bangladeshi cattle traders and farmers get killed every now and then. //////The US has offered Israel a package of incentives in exchange for a settlement construction freeze in the West Bank, diplomatic sources say.//////Frequent incidents of extortion ahead of Eid have become a cause of concern for Jhenidah townspeople.//////France's President Nicolas Sarkozy was choosing a new cabinet line-up, hoping to reinvigorate his government and set the stage for his undeclared 2012 re-election campaign.//////Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi pledged on Saturday to put his government to a make-or-break confidence vote to see if his weakened coalition still has enough support in Parliament to survive.//////The figurehead of Myanmar's fight against dictatorship, Aung San Suu Kyi, was freed from house arrest on Saturday, a move seen an attempt by the military junta to gain some credit for its much-criticised political process.//////An independent task force cautioned President Barack Obama on Friday about the high cost of the Afghanistan war and said he should consider a narrow military mission if his December review finds the current strategy is not working.//////Iraq's power-sharing deal, hailed as a sign of its factions coming together, is more a result of foreign powers' influence and was pushed in particular by the United States and Iran, analysts say.//////Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula denied on Sunday it would stage any action to coincide with the Muslim haj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia after a Saudi minister said such an operation could not be ruled out.//////Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said that the United States must reduce the visibility and intensity of its military operations in Afghanistan, The Washington Post reported.//////President Barack Obama said yesterday he would push hard to get the US congress to approve a new START weapons treaty with Russia and stressed the former Cold War foes were now cooperating closely on key issues.//////Greeks vote in a local election run-off yesterday which could further complicate Prime Minister George Papandreou's drive to meet tough deficit targets agreed in exchange for a 110 billion euro rescue from the EU and IMF.//////The West can only contain not defeat militant groups such as al-Qaeda, the head of the UK's armed forces has said.//////In the midst of political heat over scams, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has decided to make public assets and liabilities of his ministerial colleagues.//////Eid is a fun day for children.

If it was a purely legal issue between the opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia and the Cantonment Board, then there was no need for the ruling party to make any comment on the issue from the beginning. Sadly, the people's reading of the entire development over Khaleda Zia's Cantonment residence is quite different. Leaders of the ruling Awami League (AL) have been on various occasions in the habit of attacking the opposition leader on the issue. At the AL-organised political gatherings the issue has come up again and again. So, it would be nave to think that the people at large will like to look at Khaleda Zia's eviction from her Cantonment house as purely a matter of legal battle between Khaleda Zia as an individual and the plaintiff, the Cantonment Board. On the contrary, the popular perception of what happened on November 13 at the Cantonment residence of the opposition leader will be seen as a nasty outcome of politics of hatred between the two major political parties of the country.//////Remittances from Bangladeshi migrants have been growing rapidly over the past decade and a half, contributing significantly to economic growth and substantially improving the nation's balance of payments position.

While remittances increased until 2009, the drastically lower numbers of new migrants has already resulted in reduced remittances during the first months of 2010. //////As far as miracle stories of growth go, few can elicit as much wonder and admiration as the Korean one.
