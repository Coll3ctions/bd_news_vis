Some say they will be, while many doubt whether the PML (Q) and the establishment, sensing defeat, would let the elections go through on the day. But, considering some international pressure and the fact that postponing it will cause an immediate uproar and will not help the retired General Pervez Musharraf to go ahead with his plans, sticking to the date may become necessary.

Fish which is now scarcely available in the market is selling very dear. Besides, the prices of vegetables have gone up very high.

The rising prices of foods and essential commodities are causing great hardship to the people of all classes.//////It can be observed with great concern that drug addiction is on the rise in our society and a large number of our youths are addicted to drugs.

All that the team wants is to make their homeland proud. The disabled have just as much right and claim on Bangladesh as we have. They have done so much better than our other competing athletes. All they want is respect. And they have earned that right. Bravo !//////Freedom of speech, freedom of press etc. are the pre-requisites of democracy. More or less our press is free.

Qatar is a flourishing country, trying to keep pace with the development of other Gulf nations, particularly the UAE. //////Moinul Chowdhury (Letter January 18) is the latest of many to misunderstand Henry Kissinger's awful comment about Bangladesh, which is a great deal worse than 'bottomless basket'. That conveys the notion of some nation or person having endless needs and, actually, if Kissinger had meant that, he would probably have used the more likely English expression 'a bucket with a hole in the bottom'. No, he said that Bangladesh was a 'basket-case' - and the real meaning of that is much more insulting. //////Rebels in Chad announced Tuesday an immediate ceasefire as France -- emboldened by UN condemnation of the insurgents -- declared it was poised to intervene militarily. //////As Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama chase the nomination to run for US president, observers have raised the prospect of a "dream ticket" uniting them in November's election. //////The party of slain Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto released her will to the public yesterday to prove that it names her husband as her political heir. //////Combining violence with rhetoric that appeals to the hundreds of millions living in poverty, India's Maoist rebels have left the government looking for an effective counter-insurgency strategy. //////A suicide bomber killed eight members of an anti-Qaeda front as he triggered his explosive vest at a checkpoint outside a Sunni tribal sheikh's house in central Iraq on Tuesday, police said. //////From the Indonesian city where Barack Obama spent part of his childhood to Hong Kong's bars and a Dublin pub, US Democrats abroad grabbed their first chance to vote in "Super Tuesday" primaries. //////Two roadside bombs killed seven people in Afghanistan, five of them civilians from the same family, police said Tuesday, in new attacks linked to a bloody Taliban insurgency. //////Seven Sri Lankan sailors and their speedboat were missing yesterday following a sea battle with Tamil Tiger rebels near the maritime border with India, diplomats and officials said. //////Kenya's feuding political factions yesterday started discussing power-sharing issues, a day after reaching a number of recommendations aimed at easing the security crisis. //////The government is planning to increase the security of senior BJP leader LK Advani in the wake of intelligence inputs suggesting threat to his life from terrorists.//////Democrat Hillary Clinton said Monday she would be wearing the pants in the White House and not her husband, former president Bill, if she is elected in November. //////Six Hamas fighters were killed in an Israeli air strike on the Gaza Strip yesterday, the day after the first suicide bombing in a year by Palestinian militants on Israeli soil.//////Turkish lawmakers vote today on a constitutional reform to end a ban on Islamic headscarves in universities, an issue that has divided the Muslim country.//////Afghanistan risks becoming a failed state if Nato troops do not defeat the Taliban, boosting Islamist extremism worldwide, a study said yesterday, also warning that the West lacked resources.//////A new study published yesterday dealt a fresh blow to accusations that a triple vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is linked to autism.//////President Nicolas Sarkozy and France's new first lady Carla Bruni yesterday won a lawsuit filed against budget airline Ryanair for featuring a photo of their couple in an ad campaign.//////Veteran Hong Kong reporter Ching Cheong has been freed on parole after spending nearly three years in jail in China on spying charges, officials here said yesterday, sparking celebrations among his supporters.//////Japan has confirmed resuming whaling in Antarctic waters after environmental protesters stopped obstructing Japanese whalers there, press reports said yesterday.//////The oil-rich Gulf state of Kuwait plans to build a major new city inspired by the Silk Road that it hopes will become a global trade and tourist attraction, an executive said yesterday.//////China yesterday sought to play down a food poisoning case blamed on Chinese-made dumplings that may have sickened thousands in Japan, calling it an isolated incident that should not hurt trade.//////As part of the daily discussion at the month-long Amar Ekushey Granthamela 2008, filmmaker Manzar-e Hasin Murad presented a paper titled ////// on February 4. //////The three-day documentary screening, titled ////// started at the Shawkat Osman Auditorium, Central Public Library on February 4.
