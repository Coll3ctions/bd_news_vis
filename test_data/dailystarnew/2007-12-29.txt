Benazir Bhutto was also warned that her meeting with Hamid Karzai just few days before the elections could create more troubles for her. She was advised to avoid meeting Karzai because some extremists would have another opportunity to declare that a Pakistani American agent met an Afghan American agent, but she ignored all the concerns raised by her close associates. Sources present in the last Karzai-Benazir meeting revealed that the Afghan president prayed for the safety of former prime minister of Pakistan and in return she responded, "Life and death is in the hands of Allah and that is why I have the courage to stare at the eyes of death without any fear."//////Awami League (AL) will take its future steps cautiously as the top party leaders fear that the party will have to deal with manifold problems next year. //////There has been a lot of talk about reversing the "brain drain" out of Bangladesh at the ongoing conference of non-resident Bangladeshis. There has also been a lot of talk about why this is not only unlikely to happen but also almost impossible to make it happen due to a lack of infrastructure and security. But, no one has shattered this myth more spectacularly in the last decade than Iqbal Z Quadir, founder of Grameenphone who brought the mobile phone to the masses.//////Ferry service between Aricha and Nagarbari resumed yesterday after five months. //////Two globally endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles were rescued from sellers at Taantibazar in the capital by the Department of Forest and Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh yesterday morning. //////Nepal lawmakers yesterday formally approved a decision to abolish the monarchy and declare the country a republic as part of a deal with former Maoist rebels. //////The United States has appealed for calm and urged Pakistan, a staunch ally in the war on terror, to press on with its elections after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. //////Pakistan's interior ministry said yesterday that Benazir Bhutto was killed after smashing her head on her car's sunroof while trying to duck, and that no bullet or shrapnel was found inside her. //////Shahbagh police arrested former state minister for Liberation War affairs Redwan Ahmed on the premises of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) soon after his release on bail yesterday evening.//////Khulna office of the Archaeology Department has discovered an 1,800-year-old terracotta plaque bearing the image of the only female Jain Tirthankar, Mallinath.//////Jatiya Press Club yesterday unanimously adopted a resolution demanding immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency for restoration of democratic process in the country.//////Police recovered four bombs from Kashipur area under Khalishpur Police Station of Khulna city yesterday.//////Unidentified criminals gunned down a first class contractor of LGED near Kushtia railway station yesterday.//////New Zealand produced a solid all-round performance to wrap up their three-match one-day series against Bangladesh with a 102-run victory under the Duckworth-Lewis method in the second game in Napier on Friday.//////A woman and her son drowned and 10 others received injuries when a boat capsized in the Meghna at Rajnagar under Raipura upazila yesterday.//////Inspector General of Police (IGP) Nur Mohammad yesterday said law and order situation in the country has improved this year in comparison to those of the previous years.//////At least six children died of pneumonia at a Rangpur hospital in the last two days as cold wave continues to sweep across the northern region.//////Police recovered a decomposed body of a worker from a plastic factory at Lalbagh in the city yesterday.//////India's main opposition BJP yesterday regained power in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, dislodging Congress from power, to end the year 2007 on a high note politically, just five days after retaining the reins in the western state of Gujarat. //////Bullets and bombs of maniacs finally found their target in Pakistan. They succeeded in stopping the bold strides of Benazir Bhutto, who, knowing fully well the risks, remained iron-willed against forces set to spread undemocratic and extremist ideology throughout Pakistan. It is deplorable that she could not finish the battle against those elements. In a poignant twist of fate, she was stopped when common people were beginning to rally behind her to demilitarise country's politics and pave the way for democracy. //////The all pervasive nature of corruption and the impunity culture growing around it have had a telling effect on the national economy, the traditional value system and the way politics and governance operated in the country. The society was taken over by an upstart money elite with their insatiable acquisitive lifestyle as the saner and cultural elements beat a retreat. //////Even those of us sharply critical of Benazir Bhutto's behaviour and policies - both while she was in office and more recently - are stunned and angered by her death. Indignation and fear stalk the country once again. //////With her luminous eyes and strong features framed by a flowing white head scarf, Benazir Bhutto was the face of Pakistan's democratic hopes -- a face that had been thrust into the limelight with the execution of her father in 1979 and that remained there, aging gracefully, until her assassination in Pakistan on Thursday.//////A drama-filled 190-nation conference ended mid-December after setting a 2009 deadline for a landmark pact to fight global warming. This was possible only after the United States backed down from its last-ditch objections. We in Bangladesh have followed the steps leading up to this conference with great care.

It would still be Australia's day but India would end it upbeat, hoping to mop up the tail in the first hour tomorrow. They would have taken heart from their effort and looked to sustain the fight on the next day.//////Dhaka and Rajshahi won their respective matches of the Meril Women's Divisional cricket tournament in the city yesterday.//////Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh has been charged with showing dissent towards an umpiring decision during the first cricket Test against Australia, Cricket Australia said Friday.//////Zaheer Khan was roundly booed by Indian supporters at the MCG for the flurry of no-balls but apparently there was a reason to it.//////Pakistan cricket coach Geoff Lawson said Friday he is seeking advice on the situation in the volatile country before deciding whether to return following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.//////Michael Clarke believes reverse-swing holds the key to wrapping up the first Test as Australia eye a four-day victory at the MCG.

She was a woman of true grit and determination who could have made a difference to Pakistan. That she had the chance twice to do that and failed is part of history. That her enemies were always baying for her blood and would not rest until she was thrown out of power, twice, is part of history as well. And yet there was always the future that beckoned Benazir Bhutto.

But surprisingly enough it was not and I felt somewhat discomfited at having packed so much warm clothes in my luggage. Less space for books that I planned to buy, I thought a little sourly. We drove in a microbus through dry, dun-coloured Delhi streets towards Indira Gandhi University campus. I had only just met my fellow Bangladeshis, at Delhi airport when we were being picked up by the event manager's representative. They were all academic folklorists here to read papers at the international folklore seminar and I, the journalist, distinctly felt the odd man out. But we soon became acquainted, exchanging small talk as we peered out of the microbus windows at dusty ////// tree leaves scattered over a scrabble earth that looks desolate to Bengalis born to the lush green velvet of their countryside.

How he handles the next several days could determine whether nationwide antigovernment protests erupt. //////Today, many Arab Israeli leaders are accusing the Olmert's Government of conducting a double standard policy towards the Arab community. Some of the current officials of this government have declared that the Arabs in Israel are equal citizens.

Her third attempt to help give her country a democratic government was gruesomely anticipated by those opposed to liberal ideas and democratic dispensation in Pakistan.//////Mukhtar Mai, also known as Mukhtaran Bibi, was subjected to gang rape in the village of Meerwala in Pakistan's Punjab province on the recommendations of a village council in 2002. It was an incident as horrible in its perpetration as it was powerful in its ramifications. Mukhtar Bibi, like so many others before her in Pakistan and elsewhere, could have opted for the traditional suicide after the shame that was heaped on her even as a whole village watched, tongue-tied, what was being done to her by men on the higher perches of feudalism in her country. No one lifted a finger, no one said a word, there was none to protest the scandalous behaviour of the Mastoi tribe. Mukhtar was only a Gujar, a member of a community that had for ages been poor and therefore resigned to its fate, which again was what people like the Mastois made of it.//////This book is the outcome of the author's collection of papers prepared for seminars, workshops and conferences at home and abroad, enriched by her own teaching and research experiences. It deals with critical issues within the overall situation of inequality, giving rise to divide and discrimination within a sovereign state. The social process of empowerment, as the theme makes it clear, is a pragmatic and a much needed method to ameliorate what is a worsening situation.//////Chitrita Banerji makes us happy and makes us remember all the culinary traditions we are heir to in this gem of a book. Indeed, it is at the very beginning of Bengali Cooking that you get to remember that certain cultural aspect of your being. As a host, you will likely implore the one visiting you thus: Do please grace my poor hovel with your presence and share our simple meal of dal and rice. Sounds familiar? You bet it does, for who has not heard of Bengali hospitality? It is as spontaneous as is the manner in which a Bengali loves to eat with his family.//////Poems of An October Evening was launched recently at the Russian Science and Culture Centre in Dhaka. A recitation of poems composed by some of the leading Russian poets, translated into English and Bangla, preceded the launch. The book has been published by 'Meghdut', a cultural group engaged in promoting poetry recitation. Meghdut has been involved in such endeavours in its conviction that recitation is a distinct avenue of performing arts among the younger generation. The members of Meghdut are committed to working together to promote the Bangla language through quality recitation and at the same time acquainting themselves with poetry written in different languages.//////This is a fresh new look at a happening that has people wondering even to this day about the compulsions that caused the partition of a country. Yasmin Khan belongs to a new generation of historians, born much after 1947, and goes into a study of the details of that period from her own perspective. The work makes a lot of sense.//////
