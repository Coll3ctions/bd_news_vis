All untimely deaths are tragic, but what made this death unbearably tragic is the fact that he went to Bangladesh on his summer break from the university he attended in Minnesota to surprise everybody at home and take part in his elder brother's wedding. There's no doubt that he did surprise everybody, but by not how he came but by how he left all of us forever while on his way to Dhaka to attend his brother's wedding. //////I met Tareque Masud first at the launching ceremony of 'Muktir Gaan' at the Public Library in 1995.

Most of the families in the cities keep young children to do all types of household chores. It is really pathetic that these children, who should have gone to school to acquire knowledge, work as domestic helps due to extreme poverty. Moreover, they are not treated properly by their employers. They are frequently tortured and abused. In many houses the house mistresses force the young children to work much which is inappropriate for the children's age. If they fail to do the assigned works properly, they are beaten inhumanly. Sometimes the torture costs their life. Likewise, many other working children are deprived of their basic rights.//////Anna Hazare, the respected social activist and the latest household name in Indian media as well as outside world, is showing the whole world how to fight corruption by beginning a hunger strike that will not end until the government eliminates corruption. //////A good number of television channels have emerged in our country.

Shammi Kapoor filled those wondrously difficult years when laughter and optimism were the only pathfinders from an unknown jute mill settlement in Bengal to an unwelcome Calcutta teeming with every variety of revolution. Even hope seems too ambitious in the second half of your teens. Shammi Kapoor was our torch, for he combined three essentials of teenage: he was mad; he got his girl on his own terms; and there was always a happy ending. He joined the dots between changing the world and dreaming of love. //////The upcoming visit of Dr. Manmohan Singh is surely going to be an attempt to reach out to the people of Bangladesh, therefore it should not be seen as just an effort to strengthen the relationship with one party or the other. It appears there is a realisation in Delhi that India has to build bridges with all shades of public opinion in Bangladesh. At the same time, India has a particular affinity for the genuinely democratic, non-communal and pro-liberation section of Bangladesh society. So, it is but natural that India will make a special effort to reach out to them. ////// published an article on July 30, entitled "Embraceable you," on the relationship between India and Bangladesh.

During the Kurukshetra War, between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, the Kaurava commander Drona mercilessly killed thousands of Pandava warriors. Krishna (avatar of Lord Vishnu and a trusted advisor of the Pandavas), thought of a clever plan to deter Drona. He asked Yudhishthira to announce that Drona's son, Ashwathama, was killed, even though this was untrue. Krishna knew that Yudhishthira would never lie, so he constructed a ruse. He had an elephant named Ashwathama killed and asked Yudhishthira to declare: "Ashwathama is dead, but I am unsure whether it was an elephant or the man." Krishna ensured that the words were uttered while the Pandavas beat their drums and cymbals in a way that drowned Yudhishthira's critical trailing words. Given Yudhishthira's reputation as a righteous man, Drona believed him. He laid down his arms in distress and was slain. The Pandavas were victorious -- Krishna justified Yudhishthira's deception as a moral act toward humanity for ensuring justice and peace on earth, through a just war. //////
