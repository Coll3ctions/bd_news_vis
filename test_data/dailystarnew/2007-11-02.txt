transform the Anti-Corruption Commission into a self-governing body is welcome. In the past many months, especially since the imposition of a state of emergency in the country and a consequent reconstitution of the ACC, the anti-corruption watchdog has made some impressive strides in handling cases of wrongdoing at various levels of politics and administration. However, the increasingly complex responsibilities it will now be expected to carry out call for special skills and competence in order for it to deliver the goods. We hope that in the days ahead the ACC will live up to the expectations reposed in it by the nation.//////At any given point in time a good number of faculty members of Dhaka University would be overseas pursuing higher academic and research attainments. It is only natural that teachers of Dhaka University, or for that matter, any higher seat of learning, acquire further knowledge and advanced degrees in their chosen fields to let their students benefit from their accomplishments in due course. We grant, there is also the right to career development. //////Ever since 1/11 there has been endless debate as to the parameters of the role of the caretaker government.

Eleven donors are supporting it. Its mid-term review is planned for October 29 to November 12.

recent reports in The Daily Star regarding the statements by leaders of the Jamaat that there were no anti-liberation collaborators of the Pakistan Army during the Liberation War of 1971. The Daily Star has rightly pointed out that there is enough written evidence to the contrary.//////Fees for national ID Cards Set'- This news published in the front page of The Daily Star on 22nd Oct 2007 took me aback. I was rather shocked seeing the government's series of unwise and thoughtless steps regarding national ID cards. National ID is surely a big buzz word for those involved in this project in our government, but it's part of my profession. It does not make sense to me; we have not even started the groundwork for the National ID card and how on earth we can set the price tag to the National ID card. Excuse my loud and facts-based assumption! It seems the National ID card project is going to be another breeding ground for corruption!//////I was very happy when the government took the decision of running the CNG auto-rickshaw by the meter and also that the drivers will go to any destination according to the passengers' needs. And for that you reduced the deposit money of the CNG drivers to their owners and increased the fare from Tk. 12 to 13.50 for the first 2 kms.//////I had the opportunity to visit Chittagong on a number occasions during the last few months. For that purpose I had to travel through Shah Amanat International Airport. I was shocked to come across distorted history on the mural at the departure lounge. The mural inscribes the distorted message of Major Zia proclaiming the Independence and urging different governments to accord recognition to our newborn country. Such was the norm during the Jote Sarkar. The mural does not mention the actual message that Major Zia read at the Kalurghat Radio station on 27th March 1971. In the actual short message delivered, Major Zia mentioned thrice that he was declaring Independence on behalf of the great leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. I heard it myself. There is nothing wrong in quoting the correct history. I would like to congratulate the present caretaker govt. for taking the initiative to correct the distorted history and the mess created by the BNP-led government. And also for recognising Bangabandhu as the Father of the Nation. I would, therefore, request the authorities concerned to immediately take necessary steps to remove the distorted history from Shah Amanat Airport and correct the mural inscriptions with the actual message read out by Major Zia.//////We the people of South Bisil located at Mirpur-1( west of Dar-Us-Salam Road heading towards Mirpur-1 bus stand) are suffering a lot for this road. Though it was a good road 10 years back, but due to poor maintenance now it's worse than a muddy village road. This road is connected to Mirpur Shah Ali Market as well as the Mirpur-1 bus stand. But we are unlucky that despite paying tax round the year, we don't find any improvement done by the DCC to this particular road.//////It's not only a matter of shame but a national tragedy that an anti national and reactionary entity like Jamaat-e -Islami is still allowed to do politics in Bangladesh. This is not an anti-democratic stance but a matter of principle. Even if we accept the fact that there is nothing final in war and politics, the Jamaat's position is unique in Bangladesh. //////I am a resident of Kakrail, Ramna, Dhaka. This place is known for Willes Little Flower School which is situated beside the VIP road. Every morning thousands of youngsters walk through the footpath holding hands of their parents on their way to the main gate of the school. But the footpath is occupied by some people who are homeless and mainly street beggars.//////1. What are the most common channels when we sit before the TV set? //////I beg apology at the outset if I hurt anybody's feeling with my funny question. The question is: Who will be a successful vice chancellor of a public university- an educationist or a police chief?//////Shah Abdul Hannan is dead wrong and disingenuous when he claims that the war in 1971 was a civil war (DS, 28 October). //////I agree with Shafi Ahmed that Mountbatten was no Solomon. But, then, neither was Jinnah. If a central government for a united India couldn't be trusted by Jinnah to look after the interests of the Muslim minority, how could Jinnah expect a single government in Kolkata or Lahore to be trusted by his political rivals to look after the interests of the Hindu and Sikh minorities?//////The worst thing in the life of a common man is a visit to a government office. He is kept waiting for hours, days by members of administration-- from clerks to officers. This is the norm of offices in our impoverished country. Although the world is changing, our bureaucracy is static for the last two hundred years. People's expectations have gone high over the years. But high officials have agendas other than moving with public interests.//////An individual deserves to be called a cultured person when any of the facets of art or culture has imprinted a certain amount of positive change in the life of that person. For being cultured, it is not enough to say that the person is connected to some cultural field. One might be a singer, a poet or doing fine arts. That does not necessarily mean that the person is cultured. The dictionary meaning of the word 'cultured' can be taken as enlightened and/or refined.//////Afghan forces said yesterday they had killed 50 more Taliban militants in the heaviest fighting in a western province since the fall of the Islamist regime in 2001. //////Turkey yesterday stepped up pressure on northern Iraq, imposing economic sanctions over the safe haven Kurdish rebels enjoy in the region, as Washington said it was supplying Ankara with intelligence on the separatists' positions. //////Pakistan's top court is unlikely to rule on the legality of Pervez Musharraf's victory in last month's presidential vote until November 12 -- three days before his current term ends, a judge said. //////Influential former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Thursday warned Iran to be alert in the face of "unprecedented" actions by its arch-foe the United States. //////Japan yesterday ordered home ships engaged on a refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean, halting the close US ally's main role in the "war on terror" due to domestic opposition. //////King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia had a "meeting of minds" in talks Wednesday with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on taking forward the Middle East peace process, a spokesman said. //////Former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto left for Dubai Thursday, officials said, in a surprise move after cancelling the trip overnight due to rumours of an impending state of emergency. //////Sri Lanka's government said yesterday it would not censor reports on its war with Tamil Tiger rebels, just hours after it introduced the blanket restrictions. //////Sixty-six guerrillas surrendered Thursday in India's northeastern Assam state in a sign of cracks in the rebel force blamed for 15,000 deaths in separatist violence in the past three decades. //////US State Department diplomats have criticised new rules that will force some to work in Iraq against their will or risk dismissal, the Washington Post reported Thursday. //////Kabori Sarwar, the heartthrob of the 60's and 70's Bangladeshi big screen has recently won the prize for best direction, awarded by Bangladesh Cultural Reporter's Association.

The irony is that credit is readily available for rich people who can save and may not require it, whereas it is beyond the reach of the poor who are in desperate need. The tragedy is that the imperfect markets for credit nurture poverty through a process of ruthless exploitation. //////Let us stop looking for what we do not have. Let us look at what we do have. We do have a small and promising group of young men and women who are smart, articulate, and impressive. Let them take the reins of our businesses. They may not have all the qualifications and experience that one may ideally seek but they will in the long run be better for one's business than the short tenure short horizon expatriate. //////In Pakistan today there is a paradox crying for an explanation; it is a paradox, moreover, whose exploration can bring some clarity to the predicament of the Islamicate today. //////Do you want to remember or do you want to forget?" If only this question had an easy answer. Remembering is not easy, but forgetting may be impossible, especially when it comes to surviving the atrocities of war. //////Two bedroom flat. Father, mother, four siblings, and an uncle; all live together in the 500 sq. foot residential unit. Father, mother, and the youngest of the kids live in one bedroom. Another room is shared by the two sisters, one goes to college and one is in high school. The other brother, also in high school, and the uncle, who is struggling with his small business after graduation, share the bed which occupies a part of the living room. There is a small balcony, which is occupied with household items like an extra chair, a broken table, a shelf. //////Rising food price inflation is a major, perhaps the most important, economic issue facing the country. But it's not only in Bangladesh where food prices are rising. It's a global phenomenon that the Economist has dubbed agflation. There are macro and microeconomic reasons behind agflation, and policies to combat it will have to take these factors into account.//////The prime objective of the Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I) is to identify the environmental liability, or potential environmental liability, of the property under assessment. According to the American Society for Testing & Materials (ASTM), recognition of environmental conditions on the site means identifying any hazardous materials or petroleum products present on a property under conditions that would indicate an existing release, a past release, or the material threat of release of these substances into structures on the property, the ground, ground water, or surface water of the property. The assessment also evaluates environmental liabilities associated with real property acquisition and ownership. Information obtained through environmental site assessments can greatly influence the real estate property value.//////Forest should be protected not only because it is the home of precious biodiversity but also because forests was and still is habitat for millions of people all over the world. The relationship of man with forest is more than commercial; not only for foods and raw materials for modern commodities or genetic pool for breeding high yielding plants and animals. To Kin of Homo sapiens forest is the paradise. Still people live in forests of Malaysia, Africa, South America and many other parts of the world, with their lifestyles interwoven with environment. Indeed, it is thought that many forest communities in Latin America have yet to contact the wider world.//////Tamanna Ferdous is a 2nd year honours examinee. Just as she seats at the table, in the evening her music-minded neighbour switches on his hi-fi set up at its full blast. She attempts in vain to concentrate on the contents in her notes, with the piercing metallic sound coming from the next-door, it is next to impossible to study. Closing her note-book, she begins to wonder whether people like her neighbour cannot enjoy music without disturbing others. There are plenty of people who have much in common with Tamanna's neighbour, and not only with music but other things of their liking, too. //////
