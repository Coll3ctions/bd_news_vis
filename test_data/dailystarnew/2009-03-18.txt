The prime minister's thoughts are not only appreciated but also shared by the nation as a whole. There can be no denying that repeated intelligence failures, beginning with the assassinations of Bangabandhu in 1975 and President Ziaur Rahman in 1981 and leading up to the BDR carnage on February 25, have left the nation traumatised. All these failures have now thrown up the question of what must be need to restructure or reconfigure the intelligence bodies as a way of ensuring foolproof national security in the future.//////We are hugely relieved at Pakistan's pullback from the precipice of a dangerous slide into destabilisation. As opposition leader Nawaz Sharif's defiant long march on Islamabad was building into a crescendo, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced a package of concessions on Monday defusing the tension to a very large extent. What was threatening to become a full-blown political crisis centring around reinstatement of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhury as Chief Justice along with six other judges has, hopefully, been averted. //////Quite a few heroic men and women have emerged in Pakistan in these past few days. It is surprising, indeed amazing, that in a country where politics has either been conspicuous by its absence or had with regularity been pushed over the cliff, it is now democratic politics that has now asserted itself. And the one individual who clearly deserves credit for this reawakening in Pakistan is a reinvented Nawaz Sharif. //////Pain and distress gripped businesses and people around Basundhara City on Friday, March 13th as they helplessly watched a devastating fire on the 17th floor. //////Restoration of the twice-deposed chief justice of Pakistan on March 16 is a significant change. How real is it? The long struggle began when Pervez Musharraf sacked him in 2007. This is the first time in Pakistan's history that a popular agitation has attained its objectives.

We are totally handicapped with our limited and primitive fire-fighting equipment. Thousands of pedestrians were helplessly looking at the building. //////A very interesting report from Narsingdi, on the subject was published by a local English daily on March 4. It is a positive reflection on the initiative of BADC officials there. They have managed to utilise the waste cooling water from two power plants for irrigation! With their initiative, they have arranged to irrigate around 45, 000 acres of land for rice plantation which is expected to produce about 78,500 tonnes of Irri and boro paddy!//////In the 1960s and early 1970s, the pre-monsoon city sewerage and drainage systems cleaning drive used to be a major annual activity of Dhaka City Corporation and Wasa. This operation helped prevent occurrence of water logging of Dhaka streets during monsoon. It is not known why such an important operation was abandoned resulting in flooding of the city streets during every monsoon. Lest the new govt miss this impending crucial problem through oversight, I would like to draw the attention of the MPs concerned, before it is too late, to the crux of the problem. It is believed that the following cleaning operation in a professional and concerted manner would greatly reduce the intensity of the Dhaka city water logging during the coming rainy season.//////At present after traffic congestion, power cut is the second gravest problem in Dhaka city. On a daily basis, we have to suffer at least 4-5 hours from persistent electricity disruption. However, it's no longer a new issue in Dhaka city. It's been discussed many times, but no effective measures have been taken to solve this problem. We see many experts talking about nuclear power generation, but so far nothing effective has been implemented. Are all these experts supposed to only talk on this issue or can they be utilized to fix this problem through implementing the nuclear project by means of government's direct intervention? //////Entrance of children with disabilities to education is limited. An unequal educational structure, inflexible & unfriendly education programmes, lack of consciousness of parents, compounded with the insufficient knowledge of teachers and the inhospitable environment existing in the majority of the institutions, have done incredibly little to support education of children with disabilities in Bangladesh. //////This is a very ordinary event and may have escaped attention. But I was shocked and surprised. I cannot forget it. It has a continuous presence in my mind although I did not see this incident myself - a visitor threw a chocolate in front of the cage of a bear in Dhaka zoo. The bear for nearly half an hour tried through the small hole of the cage with its outstretched tongue to catch the chocolate and eat it. It looked like the bear brought out his tongue about a foot to reach the item. He finally failed. Nobody helped the bear to get it. People witnessing this would surely have been jubilant at this `funny' scene. But was it a fun? I feel bad when I think how hungry the bear was. Is it not cruelty? This is one example. There are countless incidents of cruelty meted out to the animals and birds of zoo/circus and in other places. Imagine how it would be like if we hear this type of 'fun' made with helpless starving children! Do the authorities of the zoo properly feed captive animal/birds? Do they take care so that the visitors do not disturb the zoo inmates ? //////It is a common practice for the leaders of political parties to stand for elections in as many as three constituencies. If they succeed in obtaining multiple seats, they have to retain one and surrender the others. This paves the way for by-elections, and in most cases other local candidates submit their nomination papers. In Bogra this year, two of the Opposition Leader's seats have fallen vacant and thus there will be two by-elections, as she has chosen to retain her seat in Feni.//////In order to avoid mass killing, the prime minister's speech to the nation, particularly to the BDR mutineers, was perfect and timely. The speech definitely expedited the process of the mutineers' surrender. The PM's decision to negotiate with the leaders of the mutineers was absolutely correct both diplomatically and politically. But now that some officers unearthed their untold sufferings and are arguing in favour of raid by the armed forces soon after the attack, many people are in confusion and are passing the comment that the government decision was probably late and wrong. //////It is clear that Pakistan is about to fall in the category of a failed state. Since its birth, the military has been dominating over everything including governance. In the past it looted the wealth of its East wing (now Bangladesh) - at present they are involved in fighting with each other. Who is ruling the country? President, army or some other force? No one can say.//////I wholly support former president Hussain Mohammad Ershad's view with regard to disbanding the present BDR. //////It is heartening to learn that the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and Future Agriculture Development Organization (FADO) have undertaken a program to help invigorate Iraq's horticultural industry. As a part of this programme, 50,000 high-yield grape vines and fruit tree-stock grown in California nurseries are being distributed among the farmers to assist them revitalize their once vibrant orchards and vineyards.//////I would like to convey my gratitude to Md. Anwarul Kabir for his recently published article, entitled "Role of MPs in light of constitution". In this scholarly write-up, Mr. Kabir has rightly pointed out the constitutional role of our MPs. Unfortunately, in our country, deviated from the constitutionally defined role, the MPs are very eager to involve themselves in local development work. Mr. Kabir has revealed that the major motivation on their part to be MPs is to be millionaire within a short span of time by indulging in corruption and the local development works give them such opportunity. This culture must be changed. The Honourable Prime Minister has called for changes in her electoral pledge. We want to trust our leader. So, for the better future of the country, we would like to urge the prime minister to empower the local government, especially the upazilas and let them carry out all development works. MPs must concentrate on the issues of state policy making which is their prime obligation. This, in turn, will reduce corruption at the state level, we believe.//////Thanks for giving awards to the students who excelled in O and A level exams. You are giving such awards for the last ten years inspiring thousands of brilliant students. This was my first opportunity to attend this function as a proud guardian. I felt happy to see you and Mr. Zafar Iqbal as you are from the same generation to which I belong. //////The present democratically elected Awami League government has made the promise to the young generation of building a digital Bangladesh. For some reason, the government has banned youtube for Bangladeshi users. This is unthinkable in this world of information technology. In this 21st century, when we are dreaming of moving forward, our government has stepped backwards. Will they again say that they will make a digital Bangladesh? //////Yesterday, when I was going to my school early in the morning I was facing a lot of problem going through the road. There was a huge traffic jam in sector 11. I had to wait for half an hour to go through this traffic congestion. And I missed my math exam. During this traffic jam I saw that the students of Mastermind and Milestone were heading for the same sector, which was sector 11 because both the schools are on the same road. There were no traffic policemen to resolve this traffic congestion. //////Mr. Muhit Rahman certainly deserves thanks for his write up published in the editorial page of 12 March 2009. Like many, it appears that Mr. Muhit had been a keen observer of the recent Pilkhana incident and burnt midnight candle to gain knowledge on the Hostage Crisis Management. But to me it appeared that he had been rather unkind in making certain comments.//////US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Pakistani leaders that some US lawmakers "may not feel inclined" to support aid to Islamabad if political chaos continues, a top US official said Monday.//////A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a restaurant in Pakistan's garrison city of Rawalpindi, killing 14 people and wounding 18 others, police said yesterday.//////Vowing to take all parties on board for national reconciliation, Pakistan Premier Yousuf Raza Gilani today said the possibility of forging a fresh alliance between the ruling PPP and Nawaz Sharif's PML-N cannot be ruled out. //////The situation in Sri Lanka was 'very risky and dangerous', a senior EU official has said.//////Eleventh-hour talks on a Israel-Hamas prisoner swap appeared to collapse yesterday as both sides accused each other of about-turns and bad faith in their Egyptian-brokered negotiations.//////The rift is out in the open.

Through my exhibition, I convey the beauty, diversity and power of wild Africa, says the young photographer. //////The Reading Circle (TRC) celebrated its third anniversary recently at Words n' Pages.//////Establishing secularism was one of the principles of our Liberation War. After liberation, the 1972 constitution incorporated secularism as one of its salient features. However, post-1975 politics changed the situation and we reverted to the realm of communalism. //////Rule of law is a catchy slogan. It has tremendous appeal for the general members of the public and intellectuals alike. People tend to believe that no injustice and exploitation exist in a society administered by rule of law. In other words, absence of rule of law is the source of all evils in the society. Looks fine, but only when read superficially.//////This is an apology and correction issued by the global financial industry (formerly known as the Masters of the Universe, the Lords of Capitalism, the Gurus of Free Market Economics and so on).
