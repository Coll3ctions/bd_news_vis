January, is a fact of life in Dhaka today. It is not going to change in the foreseeable future. A very logical and important reason for this was unfortunately not touched upon by the writer.//////We have learnt from a national daily that the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) has taken steps to set up sophisticated training institutions in seven divisional headquarters in an effort to reduce road accidents throughout the country.

I was quite amused at the writer's conclusion that Bangladesh was quite secure without considering a lot of factors, such as the per capita income, disposable income, variety of food available at the same income, quality of food, etc. To actually come down to a rational conclusion, one would need to factor in everything that relates to food and the means of getting them, either by purchase or by growing them. //////The recent situation in Bangladesh may provide an answer to the above question. Every day a Bangladeshi native is being brutally tortured by the Indian BSF. And not only ordinary people, a BGB soldier also fell into the hands of BSF. It is also being observed that the Indian government, through BSF, has been grabbing our lands and making thousands of our people homeless. //////For Heaven's sake, why should India be worried over the plot in Bangladesh army? Is this not tantamount to intervening in some country's internal affairs or is it a testimony to the fact that Bangladesh has ceased to be an independent nation? //////I was almost throwing up watching the YouTube video showing the inhuman and barbaric torture on a young Bangladeshi civilian by the BSF on India-Bangladesh border last month. This reminded me of the still photos of the torture on the detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq by some members of the American forces. What happened there was most inhuman that is beyond any condemnation. But that happened within the four walls of a prison.//////So far a few were reported as disappearing. Now we have allegations that even army personnel are disappearing. And what is more, our major business establishments are slipping out of our hand and going into the hands of our neighbour. The way India is treating us, as reflected from BSF's beating up of a Bangladeshi national by stripping him of his clothes and holding a BGB man in their custody, one day we may hear that our independence is disappearing. The government has to clear all the mess before it is too late. The government is there to bring order in every sector by open-minded consultation. Shady deals will rather aggravate the situation. Let us be united in our effort to fortify country's sovereignty.//////The way our government refuses to ensure the rights of its citizens is very unfortunate. The LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam said, Cattle lifting, drug smuggling and many other crimes have been taking place in the border areas. This has happened in the past, is happening now and will happen in the future. This statement clearly says that the torture by BSF on the Bangladeshis on the border is not much of an important issue to the government. //////The recent decision of the government to extend the retirement age of government employees from 57 to 59 years has become beneficial to those who applied for LPR one month earlier. But as per the retirement rule, an employee should apply to the authorities at least one month ago for taking LPR. In case, an employee applies for taking retirement and the authorities approve it, then how would the new rule be applied in his case? But in most of the cases, the retired employees have joined the old job again. I think the government should rethink the application of the new rule.//////Microsoft founder Bill Gates yesterday unveiled a $750 million donation to the UN Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis annd malaria, saying the downturn must not trigger a fall in aid.//////An Arab League team is to take the 10-month-old crisis in Syria to the UN Security Council, as activists said security forces launched an assault on a protest hub near the Syrian capital yesterday.//////President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said yesterday that Iran is ready to sit down with world powers for talks on its nuclear programme as he brushed off the harmful effect of newly imposed sanctions.//////Australian PM Julia Gillard and leader of the opposition Tony Abbott had to be rescued after becoming trapped by an angry protest, local media reported yesterday.//////Five bodies were found yesterday as rescue teams frantically searched through rubble for 16 people missing after three office buildings collapsed in the historic heart of Rio, officials said.//////Fidel Castro has lambasted the Republican presidential race as the greatest competition of "idiocy and ignorance" the world has ever seen, and also criticised the news media and foreign governments for seizing on the death of a Cuban prisoner to demand greater respect for human rights.//////Leaders of the war against hunger yesterday said the financial crisis must not be used as an excuse by the richer world to renege on commitments, warning a failure to act would fuel unrest and immigration.//////Several suspected diehards of slain Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi have been subjected to torture and some have even died in detention centres run by armed militias, human rights groups said yesterday.//////Egyptian authorities have slapped a travel ban on several US citizens working for non-governmental organisations, preventing them from leaving the country, officials said yesterday.//////Argentina's president yesterday condemned the UK prime minister's claim last week that her government takes a colonialist attitude to the Falklands Islands.//////The EU executive gave 13 member nations a two-month deadline yesterday to improve the fate of tens of millions of laying-hens confined in cramped cages.//////It was on a December day that I first met him.

It was something I should not have said, for there was the distinct possibility that I would fail to meet the deadline. Besides, I had never before written an editorial. In the event, though, the gods came in to help. The editorial was ready in fifteen minutes. Waheedul Haque smiled, gave me a cup of tea and then took me to Barrister Mainul Husein.

The judges were not at all easy on the contestants either. //////NEWTON'S third law of motion certainly doesn't work on the India-Bangladesh border, because what Indian Border Security Force does unto Bangladeshi citizens aren't reportedly done unto Indian citizens by Border Guards of Bangladesh and weren't reportedly done by its predecessor Bangladesh Rifles. The comparison is not intended to provoke retaliation from the Bangladesh side, but to draw an obvious contrast between the border guarding forces of the two countries for a valid reason. If BGB or BDR could exercise restraint on this side of the border, why is BSF on that side so brazen in its behaviour?//////FRIDAY, January 13, 2011 is one of those momentous days in the annals of Bangladesh history that will be remembered by present and future generations with glowing appreciation. It was on this date all children of Bangladesh were blessed by the High Court in response to a petition lodged on July 18, 2010 by Barrister Sara Hossain on behalf of Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) and Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK).//////THIS is no laughing matter.
