Not only from aesthetical point of view but also it is full of surprises and houses a vast array of mammal splendors. And when it comes to a magnificent natural setting like that of the great Amazon, one can surely expect nothing less of extraordinary. In a fascinating turn of events, scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM) have documented a wild cat species, disguising its own voice, imitating the call of its intended victim. This astonishing behavior was recorded in the Amazonian forests of the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke in Brazil and the wild cat concerned here was a Margay, a solitary and nocturnal spotted cat native to Central and South America. It's intended prey, a small, squirrel-sized monkey known as pied tamarin. It is important to note that, this is the first recorded instance of wild cat species in the Americas mimicking the calls of its prey. This discovery is quite remarkable in the sense that this particular observation by the scientists have confirmed the scientific community what, up until now had been only sketchy reports from Amazonian tribesmen of wild cat species like jaguars and pumas, actually mimicking primates, rodents, agoutis and other species in order to draw them within the striking range. The findings were published in the June issue of Neotropical Primates. According to Fabio Rohe of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) who is also one of the authors of the paper, Cats are known for their physical agility, but this vocal manipulation of prey species indicates a psychological cunning which merits further study. //////DIAMONDS, gemstones have always amazed us with their colors. Now in the era of nanotechnology, it's the Quantum Dot (QD) that is dazzling our eyes. QDs are semiconductor nanostructures, 25 billionths of a meter in diameter, which can confine electrons in three dimensions and emit light when exposed to ultraviolet radiation or X-ray. About 50 thousandth the width of a human hair, these nano-scale gems are built by confining electrons in some insulating material(s) around a central, well-conducting region. Although they can be composed of hundreds of atoms, quantum dots in many ways behave almost as if they were single gigantic atoms. This enables the study of quantum mechanical effects on a length scale that is around 100-500 times larger than the pure atomic scale.//////Star-shape brain cells previously thought to take a back seat in terms of the brain's activity might play a key role in controlling breathing, a new study in rats suggests. //////JUST as most efficient transfer of momentum takes place between objects of identical masses, the most efficient interaction in the field of scientific creativity is likely to happen between countries that have more or less similar footings in scientific background, cultural heritage and economic development. For interaction, special closeness of course is another important factor, the countries of Asia pacific nicely satisfy their criteria to make the idea of establishing an interactive science discovery centre. We believe that human mind can interact much better in the field of science, specially, in the discovery mode than when they are fighting in the mode of hatred and suspicion with each other. //////IN the pantheon of cosmic celebrities, the sun is one true superstar. It's not only the Earth's prime source of light and heat it also fuels the greenery that makes breathing possible, keeps time by setting the body's daily rhythms and spits out charged particles that create the beauty of the aurora borealis.//////Captured by high-resolution cameras aboard a robotic submersible, mineral-rich water spews from hydrothermal vents in this picture of Kawio Barat, a massive undersea volcano off Indonesia. //////For close to three decades, nucleons (protons and neutrons) were considered to be the ultimate subatomic particles. As scientists delved deeper, they detected shadows of yet another layer of matter inside nucleons. Unable so far to crack open a nucleon and bring out one of these shadowy objects for observation and measurement, they named them quarks. It is believed that one up and one down quark make up the proton and neutron. Quarks are held together by a force dubbed the chromo force, represented by particles named gluons, which are just as unseen as quarks.//////
