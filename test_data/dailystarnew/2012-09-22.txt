The Bank's investigative unit previously shared with the Government of Bangladesh credible evidence of corruption related to our financing of the bridge, and the Bank had identified a series of clear measures to be implemented by the Government for the Bank to remain engaged with the project, which the Government of Bangladesh had failed to meet. These included: (i) placing all public officials suspected of involvement in the corruption scheme on leave from Government employment until the investigation is completed; (ii) appointing a special inquiry and prosecution team within the Bangladeshi Anti-Corruption Commission to handle the investigation; (iii) agreeing to provide full access to all investigative information to an external panel of internationally recognized experts so that they can give guidance to the Bank and co-financiers on the progress, adequacy, and fairness of the investigation, and; iv) agreeing on new implementation arrangements that gives the Bank and co-financiers greater oversight of project procurement processes. //////A Grameen Bank director yesterday protested her inclusion in a committee formed to select the managing director of the microfinance institution, saying it was done without her consent.//////The World Bank approves a $1.2-billion loan//////Twenty Bangladeshis who had languished in two Tanzanian prisons for the last 11 months finally returned home yesterday morning.//////Members of Bangladesh Coast Guard yesterday seized an oil tanker on the estuary of the Karnaphuli when the vessel was carrying over six lakh litres of furnace oil and 700 litres of diesel worth Tk 4 crore allegedly for the black market.//////At least 50 people including the Narsingdi municipality mayor were injured in a clash between supporters of slain mayor Lokman Hossain and police in the town yesterday.//////Taking a swipe at the BNP chief, the state minister for law yesterday claimed that her comments over the full verdict on the constitution's 13th amendment were tantamount to sedition.//////A housewife allegedly committed suicide hanging herself from a ceiling fan in the capital's Shyampur area yesterday.//////A tea-stall owner was run over and killed by a bus while crossing a road in the capital's Sayedabad area yesterday morning.//////Six federal ministers belonging to Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress party resigned from the UPA government in a split over economic reforms, reducing the coalition headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to a parliamentary minority. //////At least 19 people died yesterday as violent protests erupted on the streets of Pakistan's main cities in anger at an anti-Islam film made in the US.//////The first ever US-Bangladesh Partnership Dialogue concluded in Washington Thursday spotlighting greater engagement and cooperation in regional integration.//////An Iranian cleric is claiming that two young girls beat him up after he told one of them to cover up and dress more conservatively.//////Myanmar democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi, on a landmark visit to the United States, called Thursday for the release of jailed members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot.//////We express satisfaction at the news that the World Bank (WB) has given verbal commitment to revive the stalled $1.2bn loan for Padma Bridge. Congratulations are due for both the government and the WB in being able to overcome months of impasse to reach an agreement due to be announced sometime on Friday. We would like to put in an added word of appreciation for the Minister of Finance, who in the face of tremendous pressure kept his faith in the project specially at a time when the highest public officials of the government had engaged themselves in a tirade of abuse against the WB. The flurry of behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts by government officials this month in ironing out differences with the lead agency of the consortium has borne fruitful dividends and this is reflected by WB's willingness to return to the negotiation table a move we greatly appreciate.//////The fact that primary textbooks still contain some wrong and misleading information about the cultural identity of the country's indigenous communities comes as a shocking piece of news.

In our situation, such an observation assumes special significance, especially in the penultimate year of a political government when mood, expectations and delivery are extremely demanding.//////It is the beginning of the end. Whether Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee goes ahead with her decision to withdraw support to the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the centre, or has second thoughts about it, the writing on the wall is clear. Federalism is asserting itself and the Congress is feeling the heat.//////If a country wants social and economic development, it will have to break away from its orthodox and backward mould, and there must be policy initiatives to integrate social justice with economic development. This calls for a thrust in literacy as an integral part of this policy. But as it stands today in Bangladesh, there is only petty party feuds and money making to the utter disregard of human resource development. Literacy is the most crucial factor in achieving the MDG. While we brag about our education system making a leap forward, we are unable to discern if it is functioning properly. //////It is commonly said that we do not learn from history. This is by and large true, but that does not mean that we should not remember history and recall where we had gone wrong. If we had taken lessons from history, perhaps we would not have repeated the mistakes of the past. //////The success of social and economic developments in Bangladesh depends on social business. The majority of the 160 million people in Bangladesh are poor. Social and economic reforms must begin with the poor, and that's why social business plays a crucial role in the overall economic growth in Bangladesh. //////Since the dawn of human evolution, people have migrated across different places and sought a livable environment that would support their survival as well as aspirations for better life. The fundamental relationship between environment and migration has therefore been rooted in the human history. Now the reality of climate change adds a new dynamic to this nexus. Climate change is feared to accelerate the frequency of natural disasters and gradual environmental degradation which may induce people to migrate because of threats to their lives or livelihoods. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its first assessment report warned that the greatest single impact of climate change might be on human migration. However, there are uncertainties about the exact scope and scale of it as migration is essentially a multi-casual phenomenon and interacts with lots of other socio-economic factors. But the influence of climate change on migration is quite discernible and growing. International Organization of Migration (IOM) has predicted that the number of environment induced migrants may exceed 200 million by 2050 (IOM, 2010). //////The global population pressure has increased in urban areas with people thronging the cities in quest of a better life. According to the UN Population Division, about 44% of the total populations in developing countries are living in urban areas. There is no doubt that the urbanization will proceed to have significant impact on the ecology, economy and society at local, regional, and global levels. The great impact has been observed in the urban green spaces including urban forestry, parks, playgrounds, domestic gardens, roadside open spaces and urban vegetation. ////// We reached Quebec city in the late afternoon, and were planning to hit the Old City (Vieux Ville) right after we had a chance to wash up, but when we checked with the hotel concierge, he warned us not to take the car into the city since roads leading to the Old City were blocked because of a concert by Madonna. However, we defied him and, since the sky was clear and we anticipated that the moon would be up soon and brighten up the city and the river, we decided to brave the traffic and road blocks to get to the heart of the city. We lucked out and were able to get to our destination without major detours, and even found street parking on rue Ste-Anne at a spot very close to the river front, the Chateau, and for us the major attraction, the Terrace Dufferin, a promenade above the St. Lawrence River which offers a magnificent view of the estuary and the mountains surrounding it. As soon as we stepped out from the car we could hear Madonna singing Papa don't preach, a song that was the battle cry of the women's emancipation struggles in the 1980s.//////In Bangladesh, several evidence based interventions have been identified as highly effective in reducing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.

They analysed 13 existing European studies covering nearly 200,000 people and found job strain was linked to a 23% increased risk of heart attacks and deaths from coronary heart disease. The risk to the heart was much smaller than for smoking or not exercising, the Lancet medical journal report said.//////Shortly before the fateful US intervention in Iraq that led to the downfall and the eventual execution of the then Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein, Brent Scowcroft, who had been the National Security Advisor to the first President Bush, wrote a perceptive piece of advice that was published in the Wall Street Journal on 15 August 2002. Advising against intervention in Iraq, Scowcroft wrote that this 'would divert for some indefinite period from our war on terrorism' and that any military campaign 'would have to be followed by large scale long term military occupation.' The then policy makers in the US did not pay heed to Scowcroft's words of wisdom, with disastrous consequences both for the US as well as for the hapless people of Iraq who have suffered horrendously. //////From recent developments of Indo-Bangladesh relation, it appears that we are being caught in a limbo due to domestic political impasse of our big neighbour India. The rise of a high demanding regional party, The Trinamool Congress, in historically moderate West Bengal and the very nature of the federal structure of Indian polity have compounded the Indo-Bangladesh situation. With secular Awami League in power in Bangladesh which is considered more pragmatic and less rhetorical about our relation with our big neighbour in one side and the secular UPA coalition led by the Congress party of India on the other, it was a natural expectation that the relation between the two nations would flourish in the light of the worldwide trend of increased regional cooperation. What is going wrong? No political pundit would probably label Sonia-Manmohan-Pranab leadership of the present Indian government as belligerent towards smaller neighbours; yet there goodwill fails to deliver. If we take a closer look at the evolution of the party system of Indian democracy and the fresh change of political atmosphere in West Bengal we will probably be able to see where lays the gridlock. Although, in one sense, internal political intricacies of India is not ought to be the concern of Bangladesh, we are entangled in it against our wish owing to the reduced capacity and internal strife of the multiparty conglomerate in power in India at present. Other than the Congress no other party in the coalition is a national party and the primary focuses of these parties are their local power bases at the provincial level where they want to grasp or maintain the political clout. These parties share lesser responsibility in terms of some important union government functions like foreign relation. The situation is worse when a foreign relation in question involves some conflict of interest between the federal government and the coalition partner regional party and the latter is unwilling to demonstrate a rational sense of responsibility as coalition partner of the central government and rather remain arrogant to score a high political point at local level. Mamata Banerjee is not even ready to recognise the broader benefit of West Bengal itself in an enhanced Indo-Bangladesh cooperation on bilateral issues like transit, anti-terror cooperation, reordering of border enclaves etc. For the moment, it appears that the key to the gridlock is her coming of age as a responsible leader. It appears that Ms. Banerjee is all out to orchestrate a show to the West Bengal electorate; perhaps thinking of her long-term gain, that she, not the Left Front leadership, is the real hardcore protector of the provincial interest and West Bengal's well being is only safe in her hands. Given her state of temperamental mindset and hasty political behaviour, worsened by the weaker strength of UPA government in the face of it, it is prudent for Bangladesh government to take cautious steps. Pushing the central government too hard may not yield as they will not like to risk the survival of their coalition by pushing Mamata in turn. Moreover, the union government of India tend to follow the federal polity norm of trying to take the concerned provincial leadership aboard while dealing with neighbouring nation. The same policy also applies in case of Sri Lanka when the central government endeavour to take the Tamil Nadu provincial government and the provincial allies into confidence. So, there is a rationale for being reasonably patient. //////Siddiq Salik was born in Punjab.

He mentioned me and some others by name in that letter. What was more enthusing is that through Burness, who happens to be a close personal acquaintance of Achebe's, the latter (Chinua) also had come to know about our conference.
