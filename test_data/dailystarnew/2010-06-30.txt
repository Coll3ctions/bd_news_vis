The graphic images of the brutality the forces resorted to leaves us all in a state of disbelief, for the fundamental reason that such behaviour is not what one expects in a democratic society. The police and RAB men, without any qualms, simply marched into the house, stormed into its various rooms (including bedrooms) and indiscriminately beat up everyone they found there. Among those who could not escape the truncheons were Mirza Abbas' elderly mother, his wife and other female members of the family. It was clearly brutality totally uncalled for. //////IT is with interest that we receive the news of the government's initiative to legislate to stave off political partisanship in civil administration besides cutting its cost.

A case was filed.//////A front-page news item on the subject was published in a daily on June 17th.//////We hear from our friends and relatives living in Bangladesh that the supply of electricity in the capital itself is highly erratic. They report that at every one-hour interval there is one-hour load shedding. They say, it is not only in Dhaka, the load shedding, a popular power saving method, is going on all over Bangladesh. If they are correct then Bangladesh offices run only 4 hours and industries 10 hours in 24 hours. Here are my rough calculations. A 24 hours day, half 12 hours time is daylight time and another 12 hours is night for sleep and rest. The load shedding then eats 6 hours from night and 6 hours from daylight. Usually, the office hours are during day time so the officials get only 6 hours for office work and remaining 6 hours allotted for them are eaten by load-shedding. //////Free and fair election is the precondition of democracy in a country. It is a matter of great regret that in Bangladesh history it sometimes seemed that election result was manipulated, especially when election was conducted under the ruling party. But this dirty practice has come to an end which was reflected in the Chittagong City Corporation election held on 17 June, 2010.//////From Muhammad Ali to Salvador Dali... Adolph Hitler to Pope John Paul II... actress Mary Jackson to politician Janet Reno, Parkinson's disease has touched the lives of people all over the world. Bangladesh has more than a million people (a very wild guess) who are suffering from neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer, drying of the neurons, etc. A friend (secretary to the government) who had Alzheimer, passed away sometime ago. Three of my friends are presently suffering from such diseases. In a wider canvas, this list will be uncountable, as our elderly population is growing. //////Considering the overall performance of the cricket team in recent matches, we think the time is ripe for the Board to do something to find and check the humiliating degradation of our cricket. The players' performances have reached such an extent that commentators do not hesitate to ridicule them with derogatory remarks like 'fishing stick' to mean their bat and 'lollipop' to mean the ball. The team was even sometimes compared to that of a school-amateurs . //////The former general and president of the republic and presently an MP and important partner of the grand-alliance government wrote a column in this newspaper on 16 June, 2010, which is a must read for everybody who has curiosity about the politics and development of the country. The ex-general has said a lot of things, from politics, his harassment, development activities undertaken by him to the present condition of the country. Since these are his personal views, so I do not have anything to say or protest except that part which I personally witnessed and was somehow responsible for. //////Eve teasing has become quite a common scene in the present context of the country as every day we find news in the electronic and print media that young girls are being maltreated across the country. Every day school and college going girls face vulgar words from the stalkers on the way. Sometimes, they are physically harassed and sexually abused. Asma Khatun, 15, a student of class ten, was killed by a group of stalkers in Sathkhira district. Once again, it has proved that the recent initiatives taken by our honourable education minister as well as the law enforcers are not quite satisfactory. To speak the truth, women are severely maltreated in a least developed country like Bangladesh where the govt is adopting many strategies and policies to empower women in all spheres of life. Nevertheless exploitation and oppression against them are increasing. However, it is true that our socio-economic aspect is not quite favourable for women to develop themselves smoothly but at the same time it can't be denied that the birth of the girl child is not warmly recognised here due to superstitions. //////The batsmen of our cricket team have somewhat improved in scoring rate and style but the continued inclusion of Ashraful and his 'promised' low scores are absolutely debilitating for our team. It defies all and any logic of our post match analysis. He seems to have lost focus. //////It has been reported that Myanmar is working on nuclear weapons with assistance from North Korea. We all know that Myanmar is our next door neighbour and we can't simply be silent about those developments. It has many implications. Firstly, our relationship with Myanmar as a close neighbour is not satisfactory, there are frequent feuds regarding our water bodies on the basin of the Bay of Bengal. Secondly, we have disputes such as Rohingya crisis, smuggling etc. Moreover, Myanmar military dictatorship has been ruling this country for a significant period of time exhibiting less chance for a democratic govt. in the near future. We already have lot many neighbouring countries in this part of the globe having nuclear power like India, China and Pakistan. Now, Myanmar is going to join this club too! What will be the next courses of action for us? Is there any discussion or a strategic or diplomatic policy that has been taken by our government highlighting this matter? I think it is time to think again, we can't ignore the things around us. //////I have no intention to influence your decision to act as you think necessary as the Mayor of CCC. But it would be more useful if you kindly keep in mind that you are a non-party candidate though a political sticker has been added. The people of Chittagong have elected you for a change they thought absolutely necessary for the overall development of the city as the commercial capital and the main port. This job will require your statesmanship in running your office democratically without being biased in favour of any political party or your political affiliation, if any.//////Though seemingly the BNP led alliance has won the Chittagong mayoral election, but in the truest sense it is the ruling party which has won. They have proven that they can also hold fair election while they are in power. This defeat may show us all that if the Election Commission takes proper and strict measures to hold fair elections, they can do so! It will add extra weight to the demand for annulling the caretaker system in our country. //////Mr. Ahmed Niaz's above captioned letter has touched me deeply. The inadequacy in terms of expertise in medical field is horrible. It is better not to discuss govt. hospitals. Some big private hospitals which were launched after creating much hype and sounds, are not much better. Their consultants are (most of them) mediocre, probably as per the instructions of their owners, they go and go and go for damn expensive investigations, which are not always necessary, they recruit junior doctors mainly graduated from so called private medical colleges,(the govt. medical college graduates don't stay long in these hospitals.).And about these private medical colleges, may Allah protect this nation from them, the least said, the better! And a very important segment of a hospital the nursing side, is far from any acceptable standard. The charges of these hospitals are irrationally high.//////I hear so much about digital Bangladesh but the future personnel who are going to carry it through do not have the bare electronic instruction facilities to make them competent for the job. I am talking about most of the public universities of the country. Most of the classrooms in those varsities do not have computer aided instructions facilities in the classrooms. Professors are using very old fashioned chalkboard to teach complex science material. For explaining most of the modern science concepts clearly and accurately to the students, the professors need to draw complicated flow charts and diagrammes. It is virtually impossible to do all the graphics on the chalkboard in a lecture hour. Due to lack of proper electronic instruction facilities in our classrooms our university graduates are not getting quality education. We should immediately allocate resources so that at least all sciences and technology classrooms of our universities are equipped with computers and LCD projectors. To complete the digitisation we should also connect the classrooms with Internet so that the teachers can use the vast web resources for instant reference in the classrooms.//////It has been observed fairly recently that some European countries are banning the wearing of veils. Without understanding the inner significance of this tradition some of the so called self-declared smart (!) people in Bangladesh as well are thinking to ban or prohibit this tradition. This is not actually tradition. This is a human right of women what kind of dresses and costumes they will choose for themselves. If it is dictated by certain quarters of men, then there is a question of Male Chauvinism. Men should not dictate any female to wear hizab and if any woman wants to wear it none should stop her. Traditionally most of our mothers, daughters and sisters are religious. If they want to fulfil the order given by Alllah (SWT) by wearing veil we should rather encourage it instead of prohibiting it. The recent influx of rape, eve-teasing leading to suicide and indecent assault are to some extent linked with not wearing modest dress. If any girl goes outside without wearing the proper modest dress it is quite normal that boys on the road and corner may peep in and comment on the beauty of the girl and will try to tease her to satisfy his lust. That's why The Ahkamul Hakimin (Judge of all judges) Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala has given the injunction in the Holy Qur'an (Surat-un-Nur 24.30-31) in the following way: //////We appreciate Awami League MP Sawkat Momen Shahjahan for his observation which is very sensible and praiseworthy. On May 23, 2010, he expressed his dissatisfaction about the remarks of State Minister for Law Quamrul Islam on BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman, whom Quamrul Islam labelled as a spy who worked for Pakistan during our liberation war.//////I would like to put forward my views in the interest of the small savers, pensioners, retirees, widows and senior citizens of the country. The government has recen imposed a ten percent tax on interest incomes from savings certificates. The decision is indeed good in the interest of the nation but in my opinion the authorities should give a second thought to the plight of the small investors who are dependent on this income to survive. In my opinion the tax should be imposed on an income coming from an invested amount in excess of Tk 50 lakh which appears to be quite reasonable with the present inflation rate and cost of living standard to offer a retired pensioner, widow or senior citizen a decent living. As the life time savings and commutation money of a retired officer/staff cannot exceed this amount, I guess it is quite a reasonable figure which should not be considered as invested for business or profit purpose, but rather for survival. I hope the authorities will re-consider their decision in the interest of the small savers, pensioners, retirees, widows and senior citizens and impose the tax on an income generated in excess of Tk 50 lakh.//////US General David Petraeus faces a confirmation hearing in the Senate yesterday expected to expose growing doubts about the US effort in Afghanistan but broad support for the four-star general chosen to lead it.//////Maoist rebels killed 26 police officers in an ambush in central India yesterday, police said, in the latest of a series of deadly strikes against security forces.//////The government imposed a curfew in parts of Kashmir and deployed thousands of troops yesterday to quell huge anti-India protests in a region at the core of its dispute with nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan.//////Setting an end-date for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan would play into the hands of insurgents, Germany's defence minister said yesterday, warning of a "tough summer."//////Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has denied reports that the government is forming an "alliance" with the "rump" of the Tamil Tigers.//////Suspected US missiles hit a house yesterday in a Pakistani tribal region along the Afghan border where the army has been battling Taliban fighters, intelligence officials said.
