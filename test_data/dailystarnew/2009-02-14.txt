But, regrettable as it is, we have been witnessing the same crime being perpetrated quite blatantly in this country for a long time now. It is an open secret that textbook crisis at the very outset of the academic sessions is created by a section of corrupt publishers in cahoots with some dishonest government officials only to force students to buy so-called guidebooks, publication of which is prohibited under the existing law. Through this evil practice, the publisher-official nexus earns windfall profit right before the eyes of the administration. What is most disconcerting is that despite all indications of the nexus in action, the 'hostage situation' has also been created this year compelling students to go to school without books. The failure on the part of the administration to frustrate the practice has given rise to many pertinent questions in the minds of the citizens. We think it is time the administration came up with satisfactory answers. //////IT hurt many readers of our newspaper on Thursday to see the frontpage photospread of two dead Pochards, rare migratory bird species, on a boat, having been reportedly recovered(!) from Hakaluki Haor in Moulvibazar.

If youre an SOVD (single on Valentines Day) this year, indulge yourself and mope around all day (ladies suggest generous helpings of chocolate, not sure why. Personally, I like a good ol fashioned slasher/horror flick fest with other single friends). The ditties from this years playlist address (almost) all cases imaginable related to being single -- dejected, jilted, obsessively persuading, peacefully ruminating, acerbic ranting and celebrating solitude. These songs might not necessarily uplift your mood but theyre helluva great songs. Without further ado, lets get down to business. But first, a disclaimer: This is not a battle cry, nor a call to initiate a singles movement.//////The Daily Star in a report on February 10 informs us on the authority of the Home Minister that around 6000 cases were withdrawn during the tenure of the immediate past BNP-Jammat led government.

Koshkin, that is Andrei Pavlovich Koshkin, is a young diplomat at Dhaka's Russian Embassy. I had met him in Moscow where I once lived as a university student. I have returned home some five years now. These past years I have had no contact with him, until last year when we unexpectedly met at an international conference in Dhaka. I learned that he had been reassigned here from New Delhi only the previous month. We soon renewed our old friendship and spiced it up with vodka. These days we see each other once in a while, and speak quite often over the phone. Each time he goes home, he returns with a bottle of vodka for me. There are days when we also eat out at restaurants.////// edited by Jahanarah Nuri, is a collection of thirteen short stories brought out by publishers Utsha Prokashon, Dhaka. The stories center around the theme of women's oppression, domestic violence and women's rights, a condition that Ms Nuri says in her introduction has been further inflamed by the pressures generated by the difficult transition from a rural culture and village societal values to an urban culture and city-based way of life. The stories in this compilation, chosen from the works of such well-known authors such as Hasan Azizul Haq, Syed Shamsul Haq, Zakir Talukdar and Rizia Rahman as well as younger authors such as Papri Rahman and Shaheen Akhtar, however, to a large extent escape the didacticism (almost as oppressive as the brutalities committed on women) associated with such literary enterprises. Ms Nuri is aware of such dangers, as when she writes that the short story form at first glance seems an easy enough form, but that its difficulties are familiar to writers, and that she has made sincere efforts to put literary merit at the top of her criterion for choosing them. Her sensitivity and care has been vindicated in this fine and balanced volume of stories.//////Kashinath Roy began writing poetry in his teens, and in the sixties published regularly in periodicals like ////// (edited by Abdullah Abu Sayeed). After that he published little, though he kept on writing -- poems, short stories, at least one novella. Some of these appeared in the irregular little magazine ////// (edited by Naim Hasan), and more recently, ////// (edited by K. Ashraf Hossain). He was sixty when he published his first book, a verse play he had written in his teens. Now, at sixty-one, he has published a substantial collection of recent poems, ////// (Take a Look, Jibanananda). It is available from Bhashachitra, and I hope the Boi Mela crowds will notice it. The poems are forthright, often bitterly satirical, eminently readable, and a most pertinent commentary on the state of our nation. The following is my rather hastily done translation of the second poem in the book, 'Hazrat Nuh-er Nauka'.//////the faithful hurry//////for prayers//////to a sky vacant //////except for a jet//////creasing the clouds//////Lost the password through my own sheer absent-mindedness//////The cat gives me a huge Cheshire grin//////A hard rain outsidemore desirable than sex//////It strikes when you walk  a distinct pain or cramping in your calf.

Other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells which grow beyond their usual boundaries and which can invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs, a process referred to as metastasis. Metastases are the major cause of death from cancer.//////Although, red meat is an important support of our diet, people have suspected for some time that high levels of red and processed meat increase the risk of lot of complicated diseases. But how far it is true? Are all types of red meats bad? Is there any open secret?//////Women who suffer the stress of a death or serious illness of a loved one shortly before becoming pregnant may have an increased risk of premature delivery, a large study suggests.//////Discourage overeating by placing the appropriate servings of food on dinner plates, rather than plunking serving bowls on the table. For a festive presentation, garnish the plates with a lemon wedge, chopped fresh herbs or an ingredient that is in the dish.//////People who don't think life is worth living are more likely to die within the next few years, research from Japan shows.//////IN the recently held 9th Parliamentary Election Bangladeshi voters completely rejected negativity and cynicism in political campaign in which some parties repeatedly invoked Islam, and they voted decisively against such political use of Islam. The overall result demonstrates the peoples' ultimate verdict against all forms of religious militancy. Bangladesh's 153 million people showed very little appetite for political Islam. Thus the new government is in the heart of the people, hoping to save the country from the rise of Islamist extremism. Obviously it is not the time to debate whether to give combating terrorism the top priority for the new regime, rather it needs to be put on the 'emergency' list for inclusive development. No doubt terrorism has been a worrying factor for Bangladesh - a lethal offshoot of political use of religion, defective education system and the socio-economic backwardness of the country. It generates national security threats, creating tailback for inclusive development of the country. //////AS this article goes to press, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, Indian External Affairs Minister, would have gone back home after his 2-day whirlwind tour. The signing of various treaties had raised, as usual, accusations from the opposition that the government was 'selling-off' the country and compromising the national sovereignty by signing unequal treaties with India. The Government, after opening the Pandora's Box, seemed to have quickly gone on the back-foot. The Commerce Minister, who had been an outspoken champion of transit, changed his own position somewhat and said that there will be no transit or transhipment treaty, only a renewal of the existing Indo-Bangladesh Trade Agreement. //////For the last eighteen days, the Israeli military attacks on the Palestinians on the Gaza strip can be described as a modern day savagery. It has shocked the conscience of all human beings who witnessed the killing of innocent children, women and men in Gaza on the pretext that Hamas is a terrorist organization which fire rockets into Israeli lands.//////Interests and dilations about civil service have seen something of an upsurge in the recent years. Although the debate on the role and performance of civil service continues unabated, both its admirers and critics agree on the crucial significance of the civil service as a key institutional determinant of the success or failure of fledging democratic states especially in the developing world. Notwithstanding this broad consensus on its significance, however, the mammoth contextual complexities, structural heterogeneity, and functional diversity render the modern civil services no easy subject of research and academic exploration. Dr. Rashid, a senior civil servant himself, has ventured to explore, usually with verve and insight, a number of major challenges and issues surrounding the operation of civil service in Bangladesh with a special focus on such crucial aspects as recruitment, training, performance and prospects. //////The year 2008 began with uncertainty and restlessness amongst everyone. The state of emergency had already entered its second year and there seemed to be no progress in the political landscape of the country to restore democracy. The end of the year was a climax of sorts as the national elections, which was termed as the most 'free and fair' election in Bangladesh to date took place with the highest number of voter turnout ever seen. What happened in between the months of January and December in terms of human rights violations is what is reported in 'Human Rights in Bangladesh in 2008', brought out by human rights watchdog organisation Ain o Salish Kendro (ASK).//////With a runny nose so grossly large and marred by birthmarks that people remember him years after having last met him, Saleem Sinai is the not-so-handsome hero of Midnight's Children, a story of epic proportion told by Rushdie, a teller of exaggerated tales. On opening the book, you'll end up sitting in front of Saleem writing about his fantastic past and reading the first-drafts of his memoir to a fussy woman named Padma who despite being illiterate criticizes Saleem's authorship from all angles.//////Nurunnabi Chowdhury presents forty-six poems in his anthology, //////
