Even now, while starvation is stalking the countryside, responsible authorities are playing around with words and denying that there is a crisis of major proportions.//////FORMER Chief Adviser and Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman while speaking as chief guest at the National Citizen's Dialogue titled "National unity to face major challenges 2008" has implored the nation to "elect such parliament members who will be role models not only in politics but also on our way forward". He has reportedly urged not to waste our votes on incompetent persons. Justice Habibur Rahman could not be more candid. How one wishes his entreaties make an appropriate impact on the relevant quarters?//////NAWAZ Sharif, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, is touching upon subjects which leaders in his country and India intentionally avoid. His suggestion to Pakistan to unilaterally lift restrictions on travels by Indians is bold and timely. Tension between the two countries is far less than before and there is a pronounced desire to come closer to each other. The Muslim League which Nawaz Sharif heads is a concomitant with fanatic elements. Some have strong anti-India views. For him to ignore their bias is courageous. Yet, the hardheaded politician as he is, his ears are plugged to the ground. He is convinced that an average Pakistani wants to befriend India. He has tested this sentiment when, a few years ago, he swept the polls against the late Benazir Bhutto on the plank that the vote for him was a vote for friendship with India. She had then taken an opposite stand. Nawaz Sharif has said that Asif Ali Zardari, co-chairman of the ruling Pakistan People's Party (PPP), also supports his proposal. Zardari or any PPP minister should come out with some statement to confirm their support. It is, however, strange that Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has made no statement to express his views on how to improve relations with India. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose visit to Pakistan is awaited anxiously by Islamabad, said a few weeks ago that he was ready to travel to the other side provided there was something important to sign. The abolition of visa can be worth a visit.//////Nayeem Islam carried his good form with a back-to-back century as BCB National Cricket Academy (NCA) tightened their grip on South Africa Academy on

These rapid changes in the economic, social and political life have enormous impact on country's ecosystems and resources. Operationalising the concept of sustainable development requires integrating economic, social and environmental objectives and negotiating and managing trade offs. The future of sustainable development lies in the evolution of the character of governance -- the ensemble of social ethics, public policies and institutions which structure how government, people and the civil society interact with the environment. We are to find ways how to pursue active economic development without further degrading their environment and ecosystem resources. In the midst of widespread poverty and natural resources depletion in the country, the government strives to produce a proper mix of pro-environment and pro-development policies. We are also to give attention to other important strategic dimensions such as the integration of disaster risk reduction into sustainable development policies and plans. //////Sundarban Mangrove forest of Bangladesh covers an area of about 6017 sq. km which is 62 percent of its total area whereas other 38 percent is situated in the West Bengal province of India.

In a work that encompasses an entirety of a family tale, the writer in essence brings forth all the traditions, as it were, that once were an underpinning of life in this country. These are the writer's memoirs and yet they could be interpreted as expressions of the sentiments that have bound Bengali families and clans together for ages. All history begins with the personal before broadening out to a wider swath of experience. And that is the point which Ali makes at the beginning of his narrative. He goes out in search of his roots and comes away from the density of tradition enriched in terms of his discovery. It is discovery that most, if not all, of us can relate to. There is that identification not just with class but with the accompaniments of aspirations which come with it as well.//////Retired Indian Lt. Gen. J.F.R. Jacob is a tactful guest.
