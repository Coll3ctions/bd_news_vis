After all, we were the children of the sixties. Our literary sensibilities were framed by Pound and Eliot, Plath and Pasternak, Ginsberg and Neruda, Bishnu Dey and Jibanananda Das, Subhas Mukhopadhay and Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Shamsur Rahman and Al Mahmud. We had little patience for the orderly meters, the lilting cadences, and the over-wrought rhymes that marked the poetry of our earlier generations. Farrookh Ahmed, Ahsan Habib, Golam Mostafa, Jasimuddin, and others essentially followed the same poetic concerns and conventions, though Ahmed was more overtly Islamic, and Jasimuddin had carved out his niche in folkish pastoralism.
