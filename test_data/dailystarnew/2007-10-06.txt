For some it probably connotes the right to exercise one's choice with freedom, albeit responsibly. For others, it appears to suggest the freedom to use acquired power without any restraint or accountability or without the need to function within the due process of law. This difference in interpretation has become for all of us the central point in the re-organisation of politics and political behaviour that is normally associated with the dynamics of democracy. We stand today at an important crossroads in our national existence. We are faced with challenges that have to be met and overcome.

Such characters would confidently pronounce on the preeminence of fear as an effective tool in ensuring administrative and by extension societal propriety.//////The travel industry, though travel journalists have no recognised union to publicise their interests and fight on their behalf, is defended and supported by a variety of organisations, including ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents), WTO (World Tourism Organisation) and WTTC (World Travel and Tourism Council). Noticeably, the travel industry intends to protect the world's natural and cultural resources, which are at the heart of its business activities. But it has other concerns as well, some of which run counter to the tenets of sound ecotourism. These travel associations sponsor, for instance, self regulation, expanded tourism markets and a lowering of trade barriers. Almost for two decades, industry associations responded to the development of environmental concerns and the rise of ecotourism by instituting certain transformations that, when inspected directly, often amount to promoting minor, cost saving environmental reforms -- ecotourism rather than critically fighting the codes and practices of ecotourism.//////We all must die but that I can save a man from days of torture that is what I feel is my great and ever new privilege.

Naval exercises are held around the world all around the year as part of normal defense activities by nations to train their armed forces. But this particular naval exercise has a different significance. This is probably the turning point in India's foreign and defense policies that may have very far-reaching effect on the overall global power equation. This naval exercise undoubtedly represents a major shift in India's strategic security perceptions. Actually, it signals India's entry into the "Quadrilateral initiative," a new strategic security combine in which it joins as a key member in the security triad of Australia, Japan and the US. Presumably, Singapore's participation as an add-on in the exercise signifies the finer dimensions of this initiative.//////As many as 100,000 anti-government protesters led by a phalanx of Buddhist monks marched on 24th September through Yangon, the largest crowd to demonstrate in Myanmar's biggest city since the 1988 pro-democracy uprising was brutally crushed by the military.//////UN Envoy Ibrahim Gambari, who arrived in Myanmar on September 30, has met the rulers and the democratic icon Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of the founding father Bojo Aung San. Gambari is not really in a strong bargaining position now, for the indications are that the democratic forces are losing the battle on the streets under extreme pressure applied by the government. The NLD, a democratic platform of over thirty splinter groups headed by Noble Laureate Suu Kyi was not a very well organized political platform but people hang on to the straws for freedom and democracy. //////Sardar Fazlul Karim is one of our most revered icons. He has been one of Dhaka University's finest products but a product with a difference. Born in 1925 in Barisal of lower middle class parents, this outstanding student and teacher has been a simple, humble and wise person all his life, dreaming of a state for the people and by the people and facing great suffering with ease and no complaint. Can we imagine that he spent almost the full Pakistan period in jail, this soft-spoken, frail, little man of high ideals? No wonder a library assistant of the Dhaka University had remarked that he was a 'dangerous' man, leaving his lecturer's job at twenty four and returning to the university in 1972, only after Pakistan broke up. It may be remembered that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and national professor Abdur Razzak brought him back to Dhaka University immediately after independence while Ayub Khan and Monem Khan had ensured that he could never return to his teaching job during the Pakistan period.//////Back in the mid-1990s, here in Dhaka, a group of Indian diplomatic wives waited on the lawn of the Indian high commissioner's residence to receive Dilip Kumar. They had set up food stalls on the occasion of their country's Republic Day, and incidentally the thespian happened to be in town. The women were thrilled that the actor would be before them and were quite taken up by the thought of the good conversation they would have with a man who had already morphed into a legend. Moments later, when Dilip Kumar appeared before them, the women lost, or so it appeared, their power of speech. Having done the usual namaste bit, they stared at him. It was the actor who broke the silence, in chaste Urdu, 'Aap log kiya mujhe dekhte-hi rahenge ya kuch khaane ko bhi denge (will you go on looking at me or will you give me something to eat)?' A burst of laughter greeted his words. Conversation, and not just from the women (wo)manning the food stalls, flowed.////// is what meets the eyes of a young native Pakistani when he intently looks at contemporary America.
