The grievances of the UP representatives are perfectly understandable. But that does not obscure the fact that what they have done through their action is not only objectionable but also highly outrageous.

on a regular basis and the government is striving to mitigate the traffic congestion, this crisis is looming large, why? It's simple to comprehend that when things are high in number the procedures for supervision and control become complicated. There are actually many reasons behind unbearable traffic congestion and one of them is excessive number of cars. The number of cars is increasing rapidly. Let's now come back to the main point, how do cars actually cause traffic jam? Easily one can figure out by looking around while remaining stuck on the roads esp. during traffic congestion that merely two-three big and some small buses are stuck whereas hundreds of cars are queuing up all over the road. And each car is carrying either a single or two-three passengers at a time. It's like using an entire building not an apartment for a single nuclear family. Lately, the UAE govt. has made the provision for moderately-long way journey from one place to another by comfortable as well as affordable giant buses to ease the traffic congestion. And people are getting interested in it as it costs them less and provides them safety and saves their time too. However, our respectable rich citizens can come forward to help ease traffic jam by phasing out the unnecessary purchase of new cars. And we had better avoid using cars unnecessarily. If we think deep down we'll find that these cars are one of the causes behind traffic jam and responsible for air pollution, squandering of time, money, fuel etc. However, the government also needs to think about actual number of foot-over bridges as needed, widening of roads, underground rail-crossing system, setting discouraging tax rate on cars (to lessen the statistics), launching more double decker buses like-- Volvo, more flyovers on busy avenues, no approval for industrial buildings like garments factory and other manufacturing industries within the capital city in order to ease the traffic system in the capital. //////Bangladesh is so small that it becomes tough to find it in a global map. But the Almighty has blessed the country with many hidden treasures. Obviously, the culture and heritage is quite unique and rich. In fact during festivals like Eid-ul-fitre, Pahela Baishakh, Ekusey February, etc Bangladesh takes a new look. This country is very different from other countries as it has six different seasons. Each season has its own beauty.//////Thanks to the ntv for presenting an informative and thought provoking talk show. I hope the government has listened to these guests with due attention and purpose. The question of power sharing with the MPs should be left for further consideration of the government and the relevant quarters. My brief reaction to the bill is as follows://////The piece, written on the above subject by Brig Gen Md. Abdur Rashid, psc, G (retd) with Mr. Francis Arif, appearing on 4 April 2009, is interesting reading. I would like to give my compliments to the authors through the courtesy of your column for their brilliant write-up. //////Many opinions have been passed on this subject. I am not an authority on criminal law but common sense suggests that Magistracy Powers of 'remand in custody pending trial or authority to enter and search a property etc,' should not be confused with Judicial powers of actual trial. Police has wide powers of arresting an individual, however it can only hold such a person for a very limited time without any charge and must produce the arrestee before a magistrate for remand for further interrogation etc, and provide evidence to magistrate as to why this should be given. The magistrate may or may not agree to this further detention, or if there is sufficient evidence may agree to charges provided by the police to hold the arrestee for remand and trial before a judicial court. The same goes for granting 'search warrant' by a magistrate as this is not a judicial act and the number of judges are very few and they would have much more onerous duties.//////What we have been watching is that many employment notices require three first classes, it means at least one in undergraduate level/ post graduate level. It is easily conceivable that it is very tough for those who passed in the class/division system. Those who have passed in the grading system, it is easier for them to get 3.00 in the scale of four than those who passed in class/division system. So, it is a clear case of discrimination. As the division/class system is on the verge of elimination, I would request all the employers to consider this particular aspect before issuing any notice for employment. It is gross injustice to us who have passed in the division/class system and couldn't get 1st class in graduation or master's level. //////In the ninth parliamentary election, Awami League President Sheikh Hasina declared 'Charter for Change' as her election manifesto in order to build up a progressive, developed 'Digital Bangladesh'. The triumph of the Awami League with an unpredictably overwhelming majority apparently reflected the people's wishes and expectations. The violent activities of Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, has, however, created a reign of terror in different educational institutions which has within three months, resulted in the deaths of two students, injury to about thousand and the closure of thirty educational institutions for an indefinite period of time. The violent activities of the Chhatra League on the campuses of different educational institutions; repeated internecine brawls, tender businesses, rehearsal with arms and firearms in the dormitories for supremacy and hall occupation, have raised numerous questions in the people's minds, and further raised the concern of the guardians and made the whole situation bleak. Consequently, Sheikh Hasina stepped down from the position of BCL's organisational head. The retreat of Sheikh Hasina from the organizational responsibility of the Chhatra League has put it in uncertainty. The guardian-less Chhatra League may consequently become much more reckless, unbridled and arrogant. Through reforming the organisational structure, developing qualitative leadership by council, setting up committees of different educational institutions, the Hasina led government can bring back stability and peace to the educational institutions. //////I would like to draw the attention of the honourable minister for housing about the sloppiness of Rajuk in managing their land projects. I applied for a piece of land in the Uttara Third Phase project in early 2004 along with many other university professors. With lot of uncertainties in the era of alliance government and the caretaker government, Rajuk finally sent us letters indicating their decision to allocate us land in the middle of 2008, 4 years after the submission of application!! Accordingly, I paid the amount for the first instalment by 30th of September, 2008. We were advised that the actual letter of allotment with the plot number would be given to us soon. Unfortunately, no further communication was made by Rajuk yet. In the meantime, Rajuk has called for another application for land for their Uttara and Purbanchal projects. //////In the United Kingdom if a mobile phone is lost or stolen and the matter is reported to the mobile phone service provider, the SIM of the lost mobile phone is deactivated. The mobile phone itself is locked and cannot be reused by any other person. In Bangladesh scores of mobile phone are lost or snatched away by muggers every day. It has taken an epidemic form.//////With the development of market economy throughout the world, the importance of income tax as the source of income of the government is increasing.//////Nobody is above the law. Is the Bangla proverb true? It is not, at least not in Bangladesh.//////The letter entitled Deprived Students published on 5 April in this page drew my attention. Thanks to the anonymous students for writing it. I strongly support their demand. I was also a student of the chemistry department of Chittagong University and received my MS degree last year. Students of this department are not only deprived of all sorts of technological facilities but also practical knowledge, which is the key criterion in the job market. The laboratories of this department have no modern apparatus. Scarcity of essential chemicals and equipments are a very common phenomenon here. So what is the consequence? Students' research activities are badly affected and they complete their course without sufficient practical knowledge. As a result, they cannot survive in a job race. Can anybody believe that even without a UV-spectrometer, this department gives Ph.D certificate? Our research students pursue their task in BCSIR lab or elsewhere. Most of our teachers are indifferent in this regard. //////With all opinion polls pointing to a hung parliament, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seems to be keeping ruling Congress party's option open for an alliance with Left parties after the Lok Sabha elections.//////For many Indian voters, casting their ballots yesterday was a gesture of defiance against militants, tribal guerrillas and Maoist rebels intent on disrupting the world's largest democratic exercise.//////Ridiculing its allies RJD, LJP and SP, which have formed the 'Fourth Front', Congress has said these parties would act as spoilers and help BJP by dividing the secular votes.//////Sri Lanka said yesterday it had made fresh advances into the area still held by Tamil Tiger rebels, ignoring global calls for a truce to spare thousands of civilians trapped by the fighting.//////UN nuclear experts ordered to leave by North Korea amid an escalating standoff over the regime's recent rocket launch departed the country Thursday.//////US Senator John Kerry is sceptical about the US aid being put to thwart the terror activities in the tribal areas of Pakistan as he considers the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) too violent and ungovernable to benefit from the financial assistance.//////President Barack Obama Thursday urged Cuba to show signs of change, as the United States and its communist neighbour work on warming up relations after a half century of strained Cold War ties.//////Japan promised up to one billion dollars in aid to Pakistan yesterday on the eve of a Tokyo donors meeting expected to raise at least four times that amount for the poor and crisis-riven country.//////A suicide bomber disguised in army uniform blew himself up at an Iraqi military base as soldiers queued for lunch yesterday, killing at least 16 troops and wounding 50, officials said.//////An Indian court yesterday appointed a new lawyer to represent the only Islamist militant suspect captured during last year's attacks on Mumbai.//////Nepal's Maoist-led government is set to begin the reinvestigation into the controversial 2001 royal massacre of King Birendra and 10 members of his family after the coalition partners agreed to the constitution of a probe panel.//////The Israeli president has told President Barack Obama's Mideast envoy there is no military solution to the threat caused by Iran's nuclear programme and talk of Israeli plans to attack nuclear facilities there are "unfounded."//////The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the release of Bharatiya Janata Party leader Varun Gandhi on parole for a period of two weeks after it received an undertaking from him that he would not indulge in communally sensitive and hate speeches. //////Thailand's fugitive former leader Thaksin Shinawatra now has a Nicaraguan passport, complicating efforts to extradite him, as Thai authorities pressed ahead yesterday with a search for his supporters accused of leading violent riots in Bangkok.//////The Marma community celebrated 'Sangrai" in Chittagong Hill Tracts with much enthusiasm and fanfare.//////A 'Barsho-boron Probhati' programme was held at Judge Court Compound in Thakurgaon on the first day of the Bangla year 1416. //////International French Drama Festival 2009, featuring eight popular French plays translated in Bengali, is on at the National Theatre Stage, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA).

Boro cultivation, the mainstay for food security, received a boost with a message going out to the peasantry that it is in character with the new government to be friendly and caring to them. //////SOMETHING there is that we have learned from the Americans. And they of course got it from the late lamented John F. Kennedy. The first hundred days of a government, these Americans (and by now many non-Americans around the planet) believe, is a good hint of how it will fare in the future. If that is a good barometer for judging performance, why must we fall behind as the Awami League grand alliance completes a hundred days in office? Let us be judges too, not of the whole government as such but of some individual ministers insofar as their performance, or the lack of it, is concerned.//////WHILE one goes about assessing the government's performance in its one hundred days in office, no single issue with the potential of having grave impact on the country's integrity than the sad and despicable events of February 25 and 26 catches one's imagination more. //////The present government took office with the vision of creating digital Bangladesh.
