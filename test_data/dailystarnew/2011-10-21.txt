What a revelation! As if our people know nothing about the World Bank's findings. As if the World Bank has not already made its position public. As if we in the media have not printed the contents of the World Bank's letter to our government. As if her ministers have not already commented on the matter over the past few weeks. As if the Asian Development Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) have not already made public their positions.//////With the introduction of the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) at the Narayanganj City Corporation polls, the Election Commission (EC) faces one of its toughest challenges in training and convincing voters to adopt the new technology.//////Fifteen Bangladeshis, including three children, are stranded in Sirte, the last Gaddafi stronghold that fell to rebels yesterday.//////Skirting the World Bank's specific allegation against the communications minister centring on Padma Bridge construction, the government yesterday issued a press note urging the bank to withdraw suspension on the bidding for the project.//////Rejecting the prime minister's claim against him, former communications minister Nazmul Huda yesterday said the World Bank has suspended fund for Padma Bridge project due to corruption by the incumbent communications minister.//////Malaysia has proposed financing the much-awaited Padma Bridge construction. //////Bangladesh ranked 122nd out of 183 countries in a survey on the ease of doing business, dropping four places from last year. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday alleged that "a Bangladeshi Nobel laureate" had lobbied the World Bank through a top US official against financing the Padma Bridge project. //////The High Court yesterday issued status quo for two months on the effectiveness of a letter the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) served asking GrameenPhone (GP) to pay Tk 3,034 crore in unpaid revenue and tax. //////Commercial banks yesterday promised to inject fresh funds into the stockmarket.//////Selina Hayat Ivy, a mayoral candidate in the Narayanganj City Corporation polls, yesterday filed a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging violation of electoral code of conduct by her two opponents.//////With elected ward commissioners falling behind in carrying out their responsibilities, it is city dwellers who are taking steps towards ensuring their own security, cleanliness and other civic amenities.//////Detectives early yesterday arrested a Pakistani woman from Shahjalal International Airport and seized fake Indian currency amounting to Rs48,00,000 from her possession.//////Protesting against the government's decision to split Dhaka City Corporation, the main opposition BNP yesterday demanded an immediate election to an undivided DCC.//////Government steps taken to tackle the problems of the economy are isolated and do not consider the overall situation, said Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Distinguished Fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya yesterday.//////The 10 newly appointed additional High Court judges were sworn in yesterday.//////The Indian media has slammed the absence of Paschimbanga Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and local legislators during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Tin Bigha corridor visit Wednesday, terming it as another case of missed opportunity.//////Senior lawmakers of ruling Awami League yesterday demanded trial of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia for her attempt to save those accused of crimes against humanity during the Liberation War.//////Speaker Abdul Hamid said in parliament yesterday he is personally looking into the proposed metro rail line, a portion of which will now run through the parliament complex. //////Thousands of high school students marched in the streets of the Turkish capital yesterday to denounce the killing of 24 soldiers by Kurdish rebels, and the military pressed ahead with its air and ground offensive against the insurgents across the Iraqi border.//////Our sense of disbelief is being stretched a little too far. When Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina tells the nation that the responsibility for the on-going scandal around the Padma Bridge project is for the past BNP government to bear, we wonder if she really thinks Bangladesh's people will take her at her word. Again, when leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia tells us that a few rightwing politicians now in prison on charges of war crimes actually committed no such crimes during the Liberation War, we are left astounded at the way in which she tries to serve up new history to us. No words can be strong enough to condemn such an assessment of history from the two individuals who have held centre stage in national politics since the early 1980s. Both Hasina and Khaleda know that what they say are unvarnished untruths. Must they do it? Why must their rhetoric be of such a dismal kind as to leave us all raising questions about their political judgement?//////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to the Dahagram-Angorpota enclaves since the recent opening of the Tin Bigha corridor for 24 hours to connect with the mainland is a cheering piece of news. Two important Indian ministers joined her to usher in a new phase in the neighbourly relations. Our prime minister heralded the change by providing the enclaves with electricity and opening an upazila office.//////To start as the eighth Bangladesh Test captain Mushfiqur Rahim can and possibly

Right now it is the choice between the smooth establishment of the Metro and an old airport being used by the BAF.

A girl was stabbed 15 times at a bazaar in public. No one appeared to stop or catch the killers, and no one even took the girl to a hospital when the killers went away. They refused to testify against the murderers during police investigation. It reminded me of an incident that occurred in our country a few years back. A businessman killed a helper of a bus in public. Therefore, he was beaten to death by public. Now, the only question that comes to my mind is, why didn't the public in India take any action against the criminals during the girl's murder? After the incident took place, Indian people staged a huge procession demanding justice and created pressure on the police through media. The interesting thing is that in our country public don't wait for the police to come and take action against the criminals, instead they take law in their own hands. It was the Indian police who solved the case brilliantly, tracked down the killers and found out their motive behind the killing.//////I applied for primary shares (IPO) of MI Cement and MJL Bangladesh in January 2011 from my Dhaka address through BRAC Bank Eskaton branch, but I did not get allotment of shares from any of the Public Limited Companies (PLCs).

In "The World According to Garp," Walt asked: "Daddy, what's gradual school?" Garp replied: "Oh, gradual school is where you go to school and you gradually find out you don't want to go to school anymore." Nearly three years into the office of nation's top diplomat, Dipu Moni is behaving like someone fresh out of the gradual school of diplomacy. She doesn't wish to be diplomatic anymore.//////The American mainstream media is gradually beginning to pay attention to the Occupy Wall Street movement and its spinoffs springing up in Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and Seattle. But from the very beginning the movement has attracted extensive coverage from Al Jazeera and other Middle Eastern news outlets and Twitter usersprobably because they recognise the forces that are reshaping politics across their region. //////This is easily a new low that both our top leaders have hit in their exchange of derisive comments. Into the halfway point of opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia's road march, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had this to say: "How can she (Begum Zia) be so sure about winning the election if it's held under caretaker government, she could even land up in jail?" She didn't realise that by one such utterance she spoiled much of the appreciation for her hands-off approach to let the road march be, that has been otherwise making rounds.//////When we hear the word agriculture, we think about farming.

There is huge scope for investment in backward and forward linkages in the agriculture sector.//////English as a language has always been a dreadful thing for our children. One obvious reason is that it is a foreign language. The other reason is probably that it has never been taught the way it should be taught as a foreign language. The obvious reason for this is that there has always been acute shortage of proper English teachers. //////I have an iPhone 3GS, simply love it and bought it a year and a half back.
