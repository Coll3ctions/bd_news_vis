Coral reefs are home to over 25 percent of all marine life and are among the world's most fragile and endangered ecosystems. Coral reef is a mound-like structure built by tiny animal corals, mainly composed of calcium carbonate. There are two types of coral, hard and soft. The actual architects of coral reef are hard corals, which are referred to as reef-building corals. Corals are sessile animals, meaning they are not mobile but stay fixed to one place. Soft corals do not build reef.//////Arsenic in ground water was detected in Bangladesh more than a decade ago when the country had just achieved more than 95% coverage in supplying safe drinking water in the rural areas and making available irrigation water for the high yielding variety crops. More or less that was a win-win situation for drinking and irrigation water in the rural areas. But this achievement was outshined after the detection of arsenic in the ground water. Basically arsenic is a natural water contaminant originated from naturally occurring sulfide ores. It has a geological origin. The main source are the arsenic containing rocks from the Himalayas which were taken out by torrents of water and washed down by the rivers to the low lying areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. These had been getting deposited together with sand, silt and clay for thousands of years forming a part of aquifers that have been releasing the poison today. Arsenic is a hazardous material and recent studies showed that it is a carcinogen, reportedly responsible for lung and skin cancers. //////Ever been to the hills?

That may be true, since one needs a good cup of coffee before one can do anything on a cold frosty morning. However, my experience has been that this country also runs on spoken words. At work, on radio shows, at supermarkets, on the phone, at social events, in politics, or anywhere when people connect with each other, spoken words is a key ingredient, the electrons that keeps our life moving. In our everyday life, we also often engage in small talk, water cooler conversations, as it is sometimes called. //////Cancer kills more people than any other disease. More than 70 percent of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh. Experts say that about 30 percent of cancer deaths can be prevented.

But then, when has it ever been in that category? Judging by the wide nature of Rizwanul Islam's reflections on the subject, indeed on the whole concept of development economics as it encompasses the globe as a whole, you would think there is yet much to know about the subject. And you do learn, for in this work the writer brings together a whole set of perspectives on economic theory, or theories as the case may be, that will appeal to readers. But, first, a charming little caveat. The work is in essence a series of observations that take an entire international community into consideration rather than focusing on a region or, more specifically, a country. //////The English translation of the Bangla novel Vyasa by the powerful writer Shahzad Firdous (b. 1950) from West Bengal is no doubt a praiseworthy achievement in the translation arena of Bangladesh.
