In Bangladesh, the judgement of the Supreme Court nullifying the fifth amendment to the constitution must be considered one significant means by which history can be restored to its natural course or must be made to move in a direction that will uphold the interest of the nation. //////PRIME Minister Sheikh Hasina's warning that wrongdoers, who, she believes, have infiltrated into the Awami League and its front bodies would not be able to get away with their criminal activities. While it is appreciable that she wants to cut the deviant elements to size, we would like to add in the same breath that such warning rings hollow at a time when workers of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) are involved in unlawful activities like toll collection, tender and admission business and so on. They have also been found running in hot pursuit of their fellow members brandishing firearms over sharing of the spoils or establishing sphere of influence as it happened at the Jahangir Nagar University in recent times. //////Star batsman Sachin Tendulkar hit 203 and debutant Suresh Raina made 120 as India bettered Sri Lanka's run-spree in the high-scoring second Test on Thursday.//////The emergence of Imrul Kayes as an assured presence over the summer is as much a revelation as Tamim Iqbal's assertiveness since 2007.//////Eoin Morgan led England to 190 for four at tea after Pakistan took two wickets in quick succession on the first day of the first Test at Trent Bridge here on Thursday.//////The newly-retired umpire Rudi Koertzen has called for the decision review system to be included in every Test series after he bowed out with a tour that did not feature the UDRS.

Humayun Miah's father-in-law Abdul Quadir filed a case on the same day accusing the five people. Although police failed twice to unearth the reason behind the murder but they submitted the final report. At this the complainant raised 'Naraji' against the police report.

The wheels of the bureaucracy are grinding to a standstill. Many of them do not work sincerely. They are more interested in using their positions for personal gains. //////Recently the government took some steps to remove transports older than 20 years from mega city Dhaka. The end result is, thousands of passengers are seen waiting for their vehicle to move to their respective destinations which doesn't end within less than two hours. Especially, the female job holders are the worst sufferers from the day the transport removal mission started. The owners of various transport companies are staying away from their business for the last few days to avoid such subtraction of their vehicles and waiting for the present government pressure to go off, causing the situation to further deteriorate. From the Daily Prothom Alo, I came to know the grievances of the factory employees, arriving mostly from rural areas, as they are not able to reach their workplaces in time.//////The other day my wife had gone to the Kushal centre grocery market in Uttara sector # 3 to do daily shopping but when she reached near the Rajlaxmi complex from sector # 5 the on duty policeman stopped her rickshaw and told her that she could not go further. On inquiring my wife was told that the whole stretch of the by-lane has been made off limit for the rickshaws because now this road has become a VIP road and only cars are allowed to ply this road. My wife asked who made the road VIP and she further said that so far she knew this street had been purposefully constructed for rickshaws only. The policeman said.  I don't know. I am just obeying the orders of my superiors. //////An interesting front page article on the matter published on 19th July rightly stated that BERC only passes time by issuing ineffective circulars, wasting public time and money! In effect, it is not worth the paper in which it is written! Mere circulars cannot regulate the minimum temperature at which an air conditioner can be set! Better would be to install sealed thermostatic limit-switches, set at the minimum temperature desired. One wonders if BERC has the technical and organisational capability to do it.//////On June 17, 2010 Chittagong City election was held and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party backed M Monjurul Alam won the race. The election has been termed free, fair and the votes declared that they were not intimidated and no irregularities have been seen.//////Some people have been using their nick names so rampantly that it is now on the verge of abuse. This is because of their ignorance about the purpose and reason of using nicknames. //////From the income year 2010-11, the government has imposed tax @10% on the interest earnings from the saving certificates. This decision will reduce the net income of the investors and cause a lot of sufferings to the people who are dependant solely on this income. On the other hand, it will also reduce the number of votes in favour of the government nominated candidates for the up coming Union Parishad, Pourashava and City Corporation elections. So, for the sake of the people as well as for the government itself, such type of tax should be withdrawn immediately.//////In recent years, all the inventions that promise to make our life on this earth easier are from life sciences. Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology is the most remarkable field in this regard. Biotechnology ensures sustainable development. Just a few days back, Bangladeshi scientist Dr. Maksudul Alam made a breakthrough in elucidating the genome sequence of jute. It reflects the prospect of biotechnology in our national economy, health, environment etc. But unfortunately extensive research and studies are not done on biotechnology in all the universities. Research in this field is very expensive and requires proper patronization from the govt. Private sector investment needs to be encouraged. Most private universities run courses on BBA, MBA, computer science and other commercial fields. So the govt. should make it mandatory for private universities to conduct research and studies on Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering. Thus biotechnology will surely contribute to the development of Bangladesh.//////Finally, the Bangladeshi kingmakers and kingship breakers are, presumably, heading to face some music. Historically, Bangladeshi bureaucrats have never faced any major punishment except few stand-by transfers, temporary sackings, mild reprimand, stoppage of promotions for time being, idled as OSD etc. The highest punishment, we have heard, were few forced retirements for gross misconducts.//////Bangladesh is a country that is geographically very important in South Asian map. For its over population and as a developing country, the South Asian terrorists usually hide in the remote areas of the country, especially the hilly areas. The Indian, Pakistani and Burmese terrorists hide in safe places for the planning terror attacks. Recently ULFA leader Major Ranjon was arrested with an associate from Kishoreganj by Rab. This is not the first time but a regular process. Last year the ULFA chief Arbindo Rajkhwa was arrested from Chittagong. After a few days the Indian Media said that, Arbindo surrendered to the police, but Arbindo told the reporters that he did not surrender. //////The Daily Amar Desh, a Bengali newspaper of Bangladesh, has survived through a historical verdict of the Appellate Division of Bangladesh Supreme Court. The government cancelled the Declaration of the newspaper and stopped its publication on June 1, 2010 because of the absence of a legal publisher. The High Court Division of Bangladesh Supreme Court stayed the decision of the government for three months. The Appellate Division upheld the judgment of the High Court Division on 18 July, 2010.//////It is indeed very disheartening to note that an elected government of the people is so inconsiderate towards its retired employees. With effect from July 01, 2010, the government has reduced the interest rates on PSCs knowing very well that this benefit goes only to the retired govt. employees, their families and widows. On the one hand, it is offering tax exemptions to certain privileged classes to the tune of crores of taka and on the other hand, it is depriving the old retired government employees of a meagre amount, so essential to them for their survival at this age with the ever increasing prices. I as a sufferer would, therefore, humbly request the Honourable Finance Minister to please reconsider his decision and restore the earlier interest rates of PSC, to offer some relief to the old retired government employees who dedicated the best part of their lives to serving the government with their meagre incomes of yesteryears.//////The government of Bangladesh, in its national budget FY 10-11, has imposed a 4.5% VAT on all Fees and Charges payable to the private universities. I studied at Dhaka University and I had to pay only Taka 12 in a month and after 25 years a Dhaka university student has to pay Taka 25/- in a month whereas a private university student is paying Tk.7000/ to Tk.18000/ per month depending on the university. I admit that quality of education of some private universities is not good but many private universities are providing quality education to thousands of students. Some private universities have adopted better education system than the existing system of education and started research to solve national problems. After passing students are contributing to the nation in various ways. Many of them went abroad to do job and are sending foreign currencies to enrich our foreign currency reserves. So why this injustice to them? Many people have a misconception that only sons and daughters of very rich people study at private universities. I have seen many guardians of my students paying tuition fees by selling their land.//////Proper conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources (PGR) is essential for universal food security. Wild and cultivated plant species, landraces and genetically improved genotypes of economically important food and industrial crops constitute invaluable pools of genes for crop improvement and diversification. Tolerance to drought, salt, heat and cold and resistance to pests and diseases are highly desirable and valuable traits in crop improvement programmes. The need to amplify world food production can only be met by appropriate management and use of elevated quality PGRs, required for the improvement of better-adapted and higher-yielding cultivars. //////Thailand's premier said yesterday he would end emergency rule in six provinces but maintain the strict laws in Bangkok, where a weekend bomb blast rekindled tensions in the wake of deadly street protests.//////The United States should alter policy to take account of China's role as a major player on the world stage if it wants to avoid friction and instability, a major state newspaper said yesterday.//////Iran will suspend uranium enrichment to 20 percent if it acquires nuclear fuel for a research reactor, the country's atomic chief said on an Iranian television channel yesterday.//////The Arab League has declined to endorse an immediate resumption of direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, saying it needs further guarantees from the United States before approving talks.//////A Japanese appeals court yesterday ordered the government to pay 4.2 million dollars to residents living near a US base on Okinawa island to compensate them for military aircraft noise.//////South Korean Prime Minister Chung Un-Chan offered to quit yesterday to take responsibility for the government's failure to win parliamentary approval for a key development project.//////Sri Lanka's former army chief and defeated presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka was brought before the Colombo High Court yesterday to answer charges of provoking violence.//////Pakistan has strongly criticised David Cameron, the British prime minister, for his remark that Islamabad should not "promote the export of terror".//////UK Prime Minister David Cameron has defended his comments about Pakistan's record on tackling terrorism as he continued his trip to India.//////Pakistan is observing a day of national mourning following the country's worst-ever air disaster.//////Attackers killed at least 12 people and wounded 31 in a series of shootings and explosions across Iraq yesterday, police and hospital sources said.//////A two daylong music festival begins today at TSC auditorium of Dhaka University (DU).

For the past 35 years the party has stood tall, casting its ominous shadow over the political landscape, untouched and untouchable.//////IT is said that rural people share an old system of beliefs among them, which is rooted to the land, drawing their sense of pride and purpose from hard physical work. That being what it is, it translates into what is largely known as the Peasant Philosophy. By and large, a peasant expects his son to grow up to be a peasant and stay close to his land.//////We have sat down today to ask a bunch of "why's" after seeing events surrounding VAT on private university education unfold in the last few days, and the eventual repeal of the government's decision. //////AFTER the recent Nimtoli fire, someone on the Unheard Voices blog commented: "Look at the reaction after the fire, endless grief but no demand for accountability from the citizens."
