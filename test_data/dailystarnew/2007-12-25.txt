It cannot but raise our eyebrows to find that objects of great historical value were stolen from what should have been flawless security arrangements and from our very doorstep, and not in any foreign land. Given that the government's plan to send these items for display at a Paris museum had raised concerns about their safety from a section in the country, more caution should have been taken to say the least, to ensure the protection of these very valuable relics of our history and culture. //////A brilliant star in the sky over Bethlehem more than two thousand years ago pointed to the birth of Jesus Christ and hinted at the colossal impact he would have on the fate of mankind. For Jesus brought to men and women all across the globe, at a time when imperial Rome was in decline, the message that faith in God was all, that morality was the essence of the creed that ultimately mattered. Like every other prophet before him, he was ridiculed by men of lesser intelligence and little wisdom. Persecuted in all forms and in all manner, Jesus Christ nevertheless persisted in spreading the message that God loved all His creations, that indeed he, Jesus, was the chosen one to disseminate His message to all men and women.//////IN Bangla there is a proverb: //////, which means "you may have seen a ghughu bird, but you have not seen the trap laid for it."

Judging by the tension on the faces of politicians, no one really believes either the polls or the exit polls. Even the bookies, who were certain the BJP would get a majority, began to cover their bets just before results were due. The miracle of a genuine election is the secrecy of public opinion. A friend who met Narendra Modi after the last ballot had been cast found him a bit withdrawn, a little less than his ebullient sarcastic self. If Modi cannot be sure of what is lying in those electronic machines, you can bet that no one else is certain. //////THERE was a time not long ago when Japanese investors were roving restlessly around the world with pockets-full of money, and many in Japan believed that the inflated purse the country was holding would allow them to get hold of everything they desired. While corporate Japan was busy buying all it could, ranging from landmark buildings to movie distribution companies, top executives of many Japanese companies were pondering upon art and culture with the hope of getting hold of everything they thought rare and valuable. The result was a skyrocketing of price in art auctions being held regularly in major cities around the world.//////Stephen Fleming has warned New Zealand not to take Bangladesh for granted in the upcoming ODI and Test series.
