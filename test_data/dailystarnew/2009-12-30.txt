The shock takes an even more acute form when she describes all the killings that have gone on as acts of self-defence on the part of the security forces. We would like to point out here, in the clearest and most unambiguous manner, that in the past many years these deaths from so-called crossfires have given the country a bad name. What now makes these deaths extremely regrettable is the fact that the Awami League, before it rode to power at the general elections a year ago, had strongly made clear its opposition to 'crossfire' deaths and had indeed pledged to put an end to them.//////A national dialogue focused on open market acid sell in Bangladesh organised by ActionAid on Sunday ended up being a fairly comprehensive discourse on acid violence. It has not only been a revealing statistical update but also a fairly diagnostic analysis suggesting some antidotes worth applying against the social malady. The statistics are simply hair-raising: we have it on the authority of the executive director of Acid Survivors' Foundation that 3,000 cases of acid-related violence were reported during last 10 years in the country. This works out to an average of almost one victim per day. But these are reported incidents, and with the unreported ones added, the magnitude is simply appalling! Yet the more horrific reality is that only 10 percent of perpetrators ever get punished.//////There is no end to the surprises that our politicians keep piling on our doorsteps. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which has never seen any reason to say sorry for its bad governance between 2001 and 2006, now has happily made it known to the country that henceforth Begum Khaleda Zia will be its chairperson without anyone being able to challenge her on the leadership question. The amended party constitution makes this much obvious. //////One year's performance is not enough to evaluate the achievement of a regime that is to continue for 5 years. Furthermore, the present elected government assumed power from a government without accountability.

Day Saving Time has become a sore point for everybody, particularly the young mothers and children. One wonders whether it has been imposed on us by a third country. Otherwise, why the govt should be so stubborn despite the fact that majority of the people are against it. We are now one and a half hour ahead of India which means our international business closes 90 minutes early if the office time is up to 5:00pm in India. This provides more business opportunities for our competitors in the neighbouring countries. This is also funny to note that a cabinet meeting is needed to say 'no' or 'yes' to such a small issue. //////It was a ridiculous remark that the former prime minister of Britain, Tony Blair, made a few days back to the world media. He supported the attack on Iraq!!//////Nursing is a noble profession. The service of a nurse is very important and essential for society. When a sick or wounded person comes to a hospital, nurses look after him carefully. In wartime their services are more important and essential. Once the job of nursing was looked upon with disdain.

I was looking for a word of remorse or regret in the reams of statements by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on the Liberhan Commission's Report on demolition of the Babri Masjid and on the stepping down of L.K.Advani from the office of opposition leader in the Lok Sabha. But I was disappointed. Not that I was expecting a change of heart in the party. Yet I imagined that some leaders, at least from among the young who are supposed to have taken over the reins of the party, would feel sorry for the masjid's destruction and the killing of hundreds in the wake. It would have sent a message that the BJP was trying to shake off its past and paving a new path of conciliation and consensus.//////
