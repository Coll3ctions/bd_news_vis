A much-needed infrastructure link when materializing, instead of paying desired dividends, turns out to be counter-productive.

Since the days in Dhaka University when Jack Nicholson won the Best Actor award for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, we have been Oscar-addicts. We not only try to see all the pictures nominated both before and after Oscar Night, but also follow the careers of the actors and actresses who catch our fancy.

Last year move for building mosque at Ground Zero is another step in this process. President Obama defended the right of the Muslims to build a 13 storey cultural center and a mosque to be named Cordoba House. This decision raised the wave of condemnation; flurry of loath from mass people across the US. In protests Americans depicted their view points regarding the issue with racial; anti-Islamic beliefs. One placard had - 'Mosques breed radical Islam, Radical Islam breeds terrorists' and below that 'Not all Muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are Muslims'. In fact the reactions from Americans on these issues are the indicator of their mindset on the question of Islam or the role of the US in Middle East. Surely we didn't forget that though Mr. G. W. Bush invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 he didn't loose his presidentship. He was reelected by those Americans. Hence, it can be assumed that events had been taken place for last few years by the US government in Middle East and by Americans within the US has a common trait or a common tendency of Islamophobia.

It is the same with the Hay-on-Wye festival that you wish you could be part of every May in Britain. There is then the Kolkata Book Fair that many of us would not want to miss, given that Kolkata remains a symbol of Bengali intellectual attainment on both sides of the political frontier. Here in Dhaka, you could safely venture to suggest, the Ekushey Book Fair has increasingly been turning into a defining aspect of life in this free republic of Bangladesh.
