The very fact that 56 rooms at the headquarters in Dhaka were left ransacked, along with a theft of documents from the Chittagong office, gives every indication of its being an inside job carried out to near perfection by those involved. The question naturally arises, therefore, of what might have motivated the perpetrators of the act. And the answer, in all likelihood, is that the break-in was related to sweeping dirty linen under the rug. Important documents, are said to be missing from Dhaka and Chittagong offices.

And when it comes to mosques, or similar places of worship, it is your shoes that must stay in the right place. In cultures across the world, shoes are often an apt symbol of disrespect that you must not demonstrate beyond what is absolutely necessary. Certainly, you will not, you must not use it in mosques. You take them off, until such time when your interaction with the Lord of the Universe is over and you are ready to go back home, shoes back on your feet.//////THE term war criminal is a generic term.

Once they begin, the hardship still does not convince farmers to switch to other crops, due both to lack of awareness and knowledge of cultivating other crops and inability to have loans and other services, including assistance in selling the crop. Through the aggressive activities of the tobacco companies, a farmer is coaxed into tobacco farming simply by watching his neighbour graduate out of poverty after cultivating this crop. Such a demonstration effect could be achieved for other crops as well. //////In this ruthless world we repeatedly witness events which are too distressing to be described in words and clichs. Even in this enlightened era, sophisticated brutality frequently reigns over the trampled emblem of humanity as the civilized world turns deaf to the desperate calls of the oppressed. The harrowing pictures of the Gaza carnage everyday remind us of this unacceptable and yet inescapable axiom. It's easy for political analysts to put responsibilities on several factions while seating in luxury cabins. World leaders, who have been silent for long, are now engaged in formulating complicated reconciliation schemes, instead of taking immediate pragmatic initiatives. The international community is engrossed in its pursuit of the hard facts while concrete actions are needed to end the gloomy misery of a confined race dying hopelessly. I guess today only the innocuous Palestinians who are being brutalized mercilessly can sense the concrete 'hard facts'. The hard fact for them is that as the civilized world silently watches they have to count the bloodstained bodies of their infants and endure the merciless Zionist butchery. //////I totally disagree with the editorial of January 19.

Why should my every walk to the store be akin to a stroll through a parking lot? Why should that majority be subject to the many costs and risks to health and safety attendant on the private car? --The Ethicist, a weekly column in the New York Times Magazine (July 27, 2003) //////Nowadays the mobile phone is inextricably linked to our daily life. However, because of some unscrupulous people it becomes a headache for our general people.

'Teasing' is one of them, which even results in ending a girl's life. //////After the change over of one-eleven there emerged many shushil shamaj members who were not much known to the public before. They suddenly surfaced and started imparting knowledge to the public including the members of caretaker government as invited participants of talk shows from all quarters like retired bureaucrats, army generals, lawyers, teachers, politicians and leaders of some business organisations, associations etc. We remember the suggestions of forming a national government, constitutional hazards created by taking over of power by the CTG and its legality and of course, their remedial suggestions. //////I am pleased to witness the landslide win by the Awami League over the shamelessly corrupt BNP and their allies. This victory of the masses is a huge defeat for the anti-liberation forces. After the win by Obama here in the US, this is the icing on the cake for me.

The 'Freedom Track' was coming to and end. Having started his journey in Oslo, Norway on November 24, 2008, photographer Tom Hatlestad drove for 55 days and crossed about 14,750 km for the project 'Freedom Track' (an inquiry on freedom) for 'Chobi Mela V' and had finally reached Dhaka. //////Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy organised a solo musical soiree featuring Bhawaiya singer Shafiul Alam Raja.

He's credited as the founding father of detective fiction, a master of the macabre, the namesake inspiration for the mystery world's premier annual award, and perhaps the first proper full-time freelance writer. This second son of an acting couple might well feel a mix of puffed-up pride and mystification at the celebratory atmosphere if he were alive to witness it. He spent most of his life cobbling together a living out of the scraps of poetic and prose publication, sporadically climbing the mountain of literary acclaim (as with "The Raven" in 1845) only to plunge anew into penury, a state he remained in until his death.//////The sixth episode of drama serial "Roud Brishtir Shohorey" will be aired tonight on ATN Bangla at 9:20pm.

It was yet another indication that Barack Obama represents a tidal change in American politics.//////THIS is a different person altogether, it would seem! The daughter of Bangabandhu has finally come of age and has put her colleagues on notice. She has sent out clear signals: intolerance to corruption; an inclusive polity where the opposition will be allowed to play its role in Parliament; a bold, new cabinet filled with energy and enthusiasm, even if lacking in experience; a vision for the future commensurate with our democratic ambitions and economic goals. //////WHEREAS children's participation in the development process is recognised, the recognition of their participation in disaster risk reduction is a rising concern. Although much attention is given to the needs of children in emergencies, it is mostly from the perspective of adults acting on behalf, and in the best interest, of children. //////OKAY, so you've lost your job, you're about to lose your home, your investments have vanished, your partner has left you, and the debt collectors have given you a week to live.

The deep green plant of the cabbage family, resembling common cauliflower, was once available only in posh superstores. However, it has slowly made its way to be sold by street vendors.
