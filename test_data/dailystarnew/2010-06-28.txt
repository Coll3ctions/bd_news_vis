Several opposition activists were arrested including some top ranking BNP leaders in the capital city. There were sporadic clashes between the police and the pickets, but no major incident of violence was reported till the time of writing. The presence of the law enforcers in the Dhaka streets was huge and overwhelming and they used batons to prevent hartal supporters from taking control of the situation at different points. It was almost a repetition of that familiar police versus pickets skirmishes that we witnessed many times during hartals in the past. //////The home ministers' meeting of SAARC, held recently in Islamabad, has agreed to set up a regional police force modeled on the INTERPOL, to tackle transnational crimes in the region.

I find the efforts of the EC to deliver a free and fair poll have been appreciated. There was also the contrary view and criticism that the EC has robbed this democratic exercise of franchise with the citizens' committee, stripping the festival of democracy of its vibrancy, Does the Commission deserve this reprobation? I am afraid not. So a stringent law is enacted perhaps with full knowledge that like others this would fall by the wayside at the time of implementation. This syndrome is aptly called the 'culture of impunity.' No wonder, there is consternation, a cry of anguish, and an accusation of throttling of democracy, as the stringency of the law hits home only when the EC asks for and monitors its implementation without exception!//////June 17th will be a significant day for the jute industry in Bangladesh.//////I have followed the articles in your paper regarding the protection of wetlands which I find a very responsible thing to do, but my concern is that by closing these private developments we will further the gap between the rich and poor in our country, if DAP is implemented the prices of available land/houses will go up three times. And those people who already have one or to houses in Dhaka city will become richer, (including those who are adamant to close down these private companies). Then who will listen to the plight of masses of middle class? //////You told me how to live and let me watch how you live. I always try to follow your footsteps and so that I can be like you. And I believe I will neither be disappointed nor be discouraged, rather I will acquire a great deal.//////The country's oldest English newspaper - The Bangladesh Observer died after prolonged legal and financial illness on June 08, 2010 following shutting down of its operation by the owners. It was 60. Starting its publication as The Pakistan Observer in 1949, the prestigious daily broadsheet encountered so many problems including ban on publication. The Bangladesh Observer left behind numerous reputed journalists (whom it brought up), ardent readers and subscribers, writers and admirers to mourn its death. They expressed profound shock and sympathy at the sad demise of the well-circulated newspaper. They prayed for the re-birth of the newspaper. //////The finance minister quite rightly refused to disclose details about the possible whitening of money by the former prime minister and her two sons, under the Income Tax Ordinance of 1984, preventing the disclosure of such information about Taxpayers' whitening of undisclosed money. (The BNP insisted she whitened white money. Why would she want to do that? Does she also send her fresh laundry out for further laundering?) //////In my experience, the general consensus amongst people I have encountered and the countries I have visited, the 'Americans are fat and not that intelligent'.//////How many times do you need to change the education policy of a nation to get it right? I simply can't understand why every ruling party thinks that changing something is the solution to all sorts of problems. You are changing the syllabus, the curriculum, the question patterns of the board exams, but what about the teachers? Are they comfortable with the new system? I don't believe. And who are being affected by that? The students, the feet on which the future Bangladesh will stand. //////The "O" and "A" level exams are patently very important for the students who have a dream to go abroad for higher studies and intend to build a bright future. The British Council bears the responsibility to conduct those exams by itself and nominating some other institutions and centres in Dhaka and other cities in our country. Achieving a good result in those exams is a mandatory requirement for admissions in foreign colleges and universities. Seemingly the standard and authenticity of the exams taken by the British Council are highly praised and accepted worldwide.//////According to our Rasul (Pbuh), there is no hermitage in Islam. //////In Bangladesh there are more than one hundred political parties, out of which two major political parties namely the BNP & the Awami League (AL) come to power alternatively since 1991 after restoration of the democratic process . All other parties rally behind these two just to get a small share from their leading parties. The AL is the oldest one and led the liberation war in 1971. The BNP was born after assassination of the father of the nation in 1975. Anyway, this party founder was a freedom fighter who took control of the country during a turmoil which was going on after the assassination of the country's founding leader.//////Our country's educational systems are not well-planned like the other developing or developed countries. We have systems such as Bangla medium, English medium, madrasa education, vocational education etc. //////An unemployed person knows best how much burdensome life can be. This stage of life begins at the end of one's institutional education. Guardians tend to expect these boys or girls to stand on their own. They seem to be reluctant to bear his expenses any more. The unemployed person starts running after a job which hardly comes within his reach. He offers his toil, sweat even blood in pursuit of this. He finds himself in more difficulty when he has to pay Tk 200--300 or even 500 or more as pay order/bank draft/invoice/postal order per application, especially for the govt. jobs along with other hard-to-manage documents. Sometimes it is felt that he has to be involved in another job to collect this money. Because of these shortcomings, the helpless job aspirants miss some good offers and thus fail to appear at the interview though he might have qualified for the post.//////Though there are divergent views about the budget, its emphasis on the power sector is welcomed by all. On the other hand, if anybody expected even a few innovations in budgeting this year, they must have been rather disappointed. The budget has proposed to impose Value Added Tax/VAT on all services. This reminds one of the remarks made by Sir Winston Churchill. //////Nowadays coaching centres are growing like mushrooms around the famous schools in Dhaka city. Most of the teachers who teach Math, English and Science have individual coaching centres or batches. Guardians and students are not actually interested in going to coaching centres but the teachers persuade them to go there by providing notes, sheets and short suggestions before exams. Finally, the teacher gives them more marks. As a result, students and teachers cannot concentrate fully during class time. //////Police made more than 500 arrests after black-clad demonstrators broke off from a crowd of peaceful protesters at the global economic summit and went on a rampage in downtown Toronto that lasted into the early morning hours, authorities said yesterday.//////Sri Lanka's former peacebroker Norway arranged the surrender of leading Tamil Tiger rebels who were later found shot dead, according to international development minister Erik Solheim.//////Iran has enough low-enriched uranium to make two weapons, which it could have prepared and ready for delivery as early as 2012, CIA director Leon Panetta warned yesterday.//////The meeting between the three major parties UCPN (Maoist), NC and CPN-UML to find a way out of the protracted political deadlock that has created obstruction in the constitution drafting process including normal business at the legislature parliament has ended inconclusively.//////Indian Home Minister P Chidambaram is known as one of the most erudite minds of the Indian cabinet, something his Pakistani counterpart wholeheartedly endorses.//////The people of violence-wracked Kyrgyzstan voted yesterday on a new constitution just weeks after deadly ethnic purges -- a risky gamble that the interim government hopes will legitimise its power until new elections in October.//////Guinea yesterday held its first free election since independence more than half a century ago, a vote many hope will finally end decades of harsh military rule and launch a new democratic era.//////Authorities in Georgia yesterday tore down another monument to Soviet dictator and native son Josef Stalin.//////Thousands of Lebanese and Palestinian activists were marching in Beirut yesterday in support of social and economic rights for the more than 400,000 Palestinians living in the country's 12 refugee camps.//////At least six militants were killed in a US drone attack in Pakistan's restive northwestern tribal region yesterday, a security official said.//////US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron agreed on Saturday there was nothing to be gained from damaging BP, a British official said after a meeting between the two leaders.//////Pope Benedict has joined mounting Vatican criticism of raids by Belgian police investigating alleged child sex abuse, calling them "deplorable".//////North Korea said yesterday it was ready for direct military talk with South Korea to discuss the sinking of one of Seoul's warships, but only if the armistice commission overseeing the Korean War truce does not get involved.//////A Nato spokesman stressed yesterday that military operations to secure vast areas of Afghanistan would not be delayed by the ouster of the top commander in the war and mounting casualties.//////Palestinian refugees gathered yesterday outside UN headquarters in Beirut to demand basic civil rights in Lebanon, such as a choice of jobs and ownership of property.//////Czech President Vaclav Klaus will name Civic Democrat leader Petr Necas as the next prime minister tomorrow, ushering in what should be the strongest government in a decade to tackle economic reforms.//////Dreams of braking global warming by storing carbon emissions from power plants could be undermined by the risk of leakage, according to a study published yesterday.//////New Prime Minister Julia Gillard signalled a change in the government's approach to population growth yesterday, saying she did not believe in a "big Australia".//////New Prime Minister Julia Gillard signalled a change in the government's approach to population growth yesterday, saying she did not believe in a "big Australia".//////The US has driven al-Qaeda into hiding and undermined its leadership, but is struggling to oust its primary sympathizer, the Taliban, from Afghanistan, the nation's spymaster said yesterday.//////Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay is considered one of the greatest novelists of the sub-continent. The Bengali novel genre practically began with him. He is widely regarded as a key figure in literary renaissance of Bengal as well as undivided India. Some of his writings, including novels, essays and commentaries, were a breakaway from the traditional verse-oriented writings, and provided an inspiration for authors.//////A cultural evening to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. So what's new? In clear contrast to the all too familiar fare of Rabindra Sangeet or a Tagore dance-drama, this time a mesmerised Delhi audience was treated to a performance of 'Tagore through the eyes of folk artists.'//////When it comes to football, the people of our country are true lovers of the game, and I'm no different, said rock star James, as he shared his interest in the World Cup with The Daily Star.//////Political documentaries shadowed by paranoia and apocalyptic foreboding are so commonplace nowadays that South of the Border, Oliver Stone's celebration of the leftward tilt of South American politics, comes as a cheerful surprise. As anyone who remembers JFK, his 1991 film about the Kennedy assassination, can attest, Stone has his own paranoid tendencies, but they are muted in this provocative, if shallow, exaltation of Latin American socialism.//////The five-day 'Theatre Festival-2010' begins at Shilpakala Academy Auditorium in Bogra town today.

In 1974, Bangladesh was the only country in South Asia to enact a maritime law -- the Territorial Waters and Maritime Zones Act.//////THE pessimistic definition of India-Pakistan relations is succinct. The two nations are walking on different pavements on either side of a street that has caved in and become an abyss. The two are always in each other's sights, but there is no meeting point; neither has the psychological or emotional resources to mark out a zebra crossing since the traffic lights cannot be trusted. Nor does the distant horizon bend towards a common focal point.//////
