The reasons remain inexplicable since no theory can satisfactorily explain the quantum leap in prices of essentials that is occurring on a daily basis. It proves right the thesis, which many economists put forward, that economic phenomenon taking place in Bangladesh can seldom be explained by economic theories.//////PRESIDENT Pervez Musharraf plans to call Pakistan's new national assembly into session in the next ten days. That should lay to rest all speculations about his intentions. He has promised to lend his support to the coalition government to be formed by the Pakistan People's Party and Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League. For the first time since the February 18 elections, therefore, Pakistanis can tell themselves that the mist is about to lift and that they can look forward to a new beginning.

Even the new army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, has reassured people that the military will support the efforts for a democratic change in the country.//////IF modernity is described as freeing man from tradition that would effectively mean wrenching human beings from the tranquility of communal life and bestowing upon him or her traits of individualism, then the question can be asked whether it would not mean alienation, in Marxian term, and whether it is at all possible to acquire modernity as individuals are (barring exceptions) irretrievably connected with one another by family, social, national and international bonds. //////INDER Kumar Gujral and Nawaz Sharif, then prime ministers of India and Pakistan, respectively, met at Male during the Saarc summit to discuss how to improve relations between the two countries.

But they also appointed a committee of bureaucrats drawn from both sides to discuss Kashmir. //////IT has become fashionable to talk about the arrival of a multi-polar world, in which the US faces increasing competition from rising powers like Europe, China and India, or resurgent powers like Russia and Japan. Proponents of such a "multi-polar worldview" often claim to hold a "realist" view of international relations. They believe the US should retreat from its ideological crusade and instead engage in a contest for influence with other global "poles" --  la "the Great Game" -- on "unclaimed playgrounds such as Africa or Latin America." //////Bangladesh is believed to be a combative team in limited-overs cricket and that tag perhaps keeps skipper Mohammad Ashraful positive and inspired on the eve of any

Once again our batsmen showed how untrained they are to play in the longer version of the game. Almost all of them chased the balls outside the off stump; they stood still on the crease and regularly fished at the wide balls. There was absolutely no footwork, I think they need to improve a lot with their footwork. Shot selection was also very poor. It seems they can't score runs in singles and couples which is inarguably the most vital thing to build up an innings. There is also a tendency among them to lose their patience after crossing the twenty mark as we've seen them throw their wickets away after reaching the mid twenties or thirties instead of going for a big score. I've also observed when the Tigers go on defence they do nothing other than blocking the ball. Thus the scoreboard comes to a halt, as a result pressure mounts on the batters. To ease things up they need to be more resourceful in defensive batting, they need to find the gaps and keep the scoreboard ticking steadily. We haven't forgotten that South Africa is a very strong team consisting of many top ranking players. I think if the South African batsmen can score double hundreds ours should be able to score fifties if not hundreds.//////A couple of news reports and writings on labour migration has drawn my attention.

Some say that basic education is the road to better life, which others agree to and decide to modify and say that basic education is the core of our business, and we will not let go any opportunity to earn the cash that will move us one step closer to being Bill Gates!! //////The blood-stained 21st February, now recognized as the International Mother Language Day, is the recognition of all languages and cultures of the universe in order to preserve, celebrate and foster the world heritage, especially those on the verge of extinction due to the assault of the all enveloping western culture, branded as satellite culture. //////I am rather disappointed to learn from a news report published in DS on February 11,2008 that the solar power plant installed by the Power Development Board (PDB) at Bagachola village under Barkal upazila in Rangamati at a cost of Tk.8 lakh is virtually of no use because of lack of proper management. The report further said that about Tk.4 lakh is being spent for salary of 29 staffs engaged for the maintenance of the solar projects.//////Looking into banking, one must first consider the advantages and the disadvantages of this particular career, and then decide whether the job will suit his or her individual needs. In general, a career in the banking industry seems extremely hard and very time consuming, and from time to time, has had me contemplating whether or not to major in finance. The type of work demanded is very diverse and seems very interesting, with very high compensation for individual performance. With that in mind, choosing to go into the banking industry could be very rewarding.//////I am proud to be a student of a public university. When I go home, my friends, relatives and others appreciate me. It was my dream to admit myself in a public university and I succeeded. But it is a university without a library, without quality education and without quality teachers. And there is no accommodation facility for the students. Yes, it is our Jagannath University. //////The war on corruption that the government has been waging for over a year seems to have stalled. While some of the notorious political touts are in jail, elimination or reduction of corruption in some important public sectors is not apparent.

I observe certain events which are significant to me. It is an energy which inspires me. Perception leads to conviction. The delicate mesh of the background holds his objects, whether they are birds or cats or the smiling face of a child. One feels the figures are seen in a lonely afternoon, with the coming of nightfall with a wan moon.//////What is the level of freedom an individual enjoys in a state run under dictatorship?

He was Bazlu Bhai to all. Old and young. Bazlu Bhai expired at 11.45 the night before. The breaking news telecast immediately over all electronic media was stunning. Bazlu Bhai was a person whom everyone loved, respected and adored. //////ELECTED governments, to uphold their narrow political interests, remained indifferent to many economic aspects that this government can embark on.
