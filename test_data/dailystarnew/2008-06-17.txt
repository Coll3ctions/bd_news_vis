That is not surprising, seeing that we have been concerned about the situation for years. What now appears to give it a new twist is the result of a survey carried out on some of the rivers, 25 in total. Predictably, the quality of the water in the rivers has dwindled to a precarious state. Worse is the knowledge that some of these rivers may actually have reached a point where they are no longer capable of nurturing or supporting aquatic life forms in them. The pollution in the Buriganga, Turag and Norai -- and these flow by the nation's capital -- has grown to an extent where no life forms can survive in their waters. That is the stark finding by a group of researchers after a three-year survey of the 25 rivers in question. Obviously, the oxygen levels in the Buriganga and in parts of the Turag and Norai have declined to a dangerous level. Where 4 to 6 levels of oxygen are required for local fish species to survive, the oxygen level in these rivers has now declined precipitously to less than one per microgram.//////Evidently it is President Karzai's frustration that has prompted him to threaten retaliatory operation across the border into Pakistan. And one cannot but sympathise with him. His government's writ runs in a very small part of Afghanistan. Efforts of International Security Assistance Force and Afghan forces to rein in the insurgents are being constantly frustrated by the Taliban whose capacity to keep the US forces and its allies in Afghanistan on the defensive have not been dented the least bit. //////Today, let us deliberate on "democracy," the mysterious word, being used by all sorts of "minority" people in the world to perpetuate their rule over the "majority" with  mere promises. But before getting involved in the fracas let us make some changes in the definition of democracy that was articulated by Abraham Lincoln. Democracy is no more "for the people, of the people or by the people." Today, "people" are mere pawns in chess and I am sure you will not differ with me. So, let us say: "Democracy -- for the leaders, by the leaders, of the leaders." //////It's now a well-established fact that most of the countries of the world are grappling with the crisis of three Fs: food, fuel and farming. In fact, after decades of a modicum of calm in the international market for food, the sudden volatility and its ferocity has seemingly changed the whole course. Real prices of food are still below their mid-1970s peak, but reached their highest points since then. For example, food price index calculated by FAO rose nearly 40% compared to 9% the year before, and prices in the first months of 2008 again increased drastically. //////Pakistan stands at a crossroad. It could either shift to wholesome democratisation, or lapse back into military-dominated half-civilian government. Long-term social trends favour democratisation. But the actual outcome will depend upon how the main actors -- President Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan People's Party (PPP) co-chair Asif Ali Zardari, and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) chief Nawaz Sharif -- play their cards.//////Mohammad Ashraful will leave no stone unturned to become a consistent performer in international cricket. //////Co-hosts Austria toiled and probed but Germany's class told in a 1-0 Euro 2008 Group B victory here on Monday that put the European powerhouses into the quarterfinals.//////Croatian striker Ivan Klasnic became the first kidney transplant patient to score at a World Cup or European Championships when he got the only goal in Croatia's 1-0 win over Poland in their Euro 2008 Group B match here on Monday.//////The Dutch are past masters at self destructing at major finals despite always having squads loaded with talent, but this time round at Euro 2008 they appear to be the happiest they have been for a long time whilst it is the French who look the most ill at ease.//////Australia were made to fight all the way to the end, but they completed an 87-run victory in the third and final Test against West Indies on Monday.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has urged the government to take initiative to start football countrywide after the rainy season.//////Chittagong Abahani look forward to bury their wretched performance in the inaugural B.
