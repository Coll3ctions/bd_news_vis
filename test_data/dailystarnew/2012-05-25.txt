We also appreciate the good initiative taken by the mountaineering club. Again, congratulations!//////Mysterious disappearances have now gripped the country. Every day people are disappearing and in most of the cases they do not reappear. This sort of disappearance cannot take place in a civilised country. So I believe we are still uncivilised. All of a sudden anybody can lose his/her near and dear ones. If such disappearances continue, then the whole nation will live in constant fear and become mentally ill. Enmity may be the main reason behind disappearance. Enmity may exist among friends, neighbours, colleagues at work and among members of the ruling parties or opposition. //////We have passed more than four decades as an independent nation but still we could not build a strong infrastructure because of political instability, corruption, nepotism, and lack of political and administrative goodwill. Most of the people of our country still live under the poverty line. Three sections of our people are contributing greatly to our economic development but are neglected by the government. Firstly, our farmers have been working hard to meet the food demand of the country. Secondly, the migrant workers are sending their hard-earned money to the country which is the biggest source of our country's foreign currency reserve. Thirdly, our garment workers are doing an outstanding job and contributing a lot to our economic development. But it is a matter of sorrow that our farmers and garment workers are struggling most to make both ends meet. And our migrant workers are passing a troubled life abroad. If the government can not provide them support to live a healthy life, we as a nation can never prosper. //////Very often we read in the newspapers that many people especially women and children in different areas of the country fall sick at a time.

The study report says that Azithromycin is a bad drug that increases death risk. There are similar drugs that are safe for heart. It is time the health ministry did something about this medicine as this antibiotic is readily available in the market. //////The article by Professor Rashiduddin Ahmad (May 18th) made delightful reading with its account of numerous worthy people who laid aside privilege and personal profit in order to perform acts of public service in the only way they thought proper. The article was inspired by the example of Sohel Taj, wishing to retire from politics and reject the income he was being paid, which, the writer said, was an attitude surely inspired by his father, Tajuddin, first prime minister in exile, who set an example of personal austerity and honesty. //////We, at Road 9A of Dhanmondi, Dhaka, have been without any water supply for the last two weeks. We have to buy our water every day. Efforts to solve this problem have gone nowhere so far. We have borne the calamity with stoic patience, but we are at the end of the tether.

Democracy without electricity is bad enough; without water, it is simply unendurable.//////A report published in a daily says that four BGB officers on May 9, 2012 gave written statements to the probe body and were all quizzed.

But the government has not taken any action yet to keep its promise. What is the reason behind this attitude? The primary schoolteachers who had protested for their rights were beaten seriously by the police on 15th May 2012. A teacher also died because of the brutal attack. We condemn the government for taking such a tough stance against the primary schoolteachers. We should realise that the primary school teachers are the builders of the nation. In other countries everybody respects the primary teachers and they get a good salary for a decent living. The government should take steps to nationalise the non-govt. primary schools.//////Nepal's efforts to write a new constitution and avoid a fresh political crisis were in disarray yesterday after the deputy premier announced his resignation amid deep divisions in government.//////A UN panel yesterday said that government forces are to blame for most rights abuses in the latest unrest sweeping Syria as a watchdog reported an 11th straight day of shelling of a rebel bastion.//////Eurozone tensions rose again yesterday with grim signals from business, and a flight of capital into Germany after an EU summit disagreed on solutions to the crisis.//////Nobel laureate and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi will travel outside Myanmar for the first time in 24 years next week to deliver a speech at an international forum in Thailand, her party said yesterday.//////Police in Myanmar were accused of beating and detaining protesters yesterday as they broke up the country's first major demonstrations in years.//////National Assembly Speaker Dr Fehmida Mirza decided against forwarding a disqualification reference against Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Gilani to the Election Commission of Pakistan after his conviction by the Supreme Court in the contempt of court case.//////Amnesty International criticised the United States on Wednesday for its use of lethal force, particularly for the "unlawful" killing of Osama bin Laden in a clandestine US commando raid in Pakistan last May.//////Iran and six world powers yesterday sought desperately to salvage something tangible from two days of talks that have revealed huge differences over how to resolve the crisis over Tehran's nuclear programme.//////Taiwan's cabinet yesterday passed a bill to let members of the public join trial judges on the bench as the island seeks to reform its judicial system following a string of disputed rulings.//////Boosting its air defence shield and re-validating operational efficacy, India yesterday successfully test fired its indigenously-developed surface-to- air 'Akash' missile from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur, about 15 km from here.//////Egyptians swarmed polling stations on the second day Thursday of a gripping presidential election in which candidates are pitting stability against the ideals of the uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak's rule.//////A US drone strike yesterday killed eight militants in a Taliban stronghold of Pakistan's tribal belt, bringing the death toll from such strikes to 12 in two days, Pakistani officials said.//////Yemeni troops killed 35 al-Qaeda militants in overnight battles in the restive southern Abyan province, a military official said yesterday as the army pressed ahead with a 13-day offensive to retake extremist strongholds.//////A Tunisian military prosecutor demanded the death penalty Wednesday for ex-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who is being tried in absentia over killings during last year's popular uprising.//////Canada police arrested some 700 people in Montreal early yesterday after demonstrators threw rocks at officers in the latest student protest to shake the city, a police spokesman said.//////Seven children have died from rabies in Peru over the past two months after being bitten by bats, an official said Wednesday.//////Draped in his favourite 'gerua' khaddar panjabi, a bright yellow silk turban wrapped around his head and a row of beads around his neck, Nazrul was often seen frequenting the theatre where he was constantly sought-after by the directors.

On Kazi Narul Islam's birthday, at his Kolkata residence, the poet's family, friends and well-wishers had gathered for an informal celebration. A lei-laden poet is at the centre of the soiree. One after another, artistes are paying homage to the 'Rebel Poet' who had by then turned silent. Manabendra Mukhopadhyay started singing Bagicha-e Bulbuli Tui. A big smile brightened up the visibly excited Nazrul's face. To the surprise of hundreds of artistes and journalists, the poet took off a garland and put it on Manabendra's harmonium. Almost moved to tears by this gesture, the singer said, I have just received the greatest honour. //////Harm-ful and unintended reactions to medicines can occur at doses normally used for treatment, and that explains the escalation of political confrontation we have been watching in this country for last three weeks. Ever since US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Indian Finance-Minister-cum-presidential-hopeful Pranab Mukherjee visited Bangladesh in the first week of this month, political tension has heated up instead of cooling down. Like adverse drug reaction, it must be adverse visit reaction that their call for dialogue has backfired only to further deepen our political deadlock.//////Every so often someone asks me: "What's your favorite country, other than your own?"

Between his two sayings -- "It ain't over till it's over" and "Future ain't what it used to be" -- he sums up the current political outlook of Bangladesh.//////After a bloody struggle that lasted for nine months Bangladesh became free in December, 1971. The language movement of 1952 and the mass upsurge in 1969 are important historical events that preceded the independence of the country. In the years immediately after independence there was instability, misrule and widespread corruption that retarded economic development. Democracy suffered a series of setbacks. Highly respected national leaders like Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and President Ziaur Rahman were assassinated, and military interventions brought disaster to Bangladesh. Military rule (direct and indirect) came to an end with the popular civil uprising towards the end of 1990. A government of professionals and technocrats ushered in a new era of democracy with the election of1991.//////The United Nation Population Division shows that by 2015, Dhaka will be the fifth largest city of the world with 19.5 million people.
