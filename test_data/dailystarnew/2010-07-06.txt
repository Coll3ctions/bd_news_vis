Ten Bangladeshis have sustained injuries from fire resorted to by a group of Indian tribesmen at Jaintiapur in Sylhet on 4th July. It is alarming that the Indian nationals trespassed into Bangladesh territory and carried out the firing. Reportedly, these people were supported by the BSF. The locals inside Bangladesh eventually chased the intruders out of our territory, and they must have felt agitated enough to have expressed their resentment at the apparent 'inaction' of the BDR by barricading the Sylhet - Tamabil highway. The BDR 'inaction' is perhaps due to exercise of extreme restraint on their part, since retaliatory fire may have resulted in Indian civilian casualties. //////The World Cup's history men face the competition's nearly men when inaugural hosts and twice winners Uruguay take on double runners-up Netherlands in Cape Town on Tuesday fighting it out for a place in the final.//////German coach Joachim Loew will be obliged to wear his cashmere sweater in the semifinal against Spain on Wednesday.

Brazil has crashed out. So has Argentina. Needless to say, World Cup, 2010 is over for the Bangladeshis. With Brazil and Argentina back home, the final is now poised to be an all-European affair.

The British Raj introduced its education system in the subcontinent for its own interest -- not for the interest of the native Indians. For the British regime, the major driving force for introducing a newly formulated education system in India was to establish its hegemony and extend its rule. //////WHY should ////// (our universe) by Rabindanath Tagore, written so long ago in 1937, be a matter of discussion today? This is because the scientific-minded Tagore comes up less in our discussion than the God-loving poet. This type of discussions has given rise to many interpretations and misinterpretations about the great mind of the poet.//////WHO knew that the Sun was so musical? For the very first time, harmonious sounds that were created by longitudinal vibrations within the Sun's atmosphere have been recorded and studied by the experts at the University of Sheffield (U of S). With the aid of the mathematical theory, combined with steadfast satellite observations, a team of distinguished solar physicists from the U of S has captured this distinct solar music on tape which many are hoping would shed some light on the Sun's magnetic atmosphere as well as into the physics of solar corona. It is believed that the harmonious sounds in the Sun are caused by the movement of giant magnetic loops in the solar corona, the outermost, mysterious and least understood layer of the Sun's atmosphere. But what is the process of this mysterious yet melodic solar auditory composition? It's been found, after studying high-resolution satellite images of the sun, that the solar corona is filled with large banana-shaped magnetic structures which are known as coronal loops. And it is believed that these giant magnetic loops (some of which are over a few 100,000 km long), play a crucial role in governing the physics of the corona and are also responsible for huge atmospheric explosions that occur in the solar atmosphere, which are traditionally known as solar flares. And it is these giant coronal loops that have been observed to undergo periodic (oscillatory) motion, which can be thought of as someone plucking a guitar string (transversal oscillations) or blowing the wind-pipe instrument (longitudinal oscillations). And in these ways, the solar atmosphere is constantly encompassed by the music of the coronal loops. //////REACHING immortality is still in the realm of science fiction. But using clues from our genes, scientists are one step closer to understanding why some of us live to be centenarians while others don't. //////Researchers have found what may be the earliest evidence of multicellular life on Earth.

These extinct animals had exceptionally strong forelimbs that probably held a victim still while razorlike teeth ripped out its throat, a new study shows.//////In chemical factories, oil refineries, oil wells, rigs and landfills, gaseous waste products and sometimes even non-waste gases produced are routed to an elevated vertical chimney called a gas flare and burnt off at its tip. This is called gas flaring. Waste gases are subjected to such a process either because the gases are waste or it is difficult to store and transport them. Non-waste gases are burnt off to protect the processing equipment when unexpected high pressure develops within them. Gas flaring in oil rigs and wells contribute significantly to greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.//////
