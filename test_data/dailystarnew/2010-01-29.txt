The execution of these men, brought about after a lengthy process of trial lasting as many as thirteen years, ought not to be a reason for a feeling of retribution to arise in anyone. It was for this nation, simply and very logically, a return to the great idea that rule of law matters, that justice is all, that anyone who commits a crime should not expect to get away with it. Indeed, now that the legal process has ensured a restoration of the principle of justice, it is time for all citizens, irrespective of political belief or party affiliation, to reflect on the dark shadows that for long impeded our march to a better and an egalitarian future.//////IF the occurrence of tsunami or earthquake in littoral states of the Indian ocean or the Pacific rim jolted us into looking inward for assessing our vulnerability to seismic disasters then it has only been reinforced by the catastrophe in Haiti.

But the answer is not quite as simple//////The nation is ready for a sporting carnival.

However, gradually they begin to understand the language, though not everything, and also the context. Even they can explain to us what is happening. Nowadays English learning is a must for all. So if our pre-school going or primary school going kids learn a bit of English from watching the cartoons, that will be a blessing for us because apart from entertaining the kids the cartoon channels are helping them to learn something new.//////Now it is time to stop student politics.

The political parties are rearing them to have more power to create extreme situations in the political arena. They are using them for their own benefit. //////Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has accused the United States of causing the tremor in Haiti, killing hundreds of thousands of people.

Thirty-five years after the assassination of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the people of Bangladesh have kept faith with him. They have made good on their pledge to have his killers face the full force of the law, to have them answer for a crime they once proudly proclaimed before a horrified world. At long last, the long night of our shame is over. Today, as citizens of Bangladesh, we will inform the world beyond our frontiers that in this country that has suffered a great deal, that has been humiliated beyond measure by the unscrupulous and the murderous and the unnaturally ambitious, we are yet capable of calling forth in ourselves the will and the determination to reclaim for ourselves the decency and the sophistication that serve as the foundations of civilised living.//////THE evening of August 14, 1975 did not seem different from any other evening in August.
