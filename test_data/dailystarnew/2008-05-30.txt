At the same time, it is for us a genuine reason to feel outraged. Coming on the heels of the sufferings Bangladeshi workers have been going through in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, this new move can only add to our growing disquiet about the future of our manpower export sector. What makes the Bahrain move extremely shocking is that it was recommended by a group of lawmakers in that country following the alleged perpetration of a crime by a Bangladeshi. //////The abolition of the monarchy in Nepal by an overwhelming parliamentary vote on Wednesday heralds a new beginning for the country. With as many as 560 lawmakers in the newly elected 601-member constitutional assembly voting to declare the country a republic, it is clear where the sentiments of the population lie. While it can be argued that the struggle against the monarchy was spearheaded by the Maoists, who now dominate Nepalese politics, it is also true that Nepalese in general have been yearning to see the back of the royal family for quite sometime. Former king Gyanendra made matters worse not only for himself but for his people as well when a few years ago he tried to impose his arbitrary authority by pushing politicians aside. He has now paid the price for that miscalculation.//////Game on. It is a testament to the circular nature of politics in Bangladesh that I used the same heading and same introduction to a column almost three years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The dynamics are different now, of course, with both AL and BNP in the opposition, so to speak, but once again the issue is elections and whether or not to participate.//////EVERY time you talk about corruption, others throw back aphorisms like revelations. They tell you that corruption is a fact of life. That everyone has a price. That character is nothing but lack of opportunity to do mischief. That even the holiest man will have the urge to clean up an unprotected house. That pure gold doesn't make ornaments. So, if you give one reason why we should fight corruption, others give more reasons why we shouldn't.

This plant was built by Russia. The Chernobyl accident cost the former Soviet Union hundreds of billions of dollars, and some observers believe it may have hastened the collapse of the Soviet government. Massive amounts of radioactive materials were released into the environment resulting in a radioactive cloud that spread over much of Europe. The greatest contamination occurred around the reactor in areas that are now part of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. After the accident, the Soviet authorities resettled more than 350,000 people outside the worst affected areas, including all 50,000 people from nearby Pripyat, but millions of people continue to live in contaminated areas.//////This refers to the editorial in The Daily Star on Thursday, May 22, 2008 under the title Regulate number of rickshawsTraffic jam needs some easing. //////I would like to extend my heartiest thanks to Mr. Shafiqul Islam Bhuiyan for his letter on Population problem published on Monday, May 26, 2008. //////The write-up from Mr. Harun-ur-Rashid regarding the Bush visit to Israel on its 60th anniversary is an enlightened summary of the Israeli occupation.

This sense of fairness will never happen from the West.//////The other day I came across an interesting article on international gas pipeline. I am talking about Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) 2775 kilometre gas line which was mooted back in 1993 involving an expected cost of $3.3 billion which has now jumped to the haggard figure of $7.6 billion. This was stalled due to the laxity of India since the US Nuclear deal was under consideration of Indian Parliament. As we see everywhere in the world, America was pulling the strings here too. American hostility towards Iran stood in the way of this project. As a result of American pressure India sidelined this issue and did not attend the three meetings between Iranian and Pakistani officials during the last nine months. It may be mentioned here that it was also due to American pressure that India voted against Iran at the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). However, the pressure of the Indian opposition outweighed the American pressure. There was another factor working simultaneously, I mean, Pakistan's invitation to China to join the IPI project. All these together hastened Indian oil Minister's visit to Islamabad to clinch this deal as both Pakistan and India announced in a press conference in Islamabad on April 25 that a final agreement would be signed within weeks if not days. In this perspective the forthcoming visit of Iranian President to Islamabad and New Delhi will be of great significance. There was another development in the shape of Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India 1680 kilometre gas pipeline project with the backing of America and its henchman Asian Development Bank just to put IPI in limbo. Unfortunately for Bush this TAPI project fizzled out first because doubts persisted about Turkmenistan's actual gas reserve and secondly because whether those gas reserves are under Turkmenistan's control or were pledged to Russia. On the other hand, Iran assured abundant gas supply from Iran's South Pars gas fields. The IPI gas line is expected to be complete by 2012 and will carry 2.4 billion cubic feet of gas per day to be equally shared by India and Pakistan. The fees will be worked out when Pakistan completes its portion of the pipeline. It is expected that Pakistan will earn about $ 148 million per year as transit fee at the rate of 40 cent per million British thermal unit of gas.//////There are many talent hunt shows for singers on private TV channels but none for the young scholars.

If these steps are not taken promptly, then our financial and economic collapse is not far away. Unfortunately, our CTG seems to have washed its hand off any forward going move in the energy sector. Similarly, the immediate past government (BNP) also ignored the sector and cancelled an already signed MoU when they took up the reins. Their whole period of government was wasted away in trying to maximise their own larder from energy investment! The CTG's attitude on new energy investment is simple: do nothing! Is this not shirking a critical national issue? But who are we to question why?//////It didn't come as a surprise that the two large political parties were contemplating whether they would join the government-political parties dialogue. These parties have reason to be worried about the dialogue session as well as the upcoming elections. As concerned citizens of the country we also feel that the speech of the Honourable Chief Adviser was far below our expectation. I personally was expecting the Chief Adviser to chalk out extensive plans so that the doubts regarding the elections were dispelled. The government should make efforts to bring the two large parties, the Awami League and the BNP, to the dialogue and also ensure their participation in the upcoming elections. An election without the participation of these two major parties will not ensure its credibility. //////The residents of Shaheenbag, Nakhalpara, Teskonipara and Arjotpara under Tejgaon police station have very little scope to find some open space for a morning or evening walk.

But, regular exercise through sports is important for mental and physical growth of children. We think it is their civic right as well. Besides, the incidence of diabetes and hypertension is alarming in the city. So, walking is a must for everyone as suggested by the physicians.//////One news item has drawn my attention, that the government held talks with delegates of TATA regarding the proposed $3 billion investment in steel, fertiliser and power.

Long before the Mukti Bahini entered the village, or even before sector 9 was formed, Bastokathi had already built an organised resistance, led by Bithika and her brother Shamiron. //////For thirty years, modern Nepal was ruled by a royal autocracy. Then, starting in 1990, the people began to experience inefficient, perhaps, but real democracy, through the medium of political parties. In 1996, one of these went underground to engage in Maoist revolution, picking up the gun against the multiparty system of the day. Though gaining momentum, and spread over the first seven-odd years, by 2005 the insurgency had achieved a stalemate with the state security. The rebels then decided to relinquish the "people's war" and, along with the other parties, helped generate the People's Movement of April 2006 against the king, Gyanendra -- who had in the meantime taken over. Two years later, on 10 April 2008, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) made a leap into the government, winning an astounding 50 percent of elected seats in the Constituent Assembly, and nearly 30 percent of the proportional-representation votes. In so doing, they trounced the two main forces of yesteryear, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), and gained a definitive mandate from the people.//////The recent decision to build a metro (underground rail) system in Dhaka has met with a range of responses.
