Hence globalization of media is part of the integration of global experiences, values and practices. Media enables globalization in a number of ways. First of all, it ensures unfettered information flow across borders. Despite all efforts, the Syrian government has failed to suppress leaking of information of how it has been trying to brutally suppress the protesters. Secondly, globalization helps undermine nationally-controlled information regimes. No matter how hard the Mubarak regime tried to stymie the revolution by shutting off mobiles and internet and feeding only government controlled propaganda machines, tech savvy younger generation found ways to connect and spread the messages of defiance to the dictatorial regime. The more repressive the regime tried to be with the social media and cellular networks, the more fuller the Tahrir Square became with protestors. //////Bangladesh, the largest delta of the world, is a flat deltaic lush green tropical country. The unique geography of the territory has fetched both boon and bane for its human habitations in chorus. Floodplain dominated geomorphology and fresh water subjugated hydrology surprisingly prop up diverse ecosystems and consequently rich biodiversity shaping the livelihood stand of the bulk people. Bitterly, a number of hydro-geo-physical features like tropical geo-location and flat deltaic topography with sea-facing low elevation have pushed the coastal territory to extreme vulnerability of stronger disasters akin to cyclone, tidal surge, tsunami, beach erosion, salinity intrusion and the like. Exclusively, her coastal belt being funnel-shaped, most of the cyclones bred in the Bay rush to the coastal inland in due course. Again, slow but sure increase of sea-surface-temperature resulting from global warming helps spawn cyclones in the Bay with soaring rate of recurrence and intensity every year. Moreover, the prevalent socio-economic limitations like extreme poverty and less infrastructural development help reinforce casualty in any disaster crops up there. Hence, the coastal people very often have to face mayhem -- massive loss of life, untold long-term sufferings, and damage of property and environment.//////Nearly one thousand years ago the reputed Atisha Dipankara, a Buddhist scholar of royal birth from the town of Bikrampur (now Dhaka district) made the hazardous journey into the Land of Snow at the invitation of the Tibetan king.
