While rental power plant contracts get all the headlines, what has for decades been overlooked is the issue of transmission system upgradation -- without which power shortfalls and outages cannot be mitigated. The ADB commitment is part of a $1.6 billion programme that is being co-financed by Agence Francaise de Developpement, the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the Islamic Development Bank, as well as a government contribution of $222 million.//////It is a healthy sign for Bangladesh cricket when unexpected faces show up at post-match press conferences. It means that the range of performers are increasing and it is not the same old story of a Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal or Mushfiqur Rahim being the driving force behind the team's wins. Bangladesh won the first of five ODIs at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium against a strong West Indies outfit without Shakib, and more impressively with four debutants. //////One of the main points of interests surrounding the first ODI between Bangladesh and the West Indies were the new ODI rules -- particularly the one that limits the number of fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle at any time to four instead of five -- and how detrimental their effect would be on Bangladesh. //////After the practice match against the BCB XI on Wednesday when they scored 361 in 50 overs, West Indies would probably not have thought that they would not be able to pass 200 in their next outing at the same ground. But that was the outcome during their seven-wicket loss to Bangladesh at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna yesterday. //////Yesterday was the day that Khulna had been waiting for -- the return of one-day internationals for the first time since 2006. The Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium filled up rapidly to its capacity of 10,800. There had been a mad rush for tickets such that wherever you went in the city, the availability or lack thereof of tickets was the refrain. //////Yesterday, the day of the first ODI between Bangladesh and West Indies, was an emotional day for Khulna as one of its sons, Bangladesh Test cricketer Manzarul Islam Rana, was immortalised when the International Gallery (West) of the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium was officially renamed as the Manzarul Islam Rana stand. //////The penultimate round of the national cricket league begins today with Khulna leading the table by 11 points.

Uday was born in 1900, in the city of Udaipur, while Shyam Shankar was serving the Maharaja of Jhalawar as his private secretary. Shyam Shankar was a connoisseur of performing arts. To him dance was both art and worship. Uday himself was instinctively inclined to dance and painting. He was sent to Mumbai in 1918 to receive training at the famous J.J. School of Arts and then to Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. For higher training, Uday Shankar went to Royal College of Arts, London, where he received both theoretical and practical training in oriental and western painting and dance.

With a scholarship from the Royal College of Arts, Uday went to Rome for further training in painting.//////Great news for Dhaka film buffs: the latest James Bond film, Skyfall, has had its Bangladesh release.

Bal Thackeray, who founded the cadre-based Shiv Sena in 1966, and nurtured it into the second largest party of the second largest province in India by the time he passed away last week, Maharashtra, never used code. //////True, natural disasters are a universal reality and humans have no control over it. But when disasters are man-made, and our preparedness is either non-existent or minimum, we have reasons to be worried. //////Terrified women leaping to their deaths. Locked exits trapping workers. Piles of clothing blocking stairwells to safety. The fire that raced through a garment factory in Bangladesh last week and killed 112 workers bore eerie echoes of another blaze more than a century ago: the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire in New York City. While the March 25, 1911, Triangle fire that killed 146 workers spurred the organized labor movement and led to workplace safety improvements, experts question whether the same will happen in Bangladesh.//////Ten years ago, the idea of elimination of HIV would have sounded like a pipedream. However, this is now considered a realistic goal due to substantial progress made through years of commitment, investment and collective action. //////The Border Security Force is formed in India as a special force to guard the borders.//////I have been asking myself ceaselessly all these years the eternal question that anyone, having suffered a loss, would ask --- a loss that leaves a special kind of void, creating a gaping hole that does not heal with the passage of time. It rather exacerbates its presence by renewing itself day after day. But why does it not die away? I often wonder. Nine years is a rather long time. Memories normally would fade, particularly when one is afflicted with one's own troubled life. One more often than not feels as if the world around one is about to close in any moment.//////Two decades ago, perhaps more, a reputed Bengali language weekly in Calcutta serialized a number of letters written by Buddhadeva Bose to his daughter. Till then, my idea of Bose had been pretty much vague. You could even say that I had little idea, apart from having heard of him, of the position he enjoyed in modern Bengali literature. It was not until Waheedul Haque, the guru who literally led me by the hand to enlightenment and had me get a taste of Bengali literature, indeed the Bengali cultural tradition, pointed out the letters to me, instructing me to read them, that I went looking for Buddhadeva Bose. Those letters opened up a whole new world for me. Having studied English literature at university and with a smattering of Urdu poetry and prose in my academic background at school (which was in pre-1971 West Pakistan), I suffered from indescribable poverty when it came to understanding the literary nuances of my own country. If my mother taught me how to write and read Bengali (and this was when I was in college), it was Waheedul Haque who opened the doors and windows to the Bengali literary and cultural heritage for me.//////Thirty one years ago, when HIV/AIDS was first discovered, there was very little understanding about the devastating virus. Even in past decades, thinking to end the AIDS was a dare dream.//////When a couple cannot have children, the woman is usually blamed in Bangladesh.

In a few years time South Asia is expected to overtake East Asia and then will be the most populous region of the world. Unfortunately, it is also the poorest region. More people are going hungry than in Africa. Feeding better a rising population will be one of the most pressing needs of the years ahead (Zingel 1999, 2006).//////In re-electing President Barack Obama, voters decisively rejected the Republican version of economic reform. Obama is already angling to use his mandate to solve the nation's fiscal woes by letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire for the rich.//////The quotation from George Eliot's ////// at the beginning of Ali Sethi's novel is a dead give away: The difficult task of knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is chiefly made up of their own wishes. Eighty pages into the story, one of the main characters is reading //////. At the novel's conclusion, there's a quotation from Tolstoy: Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Granted, Tolstoy wasn't a Victorian, but his novels share numerous characteristics with his English counterparts: lengthy explorations of family dynamics, rapid social change, and so on.//////
