First of all, there are a number of wrong statements; US was not one of the first nations who recognised Bangladesh after its independence. The US congressional caucus did not condemn the government of Bangladesh or Sheikh Hasina for removing Dr. Yunus from the Grameen Bank or for trying only the opponents of the regime. I guess only perhaps dissatisfaction was expressed; the US would not certainly remain friendly with a country whose government is condemned by it. //////The government should not get back from the war crimes trial. It is the duty of the nation to try the war criminals who committed crimes against humanity during our Liberation War. We should rid the nation of the stigma. The government should not give in to the demands of the defenders of war criminals. The government should facilitate war crimes trial so that the perpetrators face justice as soon as possible.

Lurid tales of lewdness, corruption and profligate greed are coming out of these seats of higher learning like bats flapping out of dark basements.//////The country, in particular its youth, is giving vent to its frustration and resentment against the rather unexpected verdict against a proven war criminal -- a person who was responsible for many deaths of innocent civilians during our Liberation War in 1971. This functionary of a political party that was sworn to opposing the War of Liberation is the second person convicted for war crimes. The first person was sentenced to death, but he is absconding. //////The ashes of dashed hopes have been swept away by a single sweepstake of an event on Shahbagh intersection and around.

In his letter to ADB, JICA and IDB this compelling timeframe was mentioned as the key factor. //////Seventh Crusade: Crusaders engage Ayyubid forces in the Battle of Al Mansurah.//////Once a month, Mrs. Hossain has to go to her children's school and pay their monthly tuition fees, about Tk 10,000.
