I do not know how this small number of "Islamic fundamentalists" could take law in their own hands and dictate the issues of similar nature time and again. The CTG is playing a very dubious role in curbing the harmful activities of these fundamentalist groups. Apparently, they are not only supporting but giving encouragement to fan up terror under the pretext of religion. The forum which talks about "Mukti Juddha" is in effect shielding these terrorists from the wrath of the general public who believe in freedom of choice, expression and individual rights.//////Recently, the school of Law of Australian Newcastle University organised a seminar on "Bangladesh Mass Killing-1971".

Wholehearted support of the army pushed their image to an enviable height. They arrested both the former prime ministers who still enjoy robust popular support. They were so sensitive to unlawful assemblies that a few political workers were arrested in Sylhet while having their lunch at a fellow politician's home! They languished in jail for many months for their illegal (?) activities. In Khulna a former state minister was arrested from a private house allegedly for playing cards. They were prosecuted. Such examples of zero tolerance are abundant during the 19-month tenure of the CTG. We appreciated their firmness as the fallout of the great mission the CTG was going to accomplish.//////At the outset, I will draw your attention to the news reports published recently in The Daily Star://////A news item was published in different dailies regarding the unprecedented massive vandalism at the VC office of Dhaka University.

Dogs and other pet animals of rich countries are getting such foods which can save crores of people in the poor countries. The haves and have-nots are living in the same world. Yes, Allah, the Almighty, has sanctioned someone fortunes and He will surely examine in the life hereafter how the rich used their wealth. //////The date of national election 2008 has been fixed. But is everyone getting ready for the election in a democratic style? //////Melamine has been detected in many brands of baby milk powder. It has become the talk of the city and may be the country. The test reports are conflicting. The newspapers, TV media are hugely covering this news item since it has tremendous news value. People are 'eating' the news coverage quite voraciously. All the mothers are very worried, so are the fathers, brothers, sisters and so on. People are bewildered. They are at a loss what to feed the baby. In the mean while, so called 'fresh cow milk' sellers are making windfall profit from selling their 'cow milk'. A few years back, one 'dudhwalla' was supplying fifty litres of milk from a few cows. A friend of mine got curious and followed him to his house. He found that they were mixing powder milk in water, boiling it and later on mixing with fresh cow milk. It was sold as Khanti gorur dudh'! //////The steps necessary to control the congestion level in the city are described as follows: //////The DS is doing a good job by regularly publishing exclusive interviews of politicians.
