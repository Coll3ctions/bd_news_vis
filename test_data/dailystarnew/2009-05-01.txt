Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), however, recommends that the ADP should be kept within Tk 26,000 crore mark in view of the low implementation trend in recent years.//////THE observance of May Day is essentially a remembrance of the working men who sacrificed their lives in defence of their rights in Chicago's Hay Market long ago. In broad measure, though, it is a reassertion of the thought that equality matters in every aspect of human life, that men and women who toil day and night in search of a livelihood and decent living must be privy to all the good things that come with life. It is a fundamental truth we have known all these years. It is especially in Bangladesh that May Day takes on a huge degree of significance considering the long and insistent struggles our workers have regularly put up over the years in their enlightened interest.//////IF there is one person whose insights and ideas we in Bangladesh could benefit from learning about, it is those of Van Jones, activist, author of //////, and now a special advisor to the Obama administration for green jobs.//////IN his book //////, Ahmed Rashid, a renowned Pakistani journalist, writes about his conversation with Mullah Wakil, an aide to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in 1996 in Kandahar.

In the past women were segregated from out-of-home productive work. They were kept within the four walls. The hearth became the place for them.

Men became the wage earners and all other activities became their responsibilities.//////The ship accident in Chittagong port channel put the vital life line in jeopardy. Though Bangladesh boasts of two seaports,  practically Chittagong carries the maximum load.

Also, with the use of high technology, it wants to see Bangladesh as a digital nation. All these plans and programmes seem attractive and people are enthusiastic about their success. To attain success on these plans, the present government must identify the priorities and pre-requisites first. This time, the people are hopeful and ready to have patience, which means people want to give time to the government. But definitely they will watch the track of the line of actions that this government is taking. //////In our media, especially TV channels, journalists fail to bring national issues of real significance, and are not giving a true picture of our socio-economic problems, with very few exceptions. One of the main reason is that they fail to delve deep  into a problem. I believe there is lack of 'cross examination' in journalism. The government is not clamping any censorship on  media, still people depend on rumours and foreign media outlets  like BBC for  knowing  the truth.//////Thank you for publishing my response to the article by Syed Ashfaqul Haque, "Students Down Under Look Down the Barrel" in The Daily Star of 27 April 2009. I just wanted to take this opportunity to more fully outline Australia's policy on international students. //////Thanks to Mr.  M.R. Choudhury for presenting a very lively discussion on the current political events in Bangladesh. The most interesting aspect was a two-line Urdu poem recited by the respected guest. He has succeeded to narrate the current state of affairs of governance by his two-line Urdu poem. We remember that during British rule Urdu culture was part of the aristocracy. Of course, currently English has taken over the place of Urdu in the upper and upper middle class families in Bangladesh. The culture of language has a definite bearing on the social status of a family. I do not know where we are heading, to our desired destination of cultural change or creating a class to dominate the affairs of the state. Nevertheless, thanks to Mr. Choudhury and his respected guest for presenting a befitting Urdu poem having high relevance to our present status of governance and people's sufferings. We expect more to come from Mr. Choudhury's show which might include our lost heritage and pride of the upper class.//////Why is it that our leaders feel that once they are elected to office, they are free to use the taxpayers' money for their own, private expenses? In my opinion, it is entirely unacceptable for the prime minister to go and perform Umrah at a time when the country is suffering through a severe energy crisis. Not only is she  ignoring the plight of the citizens, she is wasting the taxpayers' money by going to perform Umrah for, perhaps, the billionth time and that, too, not only with her own family but that of others' as well. //////Chittagong is one of the busiest places in Bangladesh, but the waste management system of Chittagong is really baffling. Dustbins are not enough for the waste materials in its streets. And we have become accustomed to hurling trash here and there and making our streets dirty. While crossing the dustbins, people are often seen trying to hold their breath due to the unpleasant odor  produced from the dustbins. But it is a matter of great regret that the authorities concerned are not performing their tasks properly and common people are not   aware  of their duties.  It is not only the duty of the authorities but also the duty of every single citizen to show concern for our environment.//////Information Minister  Abul Kalam Azad,   while  addressing the AGM of the DUJ as the chief guest, disclosed that the government  was contemplating revival of  The Newspaper Employees' Services, Conditions Act-1974 in the greater interest of the newspaper industry.//////I am an expatriate Bangladeshi professional working in the UK. In response to the advertisement of Rajuk, I have applied for a plot. I came to know from a recent newspaper news that only 10% of the plots would  be allocated to expatriates which is far less than the previous quota.//////It was reported in your newspaper that Members of  Parliament (MPs) have been spending from their annual discretionary funds totaling  around Tk 3 crore each fiscal year since 1992, while guidelines for the spending are yet to be formulated.//////It  is now  cause for  huge concern worldwide. The unusual strain of swine flu virus found in Mexico contains genetic material from pigs, birds and human and  the death toll has already  gone above 80 and is rising. The resulting hybrid virus can spread quickly because we don't have any natural immunity against it. Already spreading across the USA, this recent outbreak has spurred concern of a global flu, and Bangladesh is also exposed to this havoc which have the potential to kill millions in a  few days.  We don't know what measures have been taken by our government so far to face such an outrageous thing. There should be immediate awareness campaign for healthcare professionals without creating any panic. We need to understand that there is no vaccine developed yet to protect against this swine flu. Forming committees with people who don't understand the issues well will  produce no  outcome. In case of a global pandemic we need to have an urgent rescue plan beforehand, and should have stockpile the antiviral drug Oseltamivir which is the only drug found effective against this flu besides zaminivir. The WHO guidelines for a country stockpiling this drug are also available online. Some of our local manufacturers have the capability to produce this drug and they should make immediate plan sitting with WHO, virologists, scientists and healthcare experts. //////Readers' instant comments on The Daily Star Online reports.

After about 140 years of awakening of the working class to their basic rights, it is time to assess the extent of progress in this regard. If we objectively analyse the world labour market, correlating the overall socio-economic and cultural advancement of the world, then the outcome will not definitely be an optimistic one.

In fact, the elongated working hour -- stretching up to twelve hours or even longer -- is still followed in many of the formal sectors, especially in developing countries. //////THE first 100 days of a presidency can't be used as a comprehensive yardstick for evaluation of a 4-year term.
