It is a good disciplinary move that the DMP will henceforth punish police personnel guilty of arresting people in violation of the law.//////Within a week of her celebrative homecoming turning bloody with a heinous carnage, Benazir Bhutto has received death threats from a female suicide squad suspected to be linked to terrorists groups like al-Qaeda. In the thicket of allegations about three senior government officials, or Jihadi loyalists of ex-president Ziaul Haq or extremists from Pakistan's restive tribal areas being behind the last week's suicide bomber attacks, investigations into them have got nowhere near identifying the culprits. As a result, the security risk on the life of former Pakistan prime minister and now chairperson Pakistan People's Party aggravates by the day. //////The Sri Lankan (SL) government is very concerned about the way LTTE terrorism is taking a new turn, regrettably some feel, for the worst, since the peace accord with the LTTE fell through in 2005 after four years of relative peace.//////For a "made to order" event for terrorists (and motivated others) there could have been no better occasion to run riot than Ms. Benazir's homecoming after nearly a decade in self-exile.

He'll hustle you when he bowls, he'll bully you when he bats and he'll jeer and taunt you when he fields. He'll pop up wherever and whenever the opposition don't want him to, etiquette be damned.//////Spin me once, shame on you. Spin me twice, shame on me.

But suddenly, twice in succession, an inability to prosper against spin has cost them matches.//////Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene will play English county cricket for Derbyshire next year, the county's official website said on Wednesday.//////Ian Chappell has come out swinging over England legend Ian Botham's claim that he decked the former Australian captain in a bar room brawl 30 years ago.//////Matthew Hayden has urged Cricket Australia not to adopt a zero-tolerance approach on drugs because he believes the issue needs flexibility.

The wholesalers are making the excuse that the rise in prices is due to short supply of goods. The prices came down when the RAB roamed around the markets before Eid. But this came to nothing as soon as the RAB stopped its drive to prevent shopkeepers from charging too high. The government has to find out the mysterious causes behind this sudden rise in the prices of essential commodities. It was easily prognosticated that the prices would increase once the RAB stopped its mission and that's exactly what has happened. There are business people who want to make undue profits. //////Russia roared back from behind to spectacularly defeat England 2-1 at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on Oct 17, increasing its chances of reaching the European Championship.

Are the candidates responsible for it? We, as citizens of Bangladesh, have the right to appear in the general BCS every year.//////Mr. Mohammad Badrul Ahsan's erudition in and insight into the endless subjects, either on history, politics, theology or that relate to day-to-day life (I love to cite a few of the titles, among hundreds, 'Midlife Misery', 'God and truth', 'Legends of life', 'Laden and Bush', 'Other side of history', 'Garden of Life') from romance to pains of estrangement, from affluence to poverty, from everything to nothing, defy all description and one simply gets startled to get to the depth of his knowledge and at the beauty in his style of writing, always using sharp contrast. And the piece, 'Under cross talk' is, therefore, such a one that if one misses it, one misses great pleasures of reading apart from knowing what one was/is ignorant of. //////The term "just justice" was the heading of your back page UNB report on Chief Justice's advice to judges (Oct: 19). I wonder if the adjective "just" is appropriate with the noun justice. Delivering "just" justice or for that matter "unjust" justice, qualifying the noun "justice" seems totally out of place! One can however say impartial justice or sober justice or proper justice; which are examples of adjectives qualifying the word "justice".//////The EU's Portuguese presidency yesterday urged Turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern Iraq, following deadly attacks on Turkish troops from Kurdish rebels in the region. //////Six female Nobel Peace Prize winners called yesterday for more decisive international action to secure the release of their fellow laureate, the Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. //////China yesterday told the visiting UN envoy on Myanmar it would fully support his efforts to resolve the ongoing crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, state press reported. //////The Nato-led force in Afghanistan should focus on training Afghan security forces and strengthening domestic institutions, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in an interview broadcast on Tuesday. //////The latest clashes in the Democratic Republic of Congo have driven 33,000 more people from villages in Nord-Kivu province and a cholera outbreak is suspected, UN agencies reported yesterday. //////UN chief Ban Ki-moon warned yesterday that violence is on the rise in Nepal and called on political parties to push on a peace process stalled after key elections were cancelled. //////Two Pakistani soldiers were killed yesterday in a roadside bomb blast near their convoy in a troubled tribal region close to the Afghan border, security officials said. //////An Indian politician and his wife were convicted yesterday of killing the lawmaker's pregnant lover, the Press Trust of India said. //////At least nine Tamil Tiger guerillas and a government soldier have died in fighting in northern Sri Lanka, the defence ministry said yesterday. //////Police yesterday detained dozens of veiled women separatists protesting alongside many more over alleged human rights abuses by troops in Indian Kashmir, officials said. //////King Mohammed VI said Tuesday that Morocco wants an "advanced status" with the European Union, calling upon France to help push its European partners to grant his north African country closer ties. //////Insurgents in Iraq set off two coordinated roadside bombs yesterday on the southern outskirts of Baghdad, killing eight people, security officials and medics told AFP. //////Pakistan has deployed more than 2,000 troops to a troubled northwestern district to bolster efforts to stem rising violence linked to pro-Taliban militants, a senior official said yesterday. //////Rathin Kisku is a representative of new generation Santal singers who are shaping the Santali music scene today.

To me, it is the most constructive and positive discussion on the truth commission I have come across since the idea was floated by the information and law advisor of the present caretaker government.//////It's sheer audacity, breaking of service rules, and contempt of court. The way the officials of the administration cadre vented their so-called grievances is simply outrageous. In the name of holding a seminar, they a held trade union-like rally defying the state of emergency. Had it been anyone other than administration officials, by now, he or she would have been put behind bars and dismissed from the service of the republic. //////
