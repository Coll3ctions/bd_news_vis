The message is one of leading a life of purity, away from all worldly temptations and in all the consciousness that life on earth is but a preparation for life in the hereafter. And yet it is on how men and women conduct themselves in the temporal world that their spirituality or awareness of faith in its widest meaning depends. //////Wasting three to four of our daily working hours on the street, if not more, while commuting to and from places is the sordid tale of our paralytic life in Dhaka city. With valuable man hours lost, absenteeism growing, output shrinking, incomes and opportunities lost, sickening trauma of endless waiting telling upon mental and physical health, there is no end to the adverse effects of unabated traffic congestion. The land area of the city being limited and the road network more so, the intensity of the commutation snarls is driven home in the most poignant manner. //////LIKE every other patriotic Bangladeshi, I have welcomed the decision of the caretaker government to restore the sanctity of August 15 as the National Mourning Day. By doing so, they have reaffirmed the belief of people of this country that Bangabandhu was not only the Father of this Nation but also that what happened on the tragic night of August 15, 1975 was a crime whose final adjudication needs to be completed. We are referring here to a man who unwaveringly followed his dream of a separate homeland for the Bangladeshis. With courage and determination, he welcomed incarceration and despite that stuck to his task and his conviction. He did not agree to compromises and half-way solutions. In that context, he became synonymous with an idea and became the symbol of freedom and independence.//////THE refusal of some politicians, who held the reins of government and, consequently, the fate of the people of the country in their hands in the past to abide by the existing laws relating to depoliticisation of the local bodies from mainstream political parties and refusal by a political leader to enlist as a voter unless released from detention are examples of disregard by them of the rule of law. //////JAMMU and Kashmir is burning.

Some persons of eminence, particularly of the judicial arena have reacted sharply to the establishment of such commission which according to them badly cuts across the time-honoured principles of jurisprudence and gives rise to serious discrimination in matters of dispensing justice. They are of the view that the government has not been able to adequately and satisfactorily explain the rationale for creating such a body.//////AN irate BGMEA has let out steam.

These are Lailat-ul- Qadr, Lailat-ul- Mi'raj, the nights of two Eids, the Night of Arafat and Lailat-ul-Baraat. On these auspicious occasions are a person's prayers, his or her outpourings of the heart's sentiments, the reverential expression of the soul's sincerest desires before its Maker, never fail to evoke the most coveted response from Benign Providence. No wonder, Lailat-ul-Baraat is celebrated as an auspicious night in every nook and corner of the subcontinent and in various other Muslim countries.//////Traditionally, learning science has been perceived to be difficult. There are two reasons for this difficulty. First, common-sense intuition, based on our day to day experience with the world around us, frequently leads to wrong conclusions when one tries to explain scientific phenomena through them. Scientific intuition, necessary for explaining science, has to be developed through careful and systematic study. Second, preconceived notion (frequently based on common-sense intuition) is difficult to change. Medical imaging studies have shown that as people learn, permanent changes take place in the neuron pathways of the brain, i.e. in the way in which neurons fire to transmit messages. Certain pathways become more robust as a result of learning. Later attempts at changing these pathways frequently fail. Thus, developing correct scientific intuition must be done early, preferably at the grade school level.//////As a matter of fact almost all the Arabic months are important to the Muslims for they are very much connected with observance of Muslim rites with due fervour and solemnity.//////A recent report in The Daily Star about water-logging problem in Jhigatola area in Dhaka city has motivated this article. //////This piece is in response to a news item which appeared in The Daily Star on August 10 under the headline 1m solar household systems by 2012 to achieve target.//////In the heels of the predatory nature of deforestation and environmental degradation, urban as well as rural afforestation programmes have assumed paramount significance in Bangladesh in line with the neighbouring South Asian nations.

A bony old man. He seemed to have trouble walking. But his voice had the roar of a tiger. As he came forward he was screaming (in English)://////Although there rage furious debates as to when precisely the golden age of Bengali literature was, one thing is sure: Contemporary Bengali literature is at its farthest point from it. We don't really know how we may symbolize this stage of our literature! With our printing media coming under the powerful influence of its electronic cousin, pieces of classic Bengali literature are surviving on the whims of electronic media and thereby fall prey to indiscriminate dissection at the hands of second- and third-rate serial soap opera makers. While it may be saving them from sinking into oblivion, it is at the cost of distortion. Increasing public interest in audio-visual media has given rise to serious misunderstandings about the consequence on our poor literature. The existence of Bibhutibhushan's ////// or Tagore's ////// owes more to the celluloid versions of Satyajit Ray than the old printed texts which are only gathering dust on the library shelves. These classic books are reportedly reaching wider audience by turning into films.//////This issue of ////// continues to demonstrate the literary journal's inherent vitality and variety. A most interesting piece is the essay titled ////// penned by Mohammed Nazrul Islam. It takes the reader on an emphatic tour of radical politics and cultural activities that formed the locus of oppositional politics in the then East Pakistan against the West Pakistani regimes during the 1940s and '50s. The cast of characters is vivid, ranging from Dhirendranath Dutta (the man who first raised the issue of language and linguistic rights in the Pakistan parliament) to Khan Shamsur Rahman (an ex-CSP bureaucrat who wore a red tie to a leftist meeting in Swadarghat near the Baptist Mission Church in Old Dhaka) to Hasan Hafizur Rahman (the poet-activist who brought out the famous Ekushey collection of poems, and was later posted to the Bangladesh mission in Moscow), with the settings ranging from Kolkata to Chittagong to Dhaka, and the language both spirited and nostalgic, evoking a period of our history about which we remain sadly under-informed today. The art section is specially strong in this issue, with, among other pieces, Borhanuddin Khan Jahangir and Mansur Ali writing on the veteran artist Shafiuddin Ahmed, poet Robiul Hosain explicating on artist and cartoonist Sisir Bhattacharya's much-discussed recent art show, and coverage of the exhibition of the works of new artists at the Shilpakala Academy (18 May to 6 June) by Zahid Mustafa. An article on Simone de Beauvoir however is ordinary and descriptive, as is the somewhat strained writing on fictionalized history by Sagar Chowdhury, a subject given traction by the overhyped 'Hitler diaries.' There is an interview of Amitav Ghosh which does not reveal anything new to readers of his English books, though that may not hold true of readers of Bengali prose. There are three short stories ('Reporter' by Shaymol Mojumdar and 'Thaida' by Dilara Hashim are notable) while for the first time there's also been published a micro-fiction, i.e., a very short, short story. Two articles on a couple of Bangladeshi writers make for particularly good reading: the lead piece by Sarkar Abdul Mannan on the recently deceased Shahidul Zahir, and a discussion on Hasan Azizul Haq's collection of short stories //////, which apparently was written some time back and has only recently been published. There is a very good review by Shamsuzzaman Khan of Papri Rahman's striking novel on Jamdani weavers Boyan, where the reviewer expertly discusses the Dhaka regional dialect in which the novel has been written (pointing out the very unfamiliar words that readers would not know, for example, the word 'tolok' which means tobacco leaf when it is too strong--in fact, anything too overtly spicy, temperamental or powerful is referred to as//////). //////The Daily Star invites submissions to its forthcoming Eid special issue of both fiction and nonfiction pieces.

The date will not be extended. //////While thinking about the public hospital set-ups in Bangladesh, a common scenario comes to the mind where poor healthcare facilitates are being provided with very limited resources. Most often, the ailing people have to learn that some better treatment options are not available due to the shortage or unavailability of equipment as well as skilled manpower. The condition pushes the affordable class in the private set-up leaving the poor with no answer.//////Children have different eye problems those are not readily disclosed.

With oil prices hovering around $125 a barrel, oil-exporting countries in one hand are trying to justify the newfound bounty and on the other hand have set a chain reaction of spiralling prices and global uncertainty. Such scenarios have already compelled the coastal nations to explore energy resources in the Continental shelf (CS) of the Arctic region. It is widely believed based on various scientific surveys that about 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas lie beneath the Arctic region.//////BANGLADESH has once again deflected the Indian request for transit at the just concluded Foreign Secretary level talks. The transit to the seven Northeast Indian provinces (Assam, Nagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh) known as the Seven Sisters (SS) from the rest of India through Bangladesh, to which request to use of the Chittagong Port for these provinces was added later, has been unresolved since the Bangladesh-India Trade Agreement of 1972 called for use of railways, waterways and road in each other's country for trade. //////THE first thing it reminds me is of an old adage: Do not punch a bear on the nose unless it is tied down. //////In Recent times, a few books have been published on the leading artists of Bangladesh, an initiative which now appears to be a full-pledged trend, deserving appreciation and praise. Artists need to be introduced to the art world both through their works and informed discourse about their creative process. Comprehensive books on the works of artists thus become their biographies tracing the evolution of their works and the internal and extraneous forces that were brought to bear on them. Both the text, the art works, and the contexts, the traditional and contemporary practices within which the artists work, become important. The object, the art works, attains its full meaning through circumstantial explication, the contextual analysis. //////Bengal --- or today's Bangladesh --- has a long history of relations with Japan. In the last one hundred years there have been cultural, political, social and economic ties between the two countries. Many known and unknown different facets of the Bangla-Japan relationship have been presented in Probir Bikash Sarker's formidable book Jana Ojana Japan, recently published from Dhaka.//////Where the Heart Is comes with stories of people who live their lives through tears and joy. Novalee Nation, the protagonist of the story, lives in a chaotic world riddled with problems. Novalee, just seventeen and seven months pregnant, finds herself abandoned by her boyfriend Willie Jack. This happens to be the tip of the iceberg for henceforth each and every sunrise seems to come with more trouble for her. Billie Letts, with her mastery of story craft, brings into the scene the kind, good hearted people who show how sharing and caring can make a world of difference for Novalee. With these people Novalee is able to smile through her tears. The author sews into the story line unique tales of how people can together overcome mountains of trouble. Among these people are those who are happy and some who are unhappy. And yet they are eager to help the homeless girl. The reader will be touched by Novalee's life, for she is a troubled teenager, a good soul who does not foresee the cruel blows of life. //////The book continues to be a top best seller in Italy, and has been in that position in other European countries. This book broke the writer's ten years' silence, until 9/11.The central theme revolves round what is described as Islamic terrorism and the incompatibility between the Western world and Islam. It is to be noted that the comparison is on uneven ground between secularism in the West and religious order in third world countries.//////
