After we register our shock at the extent of the calamity and extend our sympathies to the families of those who have been killed or are suffering, there are two further considerations that must be kept in mind.//////Natural disasters are something that the people of Bangladesh are familiar with. Floods and cyclones, death and devastation, associated with such occurrences, have become part of our lives. Over the last fifty years, in addition to many tornadoes, we have had massive cyclones that have at times killed more than one hundred thousand unfortunate people at a time and tens of thousands of livestock.

The doldrums must end.//////The lifeless Abahani-Moha-mmedan encounter was best summed up when Zunaed Siddiqui came on to bowl his off-spin in the 12th over. He cut a casual figure loosening his shoulders and measuring a short run-up. As he confirmed to see if the batsman on strike was left or right-handed while setting the field, Zunaed offered a smirk or it could have been a hapless smile.//////Abahani will have to travel to Malaysia in the last week of June to play their AFC President's Cup matches in Petaling Jaya, a city adjacent to the capital Kuala Lumpur.//////Usha Krira Chakra destroyed Ajax Sporting Club 6-2 at the Maulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium yesterday to join Abahani atop the points table of the Green Delta Insurance Premier Hockey League.//////The National football team will leave Dhaka on May 25 if the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) can confirm preparation matches in Thailand for next month's SAFF Football Championship.//////Grand Masters Ziaur Rahman and Abdullah Al Rakib won their respective eighth round matches to share the second spot along with two other players in the Mayors Cup 1st International Open Chess tournament in Mumbai yesterday. //////A dramatic final-over hat-trick by Amit Mishra, when Deccan Chargers needed only 15 runs off six balls, clinched a tense 12-run victory for the Delhi Daredevils and ended their four-match losing streak.

"Globalisation is striking back," Gabor Steingart, an editor at Germany's leading news magazine, Der Spiegel, writes in a best-selling book.

The current financial crisis has only given greater force to such fears.//////Roaming all over the world//////Roaming all over the world//////And coming back home//////I feel let the world//////Be reflected in Bangla//////Im in my car, driving.

First, foreign policy is not important in governance in Bangladesh. Second, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of Bangladesh is the weakest in the world. It is not that these apprehensions are new. People informed on these issues have known these for a long time. //////TEN years ago, after conducting five nuclear tests on 11 and 13 May 1998, India declared itself a state with nuclear weapons. While many reasons like a quest for world power status were attributed to former Prime Minister Vajpayee's decision to bring India's nuclear weapons out of the closet, the primary motivation clearly stemmed from living in a dangerous nuclear neighbourhood with two inimical nuclear powers, China and Pakistan, colluding with each other to destabilise India through a nuclear warhead-ballistic missile nexus and a long-drawn proxy war under the nuclear shadow.//////Tata Advanced Systems, the defense arm of Indian industrial house the Tata Group, has agreed to cooperatively develop and manufacture advanced defense products in India, including missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, electronic warfare systems and aerospace products with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).//////The Lebanese army said May 12 it will use force if necessary to disarm gunmen and restore law and order after five days of deadly fighting between opponents and supporters of the government.//////The U.S. Army Soldier Weapons Center at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J., has ordered three prototypes of a first-of-its-kind lightweight .50-cal. machine gun that fires with less recoil force and can be carried more easily in rough terrain than the Army's current .50-caliber weapon, service officials said. //////France plans to drastically reduce the number of military personnel it deploys overseas in active theaters of war, Defense Minister Herve Morin said May 14.//////Estonia's Ministry of Defense (MoD) has launched a twin-track proposal to purchase new or secondhand field artillery for the Estonian Army's Suurtkivegrupp, or Artillery Group. //////The U.S. called on May 14 for increased civilian and military cooperation worldwide to combat sea piracy, off the perilous coasts of Africa in particular.//////In his remarkable study, ////// (1997), Richard M. Eaton observes how Bengal first achieved cultural autonomy from the Delhi Sultanate in the fourteenth century. This, he points out, was the period when the first indigenous reference to Bengal itself is to be found. Eaton notes that the emergence of the independent Ilyas Shahi dynasty at this time represented the political expression of a long-present cultural autonomy. After the North Indian armies gave up their bid to exercise strict control over the frontier province and a sovereign dynasty emerged decisively, Bengal remained relatively undisturbed for a fairly long period. Not surprisingly, the now confident rulers of Bengal embarked on building mosques and monuments that would attest to their imperial glory. This was also when Sufi saints began proselytizing in the region vigorously, but in a manner that was rooted in indigenous traditions as well as imported ones. One consequence of the consolidation of the Sultanate and the rise of Islam was an efflorescence of Islamic architecture in eastern Bengal. //////The book is Benazir Bhutto's posthumous publication. The manuscript was carried by her when she landed in Karachi on 18 October 2007 after a long exile abroad. In her own language, Within hours of my reaching Pakistan some of the pages of this book would be symbolically charred by fire and splattered with the blood and flesh of dismembered innocents thrown up by devastating terrorist bombs. She had to reconstruct those chapters in spite of her heavy schedule. She could not see the final publication but left behind a masterpiece on the most contemporary issues, such as the rise of so-called Islamic radicalism and rediscovering the values of tolerance and Islam. The book ends with an epilogue from her family.//////The book has come out from Spain and art aficionados will get a chance to enjoy the renowned artist Monirul Islam's printmaking from the year 1973 to 2006. The time is a big journey for a printmaker. He has devoted himself to the print media for more than three and a half decades. His major specialty is printmaking and it is this inclination which has helped him to hold his position in the forefront of the Spanish art scene. But his profound grasp and expression regarding other mediums is really praiseworthy. He is exceedingly fond of experimenting and trying out new forms and techniques. To search for fresh themes and present them with a novel approach is one of his characteristics. //////A woman without a man, says Gloria Steinem, is like a fish without a bicycle. That sounds rather strange, even bizarre, until you realise the wit in that statement. And wit is something we have been doing without, much to our surprise, for quite a while now. When was the last time you heard someone among the glamorous and the glitzy come up with a wisecrack? There is Ronald Reagan, with his 'Honey, I forgot to duck' comment to his wife moments after the assassination attempt on him in March 1981. There was John F. Kennedy, who regaled newsmen on his visit to France in 1961 with the remark, 'Gentlemen, I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris.' Rack your brains and you just might recover some of the gems of humour you may have lost over the years.//////
