And, equally important, the vibrancy and vitality of the media has been crucial to our development and advancement.//////Bangladesh's sense of relief at the passage of Nargis away from its coastal line is as profound as its sorrow at the devastating sweep of Myanmar has been overwhelming. When the eye of the developing cyclonic storm was scowling, as it were, at the bumper boro harvest we were reaping in our land, an impending sense of loss was pervading our consciousness. The worst kind of premonition set in. Thank stars, however, we have been spared another bout of calamity.

Indeed, it has already rocked several countries, including Bangladesh, where simmering discontent over scarcity and spiraling prices of cereals has been becoming volatile, with the public ire targeted at the authorities unsuccessfully grappling with the issue. //////Logic and politics are not necessarily incompatible. If you live by the sword, you die by the sword. If you live by market forces you die by market forces. Inflation is the most logical face of market forces. It is the market that sets the agenda. It is the market that raises prices based on its assessment of supply, demand and profitability. //////The inhabitants of Madrid have just celebrated with much pomp and pride the two hundredth anniversary of the beginning of the "intifada" against the French occupiers of their country. Although the uprising first started in Madrid on May 2, 1808, it soon spread like wildfire to other parts of Spain and then evolved into a full-fledged war of independence in which Napoleon's imperial army, the most powerful military machine of its time, was pitted against bands of ill-armed and loosely organised Spanish peasants and workers.//////Country's new grandmaster of chess Enamul Hossain Rajib once again urged the Bangladesh Chess Federation to increase facilities for the chess players.//////Bangladesh will look forward to a winning start when they take on fellow South Asian opponents Afghanistan in the opening match of the AFC Challenge Cup Group C qualifying rounds in Bishkek today.//////GP-BCB National Cricket Academy (NCA) produced an all too familiar batting failure that allowed Pakistan Cricket Academy (PCA) walk all over them at the end of the third day of their second four-day encounter at the Rajshahi Divisional Stadium yesterday.//////Ziaur Rahman regained the national chess crown yesterday when the Grand Master defeated FIDE Master Mohammed Javed after 30 moves in the final round at the Chess Federation hall-room to win the 32nd National Chess Championship.//////The Premier Cricket Super League will kick off in Dhaka on May 9 with Biman, Mohammedan and defending champions Abahani beginning a three-way race for the title.//////Shoaib Akhtar has been cleared to play in the IPL after the Appellate Tribunal decided to suspend his five-year ban for one month, until they reconvene on June 4.

The national ID Card project and voter listing are going to face deep trouble. Those who were over confident about smooth progress can now reassess their viewpoint. A couple of new dimensions has been added with the existing crisis in management of the affairs of the Republic. The new dimensions are: Dialogue or monologue without any positive purpose; delimitation of the proposed NA constituencies ; price hike in energy sector without going into planned analysis or plan of operation keeping in mind the serious economic condition of the middle and low income groups; the advisers are preoccupied with political game play putting all but limited efforts to solve departmental issues ( lack of professionalism is party responsible for this ); the National Women Development Policy; the election roadmap itself; the latest episode is over the role of the police force to control the clashes between the students and transport workers in Dhaka College, teachers inside the office room have also not been spared from police action. //////The present caretaker government has very abruptly increased the CNG prices by almost 100%, which is totally imprudent and illogical in view of the current economic situation of the country. Moreover, prices of consumable goods have been increased manifold. Therefore, this increased price of CNG would be an additional burden on people, except some fortunate ones! //////I am very much surprised that no party has raised the issue of Bicameral Parliament at the pre-SANGLAPH!

But the problem here is that many of such industrial units don't know how to operate such plants. //////Our beautiful planet is in peril. And we, humans, are to be solely blamed for this. We are destroying the planet that God has given us. We all can contribute to save the planet Earth from losing its life. This is the time and we all should work right now! We should remember that the survival of our future generation depends on us. Here are some of the things which we all can do. You can pass on these tips to your friends and relatives as well://////The decision of introducing structured questions at the SSC level from 2010 is a laudable initiative indeed. Thanks to the education ministry for arranging meetings with eminent academic personalities to share and exchange views, opinions & recommendations prior to commencement of the system. //////The statement of the Bangladesh Chief Adviser's Press Secretary that the government is likely to begin the much-awaited formal dialogue with the political parties in the first or second week of May is highly welcome news for the entire region of South Asia as much as Bangladesh, because despite all its faults it has been well established that democracy still remains the best form of governance found so far and certainly much better than any dictatorial venture.//////I noticed a few letters on this subject recently. Before rickshaws can be eliminated it is necessary to make all roads pedestrian friendly and safe, so that it becomes a pleasure to walk short distances without falling into open manholes or being tripped over by uneven pavement surface. At night the pavements should be well lighted. Maybe the rickshaw pullers can take over the manual work of maintaining such pavements. Buses and other forms of transport would then only be necessary for commuting between localities which can also be served by the proposed underground system. So, safe and easy pedestrianisation of all roads (non trunk) should be adopted as a policy for Dhaka and other cities in Bangladesh as in most of the developed countries. //////I fully agree with the views expressed in Mohammed Alauddin's letter published in your daily on 24/04/08 under the above heading. It is true that some posh areas in Dhaka are getting preferential treatment in case of load shedding. In spite of promises by BPDB, their website is still not carrying the daily schedule of load shedding. This prior notification will also save us from many hazards like being trapped in the lift etc. Is it to avoid being caught for the selective load shedding to keep some quarters happy? It shouldn't be selective. //////The recent comments by Cherie Blair regarding our democracy, I think, were totally out of place. She told the reporters that Bangladesh was not going to be another Myanmar and that Sheikh Hasina's trial would follow the due course of law. Whatever my personal opinion regarding the present government may be, I totally fail to see the point of her remarks, unless of-course as the spouse of a former British premier, she has Hillary Clinton inspired objectives. //////I found the report on BB's decision not to disburse home loan to govt. employees in your Star Business page. I was disappointed. I was waiting eagerly to have the loan. I told my wife and children that I should avail myself of this loan to buy a flat at Dhaka. We were never told that the govt. employees would be out of the Tk.300 crore home loan scheme. //////It's encouraging that our nation, present CTG and the media are interested in potatoes. If we don't want to be tunnel visioned we should think collateral. What about protein consumption? During the 1960's, an average Bengalee took 85gm protein daily, now they are taking below 50gm. //////People are suffering due to acute load shedding all over the country. We are fed up with daily load shedding in this hot weather. The HSC candidates are the worst victims. Their exam is knocking at the door.//////Malaria, a disease without borders, is preventable and treatable. However, it needs a bolder commitment from donors and member states if it is to be brought under control.//////We knew that Pakistan were going for a 5-0 whitewash. We also lost the only 20-20 match. It was a great shame for us and for our nation. Because we are no longer a new cricket playing country. //////Barua's report from Chittagong on the matter in your issue of April 24 saddened me. True, it deprives the government of revenue in terms of import duties and VAT etc. However the really deprived are the poor, even middle class students, the vast majority whose need for reasonably priced books have been severely undermined-- given the prohibitive prices of original prints! This is an area where a lenient approach from the authorities would be really beneficial for a large majority of students, who depend on pirated books for higher and technical studies!//////As the election date is nearing our politicians are becoming as active as they were during the pre-one-eleven times. As a mark of their hyper activity, some politicians are demanding resignation of the present CEC who, according to them, is not impartial and is not working in the way these politicians want him to work. According to them, this CEC took about a year to make a voter list which a former CEC could do in one day!! The former CEC, a trusted man of the politicians, defying the HC order corrected the voter list in less than a week's time all over the country. What a fast man he was!! But the demand for resignation of that CEC was very strong. The whole nation was looking at him but he did not bend although he was illegally holding two positions concurrently, violating the public service rules. He brought the nation almost to the brink of a civil war.//////We do not know how the government would evaluate the visit of China Foreign Minister. We hope this would not empower the government to change its course from road to democracy to road to Burma!! //////The first time I met you at the French Embassy on Bastille Day soon after taking over your assignment in Bangladesh, I spoke to you in Sylheti & asked if you could speak & understand Sylheti .

A period of massive change is inevitable.//////ONE month after the terrorist assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, on October 11, 2001, President George W. Bush faced a more terrifying prospect. At that morning's presidential daily intelligence briefing, George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, informed the president that a CIA agent codenamed "Dragonfire" had reported that Al Qaeda terrorists possessed a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb, evidently stolen from the Russian arsenal.
