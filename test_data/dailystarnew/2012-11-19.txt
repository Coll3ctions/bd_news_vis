The Daily Star even cares enough to print pictures in their pages about how filthy our city is but everyone including the government seems to turn a blind eye to it. The politicians don't seem to care. Why is it so? Is it because their neighbourhood is clean? Why is it that the Dhaka City Corporation never gets a performance evaluation and no one is held responsible for this? Someone even cared enough to write about the dangers of dust in the city but did anyone even care enough to read that article? I have so many questions which I know will probably never be answered. All I know is that I dream of living in a clean Dhaka but this will only remain a dream unless the people in power actually wake up and do something about it.//////I fully endorse Ahmed As Sami's letter entitled "Exemplary act of a traffic officer" published in your daily dated November 5, 2012.

And we the normal citizens have to hide like fugitives. Thieves, pickpockets, murderers, kidnappers, etc. are there all over the country.

It's the right of every citizen of Bangladesh to get safety from the government. We demand safety while walking on the streets.//////We learned that in the last three years President Zillur Rahman has pardoned twenty one people who were sentenced to death in different cases.

My son was due for his O'Level examination at the British Council in Dhaka University area.

Later I learned that many students could not even reach British Council early enough. To my sheer disappointment, I convey this message to all in our administration: Please do not make our lives miserable. I hope in future our prime minister and all VVIPs would think before moving around like a in this way and make everyone stand still on an already congested road.//////What a relief that the idea of giving MP's children special rights of admission to schools has been cancelled! //////A Set-top Box (STB) also called Set-top Unit (STU) or Cable Box is an electronic device used to decode digital signals from the satellite so that it can be viewed on a traditional TV set (mostly under analogue system now).//////Here are some comments that came in response to Sunday's The Daily Star news report headlined 70pc revenue pilfered//////Southeast Asian leaders will put pressure on Myanmar to resolve violence between Buddhists and minority Muslims, a senior regional official said yesterday, after unrest left scores dead and as many as 100,000 people displaced since June.//////Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj yesterday seeking support for bringing a no-confidence motion against the UPA government at the Centre, senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi said here.//////US President Barack Obama yesterday backed Israel's right to defend itself and said it was "preferable" for the Gaza crisis to be ended without a "ramping up" of Israeli military action, as fears mounted of a new invasion of the Hamas-run territory.//////China is downplaying the impact of US President Barack Obama's upcoming visit to Myanmar and upcoming discussion on the South China Sea dispute at the meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Cambodia.
