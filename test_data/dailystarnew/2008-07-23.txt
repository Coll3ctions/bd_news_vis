That statement will certainly leave politicians across the spectrum disappointed, for they have been demanding an end to the emergency in the run-up to the promised elections in December this year. That said, the CA's remarks in Sylhet on Monday throw fresh new light on the political situation obtaining in the country and what the caretaker government plans on doing about it. A significant point Fakhruddin Ahmed has made relates to the need for a consensus in the on-going dialogue between the government and the political parties. He believes, and so do a whole range of others in the country, that the politics of the future must be based on an agreement by all to make Parliament effective and to consign hartals to history. //////IF everything goes well, and nothing should go wrong, a new government should be in office in Bangladesh come January. Never before in the history of this country has this desire for elected government been as intense as it is today. For obvious reasons, of course. In these last eighteen months, much has happened, much has not happened, and some of what has happened has been rolled back; and all of that has only whipped up this wonderful, excitable political frenzy in us for a return to democratic governance. //////WHILE many Parisians have been en vacances, heads of states and governments of Mediterranean countries gathered here for a summit at the invitation of President Nicolas Sarkozy.

He also voiced his deep concern that there was no alternative for us, other than increasing our food production and becoming self-reliant. We have to produce our own foods and stop relying on import. Once we achieve this, I strongly feel that the value of our currency will go up.//////The demand for food is increasing every day as the population is increasing at a dangerous pace. This will bring unprecedented and unsustainable demand on the country's remaining lands, forests and swamps. A massive leap in deforestation is clearly visible and it would add to global warming as the sea level continues to rise and will put pressure on our forests .

The demerits of over population are well known & visible but we should also think of the potential benefits of a populous nation, some of which are://////After 1/11 (Jan 11 2008), the political year 2008 in Dhaka has bogged down. No cooperation from the past political regimes ruling since 1991. The other parties are not in tune with the orchestration of the two major parties -- for obvious reasons, (the haves and the have-nots). The high food and fuel prices have slowed down and distracted the attention from the major theme of holding neutral general elections in Dec '08.//////In Dhaka city, we are facing many problems every day. I think everybody will agree with me on this point. //////We should realise that the main reason behind the nation being backward is our poor education system.

The private universities are now run according to the Private University Act-1992 and its amendment 1998. I am neither a decision maker nor a protestor. I am just a victim of the complexities of the ordinance and its amendments. I am interested to know what type of basic structure exists in the private universities at the moment? The university is generally known as an academic institution of higher learning. There are several types of universities in the world such as: //////Some recent developments in our present context have raised some big questions in people's minds. We've come to see Jamaat leader Matiur Rahman Nizami being released on bail. And the sudden resignation of the Attorney General -- all these incidents are, to a great extent, obscure to the citizens of the country. //////Some criminals are very active in Bashabo area. They steal electric or cable wires around the area and burn them in secluded spots, filling the densely populated area with toxic fumes. The people around are forced to close their windows and cover their faces on streets. After burning the upper plastic cover, they extract the inner metal wires and sell them. //////Recently, the Election commission, BBC Bangla, BTV and Bangladesh Betar jointly arranged a series of dialogues on upcoming city corporation elections. I was present in the inaugural session as a participant in Sylhet. It is undoubtedly a consequential venture on the way to democracy. Actually, I was displeased with the performance of the mayoral candidates but I think it has helped both sides to know each other. The candidates have known the matters that create great panic for the city dwellers. On the other hand, the voters have acquired an overall supposition about the qualifications (academic and relevant) of the candidates within a short time. Public consciousness about the candidates is indispensable to exercise voting right. It has created an opportunity to make the candidates answerable to the mass people. They have promised 'a lot of things' to the nation. If they fail to meet up those effectively, in future they will remain accountable to their voters.//////This refers to Mr. Akbar Hossain's letter published in your newspaper dated: July 13, 2007 with the headline "Neglected Khilgaon". I appreciate his concern for Khilgaon because I have also been living in Khilgaon for the last 30 years and have hardly seen any development. The construction of buildings was done haphazardly. No one knows whether there was any master plan for the area or not. //////At present, the actual type of adulteration, as well as the number of adulterated items (used in a wider sense) in Bangladesh are unknown to ordinary people. Further, the quantity and the quality (in terms of say, degrees of adulteration) of adulterated items imported by the country - whether consciously or otherwise - are currently beyond the knowledge of the people. Factors such as: the role of the country's law enforcers and others in unearthing and dealing with relevant cases of adulteration and adulterated items in recent times; and the media projection (print, electronic) of those cases as applicable have been instrumental in opening up the eyes of public when it comes to behind the scene faces of adulterated fruits, adulterated medicines, adulterated fishes, spurious engineering materials and so on. //////If we remember correctly, a government high-up made an unpleasant remark about three commissioners of the ACC serving prior to this reorganised ACC.
