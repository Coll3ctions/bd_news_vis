Its efforts to track down wrongdoing in such organisations as Rajuk and Titas Gas have been welcomed all over the country. It then follows that it is now time for the National Housing Authority to be taken to task. That much becomes clear in light of the inquiries already made by the task force of the NCC. What the inquiries have revealed is staggering, and naturally too given the fact that individuals as young as two-year old children have become the proud owners of residential plots. Such dismal realities only hold up yet once more the degree of corruption that has for years undermined the integrity of institutions, to a point where the nation as a whole now faces the uphill task of clawing back to a semblance of order. //////The bottomline about containing the spread of bird-flu is three-fold. One, we handle the affected poultry with gloves and masks; two, we dispose of the feathers, skin and droppings of fowls and their innards by dumping them five feet below the surface; and three, ensure cleanliness of the poultry markets. //////The American media appear to have developed a terrific fascination for Barack Obama. That, in a way, is quite all right. After all, the senator from Illinois is a fascinating figure. He does not deliver a speech. He goes into soaring oratory every time he speaks. And he writes with fantastic skill, as his books have so clearly shown. //////Why do certain individuals become suicide bombers? Experts say that when people think living or dying makes no difference in their situation, as they have been pushed to the wall, they act as suicide bombers.//////Once upon a time there was a primary election, and it was good. Excellent, even. Millions of voters went to the polls, and millions watched televised debates, even though it seemed as though there were millions of debates.

Forces of change will be gone with the departure of this current CTG and the evil forces of inertia will be back and will try to take the country and run it their old way. //////A few years ago, Bangladesh experienced an upsurge of private universities. Now the trend is towards private hospitals whose fancy ads are quite regular in different dailies. They share two similarities - one is expected, the other unexpected. The expected similarity is that both are expensive. The unexpected one is the fact that most of the private universities and now allegedly some of the private hospitals have failed to maintain the required standard.//////I refer to the letter written by Lt.

Only the grading system has been introduced and every year a large number of students pass their SSC and HSC examinations by acquiring Golden GPA-5 in their exams.

The syllabuses prescribed by the board which direct the students to do their studies in a planned away are mostly not practical. And majority of Bangla-medium students can't even speak English fluently despite their knowledge of grammar and the introduction of FM method, communicative English and such other processes of English speaking. In addition to this, the English books of primary level truly lack in quality and standard. //////It is appreciable that the caretaker government and the Election Commission (EC) have taken a historical step to prepare a computer-based voter list and issue national ID cards to the eligible citizens.
