He got up from his bed feeling uneasy, with a bad headache. On other mornings, while getting up from his bed, he would take his time, lying curled up on the bedsheets for four or five minutes before determinedly, in an act of will, lifting himself up and out of the bed. Then he would jump out crisply in order to avoid drifting back into another round of luxurious sleep. So today he rose, clasping the sides of the bed as he got up and then walked to the attached bathroom, feeling a numbness in his movements. He tried to think if it was due the lingering effects of a dream, or if it was because he had taken a strong sedative last night before getting into bed in order to dive deep into the nirvana of a deep, refreshing sleep, something which had been eluded him these last one-and-half months.//////Opening this issue of ////// I was immediately attracted to the article on Humayun Kabir, the distinguished poet, novelist and outstanding essayist who was a member of India's Rajya Shabha, and twice its education minister - once when Jawaharlal Nehru himself called upon him to fill the considerable shoes of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Nearly all educated Bengalis of a certain generation are aware of the general outlines of Humayun Kabir's life and career: his distinguished family lineage (a family name and tradition that lies in tatters and ruins now), his brilliance as a student, and of his later illustrious political and literary career. He was also the editor of journals at Presidency College, Calcutta, and later at Oxford. He retained a lifelong interest in philosophy, writing on Kant, and was later instrumental in forming the United Front in West Bengal. //////Despite new drugs and strategies for combating malaria, the infectious illness remains one of the world's most dangerous and deadly diseases. Approximately half of the world's population is at risk of malaria, particularly those living in lower-income countries. It infects more than 500 million people per year and kills more than 1 million. WHO also estimates that a child dies from malaria every 30 seconds.//////Travellers planning to visit malaria endemic zones must always, consult with their doctors to make sure that they take a prophylaxis (measure taken for the prevention of a disease or condition) drug which they can tolerate and one which is appropriate for their destination to be protected from malaria.//////Vaccines against a big killer pneumonia has been launched among African children recently, both backed jointly by drugmakers and groups set up specifically to promote vaccination, says a press release.//////Overweight people eat more than thin people and are more likely to travel by car, making excess body weight doubly bad for the environment, according to a study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.//////Sorry, I am not going to talk about the galaxy's milky way.

Sponge your body with water. Over-the-counter- medicines may help relieve your symptoms. Antibiotic is not effective for viral fever. So try to avoid it. Consult with doctor if your symptoms become severe.//////Afriend said something thought provoking recently. He said Bangladesh is in company of Afghanistan and Pakistan as three exceptional countries whose governments are telling the rest of the world that they are infested with terrorists. While Pakistan and Afghanistan cannot claim otherwise as there are deaths and destructions aplenty from terrorism, all reported in the international media the moment they occur, it is a mystery that our own government is projecting us as such where there are neither deaths nor destructions to show nor do we figure anywhere in the context of reporting in the international media as a militant prone country.//////ON 16th April, President Barack Obama said the US seeks a "new beginning" with Cuba and an "equal partnership" with all the nations of the Americas.

All the parties came with the will to succeed in the dialogue but there were too many obstacles that prevented such success. The main obstacles that prevented any progress in the talks were://////Letters from the war zone have always been heartbreaking. Despite all the old yarn about wars being adventures in courage and vanquishing the enemy being a proud tale of heroism, there is the sheer loneliness that comes through in the missives of those who write back home. So it was in 1971, as this rich collection of poignant letters makes obvious. But what does shine through all along is that sure grasp of hope that these letter writers demonstrate in their communication with their families and friends. That their belief in freedom is unalloyed, that Bangladesh will soon be a free nation, is the common principle which binds all of them together.//////It is indeed a phenomenal success for a person who, having crossed fifty, can look back at his childhood and youth and then present an honest portrayal of his success and failures during those days in engrossingly simplified language. He deserves to be called an accomplished individual. That is exactly what my impression is about my author-friend, Junaidul Haque. Well, there is nothing surprising as far as my personal understanding of Junaidul Haque is concerned. The English Department of Dhaka University, during our days, could be reasonably proud of having students like Junaid. Junaid, a tall man always wearing power glasses, gave us all an impression that he was flawless a character, cut out for serving a higher purpose. His literary insight and deeper contemplation of the metaphysical aspects of life made him a serious man. In the first story of this book, he wonders why people become old, why they suffer painful diseases, why there is unbearable helplessness in old age. He asks, Couldn't God make us all ever young? He also has seen some of his close relatives dying before him, leaving a score of questions in his mind which eventually made him a melancholic man. In the book, as he unfolds his own life, he admits that he has been so preoccupied with the unresolved puzzles of life that he has been unable to avail the share of joy he is entitled to.//////
