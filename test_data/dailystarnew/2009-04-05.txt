the last 5 years.

The average number of laden boxes of all these lines to Dhaka ICD per month crosses 2,500. Most of these imported commodities are raw cotton, garments fabrics & garments accessories which in fact are being used in most of the export oriented factories in & around Dhaka, Gazipur & Narayanganj.

The coastal zone is inhibited by 35.08 million people. The coast of Bangladesh is known as a zone of vulnerabilities as well as opportunities. It is exposed to natural disasters like tropical storm, storm surge and downpour. The mixture of natural and artificial hazards, such as earthquake, water and soil salinity, various forms of pollution, wearing away, high arsenic content in land water, water sorting, risks from weather change, etc, have adversely affected life and livelihoods in the coastal zone and slowed down the speed of community progress in those areas.//////Establishment of a digital Bangladesh by 2021 is the main objective of this government.//////As many other citizens, I too was horrified with the BDR mutiny and the loss of many brave soldiers. Does Bangladesh need this kind of tragedy to wake it up to the reality or should it tackle problems before they erupt? It would be nave to think that the Bangladesh intelligence had no idea what was brewing underneath the surface while it was not at all surprising to many of us ordinary citizens, who barely cared about the art of intelligence gathering. It seems tension was there for a long time and nobody really cared to do anything to handle the situation. That raises the question of competency of our intelligence agency and the people (home ministry), who are responsible to deal with such problems. Can we truly rely on their competence? //////For different indigenous hill peoples, jhum cultivation (slash and burn method) is like part of their culture. They cultivate paddy and other crops through this special type of tilling in which farmers burn all kinds of trees, plants, shrubs etc on the slopes of hills and then they do other necessary works for growing crops. After some years they choose another hill for producing more crops. Actually, a considerable number of hill people live on crops from jhum. They have been doing this from time immemorial. In the past, the size of population was smaller and people did not mind burning some trees. But nowadays we cannot remain silent watching any harmful act on our environment, as we are deeply concerned about our existence in this planet. //////Over the last two decades student politics has become a source of major concern. It is known to all that our student politics has a glorious and unforgettable history. They played a great role in 1952 , our liberation war in 1971 and in ending dictatorship in 1990. But the situation is very different today.//////What does the report of a jeep-load of outsiders entering the barrack and joining the jawans point to?//////We are shocked at the unequal treatment being meted out to the civilians killed at Pilkhana.

This railway service was the lone communication mode between Khulna and Bagerhat, though during the winter bus service was in existence along the muddy district board road. No bus could ply during the rainy season because of the muddy road. After partition of India in 1947, a moderately good all weather road was built leading to bus service throughout the year. The narrow gauge railway track was converted into broad gauge railway line during the Pakistani days of great disparity.//////Some BDR personnel have reportedly committed suicide. //////We, the students of the chemistry department of Chittagong University, are deprived of modern facilities. It is a matter of great regret that we have no computer laboratory. As a result, in the age of modern technology we are deprived of all sorts of technological facilities i.e. internet facilities, including all sorts of service. For that reason, we the students can't gather any information of the current world. So we can't keep pace with the competitive world. We can't collect any necessary data, information etc. We had a chemical conference last year and our department earned a huge amount of money from contributions made by different organisations. With that money our department has bought some computers only for the teachers. We are trying to draw the attention of the authorities to extend the technological support to the students as well. //////This is undoubtedly frustrating news for Khulna, if it is correct. The immediate past caretaker government after seeing the dismal and declining economic situation of the Khulna division, approved the pipeline gas supply project financed by the ADP and the pipeline was to be drawn from Tangail to Kushtia to Khulna and the present government has countermanded the project with a view to using that fund for Sylhet gas project. If this is true, this would be the most disgraceful treatment to Khulna people and a continuation of the process of deprivation. //////The BDR revolt [insensitive intelligence]: Bashundhara fire [lack of professionalism, training, and resources; campus violence [political rivalry]; the energy and water shortage; concentration of power in Dhaka metropolis; RMG unrest (from time to time); wholesale transfers in the BCS; political witch-hunting exercises; the winner takes all philosophy; etc, etc... all point to one conclusion: our political culture has not matured to run a new nation even after 37 years. the digital mobile telephone has vastly reduced the communications gaps, especially in the rural areas. The crafty politicians do not like it [burqa removed--exposure of vicious cartels].//////For centuries, battles have been fought with kudos won for the war heroes. Violence has been condoned in declared wars, communal riots, religious crusades or hartals; use of arms in defence or offence has been justified. The war heroes have often been glorified along with the cause they defend, whether it is fundamentalism, capitalism, communism or any other ism that moves people to fight for their beliefs. Examples of such "courage and valour" expand in literature and in schools texts as inspirational stories for children.//////I am not a son of any freedom fighter. I did not see the liberation war of 1971. Whatever knowledge I have about liberation war, I have gathered it from books. I never met any Birangona. Perhaps, that's why I am now suffering from a sense of guilt.//////Voice of America and British Broadcasting Corporation are inviting public opinions on various matters and subjects on different occasions from us as well as Bangladeshis living abroad and broadcasting these regularly and freely. //////We demand quick, just and exemplary punishment to the so-called mutineers and dastardly killers of army officials. Investigation is going on and a very competent investigating officer has been assigned with the task. We hope the perpetrators will be identified and duly punished. But some disquieting information is coming to our knowledge which may not make the trial unquestionable. A few BDR personnel have died in unnatural conditions. For fair play and justice, the law has to be followed strictly. //////The world is becoming dangerous day by day because of the terrorism unleashed by the goons across the globe. There are many reasons behind the mushroom growth of these terrorist organisations. One reason is the unscrupulous arms trade. World's superpowers are the main players of this trade. Arms deals worth billions of dollars are struck every year. //////France and Germany fully endorsed President Barack Obama's new Afghan war strategy but continued to firmly resist US demands for more combat troops yesterday in a rift that overshadowed symbols of unity at Nato's 60th-anniversary summit.//////High winds may have forced North Korea to delay its rocket launch, despite the country's insistence Saturday that preparations were complete for the liftoff that many suspect is intended to test the country's long-range missile capabilities.//////President Barack Obama intends to lift the US ban on family members travelling to Cuba and remittances to the island, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.//////A soldier in a Nato-led force fighting an extremist insurgency in Afghanistan died in a bomb blast Saturday while the US military announced it had killed 20 Taliban-linked insurgents.//////Pakistan's president pledged yesterday to protect the country from rising fundamentalism as he addressed a crowd at the tomb of his slain wife and father-in-law.//////The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asserted that if elected to power it would have no peace dialogue with Pakistan unless Islamabad dismantles the terror infrastructure on its soil.

Originating in the rural areas, almost all customs involve narration in the form of songs and certain physical movements. Today, burdened under financial woes and threatened by the invasive global electronic media, these traditions are gradually losing ground. Adding to that loss is the lack of government and non-government initiatives to conserve the art forms and the escalating preference for razzle-dazzle over authentic folklore. //////The first day of Kolkata Fashion Week (April 2), clearly belonged to Bangladeshi model-turned-designer of international fame, Bibi Russell, who showcased the rich Bengali heritage of textiles -- her 'gamcha' and natural fibre collection. //////The two-day 'Baul Shah Abdul Karim Loko Utshab' ended at the home village of the living legend yesterday afternoon.

If he had, he would have noticed that Jesus had a beard. //////THIS is ridiculous. This contradicts the spirit of our constitution. Above all, this implicitly opposes the electoral manifesto of the government. This manifesto pledged to bring a positive change in the country by strengthening the local government and democratic ethos. //////
