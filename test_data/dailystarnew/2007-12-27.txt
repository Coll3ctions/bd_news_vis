It is the latest example of an important matter being so awfully mishandled, that even our diplomatic relations with France might come under strain. However, what the French Charge de Affairs said about the protestors has, to our mind, been unthinking and undiplomatic which we wish he had better avoided. //////This is the second time in four months that abused and underpaid Bangladeshi workers have sought refuge at our country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur. This time 225 workers have been sheltering partly within the mission compound but mostly on the pavements since early December.

There will be seminars and meeting of the minds of the scholars of Bangladesh, wherever they come from -- home or abroad. //////The political conditions are extremely confusing, and it cannot be overemphasised that the country is in a bad shape: everyone realises that a number of wars and polarisations describe Pakistan polity today, what with the Taliban's depredations and BLA's campaign in Balochistan. There is intense polarisation between the social and economic elite and the army. A reconciliation, and honourable peace, has to be achieved. A dictatorship with a democratic faade is holding an election which is controversial at home and suspected abroad.//////The weather stayed kind, the drop-in pitch behaved like a dream and expectations within and beyond the Bangladesh team soared for a couple of hours before the Tigers allowed every positive to drift away and succumbed to a 6-wicket defeat in the first one-day international of the three-match series at Eden Park on Wednesday.//////As expected, veteran wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud along with ace left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique were ignored for the New Zealand tour when the national selectors announced the additional three names for the two-match Test series yesterday.//////FIFA has threatened to ban Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) from the international scene unless it holds the election under the new statutes within the one-year deadline given by football's world governing body.//////Skipper Anil Kumble inspired a dramatic Indian fightback to almost bowl Australia out on the opening day of the first cricket Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday.//////Rajshahi must be thanking their lucky stars ahead of their momentous ninth round National Cricket League home four-day match against Khulna today.//////Inaugural AFC Challenge Cup hosts Bangladesh will have to play in the qualifying rounds of the second edition of the event next year, the Bangladesh Football Federation confirmed yesterday.//////Anil Kumble has termed his five-wicket haul on the first day in Melbourne as the best spell he's bowled overseas.

It helped that the warm-up match against Victoria was rained off, allowing them a longer rest. And if they were still struggling, there was always Boxing Day, a bank holiday. India normally spend the first day of an away series sleeping and by lunch Wednesday they were sleepwalking.

For the first session those local supporters who demand nothing but dominance by Ricky Ponting's men were satisfied with the direction of the game. Their disgruntlement when it changed in the second session was offset by the joy felt -- and heard -- at the ground by cricket supporters who are desperate to see Australia challenged.

In future banners and slogans must be done away with. And the events proved beyond doubt that year after year Bangladesh produces some of the best planned events in the world. This land is brimming with talent. The level of culture and design of events this year was just impeccable. //////In 1991, I experienced the destruction of Cyclone Gorky. At that time I felt how much insecure we people were. Today when I see the sufferings of the Sidr-affected people and areas, I still find people being helpless facing the crude wrath of nature. This is indeed very unfortunate. Years passed since Gorky, we still remain as vulnerable as we were. Bangladesh being a delta with most of its parts in coastal areas, will face natural disasters like cyclone, hurricane or even tsunami very often. Therefore, we must fortify ourselves to fight such calamities. There should be public awareness campaigns for disaster management in these coastal areas throughout the year. People of these coastal areas should be trained on safeguarding themselves along with their belongings such as cattle during the disaster. There should also be clear understanding and knowledge on the needful to be done after the crisis. Adequate number of cyclone centres should be developed in these areas. All schools, colleges, mosques or other infrastructure should be developed in such a way so that they can serve as shelters during the disaster period. We expect relief operation to go ahead in order for people in the cyclone battered areas to return to a semblance of normalcy. I have been informed by a newspaper that 14 million people are yet out of shelter or rescue coverage. This is indeed shocking! I urge the government, the private sector and NGOs to identify the poor of these coastal areas and rehabilitate them with enough resources to fight back. The weather forecasting team should be more efficient and updated to deliver the right news at the right time. //////May I take this opportunity to compliment Gen. Moeen U. Ahmed for all the good work he has been doing. However, I write this letter not just to praise him but to broach the subject of reburial of the seven Birshresthos. I would like to request him to reconsider his proposal to re-bury the Birshreshthos at the Jatiyo Smriti Shoudha. I have the highest regard for the heroes and all the fellow comrades who gave their lives for the cause of our liberation. Being fully aware of the sensitivity of this matter, I would submit that a nation is larger than the glorious war of independence. Jatiyo Smriti Shoudha is not just about the Shahids of special ranks and honour roll; it is for all those who fought for the war - all those dead or alive. It is an icon of the entire nation. I am personally aware of many valiant freedom fighters - some dead and some alive who did not receive any gallantry award. No wonder, in many countries there are national memorials for the unknown soldiers. //////Mahmood's letter on the matter (Nov.30) was all about family planning than anything else. However, in Bangladesh context; resettlement or relocating families is out of question. I firmly believe that we must again go for a population management (coined by Mahmood) programme with determination and full mobilisation; if needed with the support of the armed forces as and where needed.//////Since our teachers cannot be disciplined by the law, and that they cannot discipline themselves, the only recourse for the people of Bangladesh is to impose upon them the discipline of the market.//////I read with great interest the article by Farida Akhter on the above subject as it appeared in The Daily Star on 17 December.
