Malaysia. The move reflects the urgency of the situation in which these workers, a very big group of which comes from Bangladesh, find themselves at present. The points which the civil society groups have raised certainly make much sense since they are aimed at cushioning the pain that migrant workers go through when they are informed suddenly that they cannot work any more. In these past many weeks and months, thousands of workers from Bangladesh have had to bear the brunt of the arbitrary moves made by the Malaysian authorities. The latest has been the cancellation of work visas issued to 55,000 Bangladeshi workers even before they could travel to Kuala Lumpur. Making matters worse was the plight of hundreds of others stranded at the airport in the Malaysian capital because they were not being allowed entry.//////STINKING waters of rivers girdling the metropolis and the physical encroachment on them are strangling the wind pipe of Dhaka city, as it were, to its virtual death.

But this time what occurred in Pakistan on March 16 was, for the first time, a successful manifestation of people's power to restore democracy and rule of law. This is a great victory for the people, signaling detribalisation and secularisation of politics in Pakistan. //////THE impacts of the current financial crisis are being felt around the world.

Nowadays, we observe some efforts by the law enforcers to ensure formalin-free fish and stop adulteration of restaurants foods. But they overlook the pesticides used while growing vegetables and other agricultural products. //////Thanks to our Dhaka Stock Exchange new President for his powerful strides to bail out our capital market from the vicious cycle around Z category shares wrought about by some crafty wrong doers. Z category shares transaction in percentage of our total turnover may not be that high. But the damage caused by it goes much deeper down the spine of our capital market system. It has produced such satire in our capital market that sounds as it were: Invest in bad shares and be rewarded. Invest in good shares and be punished. This hints at decaying of intrinsic value in our capital market system.//////No doubt Bangladesh has immense potential in tourism. But still it is not developed due to the lack of interest and proper policy of the government. The recent announcement on establishing a national tourism board is a ray of hope for the development of tourism industry in Bangladesh. But it is not enough, because tourism industry is an amalgam of other industries like transportation, accommodation, international technology etc.//////National security is matter of topmost priority. That BDR Headquarters and other military establishments exist without adequate video surveillance and digital identification is just unthinkable to me. Even before Bangladesh goes digital, our armed forces need to do so immediately. It is sad to read how the investigators have to rely on amateur cell phone videos to look for suspects. Many rosters had been burnt which make it impossible to determine the whereabouts of the personnel. This could easily have been avoided if each personnel were assigned a digital identification card. This would make their whereabouts easier to find and also the information could not be burnt as it would immediately (at the speed of light to be precise) make its way to a central digital information storage hub (say a facility in the cantonment). //////The fundamental principle of all religions is to try to be a good human being, though there are different ways to achieve the goal. Our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (Pbuh) is the truest human being the world has ever seen. But some people, who claim to be the followers of Islam, engage in activities that violate the basic tenets of the religion. //////US President Barack Obama on March 20, 2009 made a historic appeal to the Iranian people, urging an end to decades of animosity and offering a honest engagement with the Islamic Republic. It proves that he is a person of great wisdom who wants to have a peaceful relationship with every country.//////A few days ago I purchased a hot water bottle from a drug store. I wanted to buy a local product but was told that the quality of the local product is not good. Hence I had to buy an imported product at a higher cost.//////I would very much welcome the cancellation of Pakistan cricket team's tour of Bangladesh. I think this is a very good decision by the government. There is no denying that terrorists have got no sympathy even for sportsmen who are considered goodwill ambassadors of their country. The recent attack by the terrorists on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan is an example that even the sportsman are not sparred by them. Thank God, the Sri Lankan team members narrowly escaped. //////The rulers of Myanmar are oppressing the Rohingya Muslims. Though they are the legal citizens of Myanmar, but their social and political rights have never been recognised. They can't perform their religious duties, they can't marry without the permission of the govt. They can't move from one town to another without permission. The dictators are trying their best to finish the Rohingya Muslims. The Rohingyas are now foreigners in their own country. There were 3.5 million Rohingyas, and 1.5 million have escaped from Myanmar and they are passing through great uncertainty. //////Recently, Paramita's story in DS drew my attention. I was astonished to see her patriotism and love for the mother tongue. I can visualise my own childhood in the eyes of this little girl. She spent her money which she got as prize for poetry recitation, for building a Shaheed Minar. She did this spontaneously to show her love for the martyrs of the language movement. It was a spontaneous expression of her love for her mother tongue too. Nowadays what our countrymen lack is patriotism. But when I read the story of a school girl's love for the country and our mother tongue, I got back my lost faith. //////Thanks to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for directing the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs to arrange special programmes for rehabilitating the hapless street children and ensuring social and economic security of women.//////The ACCA students, particularly in Chittagong, are facing many problems. Since the course is not so established and familiar in the context of Bangladesh, students cannot determine what is happening during taking tuition. The main problem is created by tuition providers, especially the new ones. They lack experienced and skilled personnel in administration. In fact, their management is too weak to run such a professional course. Furthermore, it is widely complained that, they take the ACCA fees from the students but do not pay to the ACCA in time.//////AIG and the other failing banks in the USA have set new and absurd standards for executive privileges. They give guaranteed bonuses; while the organisation reels under astounding losses! Funnily, individual amounts of this bonus are more than the gross income of many US taxpayers! Indeed the USA is the land of milk and honey! These fat salaried executives get the honey of bonuses in these hard days of economic downturn, regardless of losses suffered, conveniently milked from poor taxpayers! This is the refined way of robbing the bank without guns and masks!//////I am really sympathetic towards Md. Lutfar Rahman (Letter to DS on March 20, 2009), as I too am feeling the pain and suffering each and every day caused by the careless behaviour of the rickshaw-pullers on Dhaka streets. //////In the human body, all the systems simultaneously work in a co-ordinated way and in full harmony for a definite purpose, namely, to keep the body alive. Even the smallest movements we do everyday, such as breathing or smiling, are outcomes of perfect co-ordination in the human body. //////I am very sceptical about the selection of the AL cabinet. Most of them do not have any technical knowledge or experience in their respective fields. It takes knowledge, vision and administrative skill to run a ministry.
