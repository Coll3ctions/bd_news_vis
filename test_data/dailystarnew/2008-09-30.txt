With the end of the holy month of Ramadan, it becomes our particular responsibility to go for self-assessment on what we have endeavoured to do during the period and what we could yet have done to bind our spirit with the higher calling of faith. Ramadan is a testing time for all Muslims. In this month, it is questions of how we have fared as a society, of how the gap between rich and poor keeps us pinioned to disappointment that we deal with. Ramadan is also a reminder that Islam is a religion of peace and abjures all forms of extremism. Exploitation of faith for the purpose of attaining ulterior motives is an idea abhorrent to Islam. Ramadan is also a message about the higher moral quality we need to bring to life and a necessary lesson that life lived on earth is but a preparation for the world hereafter.//////THE BNP's demand for withdrawal of the Representation of the People Order (Amendment) 2008, and its apparent backpedaling on its position on the next general election, has come as a shock to us.
