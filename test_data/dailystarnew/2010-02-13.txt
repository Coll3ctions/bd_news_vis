At that time, Dacca, as it was then known, was a small town of about one hundred and seventy thousand people. Limited to a large extent to the southern tract bordering the river Buriganga, its outer limit included the Dhaka University campus and the lush green Ramna Park. There was very little motorized vehicular traffic and negligible pollution. There were also designated public toilets in different parts of the city -- Narinda, Wari, Gopibagh, Ganderia, Shamibagh, Islampur, Chawk Bazar and Nawabpur and other facilities that included an effective emergency fire service. There was also steady supply of water in the pipelines and road side hydrants.//////THE developing countries have in parochialism a menace which disrupts normal life.

F. Rahman Hall, the ominous signal of the slide to disorder and violence in the campuses of the universities in consequence of intra or inter party clashes has surfaced again. Abubaker was killed as a sequel to clashes between rival groups of Chhatra League in the AF Rahman Hall of Dhaka University and two days after this killing, Faruk Hossain, an activist of the Chhatra League in Rajshahi University fell victim to Islamic Chhatra Shibir barbarity. With the grisly killing of Abubakar and Faruk Hossain the good days their poor parents were looking forward to, have been dashed to ground. //////The almost unbearable traffic situation in Dhaka metropolitan area has engaged the attention of people of all classes and vocations. This has been natural as the socio-economic costs of traffic disorder have been too high to be ignored. While the statistics that graphically depict the harm caused to the economy and the tragedy in terms of loss of human lives serve useful purpose, the important considerations at this time are the remedial measures.//////The traffic jam recently in Dhaka painfully surpasses all that obtains in other mega cities, with too many vehicles, many with inadequate road networks, some with narrow roads except the major roads, particularly Manila and Bangkok. All the major European and American cities and Tokyo in Asia have efficient underground metro which has made their traffic situation easier than in other cities. The traffic madness in Manila and Bangkok was worse during the pre-under ground metro up to eighties.//////The conflict between development and environment still remains unresolved. Industrial revolution in the 1780s, Green revolution in the 1960s gave great prosperity to humankind but snatched away many things of importance and in some cases caused irreversible damages. England first had the industrial revolution and Edwin Chadwick in 1842, 70 years after the industrial revolution submitted the world's first famous report on water pollution to the British Parliament. Following the start of Green revolution, ////// published by Ms. Rachel Carson indicated the toxicity of insecticides such as DDT in 1962.//////Climate change signifies the deforestation issue as a major development challenge. FAO estimates that 13 million hectares of the world's forests are disappearing annually, and that accounts for 20 per cent of all global greenhouse gas emissions. If deforestation continues at the present rate then the tropical forests may be lost by 2050. This is likely to be true, but so far no international treaty has provided any financial incentive for reduction of deforestation and degradation of the ecosystem in the tropics, except the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows investment from developed countries to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions through forestry schemes for developing countries. //////When Omar Khayyam wrote, "I desire a little ruby wine and a book of verses, just enough to keep me alive, and half a loaf is needful" in the eleventh century, he was pretty convinced that reading was one of the most important aspects in a person's happiness. After all these years, the appeal of books and reading them has remained the same. A good work of fiction or a thought-provoking poem is capable of leaving a lifetime impact on people's minds. It won't be an overstatement to say that Khayyam left some perfect lines for book lovers to apply to their thoughts on literature.//////FEBRUARY, the Bangla month of Falgun, is our precious month. It is our time of reckoning---recollecting the past and calculating the future; to renew our pledge for Bangla Bhasha. //////DR Maniruzzaman, a veteran linguist of the country, turns 70 on 15 February.

Does it really matter? After a bomb blast, trees are uprooted; buildings blown sky high; and sounds of window panes breaking are heard from afar. But have you ever heard a heart break? Buildings are reconstructed with improved looks; trees are replanted with imported saplings; but what happens to the broken heart?

People with leprosy are cured significantly with successful medical treatment. But the stigma and social isolation becomes a major concern for thousands of people who live with permanent disfigurements caused by the disease. They face more extensive social and psychological adverse impacts than many people consider. But the problem is frequently overlooked and neglected.//////Since the detection of HIV virus in 1983, scientists and researchers are trying hard to invent and explore effective weapons to fight with the deadly disease. AIDS takes away millions of lives as there is no specific treatment for cure or vaccine to prevent transmission of HIV. In quest to combat HIV/AIDS, a recent research has revealed breakthrough findings to protect body from infection.//////About 1 in every 600 children develops cancer before they reach the age 15. The cause behind childhood cancer is still relatively little known.

With little changes in your lifestyle that keep your heart healthy you can offer the big gift.//////PRESIDENT Obama could not resist blaming his predecessor for a lot of the current mishaps to shore up his declining approval rating. In his state of the union address on January 27th , his second since becoming President and given on completion of his first year in office, he said early in his address: one year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy devastated by recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt. He said that although the worst was over, deep problems remained with job loss being the most serious where 1 in every 10 Americans was unemployed.//////SRI Lanka is known to pride itself as a democratic country since it achieved its independence in1948.

The aircraft is the X-47B, being developed by Northrop Grumman under the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) program. Roughly $2 billion has been added by the Pentagon over the next five years to give the program a major boost. Most of that money, said Rear Adm. Bill Burke, was at the behest of the new Quadrennial Defence Review (QDR).//////Iran started on Monday production of two domestically-developed unmanned aerial vehicles capable of delivering high-precision bombing strikes and performing reconnaissance missions, the Fars news agency said. Iran unveiled the drones, dubbed Ra'd (Thunder) and Nazir (Harbinger), at a plant in the northern province of Mazandaran.//////HEIDI Holland subtitles her otherwise revealing work on Robert Mugabe as 'the untold story of a freedom fighter who became a tyrant.' That, if you remember, is how the West has portrayed the president of Zimbabwe for the past many years. To be sure, Mugabe has himself provided his critics with the ammunition to fire away at him. His increasing intolerance of dissent, his refusal to accept what was perceived to be a clear victory not long ago at the presidential election for Morgan Tsangvirai and his condoning of a land grab by his followers (who called themselves freedom fighters) have in a big way tarnished his reputation worldwide but especially in the West. Even so, Holland's assessment of the man who has led Zimbabwe since it achieved freedom in 1980 through the Lancaster House agreement reached the previous year appears to be directed at discovering as many signs of the 'monstrosity' Mugabe has become over the years.//////How many times has the Romeo and Juliet story been retold? Having asked that question, I'm not certain that Eritrean writer Sulaiman Addonia had Shakespeare in mind when he wrote his evocative story of two star-crossed lovers, not in Eritrea but in Saudi Arabia. However, the publishers of ////// highlight the connection to a story that depicts the near impossibility of love in such a stultifying and repressive country. The young lovers, Naser and Fiore, have Eritrean parentage, but the obstacle they encounter as foreigners attempting to fulfill their love is not familial but religious: fundamentalism.//////
