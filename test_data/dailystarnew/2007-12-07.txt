In bits and pieces we have heard about our citizens being stranded, detained, im-prisoned and deported, but only when such a consoli-dated figure appears in print that we sit up and take note. Or do we? May be we would be nudged to feel for them, perhaps only momentarily, at their plight in in-hospitable conditions and curse their gullibility in keeping faith with cheats. //////The move by the Pakistan government to send 37 judges of the Supreme Court and the various High Courts into forcible retirement spells grave danger not only for Pakistan's judiciary but also for the future of its politics. At a time when the country's politicians, law-yers and other classes of people are engaged in a strug-gle to have democracy underpin the political process, the dismissal of the judges, for dismissal it is, smacks of a crude attempt to have a pliant judicial system in place for Pakistan's rulers. //////WE eat to live, not live to eat. Try telling these lofty words to my man the court clerk and he will give a piece of his mind. With the price of rice hovering around Tk 40 per kilo, and the average price of the same amount of vegetable wobbling at Tk 20, while the prices of other essentials are keeping pace with these hikes, this man is now in a double whammy. His income has diminished since the anti-corruption drive forced him to stop charging his "facilitation fees."

He will be lucky if he lives only to eat. //////THE opposition parties are making a spectacle of themselves. The All Parties Democratic Movement, minus JUI of Maulana Fazlur Rehman, has decided that the January 8 election should be boycotted. The reason given is that it is unlikely to be free, and would only perpetuate Mr. Pervez Musharraf's rule. //////THE media worldwide abound with reports about China's economic prowess and rising military capabilities. Little noticed is China's quiet effort to build "soft power" in its long-term objective of becoming a Great Power. China has found the source of its soft power in the millennia-old Chinese language and culture. //////Sylhet had a handsome lead over Dhaka while Chittagong kept their upper hand over Khulna and Barisal took a slender lead over Rajshahi on the second day of the 9th National Cricket League across the country yesterday.//////Late Ataul Huq Mullick -- a journalist who lived in cricket -- was reportedly removed from the National Sports Awards list last year as a vice-president of the previous executive committee of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) manipulated the selection.//////With the day's practice almost over, fielding coach Salahuddin was putting up one skier after another towards Tushar Imran, the last man in the dapper coach's radar.

Mr. Masud has made several observations that deserve response from the discerning citizen of Bangladesh, more so at a time when our beloved Bangladesh is passing through a phase that will determine the future for the better or worse, depending on how the majority of the people think and act now. Whilst there is absolutely no problem with agreeing to the comments and views of Mr. Masud, however, in the final analysis he has given ample reasons to discard his recommendation as to the current course of events vis--vis priorities of the nation. For clarity, lets look at Mr. Masud's comments one by one.//////It was the most tense and eagerly awaited moment for Sri Lankans as well as the cricket lovers all over the world to watch Muttiah Muralidharan, the wizard of both off and leg spin which he called dusra, getting the highest number of wickets in Test cricket, breaking the record set by the legendary Australian Shane Warne. Muralidharan surpassed Shane Warne's record of 708 wickets by taking the wicket of Paul Collingwood of England in his home ground in Kandy, He leveled the record when he took the wicket of Ravi Bopara. But Murali had to wait patiently for his prized possession because rain delayed play. However, luck finally smiled on him. //////It has been reported that the big parties are not finding good mayoral candidates, which seems to be a problem. They encouraged the corrupt people to be in politics in the last 36 years and sidelined the good people. So the parties have created this problem. //////People, mainly in the western parts of the globe, are of the opinion that life begins at fortyand they act accordingly!

Even the girls are getting addicted to it. It is a new addition to the world of drug abuse in our country. //////University of Alabama at Birmingham Associate Professor Akhlaque Haque, Ph.D., is in Bangladesh on a mission to create that nation's first comprehensive digital maps, starting in the capital city of Dhaka. Haque, a Bangladeshi, says that currently, there are no digital maps of the city available to the public. //////Recently, some political parties have appealed to the EC to ban religion-based political parties from participating in elections. They argue that the founders of the religion-based parties are war criminals and also that allowing such parties to contest in elections will go against the secular nature of the state. Well, I am not writing in support of any proven war criminal, but I want to assert that the founders of all religion-based parties are not proven war criminals. The spirit of our liberation war was to ensure that every individual has the right to practise his/her respective religion peacefully. The constitution of Bangladesh also guarantees different political parties having different political ideologies to contest in polls with the common people reserving the right to decide which one of them should rule the country. //////After 36 years of independence a section of the population complains of total failure of Bangladesh's entire state system--socio-political and socio-economic. Unfortunately, they are correct to a certain extent. What is extremely unfortunate is that the exponents of this theory do not want to recognise even whatever little we have achieved under adverse circumstances.//////There is always a good timing to do everything in life. If anyone can hit the perfect time, he will get the best score in his life. Taking great decisions and accepting real facts of life, anyone can make his or her life peaceful, and can create a nice world.//////I strongly feel that the war criminals should have been tried long before, but the demand for such trials appear to have come at a wrong time and from the wrong people. The people who virtually established the Jamaat in national politics have now suddenly become vocal and want to put the gun on someone else's shoulder to wipe them out. One gets a strong feeling that the Jamaat, by now, has already made inroads into national politics and even if they compete independently in the coming election they are likely to become a force to reckon with. Keeping this in mind they are now out to eliminate the Jamaat on some pretext or the other. Let the people decide whether they should be eliminated or not through the ballots. The Law Adviser has rightly pointed out that they don't want to be a scapegoat to handle such a sensitive issue and those who have not tried the war criminals in the last 36 years should be taken to task first.//////Lanka warned of more Tamil Tiger attacks against civilians yesterday, a day after the guerrillas were accused of setting off a road side bomb blast that killed 16 bus passengers. //////One in every four people has been asked to pay a bribe to the police, and political parties and parliaments are the most tainted by corruption, a Transparency International study released on Thursday shows. //////A peace process in Nepal aimed at bringing Maoist insurgents into the political mainstream and ending a decade of civil war has "lost momentum", the European Union warned yesterday. //////Riot police Thursday blocked former premier Nawaz Sharif from meeting Pakistan's deposed chief justice, who is under effective house arrest for refusing to endorse emergency rule, witnesses said. //////At least 70 people were killed and 26 others trapped after an explosion at a coal mine in northern China Thursday, with the tragedy magnified by chaotic rescue work, official media said. //////The top American general in Iraq, David Petraeus, expressed satisfaction on Thursday at the progress made in Iraq but said the military was still far from any victory dance. //////The US on Thursday said it will move forward on the civilian nuclear deal whenever India is ready as it "understands" that New Delhi needs to work through the political process in the country. //////A Pakistani court yesterday granted bail to the brother of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in a nine-year-old murder case, his lawyer said. //////Troops retook two key towns from disciples of a pro-Taliban cleric in northwest Pakistan and freed dozens of people from a rebel jail set up in a girls' school, officials said yesterday. //////A military judge rejected a request Wednesday by lawyers for a Guantanamo detainee to talk to the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, thwarting their attempt to show the defendant was a minor al-Qaida figure. //////International forces in Bosnia staged a raid Thursday in the hunt for genocide suspect Radovan Karadzic, as a Serbian prosecutor said his main war crimes accomplice remained elusive. //////An Indian Hindu nationalist leader accused of failing to stop deadly 2002 religious riots has sparked fresh controversy by saying an innocent Muslim man killed by police "got what he deserved." //////Sajid-Bin-Doza, 34, an architect by profession who is also studying at BUET, is having his remarkable exhibition of sketches titled Entity at Gallery Zoom and Caf Veranda of Alliance Francaise, Dhaka.

We do not know when and where to start again" was what I heard from most of the people of the devastated areas that I visited last week. Manikhali, Betaki and Amtali are the three places that I along with a few others visited after the ravaging cyclone Sidr, which razed everything on the fateful night of November 15. //////OUT in the ravaged fields, days after Cyclone Sidr hit Bangladesh, the devastation was everywhere. Flattened houses, crops, trees, dead livestock and, sadly, also people. Yet even more evident was the resilient Bangladeshi spirit. //////PRESIDENT Bush, in his news conference this week, said "nothing's changed" about the U.S. approach to Iran. On the contrary, everything has. What the U.S. president failed to acknowledge was that there had been an earthquake in Washington, which came in the form of this week's new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran. The most immediate impact is that the NIE resolved the big question hanging over the last 12 months of Bush's troubled tenure as president: will he attack Iran? The answer now is almost certainly no. The report also means that a host of international actors who are not necessarily friendly to America -- from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Russia's Vladimir Putin to Mohamed ElBaradei, the controversial head of the International Atomic Energy Agency -- come out looking like winners. America's reputation in the world is the biggest loser.//////
