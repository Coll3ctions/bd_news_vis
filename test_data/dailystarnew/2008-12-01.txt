The event was officially inaugurated on Friday with the chief adviser of the caretaker government cutting the ribbon. The celebrations would continue for three years to mark the grand occasion. Founded by the Mughals in 17th century, Dhaka saw rapid growth during the British Raj in the late 19th and early 20th century, a period when many eye-catching office buildings and residential quarters were built and concrete roads constructed. Residents were introduced to electricity, telephone and automobiles, and new destinations were brought under the railway and steamer network. For the first time in late '30s and early '40s new residential enclaves were built up in a planned way. In fact, by the 40s Dhaka became a modern city worth its name. Lofty trees, large ponds and playgrounds became some of the integral features of Dhaka.//////A hiatus of two years after despicable rule has done wonders by resuscitating a comatose BNP back to life. During the period, much of its misdeeds and miasma have been buried under the thick crust of the shifting sands of time and obfuscated by the nation's collective amnesia. None of the excesses perpetrated by the so- called Hawa Bhaban is put to question; neither is the high-handedness of Tariq Zia or Babar a subject of scrutiny anymore. //////AT long last, the nation heaved a sigh of relief.

people. Having said that, an analysis of the problem is also required by sane minds. The primary reason for terrorism in the world-- be it in India, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, or Sri Lanka etc-- is for control of territory or creation of a State, and has nothing to do with establishing supremacy of one religion over another. Once such control of territory is established we have secondary terrorism between the sects of the same religion, or majority versus minority conflicts within the same territory ( Taliban type versus moderate Muslims or other minority; Shia v, Sunni, or say revivalist Hindus v. secular Hindus, or Muslims etc).//////Arsenic was first detected in Bangladesh in 1984. During that period about 2,500 shallow tube-wells were tested in 34 districts out of which each and every tube-well was detected arsenic contaminated.

It is also marked that the most affected area in Bangladesh is North Bengal. Thousands of people in Bangladesh are suffering from arsenic poisoning and more are being affected every day.//////To escape the vicissitude of consumerism in the industrialised West, the Asia countries should increase trading within Asia, to be more independent of external capitalistic tendencies.

Yes, change we need, indeed.//////I was dumbfounded when I saw the news in The Daily Star. How desperate and strong the Islamist groups are now that they can force the government to remove sculptures from an important place. This was a good step by the government to set up sculptures on airport premises. This step would reflect our rich culture to foreigners. But our government has failed. Now my question is if our government is scared about Islamist groups, then can't we guess a time when these groups will try to destroy the memories of the war of liberation? //////I am one of the hundreds of victims of session jams which took away valuable time from my life during my days as a student at Dhaka University in the 80s. I am proud that the general students of my university did play a pivotal role in ridding the nation of the autocratic regime of Ershad's military junta. I do applaud the leadership of several political leaders at Dhaka University at that time. But I also do recall the killings that took place in gun battles during that time. The whole nation knows the names of several groups that were actively involved in militant politics on Dhaka University campus during that time. Many of the leaders of the so-called armed groups are now engaged in national politics openly. No cases were filed against them and serious allegations are there against the inactive role of the police in those forgotten cases of criminal nature. We have forgotten names like Mamun, Mirza, Bosunia, Shaheed and many others who are now dead. Law might have forgotten to take action against the perpetrators of such criminal activities but we, as the students of the then Dhaka University, have not and will not forget their names. //////Professor S M A Faiz, Vice Chancellor, Dhaka University while inaugurating a two-day 'Teaching seminar on child rights' recently urged all to come forward to protect the basic rights of children, which include right to education. Terming children as the future of the country, Prof. Faiz emphasized the need for resolving the problems being faced by them.//////As usual it started very well. Grassroots leaders chose their candidates democratically. Hope and enthusiasm flushed in the faces of dedicated workers of the AL, the party set to participate and win the election. But soon the dirty cat came out of the bag. In many places the weakest of the five was nominated, whereas in other places persons not recommended by grassroots leaders got the ticket. Some were selected not on the basis of their popularity but on the weight of their purse. It is rumoured that the AL nominated 122 candidates ignoring their chance of success. In many places non-locals have been planted, which irked the local workers. In urban and metropolitan areas transplantation may work but in a rural constituency such adventure will definitely backfire. The weight of the opposition candidates is also not taken into account in fielding candidates.//////People of the United States of America made history by electing Barack Obama a black young man as their President for the first time. The entire world, with great enthusiasm, cherished the victory of Barack Obama.//////A news item in some newspapers stated, Bangladesh Railway has agreed to suspend rail operations between Tejgaon and Kamalapur stations during the peak travel hours to reduce tailback in the capital. The move follows a recent request from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police to the railway authorities for assistance in mitigating huge tailbacks that become a common feature in the capital city. According to DMP, many of the city's roads are too frequently blocked for trains arriving at or leaving Kamalapur Railway Station. //////I have long been contemplating to write on the disabled. Disability related writing is normally done by persons who are not disabled. Long ago I read an article by Sylvia Mortoza in which she narrated the miserable plight of her being paralysed. As she was a victim, her description was very authentic. It was a tragic part of life for an outstanding columnist and a prolific writer like Mrs. Mortoza when she was unable to put her signature on a piece of paper. An active women as she was, it was her traumatic experience when she could not longer be caring for her own or others' emotional and physical needs. The thought of being helpless and dependent on others was simply horrifying but this was what happened to her.//////Outrage in India over the Mumbai attacks risks sparking a dangerous escalation in tensions with Pakistan, analysts say, even as Islamabad cautions against any knee-jerk reaction.//////Warning of mounting tension with India in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks, Pakistan's security apparatus has said that up to one lakh troops could be redeployed along the border with India after diverting them from fighting militants in the restive Afghan frontier.//////The only gunman captured during the Islamist attacks on Mumbai has provided testimony of the operation's links to a Pakistan-based militant group, Indian press reports said yesterday, quoting intelligence sources.//////This crowded, bustling financial capital, wracked by three days bloodshed, slowly began puling itself back together Sunday as a once-besieged restaurant reopened its doors and Indians mourned their dead.//////The Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel in Mumbai had been warned of a possible terrorist attack and had temporarily beefed up security, but nothing could have stopped the gunmen, Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group that owns the hotel, said in an interview broadcast yesterday.//////A suicide attack near a German diplomatic convoy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul left three Afghan civilians dead yesterday as 20 other people, most of them insurgents, were reported killed in other unrest.//////Thanks to India.
