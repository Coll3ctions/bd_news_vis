Based on the fossilized remains of the skull and jaw bones, it is presumed to be one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs ever to be found. It might be the long lost relative of the legendary predator, the mighty T-Rex. Details of the research, which have been published online in the 1st April edition of the scientific journal Cretaceous Research, testimonies that the ancient creature has been named "Zhuchengtyrannus magnus", meaning the Great Tyrant from Zhucheng, chiefly because the bones were found in the city of Zhucheng, in eastern China's Shandong province. It is this very site that holds one of the largest concentrations of dinosaur bones in the whole world. According to Paleontologists, this is because this very area was a large flood plain where many dinosaur bodies were washed together during floods which eventually started the process of fossilization of their remains. Given the fact that only portions of the skull and jaw bones (so far) have been recovered, the team of researchers was successful in estimating the size of the ancient beast. Measuring about 11 meters long (36 feet), 4 meters tall (13 feet) and weighing about 6 tones (13,000 pounds, equivalent to that of a school bus), Zhuchengtyrannus magnus (Z. Mag from now on) belongs to the group of gigantic theropods called tyrannosaurines, the Jurassic creature which roamed N. America and Eastern Asia during the late Cretaceous period that lasted from 99 to 65 million years ago. They were especially known for their small arms, two-fingered hands and large powerful jaws that could deliver brutally powerful and bone-crushing bites. //////A study has shown that reed warblers - a cuckoo host species - are less likely to attack more "hawk-like" cuckoos.//////In the eerie bluish-purple depths of an Antarctic lake, scientists have discovered otherworldly mounds that tell tales of the planet's early days.//////A tiny sea mollusk uses eyes made of a calcium carbonate crystal to spot predators lurking above, researchers say of the first such rocky lenses found in the animal kingdom.//////A time capsule is a cache of goods / information created to serve as a mode of communication with people in the future.
