But for the people of the coastal districts, it proved to be a bane rather than a blessing as the low in the Bay behind the rain caused tidal surges that inundated some 52 villages in Cox's Bazar. In Patuakhali, on the other hand, the tidal surges damaged flood protection dam washing away Aman crops in the field and fishes in the hatcheries causing huge loss to fish stock and the crops. The experience has quite upset the traditional pattern of agricultural farming which depends to a large measure on the knowledge of the farmers about the seasonal cycles. But the recent changes in that seasonal pattern, a phenomenon called 'climate change', has caught our peasants off-guard. They can no more plan their cultivation and cropping strategy ahead of the appropriate times for the different stages of the cropping seasons. Worse still, their age-old knowledge of preparedness against the vagaries of nature such as drought, downpour, floods and the seasonal storms and tornadoes -- which, too, they could predict from the movement of the winds and the clouds -- has lost its usefulness and efficacy in the face of the recent global shift in the climatic pattern. But agriculture is still the mainstay of the livelihood of 60 per cent of the population. This population, the vast majority of whom are farmers, also feed the entire nation. So, it is the turn of the nation, especially its leaders and policymakers, to provide the farmers with the scientific know-how to cope with the challenge posed by 'climate change'. The government and all other stakeholders will have to work in concert to provide the farmers with the technical know-how and resources to adapt themselves gradually to the climate change. The experiences of the successive years call for urgent steps on the part of the government to undertake such a process forthwith. Otherwise natural calamities like Aila, Nargis along with sudden floods and torrential rains will continue to deal blows to the farming community. The incessant rain over the last few days should be a wake-up call for the government to swing into action. The non-stop rain that has upset the city life will be over within a day or two as forecast by the meteorological department. But that should not make us complacent and forgetful of the bigger picture of climate change and our compulsions to face it right now.//////The recent arrest of a large number of militants in Bangladesh is both good and bad news.

On the occasion, the organisation arranged a three-day programme highlighting recitation, titled Joog Jog Joog, at the Shawkat Osman Memorial Auditorium, Central Public Library, in Dhaka. //////Events like book fairs play an important role in generating interest in books, developing reading habits and encourage new readers. Unfortunately however, most major book fairs are held in the capital while readers in other parts of the country remain sidelined. Reputed publication houses should expand on the divisional and district levels to encourage the national reading habit -- speakers at the opening of a book fair, organised by the publication house 'Oitijhyo', said. The programme was held at the premises of Sylhet Press Club on Thursday.//////Hollywood star Johnny Depp has made an unannounced visit to a London primary school after receiving a letter from one of its pupils.//////Suraj Bhopa is a folk healer and musician from village Nanglimega, Alwar district, Rajasthan, North India.

We move around so much that the children cannot go to school most of the time, he laments.//////The pathetic recurrent reality of extra-judicial killing has once again attracted attention and, thus, The Daily Star editorial concern on such aberration comes as no surprise. The question that should engage thinking minds is, shall such deviation continue to be a part of our law enforcement culture? Alternately, one could ask as to how we have arrived at a situation wherein it is becoming extremely difficult to de-link a lawful outfit from an unlawful practice. //////No doubt, there has been peace and tranquillity in India after the judgment on the Babri masjid-Ram janambhoomi dispute. No untoward incident has taken place in the country. But the credit for this must go to the Muslims who, although generally sullen, have abided by their earlier declaration that they would accept the court's decision and go to the Supreme Court if they felt aggrieved. And they have declared that they will go in for an appeal.//////Ominous crises of mythic proportions have taken hold over the country, breaking down hopes and aspirations of the people. Foremost among them is the simmering political crisis. The administration, leaders of political parties and their operators do not act on the basis of rational discussion and orderly action. The rule of reason or a consensus seems to be an illusion. They continue to be the guiding spirit in newspapers, public speeches of the leaders and seminars. //////If Bangladesh has to establish democracy quickly its major parties, the AL and the BNP, will have to work together to make amendments in the constitution and the election procedures. Without such an effort the present negative practices in its democracy may continue and the common people will never be able to see establishment of a true democracy in Bangladesh. //////Many people tell you to make back-up copies of your computer files. Don't listen to them. I did, and this is what happened. //////Bangladesh has lost her last stadium size forest'- this may be a newspaper headline after few decades. The forces of over-population are invading the natural habitats, hastening the demise of the forests. During the past 40 years, close to 70 percent of the forest coverage has been cut down -- more than in the whole of previous 250 years since the British colonization began. Due to high population density and sharply skewed distribution of land, the forest resources are overexploited. //////Over the course of the 20th century, the automobile rapidly developed from an expensive toy for the rich into the de facto standard for passenger transport. The development of the automobile built upon the transport revolution started by railways, and like the railways, it introduced sweeping changes in infrastructure, manufacturing and legislation. The wide reaching effects of automobiles on everyday life, however, have been a subject of much controversy. Proponents on one end of the spectrum claim the car is a marvel of technology that has brought about unprecedented prosperity, while opponents on the other end claim it leads to a mode of urban and suburban planning that discourages walking and human interaction, uses large amounts of polluting fuel, etc. In this assignment, I try to find the impacts of car dependency and the solutions.//////Let us suppose for a moment, in an on-going teaching session on the English Romantic poets, a traditional teacher asks his or her learners: Can you accurately spell out the full name of Byron? What may be the potential responses? My present experience as a university teacher in English suggests, at least eighty per cent of them will fail to give a right answer. It is not because the name is difficult but because today, very few students have the propensity to research into writers they study in each semester. Moreover, forgetting names of writers, teachers, relatives, friends, colleagues and acquaintances is now almost endemic in casual learners. Senior English teachers will certainly bear me out that it had been customary in our time to dig out the essential details of writers' lives before their texts were taken up for explication. However, let me answer the question for those who stumble in recalling Byron's name in full. It is George Gordon Lord Byron who was the most 'flamboyant' among the British poets and is rated as a true embodiment of literary Romanticism.//////There is a certain charm in the chime and resonance of a sounding bell. While the chime chills you with a soothing effect, the dings leave their continued and long-lasting resonance. Long-lasting, I said, not ever-lasting, did you notice? And that is because, however a sounding bell reverberates, you simply do not let yourself lost into it. In our practical lives, we are rather keen to make a meaning of all these bells around, be it in the schools or exam halls, in offices or households, of one from a Monday church or from a rickshaw at our back, simply because we know they carry actions associated with them.//////How could you make handles like these?//////Sir?//////What's the deal with this 'sir' business of yours? Can't you see how fat I have become? Do you think I can sit with my legs clung to each other for ten straight hours!//////No, Sir!//////You guys lack common sense, which by the way has become so uncommon.////// Sir!//////If these handles were a bit slimmer, I would have been able to stretch out a bit. That's what I have been trying to tell you.//////Sir! The carpenter's wife has been suffering from some sort of girly sickness. He is off to Diamond Harbor  on leave for the last fifteen days.//////Let him go to hell! This is not a job for old haggards anyway. Do you know that three-fourths of a working man's life are spent in his office chair? Is it too much to ask for a boss to ask for a comfortable chair?//////Sir, I will return in another two weeks, and cut these handles down to size.//////Thank you. You don't have toby that time fungi will grow in my crotch. Please leave.//////Sir!//////Haripad!//////Big Boss presses his calling bell. Haripad appears.//////What's the deal with you guys?//////Sir?//////What 'Sir'? For how many days do you think I need to strive for a single chair? The chair for an officer is everything. He does things sitting in his chair, and if that chair is not okay nothing is okay. You can't even fix that chair. See//////Mental illness can be called the invisible illness. Often, the only way to know whether someone received a diagnosis with a mental illness is if they tell you. Having someone in the family mentally sick or being oneself with any psychiatric disorder is still stigmatised.//////British physiologist Robert Edwards, whose work led to the first test-tube baby, won the 2010 Nobel prize for medicine, the prize-awarding institute announced recently. Sweden's Karolinska Institute lauded Edwards, 85, for bringing joy and hope to the more than 10 percent of couples worldwide who suffer from infertility.//////The concept itself is relatively new in Bangladesh. In short, Palliative care means taking care of patients suffering from pain for a long time. Any patient suffering from intense pain like cancer to renal diseases or paralysis requiring long term care can get benefit from this. The objective of this is to improve the quality of life and render living acceptable.//////New research confirms that women plagued by morning sickness in early pregnancy are less likely to miscarry. But women who do not experience nausea and vomiting during their first trimester should not be alarmed, Dr Ronna L Chan of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, one of the study's authors, told. "Not all pregnant women who go on to have successful pregnancies experience nausea and vomiting early on or at all. In addition, pregnancy symptoms can vary from one pregnancy to the next, even for the same woman."//////The excitement spun by the Bangladesh government about a paradigm shift in Bangladesh-India relations following Sheikh Hasina's state visit to India in January is receding. The promises made by India have either been slow in coming or where given, the Indian concessions have not been properly reflected in the media, particularly in Bangladesh. //////When the Egyptian-born theologian, Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, died on 18 October 1505 it is said that, his reputation as a scholar and the aura of godliness which were already his during his lifetime, then reached their zenith; his clothes were bought as if they were relics. Although he lived for only sixty years, a 1983 study credits him with the authorship of 981 works the central message of which was everything is based on the Qur'an.//////WASHINGTON: Pakistan appears to have stepped up construction of a new atomic reactor that could help the country produce easier-to-deliver nuclear weapons, a US research institute said Tuesday.//////TAIPEI: Taiwan's vice defence minister warned that China represented an increasing threat to the island's security despite improving ties between the former bitter rivals, Taipei-based media reported Tuesday.//////Quietly tucked away in the rather bland environs of Toronto, Canada, a high quality literary journal called Bangla Journal has been making its yearly presence felt for over a decade. The editor of the magazine, Prof. Iqbal Hasnu, is from Bangladesh but his audience is from all over the Bengali-speaking world. While many journals carry a distinct geo-national identity mark, Iqbal Hasnu has crossed these boundaries by choice and in the process has even brought closer common interests, concerns and interests of the two peoples living in Bangladesh and West Bengal. And it is bi-lingual to boot. Since its debut in 1999, first as a twice yearly and now an annual, the Bangla journal has reached a point of excellence in a mature cultural space. //////Sparks certainly knows how to tug the reader's heart strings! A rich assortment of characters, romance, intriguing plot and mystery make The Guardian a book that is to be read by holding one's breath till the end comes. The saga continues to fill the heart with the joy of reading and excitement bubbles even long after reading the book!//////Binod Bihari Chowdhury, the iconic revolutionary figure of the subcontinent, turned one hundred on 10 January this year. By all accounts yet a young man, he has produced a book called Ognijhora Dingulo (The Flaming Days) through dictation where he has deliberated on his long as well as told and untold stories of his eventful life. There is no doubt that the publication of the book will help us learn more about this centenarian figure who has observed the three phases of the evolution of the Bengali nation the British era, the Pakistan era and the present Bangladesh era and thus has made himself an erudite figure in the historical perspective. //////Crass commercialism seems to be taking over at Dhaka's Aziz Market. What used to be a place for books, for good conversation, could soon be a thing of the past, forced out by boutiques and beauty parlours. Ask any bookshop owner there. They will tell you they cannot cope with any more increases in rent. The boutiques and the parlours can, of course. And there's the rub. Your reading is going down. And now it is the bookstores that are an endangered species. But let us talk of reading, for now. //////
