weeks much discussion has gone on about the alleged links of qaumi madrasas to religious militancy in the country. Against this backdrop, a team of religious leaders met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday and apprised her of their grievances vis--vis some comments on qaumi madrasas allegedly made by some senior government figures. The prime minister, we are happy to note, reassured them that the comments had been taken out of context and that her government sought the cooperation of the ulema in combating religious militancy. Clearly, the meeting has proved to be a useful exercise in establishing rapport between the government and the ulema community, a move that bodes well for the country. For their part, the qaumi madrasa representatives assured the PM of their cooperation in stamping out religious militancy wherever it might surface. //////From all the discourses that we are getting to hear on the power situation prevailing in the country the impression we get is that the government is not moving fast or diligently enough to reduce the suffering of the people caused by constant power outages. And one does not even have the correct figure of actual shortage of electricity since there is an 'official' and an 'unofficial' figure. Taking the government statistic as a datum, the current shortfall remains high in spite of the 700 megawatt of additional capacity provided in the last three months; and the peak season has not yet come. //////HUMBLED in the last general election the once arrogant BNP still licks the wounds of its defeat. The party is in total disarray, with no visible initiative to reunite or reconsolidate the party split during Begum Khaleda Zia's incarceration. Amid post-electoral Awami bashing, party activists are closely watching the denouement of the catastrophe that has befallen them. In the meantime, the ruling Awami League also isn't faring any better. Mired neck-deep in the mess left by the preceding governments, it will take them far longer than many anticipated to put the polity back on the rails and devote itself seriously to the business of governance.//////WHATEVER its outcome, India's general election will be remembered for many peculiarities. First, there are no major issues at stake, no ideological contentions, and no political fault-lines. //////WHILE the BDR incident had been a real acid test for the Awami League led grand Alliance government in its first 100 days, some challenges from within the party rank and file have emerged sharply, and put it in a rather disadvantageous situation.//////Preparations for the PCL (Port City League), set to be kicked off on May 2, stepped up further yesterday with the signing of title sponsor agreement with a prominent business group.//////Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has decided to change the name of the Club Cup.//////Bangladesh Cricket Board's game development committee has yesterday suspended Shahjahan Shaju for his assault on an umpire last week.//////New Zealand left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori took three for 15 as the Delhi Daredevils won a rain-shortened Indian Premier League match against Kings XI Punjab by ten wickets at Newlands Sunday.//////Mahmudul Hasan led from the front with a steady 82 on the opening day during Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Development Squad's two-day practice match against the Sri Lanka Under-19 side at BKSP yesterday.//////Satyki Dutta spared the blushes of visiting Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) under-15 side on the final day of the two-day match against BCB under-15s that ended in a draw at the Mymensingh Stadium yesterday.//////Bangladesh Hockey Federa-tion (BHF) will get a donation of Tk 12 lakh for the Asia Cup to be held from May 9 in Malaysia.//////Pakistan are considering whether to switch a home series to New Zealand after the Black Caps refused to tour the troubled country, a cricket official said Sunday.//////Rayer Bazar and Dhanmondi Cricket Academy (DCA) banked on devastating bowling performances as they won their respective Second Division matches yesterday.//////For gnarled, one-year veterans of the Indian Premier League there will be always be Brendon and Bangalore. The bar was set so high by last year's curtain-raiser, when Brendon McCullum lit up the night sky with a pulsating 158 not out, that whatever happened today was destined to feel like an anti-climax. Sure enough, Sachin Tendulkar's unbeaten 59 from 49 balls was a model of good sense. Despite the impression given by some of its officials, the IPL can't have everything.//////The Indian Premier League started on foreign soil with an explosion of entertainment and two cricket upsets at Newlands Saturday.//////No one can accuse Bangalore Royal Challengers of not preparing properly. Their new captain, Kevin Pietersen, was on the phone repeatedly with their new coach, Ray Jennings, ahead of the tournament. Tactics were discussed, names learned. Earlier today, as Mumbai Indians got things under way against Chennai Super Kings, the pair of them were side by side in the media centre, watching, analysing, possibly fine-tuning. Neither was involved last year, when Bangalore lost 10 games out of 14, but they share a sense of responsibility now. And how.

This is the only success I can see. In reality they have added more problems to their list of what they inherited. The BDR carnage, the BCL crisis, MPs vs. upazila chairmen are some examples of what is going on. The parliamentary sessions are practically limited to a few items but no major legal reforms were initiated. The performance of parliament as of now is://////About 50% of the land in Bangladesh is classified as wetlands, and major part of this area is covered by freshwater wetlands, the total area of the wetlands of the country has been estimated at seven to eight million hectors. Wetlands of Bangladesh have great diversity, which are classified on the basis of their hydrological and ecological functions such as saltwater wetlands, freshwater wetlands (haors, baors & beels) and human-made wetlands.//////The honourable commerce minister stated that the government was going to impose restrictions on import of powdered milk in next three years' import policy to discourage its import. I would like to draw the attention of the government to consider the situation from the consumers' point of view. The BNP led government imposed high customs duty, VAT, supplementary duty, AIT, PSI etc. to discourage import of powdered milk on the plea that production of milk in the country would be increased manifold within a couple of years as a result of such measures. The government also introduced cash subsidy for cattle farmers. But the government could not continue the programme due to mismanagement of subsidy funds. In practice people did not get adequate supply of milk in the last one and a half decade. //////Economic recession has hit the whole world. Economic condition is at low ebb in most of the developed countries. The economy of a third world country like ours is interrelated with the economy of first world countries.//////What should have been done ages ago has been sent to different ministries for opinion. This is not the Friday-Sunday issue to be debated upon. If you want to save energy by closing down shops and businesses at 8:00pm, then adopt the daylight saving scheme to save more. Pushing the clock in summer by one hour, you actually save daylight. You do not need artificial light when the sun has not yet set. The statistics are as simple as that. //////For years, Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority supplied one KW of electricity with a single or multiple number of electric meters as desired by a house/building owner in Dhaka. The house/building owner purchased the required number of electric meters at a fixed price from the electricity supply office.//////Every now and then the print and electronic media cover horrifying news of sex-related crimes that are going on unabated in our society and the country as a whole. They (the occurrences of deplorable sex crimes) give us enough food for thought and at the same time raise the question as to what kind of society we have been living in.//////I have been campaigning for positive engineering solutions for a few years now and have written many articles and letters in the media. The carbon restriction appears to be a purely negative activity, the result of which seems to be too slow, tenuous and uncertain. //////I hasten to inform everybody before an accident takes place that the foot overbridge at Asad Gate is in very bad condition. The steel plates have developed holes due to rust in many places. Like this foot overbridge, many over bridges in Dhaka are in poor condition. //////As a Bangladeshi by birth we follow the BD politics with keen interest, we watch different TV channels of Bangladesh. We had the opportunity to watch segments of the proceedings of the recently concluded first session of the 9th parliament. We were very shocked to see that some members of this parliament were telling things far away from the truth. For example, they said that they have doubts that Shaheed Ziaur Rahman took part in the liberation war. We are very upset that their statements were not expunged from the parliament proceedings. What a shame for a parliament! It reinforces the common belief that the Bangladesh Awami League is run by highly biased people. //////I am angered by the government's move to dole out Tk.3,000 crore to exporters. If one looks at the genesis of this generosity(?), one can easily find that it is very easy to give away somebody else's money for bailing out the exporters. It is people's money kept in government custody. The doled out amount will ultimately benefit the consumers of the importing countries (the developed ones, who are responsible for the financial meltdown) at the cost of our hard working and often deprived common people. Our poor people, who earned this amount, will never have a chance to get its benefits.//////Transcript is essential for students who want to study abroad. But some Dhaka University staff make profit on this. I'm also a sufferer. I visited Bangladesh in August, 2008. I deposited Tk. 800 on Janata Bank for a transcript. I submitted all necessary papers to DU staff to issue the transcript on August 21, 2008 and they were supposed to send it within a month. Till today, nothing was sent. I called the staff twice in the month of October, 2008 from here (Canada) spending my scholarship money. In December, 2008 I sent one of my friends to the staff to get information. Every time they told that my transcript would be sent soon. From May, 2009 my father, who is 65 years old, is going to that man. Till today, my father met with him about 10 times, but with no outcome. //////The government has removed all the nationalist-minded officers, educationists, military officers, etc. from their positions and then put its blind supporters in those positions. Their golden boys have forced closure of many educational institutions across the country. They are saying in parliament that Shaheed Ziaur Rahman was a Pakistani agent, he did not take part in the war of liberation!! And then your cabinet has asked Begum Khaleda Zia to leave her house in the Dhaka Cantonment. Well done!! Do you know that powers of dictators are not ever lasting??//////My mother and I went for the Baishakhi shopping. The market was certainly crowded as people were engaged in shopping for the Bengali New Year. The shops had the time of their sales with several people emerging in and out of the shops with loads of shopping bags in their hands. In this very crowd while seeing a pair of earrings, I noticed a very young lady with two kids holding her hands. What surprised me was that when several people found it difficult to spare time so as to pay at least a single visit in every shop (since the shops are instructed to be shut by 8.30) this young lady was staring at the bright, colourful objects from the glass windows, not even bothering to ask the price. Just then her young daughter called out to say 'Maa. ajkeo ki amra kichoo kinbo na?' (Mother, aren't we going to buy anything even today?). The mother replied very softly- 'na maa kalke kine dibo (No, my child I'll buy you something tomorrow). Those were the only few words that a mother could say to console her daughter. The three of them didn't stand there any longer. Instantaneously, I felt my eyes watering, my heart crying out and found it difficult to shop anymore. I came out of the mall and took a deep breath. Why is that when flowers of happiness shower upon this mighty world only few are fortunate to get them while the others are turned away empty-handed?//////The Foreign Minister on Saturday, 11th April, described Bangladesh as secular with a majority Muslim population, and not a moderate Muslim state as portrayed by the international community. She further stated that the ruling Awami League, which led the nation in 1971 Liberation War against Pakistan, never believed in the idea of moderate democratic Muslim country. Both of her claims, undoubtedly, appear to be consistent with her party's fundamental policy. However, is not it the same party that pledged to the nation that, if elected to power, it would not pass any laws contradictory to the Holy Quran and Sunnah? Apart from frequent use of religious terms before the election, did not the party begin its election campaign by visiting the shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal(R) in Sylhet and seeking divine guidance? //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is loved by the majority of the people of Bangladesh which was reflected in all the elections, held lately. //////Nearly 3,000 civilians escaped from Sri Lanka's war zone and sought shelter with security forces, the defence ministry said yesterday as troops stepped up an offensive against cornered Tiger rebels.//////For all the talk of a fractured electoral mandate and important role of regional parties and their leaders, the campaign for Indian parliamentary election has so far been more about two personalities --about a Prime Minister "by accident" Manmohan Singh and his main challenger LK Advani aspiring for the top job. //////Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Sunday rejected Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad's charge that the Congress too was to blame for Babri Masjid, saying the BJP was solely responsible for the 1992 mosque demolition.//////Warning that Pakistan "is in danger", former President Pervez Musharraf on Sunday said its leadership must take cognisance of concerns expressed by world community about security situation in the country but asserted that nobody should dictate any course of action to it. //////Pakistani jets and helicopters attacked suspected militant bases in a tribal area on the Afghan border yesterday, killing at least 12 rebels, a military official said.//////President Barack Obama says America's estranged relationship with Cuba will not change overnight.

This year the organisation has planned to commemorate the day with a weeklong programme, which will commence on April 23 at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA). //////Documentary films portray reality as it is in an artistic way. Thus it can be both a living document of history and a powerful force against social injustice. Though there are several non-fictional, documentary based programmes aired on different TV channels, except on some special occasion, very few documentary films are aired on the TV channels in our country. Addressing this issue, a roundtable was held on the third day of the documentary festival, "Documenting Bangladesh 3", which began at the Central Public Library on April 16.//////Movies on Liberation War, in particular those featuring combat scenes, are few and far between. Another issue that mars this genre, according to film enthusiasts, is that these movies are mostly one-dimensional.//////To celebrate International Dance Day on April 29, dance organisation Srishti Cultural Centre (SCC) will hold a two-day dance festival at National Theatre Stage, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, starting from April 25. //////Various socio-cultural organisations and political parties in Satkhira celebrated 'Pahela Baishakh' (Bengali New Year) amidst much festivity. Cultural activists and locals observed the day with rallies, discussions, cultural programmes and 'mela.' The main rally started from Shaheed Abdur Razzak Park and went through the main thoroughfares in the town. The masked participants carried colourful festoons.//////THE present government is designing yet another "new" national education policy. This is indeed timely, especially in a globalising world in which other countries have catapulted themselves into the 21st Century by vigorously engaging in "knowledge revolution" and by developing their human resources that are aligned with the global knowledge architecture. //////WHEN a delegation from reporter's unity called on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, she told them that her government was going to construct an elevated expressway from Gazipur to Narayanganj via Tongi to ease traffic congestion of Dhaka city. She also said that there were plans to build a sky rail, a ring road and a modern river transport system around Dhaka. Earlier her communication minister told us about sub-way train service for the city.//////IN a democracy no one, not even the government, can get away with doing a wrong or not doing enough to right a wrong. Good and democratic governance over the years have taught the people to denounce and reject the wrong and espouse the right. In a democracy the judiciary, the police, the bureaucracy, the media and the civil society are so strong, independent and public welfare oriented that they would just not allow any wrong to go unaddressed and fester.//////
