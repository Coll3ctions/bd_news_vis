We were wrong. The Jamaat-e-Islami has now laid claim of a sort to the War of Liberation. For a party which actively collaborated with the Pakistan occupation army, and formed the al-Badr and al-Shams goon squads whose specific job was the abduction and killing of Bengalis, this is quite a claim. The nation would have been happy to see this new face of the Jamaat if meanwhile it had done something about its past. To suddenly appear before the country with a so-called Jatiyo Muktijoddha Parishad and tell people that Jamaat supported our Liberation War and it honours our freedom fighters seems at best a joke and at worst a travesty of history. The joke and the travesty both have been emphasised by the recent ugly incident of a genuine freedom fighter being subjected to physical assault at a meeting of the so-called parishad. //////IT is reassuring to hear from Saudi ambassador Dr Abdullah Bin Naser Al-Busairi that his country has not imposed any restrictions on hiring of Bangladeshi workers by Saudi companies.

My mother has not done any higher education like graduation or post graduation. But she is a conscious woman, I must say. This time we were talking about the voting system. She was talking about the 'no vote' system. She was very upset for not having 'no vote'. But now the government is going to introduce this process in the election. This process will help the people to express their views regarding the candidates. //////I am appalled to learn that the United States is contemplating an attack on Iran to stop the latter's nuclear programmes.//////The govt has declared pharmaceutical industry as the thrust sector. That's good news, no doubt. The country has a commendable track record and has achieved almost self sufficiency in pharmaceuticals production. Currently, at 700 million dollar, this industry has attracted huge public and media attention. Over the years, the sector has attracted overseas buyers, mostly in unregulated markets, and it has earned good reputation as a quality drug manufacturer. I am talking about top manufacturers. It is indeed encouraging when we hear about its tremendous export potential in the dailies, talk shows. With recent certifications of top 3-4 pharma facilities by major drug regulatory agencies like UKMHRA, TGA etc, the sector has reached new heights. I am not contradicting the popular notion but would like to draw your attention to some of the ground realities. The country certainly has huge potential in the pharmaceutical sector. But what have we done to realize that potential? Since the DOHA declaration, six years have elapsed. How far have we progressed in terms of infrastructure development or competitiveness? Nothing mentionable. After many years of tiring efforts by the pharma industry association, the govt. has just allocated land for the proposed central API (active pharma ingredient) facility. Isn't it quite a big lapse when the time factor is critical? Again, the industry is yet to have any bioequivalence testing facility which is mandatory for product registration in developed markets, and there is mounting pressure from even semi regulated markets for such compliance. Unless you prove that your medicine is equivalent to the originator brand in terms of safety and efficacy, by conducting bioequivalence testing in human subjects, you cannot make any foray into the regulated markets like US, EU, Australia etc. The cost of doing such test is exceedingly high in developed countries ranging from Tk 70-90 lakh per study; in India it costs around Tk 40 lakh. A central bioequivalence facility in the country can largely benefit the industry by saving foreign currency, at the same time this will significantly improve the quality of our medicines. I know the govt and the industry are currently working on this. Again the same question arises- why is the delay in taking action? Couldn't this be done much earlier? By the time the central API and bioequivalence facilities are ready, there is no clear timeline though, 2016 is knocking at the door -- the waiver period will expire without any real benefit to the industry. Having so many advantages, as many experts say, how is the industry equipped to realize them is a million dollar question. When we have generic drug producers like India and China, we will have to make double the efforts required to enter any export destination. Is India sleeping? India has over 100 US FDA-approved pharma plants, the highest number outside the US; and they are increasingly focused on R&D. //////The fuel price in our country has been hiked between 34 to 66 percent. The new price is petrol Tk 87/l, diesel 55/l and CNG 16.75/c.m. The authorities concerned have said that they had no alternative because the government could no longer afford to give the staggering amount of subsidy to the sector. Even with the price hike, the government will have to spend Tk 100 billion in subsidies on fuel over the next financial year, which is 40% of government's developmental budget. //////In western democracies, radio or TV broadcasting is not in the government's hands. Why should our government own any electronic media? The government ownership results in more disservice than providing neutral views/information to people. On behalf of the government, these media provide only the regime's views and development stories, as if all steps were good and for the people. //////We have heard arguments and counter arguments regarding holding of the upazila election before the general election.

The gathering was arranged by the Jamaat-Shibir - well-known as collaborators (in 1971) or their loyal progeny. My question is how the collaborators could collect a number of freedom fighters forming a front named 'Jatiya Muktijoddha Parishad' (National Freedom Fighters' Council)? Don't the freedom fighters know them? //////An assault on a freedom fighter means an assault on our motherland and this is exactly what some operatives of the Jamaat-e-Islami and its students' wing Shibir did on Friday with success.
