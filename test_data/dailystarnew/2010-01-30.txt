The 11th South Asian Games got underway with a dazzling opening ceremony at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday with thousand of athletes and performers taking part in the three-and-a-half hour programme.//////Seldom has a founder of a new state and the supreme leader of any independence struggle met so brutal an end as Bangabandhu. Not only was he gunned down at the prime of his life (he was only in his mid-fifties) his whole family was also killed including his 10-year-old son Russell. Both Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana would have also been killed but for their fortuitous trip to Germany. There have been other instances of assassination of leaders in history, but seldom if ever, can we find anything remotely similar as the barbarity, the brutality and ruthlessness shown in this case where the whole family was eliminated, including the two newly wed wives of Sheikh Kamal and Sheikh Jamal.//////Main opposition BNP is planning to return to parliament this week, ending its long boycott of the House since June last year.//////Bangladeshis working in Malaysia on irregular basis and staying there for over a decade will face repatriation or arrest as the country has moved for more stringent visa renewal process and a crackdown on illegal foreigners. //////Bangladesh Railway will introduce SMS ticketing service through mobile phone next month to ease sufferings of commuters. //////The government plans to form an inter-ministerial committee headed by the finance minister to regulate and monitor the activities of non-governmental organisations, said a source at the social welfare ministry. //////Over 50 people including teachers and a journalist were injured yesterday as bus workers and police clashed with students on Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (Ruet) campus and at Rajshahi bus terminal.//////The government plans to repair within March the embankments damaged by cyclone Sidr and Aila in the country's coastal areas, BBC Bangla Service reported yesterday. //////After around 20 months, the ruling Awami League holds an extended meeting today in efforts to revamp the organisation.//////Shukrana munajat was offered in all mosques across the country after Juma prayers yesterday expressing gratitude to the Almighty Allah following the execution of the death sentence of five killers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.//////Cadres of Bangladesh Chhatra League and students of Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University last night vandalised more than 100 vehicles of visitors to the International Trade Fair, looted valuables and clashed with police, injuring at least 20 persons including law enforcers.//////Saiduzzaman Pasha, who was photographed brandishing a firearm during the clash between Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal factions at Dhaka University, is an ex-army man, Detective Branch of Police officials said.//////Six Nepali players and an official have been injured when an "overloaded" elevator at Hotel Imperial adjacent to the Bangabandhu National Stadium crashed just hours before the start of the opening ceremony of the 11th South Asian Games yesterday.//////Bangladesh women football team's bid to win the gold medal of the South Asian Games suffered an early blow when they were beaten 1-0 by Nepal at Birshreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium yesterday.//////Former British prime minister Tony Blair acknowledged yesterday that Saddam Hussein didn't become a bigger threat after September 11, but said his perception of the risk posed by terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction was dramatically changed by the attacks.//////Awami League leader and a former member of Union Parishad was hacked to death by criminals yesterday afternoon in Hossainpur upazila of Kishoreganj district. //////As the section 144, clamped following a clash between hawkers and traders on Thursday, continued for the second day yesterday Reazuddin Bazar and its adjoining areas wore a deserted look.//////A Habiganj court awarded life imprisonment to four persons on Thursday for throwing acid on a housewife over land disputes. //////The success of talks this year to salvage a global climate accord hinges on money, Mexico's President Felipe Calderon said yesterday, urging executives at the World Economic Forum to pay more to fight climate change.//////More than a dozen Asian nations aim to double the numbers of wild tigers by 2022 and prohibit the building of roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that could harm their habitats.//////al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden blamed industrial nations for global warming, and urged a boycott of the US dollar to end "slavery," in an audio tape aired by Al-Jazeera television on Friday.//////All preparations have been completed for holding the fourth convocation of Jahangirnagar University today.//////REPORTS have it that illegal trade in primary and secondary school textbooks, meant for free distribution among the students in the districts and upazilas, is going on in the different book markets of the city. Such sales by some quarters in the market in collusion with a section of dishonest education officials in the districts have put a clear challenge before the government's stated policy of zero-tolerance against any irregularities in the distribution of the textbooks by the end of this month. //////FACED with the crisis of ever shrinking land-man ratio, meeting the constitutionally guaranteed basic human need of a shed over every citizen's head is becoming a big challenge before the policymakers. The challenge is still bigger in cities, where rural migrants--people dislodged from their village homesteads for various reasons, environmental or otherwise--are flocking to in droves and landing in the unhealthy shanties. //////WE have recently had an important regional conference in Dhaka -- the 'Asia-Pacific Policy Dialogue' -- on the 'Brussels Programme of Action.' It was of particular interest to me as I was closely involved on behalf of Bangladesh (as its Ambassador in Brussels) in the deliberations carried out during the Third UN Conference on the LDCs held in May 2001 in that city.//////THE 4th convocation of Jahangirnagar University (JU) is to be held today, on Saturday, January 30, 2010. The university that I proudly headed once is about 40 years old. It implies that the campus so far embraced one convocation every 10 years. This is undoubtedly not good news as far as formal awarding of degrees to the students is concerned. In other countries, and even in private universities in our country, convocation is considered to be an integral part of the performance of the university. Convocation is a dream for students and that dream should not be dashed to the ground. //////The 11th South Asian Games, the biggest sporting extravaganza of the region, got underway at the Bangabandhu National Stadium yesterday with a spectacular opening ceremony marked by great fanfare and enthusiasm. A spectacular cultural show, a scintillating aquatic display caught the audience gripped while the dazzling pyrotechniques lit up the night sky of Dhaka bringing the perfect ending to a three-and-a-half hour spectacle.//////Hosts Bangladesh will look to put up a spirited show when they take on Nepal in their first Group A match of the football event of the South Asian Games at the Bangabandhu National Stadium today.//////Roger Federer cruised into his 22nd Grand Slam final with an effortless straight sets win over listless Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Australian Open on Friday.//////Justine Henin's fairytale is set to collide head on with Serena Williams's reality when the pair resume their fierce rivalry in the Australian Open women's final on Saturday.//////Fast bowler Mashrafe Bin Mortaza's departure for New Zealand for the T20 & ODI series was delayed due to his fever.//////Khulna continued their excellent run in the National Cricket league when they handed a 179-run defeat to Barisal at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium yesterday. //////A big colourful rally was brought out from Nirala in the afternoon on the occasion of the inauguration of the eleventh South Asian Games (SAG) yesterday.//////Australia mercilessly ripped through a feeble Pakistan at the WACA to keep alive the prospect of inflicting upon the tourists only their second 5-0 whitewash in ODIs. Michael Hussey and Nathan Hauritz starred with the bat, before Ryan Harris tore through the batting with a second successive five-for to set up a crushing 135-run win. Remarkably, given how poor Pakistan have been in this country, this was Australia's first win over them in an ODI in Perth.//////Michael Clarke has raised doubts over the types of balls that could be used for day-night Tests and outlined his concerns about batting under lights. Cricket Australia is trialling pink and white balls in domestic Second XI games this week as it attempts to find ones that can last for 80 overs.//////Kepler Wessels is convinced a strong batting line-up and Graeme Smith's 'strong personality' will hold South Africa together and help them tide over the coaching crisis on their tour to India.

Sea-level rise as a consequence of global warming is caused by increase in seawater temperatures resulting in thermal expansion of water and melting of glacier and polar iceberg (Kennedy et. al. 2002). The climate change has already affected the ecosystems of northern hemisphere including the coastal forests.//////When biotic factors, abiotic-biotic and biotic-biotic interactions, biotic-biotic association stand responsive to forecast future happening by the cause of climatic changes or of any changes in any ecological area or in an ecosystem then the factors/interactions/association may be called the biotic-indicators. Use of biotic-indicators is applicable in taking mitigation approaches to combat calamities caused because of unusual climatic changes. This is applicable especially in the case of forest conservation and for the conservation of forest biodiversity. //////All journeys have destinations both to and from. There are physical and emotional aspects involved in all such journeys but when added to those is yet another aspect, that is, the spiritual, that makes all the difference. Such a journey that is wrapped in an essence of metaphysical or transcendental realm does not have a full stop. It keeps on calling the seeker time and again. An ecstatic state of the mind is felt, a state of unfulfilment stirs up an urge to make one's purpose more meaningful by repeating the path not only to make it more in terms of mere number but also to make it better, to make it near-perfect, which can very well be described as the best way of elevating oneself spiritually. After all, are not we all spiritual beings? The Holy Kaabah as it stands in the middle of Masjid al-Haram as an epitome of highest level of spirituality, bears witness to an expression of intense urge of human hearts converging there from all corners of the globe round the year for centuries together. //////On the weekends she became the Avon lady selling cosmetics door to door to unattractive suburban wives. She often laughed when she told me stories from that time. She would say with her soft and husky voice, "Frankie, those women thought I was a gene and I could make them beautiful for their husbands with greasy fingernails." I didn't know what she meant by that but I laughed with her anyway. My mother told all these stories about her young life and struggling family while she was setting up her art studio when we moved into our new home. //////Just think of it for a moment. Isn't it a puzzle that in spite 'of declining reading and downsized bookshops' book launch events are so much the 'in' thing these days? Publications of new books call for celebrations, and this is what is happening every day in Dhaka.//////Through the twilight zone, through mist and haze//////She plods on, as sunray and cloudshade play //////Hide and seek with the dreamland of her face.//////A tired face, with exhausted contentment, is poetry//////The world reads this wild afternoon.//////Wrapped in pieces of unspent pleasure//////I paused to touch the palette of silence, the desire//////I drifted inward to the consciousness of pain //////And then, appeared a visage in the morning rain//////THERE are important lessons to be learnt for Bangladesh from the Japanese experience with secret deals. While the LDP was in power for over five decades, except for a brief period in 1993, there was persistent accusation from the opposition with considerable public support that Japan had entered into secret deals with USA on security. However, the LDP led government was not willing to lend credence to those accusations and perceptions without being able to prove there were no secret deals. When the LDP lost power in the elections last September to the Democratic Party of Japan, one of the first tasks of the new Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada was to instruct the Foreign Ministry for a report about the secret deals. He gave his Ministry a year to come up with its findings, acknowledging the fact that it is easy to accuse about existence of secret deals but quite another thing to prove it. //////WITH 30,000 American and 7,000 NATO additional troops, it still difficult to judge which way Afghanistan is going. There is no cut and dry situation in the treacherous war that is increasingly asking for more blood and money. Americans are getting jittery because of few thousand casualties suffered since 9/11 on both fronts. No matter how sophisticated and overbearing the position is it is irrational to think of counterterrorist effort without a price tag in blood and money. Military compulsion in Afghanistan and political expediency in Washington appears on a collision course. The fallout of war on US economy and politics in the sensitive midterm election at the yearend remains as unpredictable as the outcome of the surge of additional troops in Afghanistan. //////India has decided to end its four-year self-imposed embargo on supplying small arms to Nepal and plans to provide the country with a range of assault rifles, machine guns, pistols and revolvers in addition to bomb-detection and disposal equipment.//////The US appears unwilling to stop selling arms to Taiwan despite aggressive lobbying and pressure from China. Sources in Taipei and Washington have confirmed the United States is preparing the release of US congressional notifications for new arms on hold since the Bush administration.//////As I have taught in colleges, including cadet colleges, and as my present position assigns me to work with and for secondary school teachers, Samir Ranjan Nath's ////// easily drew my attention, making me read it more than once. The information presented in the book seems very relevant, necessary and fruitful for those who work in education. //////The Bangla literary giant Shomoresh Majumdar holds the reader completely engrossed with the gripping story told in //////. The characters and the plot of the story are so real that the reader feels as if he or she is witnessing the events as they unfold with each page. The story is a spellbinding drama of a family that comes out of the stereotyped roles of men and women. It is about a young woman, Titir, who finds the courage to go out of the four walls of her home defying the old conventions and finding a place of her own in the outside world. //////India remains, especially for people in the West, a land of mystery and mysticism. Paul Hyland happens to be one of those drawn to a land that is noted as much for its political history as its cultural heritage. Hyland focuses on the latter, a particular reason being that his ancestors once made what was, back in the 1830s, an arduous trip to India and then stayed on to breathe in the aroma and the pungency of a country as varied in its landscape as it was, and is, in its cultural diversity. The author's hundred year-old grandmother, not in the best of health in Devon, perks up when grandchild Joy speaks of Narsapur. And Narsapur is what the centenarian associates with her own past. For she was born Lily Bowden 'at Kakinada, on the eastern delta of the River Godavari which flows into the Bay of Bengal'. As Hyland takes care to let readers know, only forty years earlier, her grandfather William Bowden had been an apprentice stonemason in Barnstaple but soon took off, along with his newly-wed wife, for Madras.//////Once again, the Jaipur Literature Festival brought the world of books to life. Jaipur in January has become the spot to air ideas, to hear fresh voices, and to enjoy the simple pleasures of writing, reading and intelligent debate.

Bangladesh's Shazia Omar, author of ////// who was invited to attend, was recognized as a 'star' at the show by one of the festival organizers and fellow writer, William Dalrymple, in India's Outlook magazine. //////
