//////Detained Sylhet city mayor Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran quit his party position yesterday. //////Four Jatiya Party (JP) leaders here were expelled from the party for doing anti-party activities, JP

After long 56 years,  what we have  achieved is a question to many including myself as far as speaking Bangla is concerned. Majority of Bangladeshis hardly speak Bangla in their daily life. What we all speak is some sort of distorted Bangla in local (Ancholik) accent. //////Our four National Leaders, Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M Mansur Ali, and AHM Qamaruzzaman (we remember them with due respect)) were killed inside Dhaka Central Jail on November 3, 1975. But only one man is responsible for their deaths! It's heartbreaking and shameful news undermining the sacrifice of the leaders who laid down their lives for our country. //////The judicial pronouncement of a  bench of the High Court  has curtailed  the authority of  the president  to appoint the  judges.  By this judgment the court has  ensured   the freedom and prestige of  the judicial department and has closed the door of  the executive branch  to exert  influence  on appointment of judges. This judgment is very important.  In  the past,   we saw  that every government   exerted  influence on all such matters. This tendency of the governments has created a lot of controversy.  In these circumstances, such a verdict was much expected. So, we welcome this epoch-making verdict and hope that it will ensure the freedom of the  judicial department. //////It is important to know what steps  are being taken to avoid  the loss of land  and maintain navigability  of all the rivers round  the year. //////I am writing about the incident that took place on the Dhaka university campus and in the adjacent areas of it,  following the news of Tarique Rahman's injury,   which is totally unacceptable. The people who had vandalised the taxicab and set it on fire, that left one businessman dead, are the so-called students of the university. They remain in the university year after year as student  to serve their political parties' interest.//////Saarc  having entered the 24th year of its existence  is now a full  grown  youth. Unfortunately, Saarc  hardly achieved anything whatsoever to go ga-ga over or write home about.//////On the eve of participation in any international competition, the officials always say that it is not the prize,  rather the participation is the main objective and  spirit of the game. We have been hearing this since  the independence of our country. And thus we are always satisfied with our dismal results in almost every competition. Our results are bad even in SAF games,  let alone Commonwealth or Olympics. //////I would like to comment on the much  expected release of the immediate past  prime minister  Begum Khaleda Zia and her eldest son Tarique Rahman. From the very beginning of the anti corruption  drive,  the present  military backed interim government  arrested a large number  of veteran politicians, including BNP, AL, Jamaat chiefs who  were imprisoned for several months.   AL president Sheikh Hasina along with  Jamaat Amir Moulana Motiur Rahman Nizami were released after a couple of months. Unfortunately,  BNP chief  Begum Khaleda Zia is yet to be released. //////The historic Uttara Gonobhavan  in neglected northern region, consisting of a total of sixteen districts, has been functioning as another presidential palace since the days of President  Ayub Khan of  Pakistan.//////Bangladesh earned fame in terms of establishing some well-equipped reputed hospitals.  Some of them are highly expensive and one has to pay through the nose. Still people  try  to admit their dear ones in such  hospitals with the  hope of getting better medicare. Alas!! The doctors here pay little attention to the past history of the disease and remain concerned  only with the present complaints of the patients. As such it further deteriorates the condition of patients. So instead of being cured,  mostly the patients return home unwell due to improper treatment. The so-called consultants have manifold explanations in support of their misdeeds.  //////It is learnt from the newspaper that Shibir cadres assaulted the RU acting VC and some other teachers on 08 July, 2008,  when they went to request the Shibir men to withdraw a road barricade on Dhaka-Rajshahi highway at Binodpur Bazar in Rajshahi. This attack  was outrageous  and  has been condemned by all.//////Harassment in the government institutions is a very common  in our country. We live in a free country but when we have to go to the government offices, we at once forget about the feeling of freedom  due to the rude behaviour of the government officials. We hoped that this government would  change the situation,   but they  disappointed us. It is really sad to know that even a peon can harass a  common citizen  easily. It is because there is no transparency in the activities of government institutions. Without transparency, it will be impossible to think about a welfare state. We see that still so many corrupt officials have been retained in their respective jobs and they seem to be above the law. This kind of disparity encourages corruption all the way. Such  indulgence always delivers  a negative message for our next generation. The prime condition of a welfare state is  social  justice.  The government's  attitude should never be negative  but we see here the situation is  totally different. When a government official does anything offensive, the government will try hard to save him from the allegation  and  sometimes we saw  that such officials  were  rewarded for their  misdeeds. It shows that we are really a failed state.//////I am an international student working part time for a security company. It's a twelve hour night shift. Today I am in a construction site. Whenever I am in a construction site I am really bored. But nowadays I  have  a laptop and mobile broadband modem. I can listen to music, have a peep in youtube, and,   most important of all,  I can browse all the newspapers from Bangladesh. Before  the introduction of  Internet,  I was isolated from my beloved country. As a full time student,  life  for me is very  hectic here.//////Landslide is a common affair in our country, particularly in the rainy season.  A few days ago 11 people died in Chittagong. Recently,  such a collapse occurred in Moheshkhali. So, undoubtedly it is a matter of major concern for us. We expect that  the authorities  will  address the issue with due sense of urgency.//////The other day I was watching Close up 1, the talent hunt programme for singers that I very enthusiastically watch every year. The arrangement is satisfactory,  for it accommodated public opinion with that of the experts. But I was dumfounded when I saw a singer, Tasmih,   who in  the opinion  of the judges scored the highest while in  the opinion of the viewers she scored   poorly. It  was the opposite   for  her  competitor Robin who scored substantially less than Tasmih but received tremendous compassionate support  of the viewers. Earlier,  Robin  had very wisely reminded the viewers not to vote  for him just as a matter of sympathy for his being lame  but to vote for him considering his performance. Viewers were not to heed to the appeal and  the viewers' love for Robin overrode his appeal. Ultimately, the  outstanding talent of Tasmih  was subdued by  the emotion of the viewers. This is an inherent flaw of democracy that nothing can be done against the popular  opinion. However, in this talent hunt programme,  I suppose measures were taken to  weigh  everything  carefully  to search out for the best. This reminded me of the cardinal bottom line of democracy that in democracy majority must be granted and also the fact that democracy counts head equally not actually what is there in each and every head. Yet,  in many countries arrangement is made to elect the best of the candidates.  When in the developed countries most people are capable of making sound decisions regarding competence of a candidate, the situation is not the same in poor countries where majority of the population are illiterate. In imitating the developed countries we find  in most cases that we elect the wrong candidates. Despite  the unprecedented caution on the part of the administration  in the recent local election, there  was  no significant change. In line with this, it can be presumed that in the parliamentary election also,  after two years of preparation,  no significant change shall occur. I think our emerging civic society should contemplate as  to how to develop a democratic system by which we shall be able to elect the best candidate. No one should feel complacent that the American system is foolproof; it too needs periodic reform to address the time. //////The delta regions in the world are fertile: low flat fertile lands, plenty of water; and natural fertiliser effect due to silt layers after periodic flooding. Farming and agriculture thrive; and the human fertility rate is also higher (higher density of population), providing plenty of human resources. How are we taking advantage of this natural situation?//////I refer to your excellent editorial on this (26 August). I appreciate personally the provisions pertaining to front organisations, and foreign chapters. These are the most insidious  ones that undermine  the national character and  are a bar to proper education and future of our country. Take for instance the most recent riot by JCD  i.e. BNP student wing, which caused the death of one person and  they vandalised many cars and buses in support of Tarique Rahman. Also many roads and highways throughout the land were blocked by  the BNP student wing  for hours causing immense  trouble to the general public. Front organisations are the tools  to exercise violent power without any responsibility and  to corrupt the students.//////The  very important Dhaka-Mymensingh  highway is in precariously dilapidated condition. Hundreds of vehicles ply  this road every day. //////A question has  arisen  regarding the length of  government  service.
