Already such schools in 10 districts have been unofficially closed. And the reason is that the teachers are no longer able to make both ends meet with the paltry sum that they get as pay. One is at a loss to understand how such a meagre amount of Tk1200 was determined as their monthly pay in the first place? The pattern would appear even more ridiculous when one considers that Tk. 500 was the pay of these teachers almost a decade ago, and increased to the current level of 1200 from Tk 750 in 2007. //////IN 2004, a scandal originating from the nuclear Shangrila of Pakistan's Kahuta was first spotted by the IAEA, the international nuclear watchdog.

Their living standards and lifestyles are of very poor quality due to low income, under employment and unemployment. The ever increasing price hike of commodities has affected the lower, middle and fixed income groups, severely aggravated their condition and prolonged their indescribable sufferings and pangs from starvation. The prices of foods and other essentials have more than doubled in a year and gone beyond the purchasing capacity and affordability of the majority of the people. The people are to spend more than 70 percent of their daily income only for food purchase. The sky-rocketing prices of essentials have pushed about 60 percent people of the country under the poverty line. Eight lakh school teachers have demanded food rationing. The school-going children are seen standing in the long queues of BDR run shops during school time. We cannot forget the mad rush of the poor people to the BDR run shops from the early morning to buy rice at reasonable price. The exorbitant increase in prices of commodities has resulted in reduction of daily calorie intake and of baby food consumption, ingestion of sub-standard foods and starvation in the extremely poor families are causing serious malnutrition and ill-health. The bulk of the people are struggling to enhance their purchasing capacity and affordability to cope with the prices of foods and other essentials.//////A front page report published in a local English daily on July 21 was simply unbelievable! How can we consider more age as a qualifying criterion and lower age in passing SSC examination as a disqualifying criterion for admission; where college seats are scarce, particularly in good and established colleges? This is a sad reflection where age is preferred when scholastic performance is identical! It is one of the absurd decisions that we have in Bangladesh governance and the military backed CTG is no better.//////With the looming energy crisis, the importance of utilising nuclear energy as a possible replacement of depleting bio fuels is quite evident. Nuclear energy is being harnessed in more than 30 countries to produce electricity and this figure is projected to escalate substantially in the years to come, especially in Asia. According to World Nuclear Association (WNA), Asia alone may be producing one third of the total electricity generated using nuclear power by the year 2020. Though a mammoth task, the idea of setting up a nuclear power plant on our very soil for the sole purpose of being in compliance with our burgeoning energy demand is by no means a utopian scheme.////// How much land does a man need is a widely read short story by Count Leo Tolstoy, who is adjudged by the literary critique of the world as the greatest novelist of all times . One should therefore be more careful in using similes with such a story and the characters portrayed therein to emphasize the greediness and the corrupt activities of the politicians of our country.//////If you are a regular reader of The Daily Star and have access to the Internet, why not do some cyber research?

You will be amazed at the harvest of human crops reaped by BSF at regular intervals. Please do it just to understand how cheap, easy and fun shedding Bangladeshi blood is. Not many intellectuals and media people in Bangladesh are interested in writing on this harvest of blood. But that's quite alright. Not everyone's blood is equally important to everyone.//////I was so scared that I did not even bother to go to the law enforcing agencies. It would have been even dangerous for me and for my kids.

In every civilised country, people dump these materials into dustbins in a safe manner. What is most appalling in our country is the lack of our spontaneity to handle the garbage materials properly. In most of the cases, people throw away the waste materials anywhere! Horribly enough, I have seen people throwing domestic garbage from high-rise buildings on pedestrians' heads! //////Ref: Zafar Sobhan's "Deep in the heart of nowhere" which appeared in your issue of July 25.

While the present government is trying to simplify the service sector, the BRTC is unreasonably complicating the process.

After about half an hour in queue, I deposited Tk.445 and the man at the counter wrote another set of receipts and returned one copy of this receipt + 2 copies of BRTC book. Then I went to the BRTC office in Mirpur at about 11-30am, again after half an hour they gave an application form (why?) to fill in and told me to give the photocopies of current tax token and the previous year's chalan deposit (both are already in their file) + TIN certificate. (I had). Finally, the car was inspected in 5 minutes and I got the certificate without a sticker label (but a rubber stamping- no label was issued though Tk 45 had been deposited) at about 2-30pm i.e. after 3 hours. //////The HC rejected the writ petition filed by a few successful candidates challenging the decision taken by the government to cancel the final result of the 27th BCS exams.
