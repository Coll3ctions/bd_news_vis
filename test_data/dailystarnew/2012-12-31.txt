And they come in two forms, motor-rickshaws and easy-bikes, which are battery powered. They are unauthorised, not having obtained BRTA approval. The fact is, it is not only Chittagong but also many other towns and cities where these machines have made their appearance. And they have been there for quite sometime now, operating under the very nose of the law enforcing agencies illegally. //////The image of Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim in tears after the Asia Cup final in March is one that springs readily to mind when looking at the Bangladesh cricket team's performance in the year just going by. The chance to achieve their biggest success was shattered following a two-run defeat to Pakistan at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in March, but the crying cricketers won the hearts of millions through their outstanding performance in the region's showpiece event.//////In 2012 Bangladesh have made some strides in the sports sphere -- the playing of FIFA international friendlies and the general elevation of the cricket team's standard in ODI cricket come to mind. But if there is one thing that can be expected from organised sports in Bangladesh, it is that there will be controversies, and 2012 supplied a steady stream of the same. Here's a look back at some of the off-field scandals://////While the Tigers have undoubtedly gained high honours this year with their brilliant run in One-Day-Internationals (ODIs), 2012 however witnessed various other highlights in Bangladesh's sporting arena.//////Frank Lampard scored twice as Chelsea came from behind to secure a 2-1 victory at Everton on Sunday in Blues interim coach Rafael Benitez's first game on Merseyside since leaving Liverpool.//////Pakistan beat India by 6 wickets in the first one-day international in Chennai on Sunday.//////The first-round match of the Bangladesh Cricket League (BCL) between Walton Central Zone and Prime Bank South Zone at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium eventually turned out to be a draw at the end of the fourth day yesterday.

They thought that chess would give them an identity and fame like no other sport could. But soon enough the harsh realities of the game dawned on Niaz and his followers -- the lack of money in the game, the politicisation of the game's governing body and the struggle to cope with modern tech-based chess -- meant the positive vibe from the game slowly drifted away. //////In a cool summer evening on the 12th of August in London, Lord Sebastian Coe stood up to the podium facing 80,000 people and a TV audience of nearly a billion to whisper a simple phrase into the microphone.//////The year 2012 is a tale of two halves for Siddikur Rahman, Bangladesh's flag bearer in international golf.

It is really difficult to forget the painful events that occurred in 2012. Firstly, the murder of Bishwajit had shaken our heart. One thing is very noticeable that a rickshaw puller named Md. Ripon took the responsibility to take the victim to the hospital. To me, he is not only a rickshaw puller but also a preacher of humanity. Secondly, we also cannot forget the tragic incident that took the lives of so many children in USA. Thirdly, the gang rape of a student in Delhi triggered huge protest. Lakhs of people came to the street to protest. We should work together to stop such gruesome incidents. Let us welcome the New Year with love, hope and enthusiasm.//////Thousands of people have seen Bishwajit's killing on TV. After the shocking incident we came to know through the media that Bishwajit's killers belonged to the ruling party backed Chattra League (BCL). We have also read in the newspapers that the killers attended other BCL-organised processions that day. One was also seen at a birthday party of a BCL leader. So there is no doubt about the identity of the killers. After the terrible incident, our home minister has tried to implicate BNP and Jamat men in the incident. The PMO office note has also claimed that the killers are not BCL men. Now the arrested killers have confessed that they belong to BCL. We came to know that on the morning of 9th December, an anti-blockade procession was led by Jagannath University BCL president and general secretary. Bishwajit was attacked by the BCL activists who took part in that anti-blockade procession. We need to punish the masterminds behind the incident who instigated the killing. The arrest of the killers should not be mere eyewash. They should get their due punishment for the crime they committed. The police should be instructed to arrest all the masterminds along with the killers. So far they have not arrested any of the masterminds. The home minister and the statement from PM office would also hamper the trial of the killers. People doubt that there would be a fair trial and punishment. //////Thanks to The Daily Star for publishing the news on the illicit activities of SI Mamun in its December 24 issue. It's very sad to learn that the SI took Tk 20,000 as bribe from a 98- year-old woman who paid him the money by selling all her belongings for the release of her son who was arrested for no reason. Nowadays, people with higher educational background are entering the police department and so we are expecting better behaviour and performances from them. But unfortunately, quite often we come across such negative news about them. The Police department should initiate a strong drive to identify all the bad people in the department and get rid of them for public interest and their own good. //////Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took salute at the Victory Day parade at the National Parade Square on 16th December 2012 as President Zillur Rahman was ill and set to leave for the UK for treatment. Traditionally, the president takes salute on Victory Day and the prime minister observes it as a guest. Article 54 of our constitution clearly says, "If the president is unable to discharge the functions of his office on account of absence, illness or any other cause, the speaker shall discharge those functions.//////A few days ago a local TV channel was telecasting live the players' auction of the second edition of Bangladesh Premiere League T-20. The person anchoring the event was frequently using words like "this player is sold at the price of this amount, that payer is sold at that amount," etc., and the players who were not hired by any team were termed as 'unsold'. The programme in which the players were being hired was titled 'auction'. //////The Buriganga flows bearing all the filths of our filthy living. All kinds of solid, human, chemically hazardous waste and garbage are dumped into this river. I wonder whether having a clean wide Buriganga, edged with good walk able beautiful footpaths is an impossible dream. Can't we make the corrupt take a u-turn for a better way of life? We do not want to see people dying under falling flyovers. We do not want to see another bloody killing, shocking abduction, highway robbery and bank looting, or another case of public fleecing to fatten a few.//////Serving people and serving humanity should be the aim of the politicians. But we live in a country where everyone is busy making their own profit, no matter what the means is. Joining a political party ensures long-term advantages and that's why some unscrupulous businessmen are getting involved in politics. The problem arises when they misuse political power to make their ill-motivated plans successful. The political parties should only give nominations to the honest, sincere and, most importantly, educated candidates in the upcoming national elections. Because only honest politicians can ensure a fair poll and represent the common people.//////We are on the cusp of a New Year. People all over the world are looking forward with hope and expectations that the New Year will bring peace and happiness. But we are so unlucky that instead of becoming optimistic we have become very anxious and frightened, not knowing what is awaiting us. The government and the opposition are at loggerheads over the issue of caretaker government (CTG) system which came into being on the demand of the Awami League. And now the Awami League led government has realised that if the election is held under neutral government they have little chance to come to power again as they have failed miserably to govern the country and people are not at all happy with their performance. They abolished the CTG system unilaterally and declared that it will not be restored again.//////She was due to marry her boyfriend in a matter of weeks, was the apple of her father's eye and her friends were convinced she would achieve great things after completing her medical studies.//////Pakistani militants, who have escalated attacks in recent weeks, killed at least 41 people in two separate incidents, officials said yesterday, challenging assertions that military offensives have broken the back of hard-line Islamist groups.//////Prime Minister Hisham Qandil yesterday said that Egypt wants to resume talks with the International Monetary Fund in January on a $4.8-billion loan frozen this month because of political tensions and unrest.//////There has been only one conviction out of over 600 cases of rape reported to Delhi Police this year even as crime against women has been on the rise in the national capital.//////Central African Republic President Francois Bozize yesterday said he was ready to form a coalition government with the Seleka rebel alliance and would step down after his term ends in 2016.//////International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi yesterday warned the Syrian war was worsening "by the day" as he announced a peace plan he believed could find support from world powers, including key Syria ally Russia.//////A 31-year-old New York woman was scheduled to appear before a judge yesterday after being charged with murder as a hate crime for shoving a Hindu man to his death in front of an oncoming subway train.//////Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi on Saturday called on US President Barack Obama to be proactive in ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his forthcoming term.//////Britain's former prime minister Margaret Thatcher has left hospital after successful bladder surgery, British media have reported.//////A US drone strike has killed three suspected al-Qaeda militants in the central Yemen province of Al-Bayda, in the fourth such attack in a week, a local official said yesterday.//////Former US president George HW Bush is on the mend and has been released from intensive care, a spokesman said Saturday.//////Nine Palestinians have died in an outbreak of the H1N1 influenza strain known as swine flu, the office of Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad said yesterday.//////Both the Bangladeshi entries -- Guerrilla and Moner Manush -- bagged awards and Turkish filmmaker Sinan Cetin received the Best Director Award for his comedy-drama Kagit (Paper) at the 12th Dhaka International Film Festival 2012, held from January 12 to 20.

One of the reasons for this success was the caretaker government (CTG). The initiatives taken by the Chief Election Commission were supported by the then CTG. //////Narendra Milosevic Modi's third consecutive victory is a big step backwards for Gujarat and a political setback for India. The result will raise Modi's national ambition, as he so clearly indicated through his victory speech in Hindi. But it will also infuse more strife and communal-sectarian poison into Indian politics without removing the major obstacles that he faces in winning the National Democratic Alliance's nomination as its Prime Ministerial candidate.//////Despite all the social development, why is Bangladesh still plunged into poor governance? Bangladesh has gained a considerable amount of both social and economic development over the last forty years. The last four decades has allowed Bangladesh's life expectancy to increase by 23 years, compared with 18 years in Iran, 16 years in India and 10 years in Afghanistan. //////Feminisation of poverty" is a global problem. The Global Poverty Project estimates a staggering 70% of the world's poor being women. In Bangladesh, according to HIES 2010, about 28 million people are extremely poor, earning less than what is required to just meet their basic food requirements. Much of this burden falls on women. //////
