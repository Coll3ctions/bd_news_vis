The people of Narayanganj have largely rejected the candidates with criminal records in the just concluded city polls, giving mayor-elect Selina Hayat Ivy a relatively clean team to run the corporation. //////There could not have been any better news for democracy, clean politics and people's empowerment and, contrarily, a stronger slap on the face of terrorism, extortion, criminalisation of politics, intimidation and mafia control of voters than Selina Hayat Ivy's victory in the NCC polls.

He has suddenly become an important regional player in the US endgame in Afghanistan. A mind-blowing public rally of Imran Khan in Lahore on October 30 made it very difficult for the Zardari regime to make any new commitments or accept any demands from the US regarding its decade-long war against terror. Imran Khan has become a threat not only for Pakistan's traditional political parties inside Pakistan but also looks about to become a big hurdle in the implementation of demands made on Pakistan by the US. //////The government will shortly declare parts of rivers in the Sundarbans as dolphin sanctuaries to ensure safe environment for the endangered freshwater cetaceans, an official said yesterday.//////Citizens, especially the business community, of Narayanganj now like to remind Selina Hayat Ivy about easing their woes. //////Police yesterday recovered stabbed body of a school boy from the victim's house in Mirpur cantonment.//////The prosecution is likely to petition the International Crimes Tribunal today for issuing an arrest warrant against former Jamaat chief Ghulam Azam for committing crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War.//////Junior School Certificate (JSC) and Junior Dakhil Certificate (JDC) examinations begin today with participation of more than 18 lakh class eight students of schools and madrasas.//////Grameenphone yesterday paid Tk 1,358 crore in licence renewal and partial spectrum fees to the government exchequer. //////Awami League favourite Mohammad Abdur Rahman has clinched the councillor post in Ward-1.

Towards that end there is a very strong rationale for the two countries to develop an environment in mutual dealings that will bring about positive outcomes for both the parties in equal measure, with perhaps a slight tilt towards Bangladesh since it has more severe development challenges to overcome. //////If there is one lesson learnt from the Narayanganj City Corporation mayoral polls, it is that the people are the ultimate master of politics. Because the people willed it, the maneuvering and manipulation by the ruling party -- including the ruling party candidate's attempt to spread panic through warnings of a possible militant attack -- had no bearing on how the people cast their votes. Indeed, the NCC polls are a testament to the fact that a genuine political leader, one with strong public support, cannot be ignored, that too, without damaging party credibility.//////With the Masuri helmet on and some of his mannerisms, one would think that it is the great man sauntering into the stadium.
