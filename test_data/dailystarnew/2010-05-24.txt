Being informed, a relief train from Akhaura rushed to the spot to carry out salvage operation.//////Our country is an agricultural one. The prosperity of agriculture depends on rivers. The rivers, in short, are the sources of our wealth as well. Regrettably, the rivers are presently being grabbed by some unscrupulous and influential encroachers. Water of the rivers is being gradually polluted by the wastes dumped by mills and factories. //////In Bangladesh, malnutrition is caused by multiple factors. The immediate causes are diseases and inadequate intake of food. The underlying causes of malnutrition include the inability of households to grow and/or purchase sufficient foods for meeting their needs; poor maternal and child-care practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and complementary feeding for infants and young children and inadequate provision of food for adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women.//////The season of summer comes with a plate of different delicious fruits. As the season has already set in, different types of fruits are now available in our markets.//////The government is soon going to sign a deal with Russia for setting up a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. As a matter of fact, we are not against it. However, we urge upon the government to take a technical decision on the matter, rather than a political or bureaucratic decision. Nuclear power plant is a very complex establishment and we have virtually no experience about it. So, before embarking upon the project please do prepare a feasibility report on the project. Nuclear power plant is a water hungry project. Estimate the water requirement for the project and see whether the location, presumably Rooppur, which is in the driest part of Bangladesh may have such huge source of water to cater to the needs of the plant. Globally, nuclear power projects are located far away from human habitation for obvious reasons. In India, all their nuclear projects are in the desert areas. Bangladesh has no desert and it is the most densely populated country in the world. Whether a nuclear project will be feasible in such a populous country that needs to be assessed with the utmost importance. How we are going to dump the radioactive nuclear fuel wastes? What is the source of fuel i.e. enriched uranium? Are we going to be subservient to a particular country for source of fuel which is knowingly available with only Russia, USA, UK, and France? The planning process also demands a feasibility study to be made before undertaking any such a billion dollar project. The study will address all aspects of the project including capacity, source of fuel, reactor building technology, radioactive waste dumping method, investment and operation cost, cost of generation, profitability, comparison with conventional power plants, life of the plant, combating hazards and accident, environmental impact etc. //////At present, real estate business is becoming tremendously popular. Developers destroy cultivable land for making high-rise building. If this situation goes on, what will be happen to our next generation? A statistical report said that Bangladesh would lose all its cultivable land by 2050, if we do not keep things under control. //////In this era, till to date we have been unable to adopt a most up to date technology --voice over internet protocol (VoIP). The real scenario proves that it has huge demand in market. So, the businessmen are being involved in this illegal business. Unfortunately, successive governments have totally failed to take necessary and timely steps in this regard. Yes, they have taken some steps to confiscate the instruments, arrest some involved people. Besides, they have stopped investment of thousands of crores of taka and banned licence of some companies. Is it a realistic approach? Certainly not.//////The other day Begum Zia again made her position clear that she is dead against the trial of war criminals (local collaborators of Pakistani soldiers) as she said that bringing the criminals to justice would 'divide the nation'. The nation is already divided between pro-BNP and pro-AL, and there is no denying that late Ziaur Rahman did sow the seed of division by forsaking the ideals of our liberation war, by amending the constitution and by rehabilitating the members of the banned religious parties (anti-state elements). He made it possible for the number one war criminal Golam Azam, a Pakistani citizen, to come to Dhaka and gave him all protection. He made Shah Azizur Rahman who led the Pakistani delegation to the UN in 1971 to thwart the birth of this nation as Independent Bangladesh, the Prime Minister, and some Rajakars were made his cabinet ministers. Remember, Begum Zia only followed the suit of her late husband and accorded Golam Azam Bangladeshi citizenship and made the latter's disciples, Nizami and Mojaheed, who worked with the Pakistani soldiers to save their beloved Pakistan, ministers. In Begum Zia's first term of rule one of the most celebrated and venerated ladies of Bangladesh, Jahan Ara Imam formed Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee and in 1994 held a public trial in the Race Course (now Suhrawardy Uddayan) and with endorsement of lakhs of people present she awarded symbolic capital punishment to Golam Azam and gong. Begum Zia, with the same mindset of her late husband, brought treason charges against Jahanara Imam and other members of the GDNC. To please the collaborators and their master Pakistan, Begum Zia did not withdraw the case as she kept no secret about her prejudice with the ant- state elements and Jahanara Imam died with the treason charge on her person. //////The 'computrese' language is rather at contradiction with physical realities! Any writing stored in the 'computer disc', known as 'CD' is called 'Soft Copy'. For reading in paper it is usually printed out. However the printed out copy; unexplainably, is called 'Hard Copy'; while the material retained in the computer CD, is called 'Soft Copy"! Funnily enough, the 'Hard Copy', is printed in soft paper; while the original copy in the hard computer disc (CD) is called 'Soft Copy"! What a paradox in computerese vocabulary, in the words chosen to represent these copies, in two places!//////This 5 June, World Environment Day will be observed nationwide through various programmes arranged by different organisations. But this day is not significant only for the people related to such associations or clubs, rather for all and sundry. Because we all share the same earth and if the environment continues to get damaged, all will be affected equally. //////This refers to a news item in The Daily Star of the 16th instant.//////More or less everybody residing in Dhaka is familiar with the sight of different kinds of vendors, so am I.//////Political scientist Rousseau in his 'Social Contract' mentioned that people create state through the common will for emancipating themselves from brutal & unruly life. True enough. People create state for leading a calm & peaceful life. But, in effect, the existing state system coveys a different message. Rape, slaughter, mutilation are very common phenomena in our modern democratic state. State mechanism makes us corrupt, dishonest & unruly. No jobs ( in most cases) & licences can be obtained without paying something. For example- motorcycle driving licence is mandatory to get a job in some non-governmental organisations. But it is not easy to get through fair means. //////I have checked the official website of the WIEF to find out exactly what the official languages of the organisation are. I am sorry to say that I failed to get the information. I would appreciate if any readers would kindly help me giving the said information. I wonder whether Bangla could be added to the list for us to speak in Bangla more eloquently and add necessary extempore beyond the official script written by the speech writer for our leader participating in the conference. //////Some buses coming to and from Dhaka stop at zebra crossing, Banani. Besides, people also need to cross the road at that point. But it is very difficult to cross the road because of the heavy movement of the speeding traffic. There is zebra crossing, there are some traffic policemen to help people cross the road, but these are inadequate in absence of a foot bridge. Such bridge has multiple advantages--traffic can move uninterrupted and thereby people can save time. Secondly, people can cross the road safely through such bridge. //////International human rights advocate Irene Khan has joined DS. That's great news for us.//////As part of his budget plan, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed eliminating IHSS, the state's fastest-growing social services program, which pays caregivers to help the disabled and the frail elderly. Nearly half a million disabled Californians get subsidized home care. //////The cabinet recently decided that laws are going to be amended pertaining to the Anti-Corruption Commission's power to file a case against any government official regarding his/her corruption. The proposed law may weaken the power of the existing commission, as the commission will be required to take permission from the ministry concerned prior to filing a case against government officials. If the cases are proved false, the complainant will face dire consequences, with up to five-year rigorous imprisonment. The idea may not help contain pervasive corruption prevailing in every nook and cranny of society, and the govt's dream of digitalizing the country will remain a dream only.//////Digital Bangladesh is now the dream of all citizens of the country, as it was one of the pledges in the last election announced by the AL-led grand alliance that resulted in landslide victory in the ninth JS election 2009.But the recent news report published in The Daily star on May 10 regarding digital Bangladesh is really discouraging for the present govt. In fact it has proved that they have not made much headway on this point, but people of the country are very much overwhelmed by the word ''digital''. Of course, it is a right step taken by our honourable prime minister to make our country digitalised by 2021.//////The government's plan of abolishing National University (NU) and that of bringing the colleges affiliated with it under public universities, in the wake of widespread instances of its mismanagement, inefficiency and corruption revolving around the autonomous institution, is frustrating. NU, established in 1992, started its mission with an eye to bringing all the University-Colleges under it, so as to make academic activities convenient for the students of these colleges. //////From class III to class XII the course title of English is English For Today. It is also known as Communicative English. The main purpose of this course is to communicate with others smartly in English. The textbooks are designed very richly which contain an adequate commonly used vocabulary along with many effective instructions. For example work in pair, make a dialogue, use your own sentence etc. But not to speak of English teachers in rural areas, the urban teachers do not communicate in English with the learners in class. They have little special training regarding this course and they are very indifferent to communication with students. Because they come from traditional syllabus. For these reasons, enthusiastic students are running after spoken English courses. //////The High Court asked the government to enforce the Law of House Rent on 17 May and you ran an editorial on the issue, which is undoubtedly thankworthy.

Since then, countries around the world have worked tirelessly to reach these goals.
