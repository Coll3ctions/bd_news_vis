Along with international presenters and partners, the sessions were packed with Government advisers, civil society members, academics and interested individuals.//////Talking about the place of English in our education and social life and how it influences the politics of representation would seem like a routine academic exercise, but to do so in the month of February might seem a bit odd and out of place, since we assume that the month is solely dedicated to Bangla and a historical re-evaluation of its role in shaping our nationalistic aspirations. The perception though is not incorrect, as February does offer us forums and opportunities to revisit the historic language movement of 1952, and discuss every possible aspect of language issue including the threat that it is facing from the spread of globalisation. It is in this context that a discussion of how we might manage to contain, if not eliminate the threat, and how best we may use the benefits that English has to offer to our advantage may be in order. There is no denying the fact that English is assuming a disproportionate importance in our education, in the media and in our corporate dealings, and threatens to contest Bangla in areas, such as social discourse, that were, even 20 years ago, seen to be Bangla-only domains. But to manage the threat, one has to have a good understanding of not only the historical, cultural and ideological contexts in which English operates in this country, but also the questions of agency and representation that are strategically linked to its spread. Indeed, the cultural luggage that English language brings with it and relocates in the Bangladeshi context also needs to be investigated, if we have to be able to devise ways to counter its influence. We have to keep in mind however, that English has become a tool and a technology in this market-driven world, which we can hardly afford to shun, but we cannot allow it to replace Bangla in any area of daily engagement. If it is a cultural force, we must accept the benefits it might offer us, but should not allow it to shape our cultural expressions. These are no easy tasks, but should not be postponed any longer.//////The deaf mute has no enemies in this city" -- this was the only advice to me, from the director of a Dhaka art centre.
