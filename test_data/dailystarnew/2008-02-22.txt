The sons of the soil had sacrificed their lives for a cause which is unprecedented in history and it has not gone in vain. 21st February has been recognised as the International Mother Language Day and is being observed throughout the world.//////The nation is currently watching a debate and discussion on media on a vital issue, whether the election can be held with the EPR on, or it has to be lifted before the election. The opinions are mixed and divided, depending on who is taking which side. The argument for and against the issue is basically depended on individual choice for democratic order, irrespective of its universally recognised character.//////Wheat supplies have reached an all-time low. Given this situation, as reported by the media, the meteorological forecast of a drought in Australia, an important wheat exporter, can trigger a minor tremor on the world's food market where prices are constantly hitting new all-time highs. Of course, the current uproar over rising food prices revolves around a lot more than consumers paying some extra money for rice, soybean oil and flour. The real issue is how we will be able to feed ourselves in the future, and at what price. How can agriculture feed a world that grows by 80 million people each year? How can agriculture feed a world that is increasingly exposed to climatic change? //////My compliments. You have headlined in The Daily Star that Sk. Hasina has refused treatment under physicians and facilities to be arranged by the authorities.//////It has been reported in the press that some officials of Titas Gas Company have agreed to return their stolen money, about Tk 400 crore to the public exchequer. About this company there is a saying among the Dhakaites that "even the walls and files in the Titas Gas offices take bribes". During the last days of the previous government, there was a hot news item in the press about a meter reader of this company. He was so much influential and powerful that he could change course of actions and decisions of the company. It was an interesting gossip at that time. None could imagine the scale of corruption in this office before revelation of such stories. However, the godfathers of these people never come to public glare.//////Kudos to the great benevolent! No doubt the $130 million donation by the anonymous philanthropist, mainly intended for rehabilitation and reconstruction of primary schools in the worst Sidr-affected areas, is great news for Bangladesh. But I'm sorry to say that I have doubts about proper utilisation of this big amount of money.//////To expound on a letter with the above heading appearing in your daily on the 15th of February 2008, the answer is yes, and no. It depends on where you live. In the west, 5 working days are more than good enough, because.....you work. That is why there exists what we call a "rush hour" that lasts an hour (or an hour and a half at the most, depending on how far you have to travel). The work force is bent on reaching their place of work on time, and do not leave a minute earlier. Lunch hour is fixed, and you cannot reach a soul during that period. On either side of the lunch hour, and as long they are at work, they put their hearts into it, and do their work intensively and extremely efficiently.//////The top govt. officials in Bangladesh are appointed thorough the BCS exams. But it is sad that 55% of the posts are reserved, 30% of which is for the children of freedom fighters. But have we thought about the disadvantages of showing this sympathy for the quota holders? If we consider the few vital posts in the 28th BCS , there are 15 posts for foreign service, 200 for administration and 150 posts for ASP. And according to the quota system, 8.25 posts of foreign service, 110 posts of administration and 82.5 posts of ASP will be fulfilled from quota beneficiaries. So, if this huge number of vital posts is filled by appointing those not selected on merit, would not the country suffer in future? And would not the top students be discouraged to sit for the BCS exams? //////The record -breaking Australian wicketkeeper, famous also for his scintillating batting prowess, Adam Craig Gilchrist's decision to retire from Test and ODI cricket has surprised his fans. //////There have been some suggestions by aviation experts and travel agents that the temporary open sky policy which the Civil Aviation Ministry has allowed be extended for a longer period. I would like to know what is an open sky policy? Does this mean that any airline can fly in and carry away passengers to destinations outside Bangladesh? As far as I know open sky policy is one that is agreed between two countries under a bilateral agreement. For example, the Singapore government has an open sky policy with the USA under which airlines of both the countries can operate as many flights per week they want between the two countries. India has a similar agreement with the US. The Bangladesh government has bilateral air agreements with many countries in the Middle East and Europe but it has remained under utilised by Biman due to its own mismanagement. On the contrary, airlines like the Emirates is taking maximum advantage of the bilateral agreement between Bangladesh and the UAE. So are the two airlines of India and GMG Airlines for flights between India and Bangladesh. Recently, an aviation expert on a TV talk show commented that India has an open sky policy. I cannot agree. Indian open sky policy is limited to scheduled airlines with which India has commercial agreements and it has allowed an increase in flights during the winter tourist season. This was to bring in over-booked tourists from the West, thus assuring a gain in foreign exchange earnings. In case of Bangladesh, it is just the opposite. Even if Bangladesh pursues an open sky policy it does not mean airlines from the Far East, the Middle East or Europe will rush in. In-coming passenger load to Bangladesh has always been low except during festival periods like Eid-ul-Fitr. Airlines have their own marketing strategies and they look at markets from both ends. The best policy which the Ministry of Civil Aviation can pursue is to allow private airlines of Bangladesh to operate on the under utilised international routes of Biman. This may ensure foreign exchange earnings for Bangladesh as well. Before succumbing to suggestions of our local aviation experts, the Ministry of Civil Aviation should make an in-depth study of aviation policies of neighbouring countries.//////I wonder whether the Bangladesh government is taking steps to investigate the allegations of corruption by politically appointed people at Bangladesh missions abroad. To my knowledge, there are several claims filed against Bangladesh missions abroad which are not to be defended under Diplomatic Immunity Act. //////Thank you very much for drawing public attention to the 600-year old gem of a temple - Jagannath Temple in Pabna. I am deeply disappointed that such a national treasure is being wasted away - even under the present government. It would be very helpful, if the government also focused on such archaeological treasures of Bangladesh. It did not happen earlier due to lack of consciousness on the part of the governments. //////It is sad that the University Grants Commission does not require Bangla as a required general education course for a 4-year college degree. It is essential that students achieve necessary competency in reading and writing Bangla to become a worthy citizen of Bangladesh. In the American system, all college students are required to take two courses in English (beyond 12th grade) to achieve general competency in the native language. There are lots of emotional talks around February 21, but not much is done to achieve those goals. //////I have a proposal that I think would (1) put money in the exchequer and (2) reduce the tremendous amount of noise pollution in Bangladesh.//////This claim to US presidency by Hillary Clinton is obviously not well founded, because if she was not the previous First Lady, she could neither become a Senator nor a presidential hopeful. If she becomes US president she would do it not because she is a woman but only because of her husband's fame and prowess.//////Recently two articles were published in The Daily Star on the above subject, one entitled Let merit count in the Bangladesh Civil Service by Ripon Kumar Biswas and another Positive Discrimination by Nazrul Islam. Both the articles are well written and deserve consideration by the authorities concerned. //////Biman.

Despite widespread concerns about compromised balloting, electoral violence and low voter turnout in Monday's elections, Pakistan is now enjoying a moment of democracy and optimism -- an exceedingly rare event in its troubled history. //////A leading daily newspaper published report about the death of two Bengal tigers (//////) in Sundarban mangrove during research by anesthesia and radio-collaring (The Prothom Alo, January 31, 2008). According to the report the first tigress was captured around end April 2005 and died six months later having the collar on. The second tigress captured in March 2006 was second time tranquillized in December 2006 to remove the collar. The BBC film crew captured this second tranquillizing sequence of near dead tigress and added it to the film Ganges and are now showing worldwide the last scenes of that pathetic tigress. The tigress was assumed dead immediately afterwards. //////Cyclones are one of the major natural calamities in our country. These cyclones are caused by formation of low atmospheric pressure over warm waters of the southern parts of Bay of Bengal. After deriving power from high-speed wind and transforming heat and spinning motion from corioli, these cyclones take a northward direction following low-pressure areas into Bangladesh and India. A catastrophic super cyclone like that took place in 1970 can exceed wind speed of 240-kilometer per hour and can trigger tidal bore of 40 feet or more. The cyclone Sidr was 400-500 kilometer wide in size, larger than Bangladesh, and its unstable atmosphere reached the height of 35,000 feet. Its enormous force dislodged underwater debris from 35,000 feet deep ocean and dumped it on the shore. Such severe tropical cyclones can be very destructive to life and property. About 1.5 million people died in November 1970 cyclone, 11,069 in 1985, 1,50,000 in 1991 and 15,000 in 2007. It is estimated that the total damage from Sidr alone is about US$1.6 million. Although 31 years have elapsed since the tragic cyclone of 1970 but the loss of life and property which these cyclones still causes is staggering. One of the reasons is that we have not been able to establish the required defence. Our measures to reduce death and damage so far have been inadequate, piecemeal and halfhearted.//////
