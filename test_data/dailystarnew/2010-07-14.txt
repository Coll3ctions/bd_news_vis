Alam's family and his party have alleged that law enforcers in plain clothes were involved in the abduction. The Rapid Ac-tion Battalion and the police authorities have, however, denied any involvement in the incident. As for tracing Alam's whereabouts, they have said that they are yet to have any clues in the matter whatsoever.//////LESS than a month to go before Ramadan, the market of essentials is smarting under price pressure. Even though it is a peculiar seasonal phenomenon in this country, the degree of restiveness of the market at this stage is purely speculative and artificial; for the stocks, we are assured, remain adequate with more in the pipe-line. Given our rather critical dependence on import for the availability of Ramadan essentials, their timely pro-curement, keeping pace with projected demands is of crucial importance. Simultaneously, steady supply and distribution of domestically produced commodities will have to be maintained. //////Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero singled out Andres Iniesta, who scored the winner during Spain's 1-0 defeat of the Netherlands in the World Cup final, for praise Monday, saying there was no better role model for youths.//////After a scintillating five-run victory in the second one-dayer, Bangladesh crashed to a huge defeat in the third match against England. The home side came hard at the Tigers in the series decider to secure a 2-1 win. But when Mashrafe Bin Mortaza's men would look back to the series they definitely can take inspiration from their first-ever success against the English side in any form of the game. The triumph came in the time when it seemed that the confidence level of the Jamie Siddons charges hit a new low following one defeat after another in this year. Many might not have been focused enough during the FIFA World Cup but the performance of the Tigers in the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka was alarming with the fact that the cricket World Cup is only seven months to go where Bangladesh will play in the mega event as one of the co-hosts.//////Mohammedan Sporting Club completed their first-leg campaign of the Green Delta Insurance Premier Division Hockey League with an all-win record as the title contenders thumped archrivals Abahani 3-0 in their last match at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.//////A Spanish town which celebrates an annual Octopus Festival has requested that Paul, the "psychic" octopus who predicted Spain's World Cup win, be allowed to join them as a guest of honour this year.//////Thousands of fans decked out in orange cheered on the defeated Dutch football team as it embarked on a seven-kilometre boat parade down the canals of Amsterdam Tuesday.//////Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique forced Cesc Fabregas to briefly wear a Barcelona shirt during Spain's World Cup victory celebrations in Madrid on Monday night. //////Fabio Capello's England were given their lowest ever World Cup ranking by FIFA after their disastrous campaign was ended by Germany at the second round stage. //////Australia successfully negotiated a searching trial by swing and seam on Tuesday to reach 171 for three at tea on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan at Lord's.//////Liverpool are hopeful that the groin injury suffered by Spanish striker Fernando Torres in Sunday's World Cup final is not as serious as was first feared.//////Thomas Mueller has said he never believed he would win the Golden Boot before the World Cup began. //////President Nicolas Sarkozy damned the shamed French football squad on Monday, saying the team had been "disastrous" for their country's image at the World Cup in South Africa.//////FIDE Masters Abu Sufian Shakil and Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar maintained their joint lead in the Mercantile Bank 36th National Chess Championship at the end of the 11th round at the Bangladesh Chess Federation hall room yesterday.//////Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp revealed Tuesday that Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano is high on their wish list, but admitted that the player's salary expectations could prove a stumbling block.//////England captain Andrew Strauss revelled in the growing competition for places in the one-day side after "leading from the front" as his team wrapped up a series win over Bangladesh.//////England batsman Ian Bell was ruled out Tuesday of the upcoming Test series against Pakistan after breaking his left foot while fielding in the second one-day international against Bangladesh last weekend.//////Newly-married Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has signed a marketing deal worth 42 million dollars over two years, a report said on Tuesday.//////With both sides weak in their respective fast bowling departments, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara have pledged to make the Test series more interesting and enterprising by aiming for results.//////A strong Sri Lanka Board President's XI gave the Indians a welcome as harsh as Colombo's humidity.

The essence of democracy is that the sovereign power of the state is in the hands of the people and the people are the source of the state power. In a democratic state, political parties have the right to adopt the peaceful measures like demonstration, procession, human chain, hunger strike etc to press home their respective demands. It may be the party in power or the opposition. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) made a human chain on July 7 to put pressure on the government for releasing their party leaders and activists who were detained during the hartal day. But our govt. used the police force with the collaboration of party activists to deal with the protests. It is a shame for democracy. We the general people do not support the destructive hartal culture, nor do we expect undemocratic activities from the political parties. //////A justified, and fairly detailed report criticizing the National Museum management was published on 7 July in a local English daily. In my opinion, the head of the organisation must be taken to task for being responsible for the deplorable state of affairs, when his people can steal gold and silver coins and other valuable artefacts from the premises. It is ironic that the custodians of treasure are treasure hunters and thieves themselves!//////Overcrowded Dhaka is already considered the word's most polluted city. Yet its environment is being polluted further unabatedly. The poor, the lower middle class and our innocent children are particularly affected by pollution. They are more exposed as they work & travel for long hours. Their poor nutrition makes them less resistant to diseases and they have limited access to healthcare. According to some estimates, 20,000 citizens are facing premature death every year due to high pollution. In my view to reduce environmental pollution, the government should take following pollution control measures. //////Our country has a glorious history of student politics. From the language movement to liberation war, students took part in all progressive movements. But what is happening now ? //////The news published in DS on 5 July about the extra-judicial killing of three businessmen by law enforcers is mind-boggling. Those, who are deployed to show the right path and force people to abide by law and order, are the offenders in those cases.//////It is true that traffic jam is one of the most burning issues in our country, especially in Dhaka city. People think there are several causes behind this. What are the main causes? Some are blaming the private cars, and others are blaming the rickshaws. They think if one of the transports, especially rickshaw, is banned, then traffic jam will be reduced. //////The Rotary Club of Dhaka Central has taken up a scheme, to sponsor the meritorious students (SSC, GPA-5), who are extremely poor (parents are daily wage earners, hard core poor). The failure of the GPA-5 students to pursue further studies is a great national wastage. There are investments and investments (power, generational infrastructure development, stimulus package). But the finest of them all is the investment on education. Right investment, at the right time and the right place, can engineer our growth.//////Undoubtedly, the number one problem of Bangladesh is the population explosion. The country has to face various problems due to the population boom. Lowering the minimum age for getting married can be an effective measure in order to control the present population increment. Virtually, all fertility occurs within the wedlock in our country. Fertility rate, however, is closely related to marriage age. As a result, the upward and downward change in marriage age is related to productive behaviour.//////I am a regular visitor to the Public Library at Shahbag in Dhaka. I have completed studying books on literature, history and journalism. I do not always get the books that I want to read. //////I am an inhabitant of Jurain area. Recently, the amount of load shedding in this area has reached the peak. Electricity remains operative for twelve hours and in the rest twelve hours we experience load shedding. Even during nighttime load shedding occurs several times and the sufferings of the people know no bounds. Children and old people suffer unbearably. The authorities seem indifferent to the issue. //////In a candid and forthright article written by Sir Frank Peters in an English-language newspaper about corporal punishment in our schools, he asks why we, loving parents, are permitting teachers to beat our children, the same ones we claim to love more than ourselves.//////Publicising a new project is not enough. The bugs are in the implementation details; and in the unwanted and negative human elements prevailing and interfering at about all the vertical and horizontal levels, in the LDCs. This is mainly due to the immature political culture prevailing at the governance levels; with short-term subjective outlook. //////This is a golden opportunity for Mr Tarique Rahman, the senior vice president of the BNP, to prove himself as a clean man and come out of the general feelings about him (corruption). As claimed by the BNP, the case of money laundering against Mr Tarique is politically motivated to tarnish his image and is a plot to restrict him from doing politics, because he has now the most talented leadership capability and has great views to lead the country and claimed him as a RISING SUN OF THE EAST. //////This is a golden opportunity for Mr Tarique Rahman, the senior vice president of the BNP, to prove himself as a clean man and come out of the general feelings about him (corruption).

To save the nation, such hooliganism has to stopped. I will urge you to see the photographs and news items in the national dailies on misdeeds of the so-called students. I am deeply shocked to see these series of horrific activities. //////Everyone is familiar with the term. It means to disturb girls with objectionable remarks and gestures. It actually means gestures and using slang language in presence of the teenage girls. This amoral activity is on the increase in our country. Especially, some hooligans and demoralised and addicted boys are involved in eve teasing. They do not have any moral feeling and family learning. They are regarded as weeds in society. Their ill and irritating behaviour causes serious mental agony to girls. Many girls committed suicide.//////Of course, in most of the cases hartal is called by the opposition party of the country and in this case Bangladesh is not an exception. On 27 June, the hartal called by the BNP, the main opposition party, was observed across the country with many processions on the streets. But the role of the law enforcers during the time of hartal was really questionable as they were tough on the people. They also tortured citizens entering into their houses in the name of maintaining law and order. As a result, it is claimed by some people that the the govt was using the administration, whereas the role of the administration should be impartial.//////A regular comment one would hear and see on the electronic media from some individuals when they are referring to the trial of the war criminals. Exactly the same expression was heard when the trial of the killers of Sheikh Mujib, the founder president, was going on. The apprehension was and is the same, can we find evidence to proceed or why not forget and forgive the same? The inner feeling of these people is not different from a few political parties which are openly working against the trial.//////Since colonial times, Bangladeshis are known to be a deprived people. Yes Bangladeshis are a deprived people there can be no denying it. Bangladesh got its independence back it in 1971, it is almost 40 years since then and yet Bangladeshis are being deprived.//////What follow acts of terror are death, injuries, wailing relatives, red alerts, promises from higher officials that something will be done, heated discussions, political blame games, candlelight vigils, and what not. Why are we not prepared to prevent such unfortunate incidents? Names of fundamentalist and extremist organizations, religious and political, are repeated every time there is a terror attack. Citizens cling to the faint hope that something will be done. True, the progress of an investigation cannot be revealed but the result of inquiries can be. Is there no end to the investigations? //////Somalis who moved to Kampala to escape their country's long-running civil war feared a backlash following deadly bomb attacks claimed by Somalia's Shabab insurgent group.//////Ugandan authorities have made a number of arrests in connection with explosions at two sites in Kampala that left at least 74 people dead.//////Former Cuban president Fidel Castro used his most prominent television interview since falling seriously ill four years ago to discuss everything from the threat of global nuclear war to the use of energy efficient light bulbs.//////The first group of political prisoners freed by Cuba has arrived in the Spanish capital, Madrid.//////In Japanese, it's called a "twisted parliament," and it doesn't bode well for the country's future.//////Ugandan police have found an unexploded suicide vest and made a number of arrests in connection with Uganda blasts. //////The United States has detained a 12th person following the break up of a Russian spy ring which led to a dramatic spy swap last week, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday.//////A day before External Affairs Minister SM Krishna heads to Pakistan, India yesterday decided to mainly focus the talks on terrorism, which it says is sponsored by Pakistan.//////A missing Iranian nuclear scientist, who Tehran says was kidnapped a year ago by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Iran section of Pakistan's US embassy.//////Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani Tuesday expressed confidence that the forthcoming meeting between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India would be fruitful and would pave the way for further dialogue.//////The race for the new prime minister of Nepal kicked off yesterday with parliamentarians fixing July 21 as the election date after the parties failed to forget old rivalries and choose a candidate acceptable to all.//////Torrential rains and severe flooding have left 107 people dead and 59 missing in ten Chinese provinces, mostly along the Yangtze River following recent storms, state media said yesterday.//////Sri Lankan police have filed a new case against former army chief and defeated presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka for allegedly employing military deserters, his party said yesterday.//////To commemorate the 68th birth anniversary of the late actor-director-playwright Abdullah Al Mamun, Theatre arranged a memorial speech at the seminar room of Bangladesh Shilpakala academy (BSA) on July 12.

There is a strange, inexplicable silence into which the former foreign minister and reputed politician has lapsed. But, again, that is understandable. //////THE Philippine presidential election was held on May 10 and Benigno Aquino III (popularly known as Noynoy Aquino), the son of two democracy heroes (his father Benigno, a former assassinated senator and mother, former president Corazon), won handsomely and was proclaimed as president in a joint session of Congress on June 9. He was sworn in as the Philippines' 15th president on June 30.//////Jamaat leaders Motiur Rahman Nizami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid and Delwar Hossain Sayedee were arrested more than a week ago, apparently not for their alleged role during the Liberation War but for failing to appear before a Dhaka court in connection with a case of hurting the religious sentiment of the country's Muslims. According to government sources, they were detained not because they were Jamaat leaders, but because arrest warrants had been issued against them.//////I think about the Cox's Bazaar tourism industry often. And my thinking is usually along the lines of: "Gee, I really wish we had a Cox's Bazaar tourism industry." For those harbouring the misapprehension that I am someone who is given to heavy critical thinking about matters of nation and state, let me clarify that I really am not. //////Al Gore and his wife broke up after 40 years of marriage.
