bb's monetary policy stance
given the backdrop to the monetary policy announced by the central bank governor dr atiur rahman, he could not probably get more sure-footed than he has actually managed to be. the policy formulation perforce had to respond to external and internal shocks triggered by the global economic downturn. despite signs of recovery, effects of global slowdown are predicted to linger until mid-2010. in the rather long interregnum, two kinds of scenario are likely: if the global recovery falters, it would slacken export growth, workers' remittance inflow and investment activities thereby affecting gdp growth. at the same time, if global recovery is faster it won't be without some risks in the shape of aggravating domestic inflation due to increasing global commodity prices.

callous people and traffic
just about a month ago, we witnessed a horrific accident at the moghbazar rail crossing. a bus was rammed by a speeding train and it created havoc. it was not only the negligence of the responsible ones at the crossing but also the hastiness of the pedestrians and travellers, who defy all the rules while moving on the road, that caused the incident. it was expected that at least some sense would prevail and we will be more careful while crossing those level crossings. but unfortunately, there is no sign of improvement. the buses still fight to get on the tracks and cross it at the last moment, the pedestrians move to and fro on the rail lines even when the train is just moments away, cars and rickshaws try to come from other side of the road to take u-turn creating gridlock. and most shockingly, the traffic policeman stands there and literally does nothing. if this is the situation, such incidents will continue to occur. building the flyovers on the rail crossings and moving the rail lines away from the busy city roads look like possibilities far away, but at least till then we can ensure locking the level crossings with adequate time in hand for all the vehicles to stop at a safe distance and ensure that people comply with traffic rules.
