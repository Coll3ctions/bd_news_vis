mars an unlikely place for life?
mars may have been arid for more than 600 million years, making it too hostile for any life to survive on the planet's surface, according to researchers who have been carrying out the painstaking task of analysing individual particles of martian soil. dr tom pike, from imperial college london, will discuss the team's analysis at a european space agency (esa) meeting on 7 february 2012.
