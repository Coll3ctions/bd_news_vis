the worries about gas
some very real worries assail us where the matter is one of gas in the country. with reports of a marginal increase in the supply of gas in the face of growing demands, our attention has long been riveted on the exploration issue. as a report in this newspaper yesterday makes it clear, not much of a headway has been made in gas exploration in order to ensure a smooth, uninterrupted supply of gas well into the near future. contrast that with the praiseworthy initiatives the government has taken in recent times to augment the supply of electricity. moves are on to generate 2,500 megawatts of electricity. such moves are yet to be seen in the gas sector. that is where our concerns come in.
blatant disregard for worker and public safety
if pictures are supposed to speak a thousand words then the two photographs front-paged in this newspaper yesterday speak more than a thousand words. they depict a manifest malady, but which, regrettably, remains outside the radar screen of the agencies concerned to be attended to and remedied. the pictures are fairly representative of the state of safety of workers in almost all kinds of work places, from high-rise buildings to construction sights to garment factories to road construction to ship-breaking yards, you name it. view the page sports
chronicles of glory
at one point, words just no longer cut it. over the last fortnight there have been adjectives aplenty to describe bangladesh's almost surreal performances against new zealand. the tigers have been called “super,” they have been dubbed “sensational” and “sublime,” some have even stretched as far as “magic,” and “magnificent.” in between there have also been some “wows” thrown in for good measure. but after yesterday's nail-biting victory, there really are no words left.

traffic woes
dhaka's traffic situation has taken nightmarish proportions. dhaka's railway system is primarily designed to serve inter-city traffic. why not use it by adding one or two extra lines to run fast track “intra-city” light metro rail, say every twenty minutes? this will be cheaper, faster, much greater in capacity, and much more environment friendly than any number of battered buses trying to do the same job. all we need is to create a few underpasses at the road intersections (or overhead railway bridges) to avoid rail-crossing jams.

anthrax and qurbani
anthrax is a lethal disease and it affects both humans and animals. most of our village people are not aware of this disease. shouldn't we take steps to save them? we know dph is trying to contain this disease. but is it possible to make the whole country aware of this disease? we humbly request the authorities concerned to take immediate steps to prevent spread of this disease before eid-ul-adha.
strike of cng owners
the owners' association of the cng supply stations recently threatened the government with an indefinite strike from november 2010, if their demands were not met before the stated time. presently we are not getting gas regularly in our area, and if we get it for sometime, its pressure is very low. the electricity supply is also inadequate and the water supply is erratic mostly because of irregular supply of electricity as electricity is also generated from gas. with this backdrop, the shutting of the cng stations for 6 hours daily is quite logical and proven to be realistic.
rules of the road
recently the communications minister syed abul hossain announced that, fastening of seat belts, wearing helmets while riding a motorcycle, using the footbridge and underpass while crossing the road, would be made mandatory, and talking on the phone while driving would be banned. these new rules will take effect from november 1, 2010, and if these rules are not followed, drivers and commuters will be fined, and even jailed. majority of the people don't follow these rules. if we change our bad habits, we can change the whole country.
whither rule of law?

quality education
there are too many holidays in the educational institutions in our country. we enjoy more holidays than the other sarc countries. in america, muslim teachers are working even on the eid days. in bangladesh, a teacher's salary is very poor compared to a clerk's and even a day labourer's. the governments are indifferent to quality education. when we raise the issue of teachers' salary increase, the govt. rejects it showing fund crisis. we don't hear of any fund crisis while increasing the salary of the mps and buying luxurious cars for them.

5th october 2010 was celebrated as world teacher's day around the world. bangladesh also observed the day with the theme, 'recovery begins with teachers'. teachers' associations have undertaken a variety of programmes to commemorate the day along with the rest of the world.
gas reserves
one of the major indicators of development or industrialisation of a nation is the level of its per capita commercial energy use. the three most important commercial sources of energy today are natural gas, oil and coal. natural gas is bangladesh's only significant source of commercial energy, with 2002 production of 384.9 billion cubic feet (bcf). production of natural gas in bangladesh began in 1960 from the chhatak field. there is much uncertainty and debate about the level of natural gas reserves in bangladesh. estimates from petrobangla put the net proven reserves at 15.3 tcf as of mid-2004. the us geological survey has estimated that bangladesh contains an additional 32.1 tcf in additional “undiscovered” reserves.
azam khan - in memoriam
megasthenes memories of azam khan, published in your october 7th issue, was a moving account of a rare and noble person who was in dhaka in the troubled 1960s. if there were another five persons like him in those days, the history of this part of the world could have been less violent and painful. even the creation of bangladesh would have been a peaceful political process, without the widespread killings and destruction, let loose by tikka khan (the antithesis of azam khan)!
babri mosque
