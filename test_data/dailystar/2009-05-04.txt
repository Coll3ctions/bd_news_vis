sheikh hasina, khaleda zia at the rallies
in a way, the rallies organised by the ruling awami league and the opposition bangladesh nationalist party in the city on friday and saturday were looked forward to with quite a few, if not many, expectations by the nation. after all, it was for the first time since the general elections of december last year that the two parties and especially their two leaders were making a public appearance with what was expected to be major policy announcements. in the event, it came down to more of what the country had been getting from them in the eighteen years since the return of parliamentary democracy in 1991. it is unfortunate that through their pronouncements on 1 and 2 may, sheikh hasina and khaleda zia both belied the hopes of the nation.

barca annihilate real
real madrid's pursuit was for nothing. even 17 victories in 18 unbeaten matches were not enough; in the 19th match, barcelona, the last side to beat real, arrived at the bernabeu and beat them again. destroyed them, in fact. it was not just that barcelona's 6-2 ­victory, secured with two each from thierry henry and leo messi, plus one from carles puyol and gerard pique, ­carried them seven points clear with four matches remaining. it was that they left their rivals in tatters, turning the santiago bernabeu's battle cry, briefly revived in the second half, into a ­murmur of impotence.

withdraw the ban
as the pakistan cricket team is planning to include their rebel players of icl in the national team and india is also going in the same direction, now i feel it's high time for bcb to soften their stance and withdraw the ban on our own rebel icl cricketers too. after all it's the question of our national pride and honour and i do strongly believe that the upcoming world cup t20 cricket and even the 2011 cricket world cup squad would be poorer minus the players like aftab, kapali and nazimuddin. especially, i feel kapali and aftab are very talented.
old habits...
it is our habit to shift responsibilities to others.
noise menace
nowadays in our urban society, noise pollution is an acute problem. “noise is the wrong sound, in the wrong place at the wrong time.” loudness of sound is a sensory dependent parameter. it is directly related to intensity of sound and measured by decibel (db). for instance according to who, permissible loudness in an industrial area is 75db and 45db is the safe noise level for a city. unfortunately, the average loudness of sound is above 90db in our metropolitan cities, which is double the recommended limit. hydraulic horn is the leading cause of sound pollution in the city. moreover, vehicles with under performing engines, blenders, grinders, electric drills, stone and brick crushers, various types of mills, loud speakers, aircraft & trains also cause noise pollution.
traffic mismanagement
it seems that the government could not settle down even after 100 days in office. government ministers are still not in grip of their ministries. one example is the chaos that is prevailing in traffic management. is it such a difficult job to create a smooth traffic system? what has to be done is known to all. a huge number of seminars, symposiums conducted at sonargaon and sheraton hotels (consuming delicious food at peoples expense !) cannot produce the desired results. enough has been said. now it is time to act. anyone who has lived in a western country will understand what has to be done.
relying on the bureaucracy!
liton's front-page report of april 25, on the lack of rules for utilisation of mps' discretionary funds is really interesting! having been elected to parliament, why have regulation on discretion? the maximum limitation on annual basis should do. possibly this was the logic and thinking, that discouraged the members of parliament to have any rules about it!
media and politics
the media, especially the electronic media, is an effective tool to shape up public opinion when society is diluted and suffering from indecisions. that is where we stand today. against this background we are to judge the role of the media. are they performing ethically or following the partisan mentors' directives to support or criticise the government efforts and opposition's role. i believe some electronic media outlets are sending selective information under the banner of freedom of information; and also producing talk shows which imply that bangladesh was a " heaven on earth' before the new government came to power in early january 2009. all crises, energy, water supply, fluctuating prices of essential commodities ( except rice, ata etc) are the failure of this four-month old government as they failed to prioritise and tackle national issues, and are spending time on non-issues like the house of the opposition leader. this type of over critical and negative presentation of the governmental efforts to address the issues are creating a demoralized state of affairs which would further aggravate the sufferings of the poor and ordinary people.
triangle of corruption
i was wondering why the bnp cadres are hobnobbing with al cadres and following their usual aggressive style of life without any problem. i did not have to go far to find the answer. the bnp cadres have relatives in the rank and file of al cadres. they seem to have a secret agreement that by hook or by crook they will maintain their hegemony over the hapless people. the bureaucracy acts here as the third force in the triangle of corruption.
khaleda's house
bnp leaders fail to mention that begum zia has got another house, a four-storied one, in gulshan, in addition to the cantt. house. what more could the fawning legislators of the then ruling party do for her? one house to live in and the other for earning rent! the allotment of a house inside a cantonment, meant for a serving military officer, to her was illegal ab initio. but nobody cared!
unquotable quotes
the reader's digest has an old and popular page, “quotable quotes”. in the context of bangladesh today, we could well start with some “uncouth quotes” coming from our 'leaders'. i will start with the gems from the home ministry's parliamentary standing committee's recommendations on dhaka's traffic problems as printed in ds on 27 april 09.
rajuk's apartments
rajuk is planning to build one hundred thousand apartments in uttara, purbachol, and jhilmil project. these apartments will be constructed in eleven thousand plots. this is good news for dhaka's citizens.
politicians
on 29 april, all the dailies carried an important news report under the headline "begum khaleda zia, tareque rahman and arafat rahman koko apply to the high court for withdrawal of corruption cases" filed against them by the acc during the caretaker government.
sri lankan civil war
colombo did not allow swedish foreign minister carl bildt to enter sri lanka on a 'humanitarian mission' together with french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband. i think colombo apparently in its final days of total victory over tamil separatist rebels (ltte) - has taken a bold decision.
driving school
most people in bangladesh are poor. mostly their votes led to the landslide victory of the awami league in the last parliamentary election. and it is high time to do something for their welfare. a portion of the poor youth can be converted into manpower. they should be trained in professions like driving.
swine flu
