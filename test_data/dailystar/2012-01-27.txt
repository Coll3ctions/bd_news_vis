students take oath to fight corruption
we are heartened by the news of hundreds of students taking a vow to launch an unrelenting fight against corruption in a recently held ceremony. these students, many of them ssc examinees, have pledged not only to shun corruption but also to root it out altogether. at a function also attended by teachers and guardians at the shaheed mohor ali high school in chapainawabganj, they took the oath. when corruption has insidiously seeped into all segments of society securing the country one of the top positions in the list of most corrupt countries, we view this ceremony as a pioneering move to see the youth take up the lead in the moral battle against corruption.

sky high dhaka land prices!
an illuminating observation about the matter, published in the front page of a local english daily on 18th. january, is a fact of life in dhaka today. it is not going to change in the foreseeable future. a very logical and important reason for this was unfortunately not touched upon by the writer.
modern driving institutions needed
we have learnt from a national daily that the bangladesh road transport authority (brta) has taken steps to set up sophisticated training institutions in seven divisional headquarters in an effort to reduce road accidents throughout the country. lack of institutional training has been identified as one of the reasons for road mishaps. the korean ambassador said his government was interested to invest in the brta.
the illusion of food security
the other day i was reading an article published in the editorial section of your daily that focused on the issue of bangladesh's food security. i was quite amused at the writer's conclusion that bangladesh was quite secure without considering a lot of factors, such as the per capita income, disposable income, variety of food available at the same income, quality of food, etc. to actually come down to a rational conclusion, one would need to factor in everything that relates to food and the means of getting them, either by purchase or by growing them.
are we at the mercy of india?
the recent situation in bangladesh may provide an answer to the above question. every day a bangladeshi native is being brutally tortured by the indian bsf. and not only ordinary people, a bgb soldier also fell into the hands of bsf. it is also being observed that the indian government, through bsf, has been grabbing our lands and making thousands of our people homeless.
india's anxiety!
for heaven's sake, why should india be worried over the plot in bangladesh army? is this not tantamount to intervening in some country's internal affairs or is it a testimony to the fact that bangladesh has ceased to be an independent nation?
bsf's brutality on bangladeshi civilians
i was almost throwing up watching the youtube video showing the inhuman and barbaric torture on a young bangladeshi civilian by the bsf on india-bangladesh border last month. this reminded me of the still photos of the torture on the detainees at abu ghraib prison in iraq by some members of the american forces. what happened there was most inhuman that is beyond any condemnation. but that happened within the four walls of a prison.
let us be united
so far a few were reported as disappearing. now we have allegations that even army personnel are disappearing. and what is more, our major business establishments are slipping out of our hand and going into the hands of our neighbour. the way india is treating us, as reflected from bsf's beating up of a bangladeshi national by stripping him of his clothes and holding a bgb man in their custody, one day we may hear that our independence is disappearing. the government has to clear all the mess before it is too late. the government is there to bring order in every sector by open-minded consultation. shady deals will rather aggravate the situation. let us be united in our effort to fortify country's sovereignty.
an insecure country we live in...
the way our government refuses to ensure the rights of its citizens is very unfortunate. the lgrd minister syed ashraful islam said, “cattle lifting, drug smuggling and many other crimes have been taking place in the border areas. this has happened in the past, is happening now and will happen in the future.” this statement clearly says that the torture by bsf on the bangladeshis on the border is not much of an important issue to the government.
rethinking extended retirement age
the recent decision of the government to extend the retirement age of government employees from 57 to 59 years has become beneficial to those who applied for lpr one month earlier. but as per the retirement rule, an employee should apply to the authorities at least one month ago for taking lpr. in case, an employee applies for taking retirement and the authorities approve it, then how would the new rule be applied in his case? but in most of the cases, the retired employees have joined the old job again. i think the government should rethink the application of the new rule.

why are bsf men so angry?
newton's third law of motion certainly doesn't work on the india-bangladesh border, because what indian border security force does unto bangladeshi citizens aren't reportedly done unto indian citizens by border guards of bangladesh and weren't reportedly done by its predecessor bangladesh rifles. the comparison is not intended to provoke retaliation from the bangladesh side, but to draw an obvious contrast between the border guarding forces of the two countries for a valid reason. if bgb or bdr could exercise restraint on this side of the border, why is bsf on that side so brazen in its behaviour?
