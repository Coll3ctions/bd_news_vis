safeguarding children's rights
it is with some consternation we observe that the draft "children act 2012" has proposed to cut the age of children from the current, universally accepted 18 to 16. such a move goes against numerous existing laws both national and international: the national policy on children, 2011, prevention of trafficking act 2011, vagrancy act 2011 and the united nations convention on the rights of children, to which bangladesh is a signatory. although, the ministry of social affairs insists that this inconsistency will be addressed prior to enactment, the fact remains that the proposal vetted by the ministry of law suggesting that it is alright to lower the age limit is a reflection of how little we, as a society value our children. view the page sports

jackfruit . . . or the fruit of passion?
if it were 16 years ago, i could clobber anyone showing a dislike for jackfruit. i remember hating people who used to say, 'oh, it is such a smelly, sticky fruit', or 'how can jackfruit be someone's favourite?' well, it was mine absolute favourite. i could eat the whole fruit in one sitting. this fruit was my passion since i was a toddler…..and who sowed the seeds of passion for this fruit in my heart? it was my dear father. he had so many points in favour of this fruit that a child, particularly so attached to her father, would naturally be convinced that this was the best fruit in this whole wide world.
young murderer
i was just a little boy
when they handed me a gun.
i was stripped of my innocence
so in rage i shot two holes in the sun.
sorrow found me
when it was time for me to be happy.
shattered space, trapped in this cage
don't look at me like you understand
don't give me sympathy
all i want is your company.
sing me a song, read me a story
happy endings were always a mystery
the violet sky synchronizes and the gray pill
envious as jack and jill went up the hill
and below we stand silent
waiting for the boring end
and no story to tell.
i choose to camp in the valley down below
i take a knife every time
when the scar is about to heal.
i cradle the pain
waiting for the sandman
but he never showed
like the scarecrow standing bold
aimless, the ravens fled from the world this cold
but i am arrogant enough not to simply let it go
pleading death to let me play this one last show. view the page star health

a life lived intensely . . .
a few hours before his life was put to a brutal end by assassin-soldiers in august 1975, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman was reading shaw's man and superman. that was typical of him, for he was an intense reader in his private moments. in his public appearances, he was an inspirational leader, an orator the likes of whom are but rarely observed in history. he was as much an admirer of men like winston churchill and abraham lincoln as he was a fan of bertrand russell. among his other heroes was, of course, huseyn shaheed suhrawardy. his respect for mohammad ali jinnah, despite his later and growing disenchantment with the state of pakistan, endured. in netaji subhas chandra bose, mujib spotted the quintessential political rebel on whom a nation could depend to work wonders. his admiration for the poet kazi nazrul islam was immense, to a point where, as bangladesh's founding father, he had the rebel poet brought over to dhaka from calcutta in may 1972. it was a classic and yet rare instance of a rebel meeting a rebel.
