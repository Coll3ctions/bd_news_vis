some social scientists argue that the contemporary labour movements are in severe crisis. this crisis includes declining militancy, falling union densities, shrinking wages and benefits, and declining overall working conditions. some common sources of these crucial problems in the era of globalisation are hyper mobility of capital creating a race to the bottom among nations; decline of state sovereignty, especially in the third world, undermining traditional associational bargaining power and welfare of the workers; and the new work organisation and technology, representing flexibilisation, creating a vast number of part-time, and/or contingent workers. the new flexible work organisation enhances managers' prerogatives, disciplines workers and introduces piece rate processes, thereby creating hyper competition among the workers. furthermore, employing unskilled, malleable and 'backward' rural women undermines the traditional trade union role in the factories.
