proliferation of fake tins
it is indeed disconcerting news that more than 35 per cent of the tax identification numbers in a sample survey conducted by the national board of revenue have turned out to be false. that raises the very pertinent question of how the individuals owning these fake numbers came to acquire them. one cannot in any way deny the fact that 35 per cent is an inordinately high number, especially in a matter as serious as tins. which again leads to a new question: how did the mechanism involved in the preparation and provision of tins come by such a grave flaw? the answer to that question, as also other questions relating to tins, must come from the nbr itself. it must explain its own failings in this regard. obviously, there have been lapses along the line which have spawned the proliferation of tins. why those lapses have been there and what is being done to plug the holes is a question that now calls for a credible answer.
cheaper prices of fuel

daughters of toil
in the early morning, dhaka becomes a city of women; from slums and tenements, a long procession of young women, clad in flame red, bright blue or green, fills the streets, their chappals kicking up the dust on the margin of the rough roads. they are garment workers, on their way to the thousands of factories.
jute industry
our jute industry is facing a number of problems in the backdrop of recent global meltdown. the recession has triggered a decrease in the demand of jute-made products. prices of jute products have also decreased by nearly 15%. our local companies are incurring losses by selling their products at prices that do not even cover costs. moreover, production costs are very high.
election fever
i remember the early eighties when i accompanied my mother to a polling station. i remember the blue smudge on my mother's nail--the proof that she had cast her vote, those posters, the crowd of people around the polling station. the whole episode left the impression on the child's brain--that the election is a time of festivity, something akin to a fair .
a great opportunity
the caretaker government started off their proceedings by entering into the political arena quite ambitiously but consequently failed to live up to their expectations. the more they dug, the more dirt spilled out of the heart of this country. all kinds of obnoxious and filthy corruption was viciously interrelated and no doubt they were unable to curb it. and now the courts are rocking with innumerable bails that have been granted to the people convicted of outlandish crimes. after all these incidents, a question arises in the mind of a common citizen like me, that if our politicians are so innocent and if our leaders are so perfect, then why have we been branded as the most corrupt country in the world probably two or three consecutive times? we human beings are mortal and not intricate robots and therefore mistakes and misapprehensions are bound to occur in our actions, thoughts and decisions. and it is our obligation to realize our mistakes and rectify ourselves accordingly. certainly, we cannot complain about lack of virtuous and graceful personalities in our country. but they are dispersed throughout the corners of this vast and endless sea of murky water and it has become so difficult to track them down. this upcoming election will be providing our politicians with a unique and distinctive opportunity to learn from the misdeeds that they have been held guilty of. it will also test their grace, smartness, capability and whether they are honest enough to correct themselves.
us presidents
according to some uk tabloids the baghdad shoe thrower had no chance of hitting president bush. apparently, all relatively young us presidents are experts at dodging missiles, (mostly) thrown by their wives. one story going round is that soon after bill clinton took office he dodged a table lamp thrown at him by hillary.
founder of awami league?
i would like to draw the attention of the leaders and policy makers of the present al to the "election manifesto of bangladesh awami league 2008". in its very second para it has been mentioned that "- - - - - the architect of our independence, the greatest bengali of all times, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, was the founder of our party". regarding foundation of al we have come to know from the banglapedia (bangla version, page 110-112 of the 1st part) that the party (then it was "east pakistan awami muslim league") was born on 23rd june, 1949 in dhaka. the leaders on the first committee were president: moulana abdul hamid khan bhasani, vice-president: ataur rahman khan, shakhawat hossain and ali ahmed khan, general secretary: sheikh mujibur rahman (at that time he was in jail), kh. mostaque ahmed and a.k. rafiqul hossain, treasurer: yar mohammad khan.
“every child is special”
thanks to amir khan for making 'tare zameen par'. it's a movie which has the power to make every parent feel that their child is very special. it makes you feel that ishaan (darsheel) the young actor, could be your son, daughter, friend or he could be you.
withdrawal of cases
the dropping of extortion cases against influential bigwigs apparently brings out the harsh political reality of our country. in bangladesh 'what's ethical' and 'what's acceptable' largely depend upon the prevailing political situation. today what we regard as 'a dire crime' might turn into 'a mere misunderstanding' tomorrow. as a result, prudent people seldom fail to heed the call of time. as the political scenario is gradually changing, the businessmen who were once courageous enough to file significant extortion cases against sheikh hasina and tareq zia can obviously imagine the consequences they would face if these 'powerful people' retaliate after being triumphant in the upcoming election. it won't be reasonable to criticize these businessmen because there really seems to be no other option left for them. it appears that our political destiny will always be controlled by a handful of people. and as long as these people can take advantage of the right situation they will always get away with their crimes. businessmen, who are now dropping cases filed against top politicians, are actually clever enough to sense that the 'blind masses' of bangladesh won't ultimately stand by their side and the public will eventually vote for the same corrupt culprits, despite being aware of their evident misconducts. these businessmen at least felt the need to alter things when they 'mistakenly' envisaged a new horizon of change.
dual nationality and us laws
each country has its own citizenship laws based on its own policy. people may have dual nationality by automatic operation of different laws rather than by choice. for example, a child born in a foreign country to us citizen parents may be both a u.s. citizen and a citizen of the country of birth.
bush in iraq
ethically, i do not endorse the way the iraqi journalist muntadar al-zeidi expressed his disgust against the us president george w. bush because by this action zeidi being a journalist has shown gross disregard to journalistic ethics. under the conventional rule, it is unlawful even to point a finger at the car carrying a foreign dignitary. after all, mr. bush is the president of a country which has been bestowed with abundant knowledge, resources, and power. of course, it is true that president george w. bush being the head of a country which is considered the lone superpower has abused his capacity by invading iraq on a false pretext that iraq had harboured weapons of mass destruction. but in reality, bush's hypothesis could not be proved as no such weapon was found. but the war commissioned by president bush had claimed lives of hundreds of thousands innocent iraqi people plus 4,209 us soldiers. the united states spent nearly $567 billion since the war in iraq began in 2003.
no choice?
the whole country has gone mad about the forthcoming election. but i still don't understand why and how they decided that we have to choose between khaleda zia and sheikh hasina. why do we have to choose between the two ladies who have been consistently failing, lying and harassing us over the last 15 years? are we to believe that out of 144 million people in our country, there is no more qualified and more capable person to be trusted with our lives and the future of our children?
politics and religion
i am most interested in the motivation, history and present practices of religious people who get involved in politics, especially those who get involved in ways that alarm the fellow-citizens of their democracy! maybe my experience in the uk might throw some light on this issue and encourage those of all religious persuasions in bangladesh who are sincere about bringing into their national life the goodness, honesty and desire to help the needy that the theory and practice of any good religion should teach us. it cannot be a bad thing for keenly religious people to want to participate in the political processes but it is how they do it that brings either good or bad consequences. view the page international
