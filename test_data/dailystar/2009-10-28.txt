irresponsible utterances hitting a new low
it is a sad commentary on politics when seemingly responsible political leaders in bangladesh end up making rather irresponsible utterances. for far too long, politicians who should have respected one another despite all their differences have gone on questioning one another's integrity and even patriotism. one of the latest instances of that is bnp chairperson khaleda zia's accusation that the ruling awami league is not only mismanaging things but is also engaged in a conspiracy to change the map of the country. that clearly is a grave charge to be laid at the door of any government. again, it is one which the bnp chief, who has been prime minister twice, has not backed up with evidence. she has not specified in what manner the map of bangladesh will likely change under the present political dispensation. if she was playing to the gallery, she did it in bad taste.

taposh ... and all those old questions
the attempt on the life of fazle noor taposh has set off a chain of events we cannot really run away from. in a bigger sense, we should not shy away from the truths that may be emerging once again about august 1975 now that quite a few individuals related to the makers of that unmitigated national tragedy have been netted by the law enforcers. but, of course, you might suggest that by now we have known everything there was to know about the conspiracy to murder bangabandhu and his family and then the leaders of the mujibnagar government. and you would have a point. which is why we will not go into exploring that territory again, at least not now. for there is another that beckons us.

weak opposition and a sad state of affairs
rahul gandhi is the perfect post-ideological politician. those who think he is preaching to the choir are missing the point: a significant chunk of the electorate is tired of grand creeds. rahul gandhi leaves behind a trail of feel-good bubbles on his travels. contrast this with the hyperventilation of his cousin, who believes that b-grade histrionics pave the way to stardom. view the page sports

border tension

clipping acc wings
in the name of reform to make anti-corruption commission more effective and pro-people, the government is planning to curb this anti-graft body's authority so that it cannot unilaterally file corruption cases against public officials, policymakers, lawmakers and other representatives. it is learnt from the news media that the cabinet committee, formed last march to review the acc act, has already drafted some proposals to this end and forwarded those to the commission for opinion. but surprisingly, the chief of the committee expressed his ignorance about the details of the proposals as he attended only one out of the five meetings held so far. this tells us how a government committee works.
extra power generation
this is a response to a report on the related matter published in the pages of a local english daily, some days back; where the writer was critical of the governments move to give away energy saving lamps to villagers. the distribution of 26,500,000 energy saving electric light bulbs is a wise step taken by the government. they deserve to be congratulated, rather than be criticised for it!
does the earth need human beings?
it is fashionable now to hold high-level junkets called regional and international conferences, protocols and establish innumerable committees to study practically every aspect of the earth from the melting polar ice to the ozone layer, from earthquakes, cyclones, global warming and climate change, to rain forest preservation, food production, population control etc etc. the ultimate theme is always “how can human beings save the earth”. this is just another manifestation of our inherent arrogance and our blind confidence in our own stupidity. we are delegating to ourselves a task which evokes no confidence in our proven abilities. we have only to look back at our own track record which covers just a mini-second when measured in the time scale of the earth's existence.
toothless tiger
us president barack obama in his first historic speech to un on 23 sept reminded the third world leaders, among others, of one most important point- "eradication of corruption". on october 17 the bangladesh prime minister vowed to contain corruption in her speech in the first ever held historic anti-poverty rally in the country. it sounds she is sincere to implement her election pledge but it remains to be seen what she can achieve.
longevity
undoubtedly, medical science has made remarkable progress in the last few decades. it has invented the root causes of many diseases and identified many germs, bacteria etc. albeit many new diseases are breaking out in our midst, the medical science is not resting, rather it is trying to defeat them.
whither rule of law?
on october 10, 2009, a magistrate along with a few dozen policemen broke down the unauthorized portion of an apartment. apparently, the owner rebuilt the broken portion of the apartment in the following two days.
no understanding!
despite the frequent announcement by our honourable prime minister about the drives against corruption and lawlessness and her advice and warnings to the concerned authorities and administration, the people of bangladesh so far have seen no sign of improvement in either of the areas. it should be mentioned here that this type of drives, announcements and assurances appear to have become the trademarks of both the leaders who have ruled the country so far in the name of democracy. again, among many people, another notion goes like that, if both of our beloved leaders(hasina and khaleda) get united forgetting all bitterness, the country will succeed in various fields of development and will be able to eradicate poverty.
television channel
a few days back it was learnt that ten more private television channels would be given permission to operate. in this connection, i have something to say. the government can persuade some private initiator to start a channel that will be focusing on our agriculture. in fact, as an agro-based country we must have a channel on agriculture. this channel will broadcast programmes relating to agriculture and cover different aspects of it.
ssf protection
i was surprised watching the news on tv that parliament had passed the ssf protection bill for bangabandhu's family members. the daily star printed 13 adverse comments (none said in favour of this bill) in “volleying back” on october 09. this is very unfortunate that nobody pays attention to public opinion or thoughts which are nicely presented by your newspaper. i would request the mps and ministers to assess the public opinions reflected in press reports. however, there is no question about pm's additional security. but why for other family members? this is questionable! why is the al inviting criticism?
traffic jams
ref: mr. k. siddique-e rabbani's column. in my opinion, we don't have any chance to depend on a slow moving means of transportation like rickshaw in the 21st century.

this is a matter of great concern for all of us to see the elaborate version of the televised interview given by none other than the notorious serial killer, rasu khan.
akbar's column
i regularly read m j akbar's post editorial or column in the daily star. i would like to thank m j akbar for his pragmatic, anti-fundamentalist, sympathetic, scholarly and smooth writings. he calls a spade a spade and advocates equal and deserving treatment for the indian muslims. the indian muslim population may even exceed the whole population of bangladesh. his writings like 'muslims need jobs not iftar' etc and 'the truth: gandhi is less of a draw than jinnah'( ds -15.10.09) are eye openers as to peoples' psyche and longings. it seems that people love controversy, melodrama and theatricals more than benevolent non-violent activities as carried out by mk gandhi.

jalil and al

a festering wound
among many bad things, general ershad did one good that i always remember. he dissolved his jatiya party's students' front. i don't want to dig the background of the dismantling, i just want to consider the deed itself. this clicked to my mind while i was reading the article captioned “thorn in hasina's crown.”
dowry system
dowry system has been an aged-old ill plaguing our society. as an observant onlooker and born and brought up in a village, i have witnessed the powerful existence of dowry system and its adverse effect on impoverished families very closely. a typical village marriage is full of festivities like singing, dancing etc.
fight against poverty
recently, the government has taken different initiatives to encourage people to fight poverty. it's obviously a good venture. but 'work' is more effective than 'word'. we understand that poverty is our number one enemy but how can we get rid of it is a billion dollar question. only holding some campaigns and taking oath in an air-conditioned auditorium is not enough.
no respite?
even the mentally retarded girls will not be spared from the rapacity of the rapists. a pictorial report was published in your daily on 11.10.09 that a young mentally imbalanced girl was raped allegedly by a local goon on 26 september at sailakupa upazila under jhenidah district. what a horrendous act! view the page international
