continuing its opposition to the initiation of discussions on a global treaty to halt production of nuclear materials required for development of nuclear weapons at the united nations conference on disarmament (cd) - the world's sole multilateral forum to negotiate arms control and disarmament agreements - pakistan blocked the adoption of the 2010 agenda for the cd on january 19, 2010 at geneva. its permanent representative at the cd, zamir akram, stated that his country did not want to work with a programme that was frozen in time and called for broadening the agenda to cover two other issues, which were directly aimed at india. according to him, the cd should also consider conventional arms control at the regional and sub-regional levels and also negotiate a global regime on all aspects of ballistic missiles. while calling for conventional arms control, zamir was recalling the un general assembly resolution sponsored by pakistan and passed in november 2009. view the page star books review
an arrogant state and a stateless people
there are some strong arguments muslehuddin ahmad puts across in this extraordinary analytical study of the palestine issue. you would have thought the middle east was an area where only its nation-states and the western powers would take interest. ahmad puts holes through those thoughts, assuming of course that you had any such. as one who has served bangladesh with distinction abroad in various diplomatic positions in various capitals, he brings to his work, indeed to his worldview, a degree of sophistication that ought always to be the underpinning of modern diplomacy. just how involved ahmad remains in foreign affairs comes reflected in this work, fundamentally his ruminations on the state of israel and the extent to which it has gone in upsetting the normal order of things on the global scale.
not every 'why' has an answer
i was mesmerized as i listened to a reading of saleha chowdhury's short stories. it was a regular meeting at gantha, a literary platform for bangladeshi writers to meet --- for individuals who write in english as well as for those who write in bangla. the book that was discussed at this meeting was the author's collection of short stories, shotogolpo . saleha chowdhury has been writing short stories since 1967, and all these stories have been collected in this compilation. there are but a few writers who have published a book with one hundred stories. if translated the title of the book would be 'a hundred stories.' it was published by bidyaprokash in 2008. it may be mentioned here that saleha chowdhury was awarded the annanya shahitya puroshkar in 2009.
extraordinary, like zorba the greek
in mehrdad baladi's disturbing novel, houri , there's a brief moment at the beginning that is emblematic of much of the subsequent story. as the narrator returns to his native iran and the airplane enters iranian airspace, “flight attendants hurried to remove wine and whisky from trays. men rushed to rinse the stink of alcohol from their breath. women donned dark hejabs to hide their hair and curves, scrubbed makeup from their faces. passengers were bracing for an inquisition, or something worse. even from thousands of feet above, and an hour before the plane landed, i caught a sense of the intolerant terrain waiting below.”
