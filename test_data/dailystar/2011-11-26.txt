the imperative of democratic law-enforcement

the many sketches of the sunset
muammar is dead! his journey of sixty-nine years has ended in indignity of the grossest nature. he was hunted down by the sworn enemies that he had created during his 42-year rule. the widely held perception is that he was a despot marked by eccentricities and hubris. when he took power by ousting king idris in a military coup in 1969 he was young and effervescent only 27 years of age. he drove the italians from libya. with libya's oil money he started building his international profile with his bluster and bounty. he is known to have given former us secretary of state condoleezza rice gifts valued at 200,000 dollars. among his fond projects in his shining days were pan arabism and armed struggles of secessionist forces. the western powers were understandably annoyed with him. his fortune started declining after libya's complicity in the lockerbie plane crash. his libya was a pariah state for a long time. the vision of pan arabism did not materialize. he tried to endear himself to africa. by that time his shine was gone and his sun was setting. and the sun ultimately set in sirte where he was born. he was not without his share of good work and yet he perished in a most brutal killing. silvio berlusconi of italy summed up the irony : ' sic transit glory mundi ' (thus goes the glory of the world).
a daughter remembers . . .
a life in the army appeals to many because it lets someone praise merit, ideas and action. it is the collective force --- one for all, all for one --- that makes the army a distinguished force in a country. my father, the late major general matiur rahman bir protik, joined the army because he believed there could be nothing better than serving one's motherland as a soldier. “there are things in our life”, he often said, “that we can feel but are difficult to be explained. for instance, being a soldier. if we ask what leads one to a life of sacrifice without any rewards except the fulfillment of a mission well accomplished, what makes one jump, operate in the jungle, cross swamps, rivers and high hills, going to where the country asks him to, without complaining. it is impossible to answer. after all, being a soldier is a state of mind.”

campaign against epilepsy and its stigma
epilepsy, a disorder of brain characterised by recurrent seizures affects people of all ages. around 50 million people worldwide are affected and nearly 90 percent of the people with epilepsy are found in developing countries like bangladesh. although most cases of epilepsy respond to simple and inexpensive treatment, statistics from world health organisation (who) suggests that about three fourths of affected people in this region do not get the treatment they need.

afghan quandary
with the gradual withdrawal of western forces, afghanistan is again bracing for a rough ride. president karzai is running around for friends in the neighborhood. he rushed to india to sign a comprehensive strategic agreement but soon realized that it would not work under the suspicious and hostile attitude of pakistan. before the ink could dry karzai started courting pakistan. afghanistan had their definition of a sovereign state all along where tribal culture asserted more influence than the state. the lasting value in that restive region is the tribal and ethnic identity.
why usa needs a base in australia?
south china sea (scs) dispute has become an epicenter for many reshuffles in strategic thinking and regional politics. this dispute has been continuing to be a dominating factor in defining intra and inter regional relationship between south asia and south east asian nations, for couple of months. the us has extended its hands of assistance towards the scs littoral states to counter china. india's involvement with direct governmental presence in that region has added a new dimension. now it is widely assumed that china's supremacy, not only as a regional but also as a global power, will be tested with that dispute. recent move by washington to establish an air base in north australia, in the name securing us interest in pacific region, has given clear nod to us expansion in chinese water. beginning in mid-2012, company-size rotations of 200 to 250 marines will begin near darwin in australia's northern territory for six-month rotations. gillard, first ever australia's female premier, said the presence will expand to a force of 2,500 over the next several years. china is questioning the value of washington's plan to strengthen military cooperation with australia and updating its defense treaty with the philippines. chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu weimin called for discussions about the boosting of american troop deployment in east asia, questioning just how cooperation would benefit the international community.

a carnival of rhymes
it is fabulously enchanting in terms of its enormity of content that encompasses cultures worldwide, some as remote as the eskimo, sub-groups among the red indians, zulus and many more besides the main dominant cultures with which we are more familiar. it is immaculate. the presentation of contents theme-wise is awesome and gives readers a methodically neat classification within a given paradigm, drawing our attention to the purposes of individual rhymes. although many of the rhymes are known to many of us, they yet remain mostly a mere act of recitation on our part through long habit.
a dream has no time frame
between oxbridge and partridge, imran khan could have lived happily ever after, milking the first and shooting the second, a lord of swing wafting on privileges due to a legitimate national hero who brought home the world cup in 1992. he could have taken the soft route to power. zia ul haq invited him to join his cabinet. imran refused, a singularly sensible decision, not least because the fundamentalist dictator was dead within a few weeks of his offer. instead, imran khan chose to test his commitment and fortitude in the deadly chaos of pakistan's electoral politics. this book is the story of how a big boy who also played at night grew up to become man of destiny. the odds are good that he could lead his country's government in 2013.
