woes of the capital city
dhaka, the capital of bangladesh, is in a very deplorable state. of course the number of apartments, shopping malls, posh cars and expensive hospitals built in the city, does not go with my statement. but in reality, the citizens are in problem as there is inadequate supply of electricity, gas and water. in many places the water supply is unhygienic and contains pathogens. the basic needs of the people are not being fulfilled. the problem is worsening with every passing day. the roads are jam- packed with vehicles and even most of the footpaths are occupied by hawkers and the pedestrians are forced to walk on the road. the roads are occupied by parked vehicles and in many places more than half of the road is occupied .unfortunately, the sight is common in most parts of the capital, especially near the malls, hospitals, etc. the public are in a desperate situation. needless to mention the condition of the roads. the potholes on the roads have already caused many accidents, while many are taking place every day. these are like death traps for the bike riders and they also slow down the traffic movement. unfortunately, the government hospitals are also in a poor condition and they need good governance and good maintenance. we all know these problems but we don't try to find a solution. i expect all the readers of this letter will try to do whatever they can to solve the problems. if we can correct ourselves, then no doubt we can address the issue and do at least something for the country.
eat fresh and help the planet
it has become almost a herculean task for people to find good foods as fruits, fishes and vegetables available in the market are mixed with formalin and other hazardous preservatives. eating out is not safe at all as those snacks that are served are fried in stale oil. even eating dates in ramadan is not safe nowadays as those are preserved with formalin and medicine.
a farce, indeed!
the picture shown above is a bird's eye view. here we can see that the india's portion of teesta is full of water, but bangladesh's portion is not. what is the worth of this treaty? it seems there is not an iota of patriotism here. there is no accountability of our leaders. they are just fulfilling their own ambition. indian politicians are working in their country's interest.
road or death trap?
after the deaths of former finance minister saifur rahman, athlete alam mahbub, cricketer rana, shetu, filmmaker tareque masud, media personality mishuk munier, how many more such names are required to draw the attention of the authorities concerned? the highways across the country have, so to say, turned into a death trap claiming lives of many talented and eminent personalities. the tragic deaths of acclaimed filmmaker tareque masud and ceo of atn news mishuk munier on dhaka-aricha highway made the list of high-profile deaths in road accident longer. this is not a sheer accident, but virtually a murder for which the government is responsible. every year over 3,000 passengers die in road accidents, shows official statistics, while ngos say it is no less than 12,000. no doubt that this rate is the highest in the world. lack of trained drivers, rash driving and lack of punishment are mainly considered as the causes of accidents. but i strongly believe that absence of dividers on the highways is basically at the root of accidents as almost all the cases vehicles collide head-on with another. the realistic solution is to make all our national highways double-lane with dividers all along.
india must implement water sharing agreement
the people of bangladesh became disappointed after learning that the much anticipated agreement on sharing teesta and feni waters was not going to be signed.
teesta water and a few questions
it looks like mamata, the chief minister of paschimbanga, has become a villain for india/bangladesh treaty with her u turn on the water sharing issue. it is difficult for us to understand what may have changed her mind at the 11th hour. if we go slightly in to details and look around the indian states surrounding bangladesh, the question of solving the mamata puzzle becomes clear and scary at the same time.
the constitution is not a scripture
the constitution of bangladesh is now suddenly elevated to the status of a sacred religious scripture. the media seems to portray it as sacred and sacrosanct. why so, may i humbly ask? this document is supposed to reflect the hopes and aspirations of our people as well as the values and principles that they cherish and uphold. it is not a divine and infallible edict and criticizing it should not mean that we have to question that person's loyalty, allegiance or patriotism. the constitution itself guarantees the right to free speech. the irony is that the constitution also guarantees certain fundamental human rights and expressly prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. yet on a daily basis, in the name of remand, citizens routinely face police brutality in the form of threats, intimidation and torture. how do we allow law enforcers to violate and trample a fundamental right and yet want to hold those people accountable who dare to exercise their constitutional right of free speech?
