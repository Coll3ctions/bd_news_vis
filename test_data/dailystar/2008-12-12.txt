lifting of state of emergency
we welcome the announcement by the caretaker government that it will lift the state of emergency on december 17 and allow unfettered public rallies with effect from today as a prelude to the holding of a free, fair and transparent general election on december 29. indeed, it is a proper and fitting response to the demands voiced in recent weeks and months by the political parties as well as members of civil society for a withdrawal of the state of emergency in the interest of a full and enthusiastic participation of all citizens in the electoral exercise. the decisions reflect the general expectation that political activities will be conducted in a peaceful and purposeful manner by all political parties. that will entail an observance of the electoral code of conduct in its letter and spirit by all parties and candidates. we are constrained to say, however, that there have been instances where intending nominees at the election have violated the code of conduct. that should not have happened and we hope such acts will not be repeated.

let us change ourselves
after the change of 1/11, the ctg tried its best to bring some changes in political culture, especially in the two major political parties through the minus two formula but clearly failed. the two ladies are now back again to the political arena and resumed their full activities targeting to bring their parties to power through the next general election. some of the big fish from the major political parties probably will fail to participate in the election due to their conviction in corruption cases but most of the power aspirants are the old faces. so, there will be no qualitative change in politics and consequently in the expectations of the general people for a brighter future. moreover, the reformist politicians are already in trouble and facing the risk of demise of their political careers.

cultural artefacts
those who broke the cultural artefacts thinking they are doing a service to islam are wrong. according to islam, a sculpture or statue is simply a piece of earthly material. a devotee of allah should not be moved by such things.
pakistan scene
mb naqvi very correctly identifies the real causes of pakistan's woes and suggests the methods for combating the taliban. his statement that taliban are moved by an ideology and it cannot be defeated by guns because ideas cannot be killed by shooting in the head is very pertinent. but i am afraid that such ideological battle against taliban cannot be won in pakistan by the methods he proposed. pakistan's very raisons d'tre is intolerance of all ideas outside religion. the national curricula from primary to tertiary level of education in pakistan conveys the ideology of islam only. pakistan's official history in its textbooks describe the birth of bangladesh as a vile conspiracy of hindu india to exact revenge on islamic pakistan for the creation of the country in 1947 and bangladesh in pakistani public perception is still east pakistan!! the madrassah education system in pakistan is highly organized and developed and teaches taliban ideology and produces its armed jihadi battalions. the army is the self-proclaimed defender of islam, islamic culture and ideology in south asia. the army actually owns the pakistan state. the elected government in pakistan has only outward trappings of power for exhibiting in media. pakistan army's power lays in its guns, money and men. there are no secular social groups, civil society associations and political parties who represent the exploited illiterate people. the people are so thoroughly brainwashed that they are unable to develop a balanced view. the grip of the triumvirate mullahs, military and the punjabi-muhajir elites on society, culture, politics, economy and minds is so complete that any liberal-humanist education system based on secular worldview is unthinkable there. there are no intellectuals in pakistan who can present a countervailing humanist ideology against the dogma proclaimed by the state. the most terrible aspect of this structure is the supremacy of isi over every institution, organization of pakistan and its tentacles have reached every corner of south asia. all jihadi organisations across the subcontinent were spawned by the isi. and it has the support of pentagon which nourishes it.
poison of hatred
fareed zakaria's article on terrorism in bombay published in you pages on 2nd.december has its beginning that in my views can be linked to the american proxy war in afghanistan to throw out the russians. that was the start given to the jehadists. about this zakaria states, “the pakistan government has created, supported and financed islamic jehadists for decades.” this is not totally correct. zakeria, however, conveniently forgets that this was done with the full support and financing by the usa in the first place! it was these jehadists who fought the proxy war for the usa; while afghanistan was fully under control of the russians. godless communism was an excellent political motivation for the jihadists that led to the birth of al-qaida, a cia misadventure that badly misfired against them!
an appeal
we are the teachers of non-government high schools. near about 98% students of secondary level are studying here. but we are getting a very poor salary. when a teacher lives in a poor condition, then teaching properly in classroom becomes very difficult.
thoughts on victory
december is here again. so will be the 16th of december. our victory day. we have been celebrating victory day for the last 37 years. yet we never felt like victorious in anyway. instead we felt like vanquished with each passing year. and those, who were defeated on 16 december, 1971, smirk with arrogance and vengeance. with every passing year, these anti-liberation elements are multiplying like amoeba and slowly but steadily enwrapping our everyday lives and the way of our living.
congratulations, hillary!

battle of plassey
like millions of mothers, my mother also told me the tale of siraj and his mother-wife-daughter in my boyhood, where siraj was sketched as a hero and clive as a villain. siraj was defeated in the battle of plassey through a conspiracy. as a result, the english ruled this land for about 190 years.
future of pakistan
as much as i admire the new pakistani civil government, i feel less optimistic about whether it can finally put the genie back into the bottle that its military had created in the name of national interest. the sixty years' indo centric policy has resulted in nothing but a weak state with no purpose and aims. paradoxically, it has become a victim of its own creation. view the page international
