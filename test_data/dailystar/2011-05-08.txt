our paean to the bard
rabindranath tagore goes on occupying a very large segment of our collective literary consciousness. and as bangla-speaking people in bangladesh, in west bengal, indeed all across the bangalee diasora observe today the 150th anniversary of the birth of the poet, it is fair to suggest that the pre-eminent niche he holds in our collective life is not likely to be moved or shaken ever. in considerably more ways than one, rabindranath embodies the psyche of his people. in a larger sense, from the perspective of history, he speaks of india as it used to be . . . or perhaps as it always has been in time.

celebrating tagore
the observance of the 150th birth anniversary of rabindranath tagore symbolizes the deep reverence in which the poet has always been held by bengali-speaking people not only in bangladesh and west bengal but elsewhere around the world as well. such reverence has to do with the fact that it was tagore whose poetry introduced a powerful dose of internationalism in the way bengalis looked at the wider world around them and the other way round. his was a comprehensive way of looking at life, not just through his poetry but through his prose and his art as well. rabindranath tagore happens to be one of those rare of illustrious individuals whose comprehension of life and death and everything happening in between has been total and layered with meaning at various levels.

weekly currency roundup
may 2- 5, 2011
international markets
the us dollar went through another week of sustained weakness. the euro held near a 17-month high against the dollar on thursday as markets waited for the european central bank to reinforce higher rate expectations, with a hint of a june hike needed to boost the currency further. markets players said the euro could rise further if ecb president jean-claude trichet, in comments after the ecb meeting, uses the phrase "strong vigilance" on price pressures, signalling last month's rate rise would be followed by another as early as june. however, some analysts thought further upside potential from trichet's remarks would be limited. trichet is due to speak at a press conference around 1230 gmt, after the announcement of the bank's may policy decision. rates are expected to be left on hold for now, but trichet's reference at last month's meeting to "close monitoring" showed the ecb remains in a tightening cycle. data showing hiring in the u.s. private sector was weaker than expected in april, and a sharper slowing of service sector growth, reinforced diverging u.s. and euro zone rate outlooks. the federal reserve is expected to keep policy loose for many months after its bond-buying programme ends in june on wednesday; top federal reserve officials repeated their cautious view on the policy outlook, saying inflation remained well under control. market participants are also watching commodities to see if a further slide prompts short covering in the dollar and unwinding of dollar-funded carry trades. view the page metropolitan

settle rohingya issue
myanmar is one of the neighboring countries of bangladesh. there exists a close tie of export-import liaison between these two countries. of late, the rohingya issue has been creating a crack in the diplomatic relationship between the two countries. thousands of rohingyas (myanmar's aboriginals) have been crossing into bangladesh for a long time. because of their illegal entrance, our local inhabitants are suffering much. rohingyas are now causing serious social and economic disturbances. they are now creating violence in our land. most importantly, many blacklisted criminals use the rohingya-cover to disguise themselves from police. moreover, they are sometimes used as the human and drug trafficking agents! so, it is very important for both the myanmar and bangladesh govt. to come forward and settle the matter.

media spotlight
the world is a selfish place where everybody is after the romanticism and gloss of the rich people. most of the media covered the story of love affair and wedding of the royal couple at a time when millions of people are dead and displaced due to tsunami and earthquake in japan; thousands of people are dying and being displaced every day in the middle-east and africa due to civil war and on the whims of the rich and powerful countries. which should be the focus of the media- the lives of millions or the romantic love story of a royal couple?
how frail is our sovereignty!
having worked in a british tea plantation for over three decades i found a lot of interest on the tea plantation which is expanding to north of our country. in april 2006, i was horrified to see the encroachment of a part of our motherland by the indians under the guard of the bsf and wrote in your daily with no reaction from any quarters. the dc and the local administration visit these areas as a routine and do nothing about it. while the two ladies and our parliamentarians have so many other things to argue about, none has the courage to speak about this encroachment of our motherland. while other nations are ready to defend every inch of their motherland, bangladeshis are petrified to even print this in the dailies. how frail is our sovereignty!

cpd suggestions
the suggestions of cpd while talking at press briefings on the upcoming budget at their dhanmondi office was praiseworthy. however, i disagree with dr. debapriyo who suggested that a tin certificate should be made mandatory for opening a bo account. it does not hold a convincing rationale on the ground that a large number of investors are either retired or housewives or returned from foreign countries after completion of their contracts or small investors who don't have tin. it is also important to mention that most of the above mentioned investors are part-time investors who come to invest in the capital market since the national saving certificate has considerably lowered their dividends. it is also not logical to suggest that interest should be charged on small investors when they buy or sell shares in the market as this will cause investors to lose interest in the capital market. we propose that the government should make a ceiling and charge interest on a certain amount so that it does not afflict the interest of the small investors.
science and religious leaders
it is said that one of the great mysteries of physics is why our universe appears to be made entirely of ordinary matter when matter and antimatter are understood to have been created in equal amounts at the time of big bang. the scientists have detected the antimatter partner of the helium nucleus: antihelium-4, a new particle, also known as anti-alpha. it makes the study about the condition of the early universe easy.
frequent power cuts
i am an investor and businessman living abroad. i have a property in dz baridhara, dhaka. since i came to bangladesh i have been witnessing a troublesome period due to power cuts at least 6 times every day out of 12 hour period. this happens early in the morning also. why such power cuts constantly occurring during early hours of the morning? it is nothing but a sabotage taking place by a group of employees who may have other plans to bring bad names to the authorities, or is it a deliberate attempt to create pressure on the authorities to achieve other advantages? i am really disheartened as i am considering my future plan as an investor here.
dangerous sound pollution
not to say of dhaka, even the district towns like kushtia have now become helpless victims of dangerous sound pollution. indiscriminate and ceaseless hooting of vehicles, ringing of rickshaw bells and ghastly metallic sound of running trucks has made the streets unbearably noisy. to add to this, there are loudspeakers used at the highest pitch mostly for commercial purposes. brick-crusher machines creating terrible sound are often seen operating freely in residential areas.
referendum please
the partition of bengal in 1905 was based on religion. in 1947 the predominantly muslim half of bengal became east pakistan and the predominantly hindu part became the indian state of west bengal. nearly 92% of the population of bangladesh believes in the quran and the sunna, yet due to trepidation of its harmoniously large hindu dominated neighbours, they hesitate to express today their democratic right to religion. even the prime minister sheikh hasina, favouring islam to be the state religion and ensuring equal rights to other religions, hesitate to retain bismillah-ar-rahman-ar-rahim above the preamble of the constitution.
