becoming superman
he'll be flying into movie theatres in 2012, but who exactly is the newest superman, henry cavill? the latest screen star to don the famed crimson cape has gained fame as a castmember of showtime's period romp "the tudors," and will hit the big screen in the upcoming greek mythology epic "war of the gods". but before he was tapped to play the iconic superhero, he was super close to portraying everyone from twilight's edward cullen to james bond to, ironically, superman in another filmmaker's vision of the superhero. view the page op-ed
discountenancing the deficits
when the prime minister of the country comments that it is proving difficult to put a complete stop to the extra-judicial killings, we may feel concerned. however, the chief executive has to be commended for her frankness because despite the protestations to the contrary by responsible persons in authority, extra-judicial killings are a reality.
commitment to normalisation
in a barren relationship, even a small shower makes the difference. the ground is broken. india and pakistan have been distant neighbours for more than six decades. that foreign secretaries of the two countries met and did not disperse in disgust is itself news. but when both are satisfied after the talks, they make a big splash.

beginning of the end
against the bank of the meandering shitalakhya river nestles charsindur, a village where most people are sharecroppers. each year the river renders quite a good number of people landless, making them dependent on the well-heeled for a square meal. about six to ten families are moderately rich out there; land is the sole source of their riches. in fact, these people own eighty percent of the total land of the village while the rest is either khas or fallow lands. of those so-called wealthy families, zobedullah, a moulana from deoband, was the one who settled out here quite a long time back. unlike his compatriots, he was modern in outlook, especially when it came to the question of planned parenthood. compared to the usual family size of the other moneyed people in the village, his family size was by far the smallest: two sons and a daughter who had been married off to an educated and well-to-do farmer in shibpur, a few miles further up in the south.

contemporary quotation
it is not a revolution, not in the literal sense of the term, not a way of standing up and straightening things out. it is the insurrection of men with bare hands who want to lift the fearful weight, the weight of the entire world order that bears down on each of us - but more specifically on them, these ... workers and peasants at the frontiers of empires. it is perhaps the first great insurrection against global systems, the form of revolt that is the most modern and the most insane.
quotes
when an opponent declares, "i will not come over to your side," i calmly say, "your child belongs to us already... what are you? you will pass on. your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. in a short time they will know nothing else but this new community."

images of a vibrant culture
razia sultana has been teaching bangla literature since the early 1970s. she has carried out research on many different aspects of bangla folklore. shahitya bikkhon is one such book where the author has brought in nine essays which range from women depicted in the old and middle ages in bangla literature, baromashi songs describing the anguish of separation in the lives of rural women and the famous poem bidrohi by kazi nazrul islam. there are essays on the works of giants like nawazish khan and mozammel haque in bangla literature. the hard work of the author is visible in the writing. it gives one an insight into the subjects that she deals with.
the lives of soulmates
soul mates are said to be heaven sent. shudha and anju are two individuals who have known each other as cousins since they were born. but above it all is the unity of their souls, of how they bond together. they are born on the same day and from that day they have been together. they are like the two wings of a butterfly. they dance, they sing, they eat and they sleeep; all of these are done simultaneously, living under the same roof.
of books, of contentment
searching for books we have always wanted to read is something of a painful pleasure we go through at some point or the other. about a decade ago, i happened to step into a second-hand bookstore somewhere in a small town in yorkshire. the second-hand books looked rather new to me. that was testimony to the care with which the shop owner had been looking after his goods, if you can call them goods. he was there, obviously convinced that i was a serious enough buyer. he pointed to the various shelves in the store, which in itself was for me a rather agonising affair. after all, you cannot get your hands on all the books in a store, can you? and because you cannot, there is that faint crack somewhere in the heart to let you know of the spasms of regret you are about to go through.
