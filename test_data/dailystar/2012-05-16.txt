congratulations to our young talents
this year more than 86 percent students who took part in the ssc exams have come out successful. it is really very nice to see the jubilant and potentially prospective students embracing the teachers, guardians and friends just after hearing the result. i congratulate them on their success. this time the girl examinees have outnumbered the boys. the credit goes to the education ministry and the non-government organisations that are working to promote female education. students have done well in both english and mathematics. another important aspect that should be mentioned here is that the science group students have done comparatively well. the fear of creative method that engulfed the students, teachers and guardians has now completely disappeared. however, my request to our young talents, concentrate on study and get well prepared and be committed to serve the nation in the future; your service is badly needed for the nation to move forward. we are waiting keenly to see you make effort to follow the correct path. keep up the good work.

of muhith, heath and other men
abul maal abdul muhith has always been a lovable man. there is something of the gregarious in him, a spontaneity of friendliness you hardly come across in any other superannuated bureaucrat or present-day politician. there is then the humility which you cannot miss. in a society where pretensions run deep and pretence is generally the norm in social behaviour, muhith is that rare personality who makes you feel at ease in his presence. his remarks to the media on the issues which this nation is confronted with are those you may not always or fully agree with, but you can be sure they come from somewhere deep inside him.
cheese sandwich and white wine
in a democratic system, politicians exploit the mistakes of the opposition. they do so for their own reasons and justifications, they want to prove how wrong the other party was and at the same time project their own views and programmes on the same subject to gain popular support. however, politicians always maintain decency and courtesy in their language and make sure that they do not utter offensive words. politicians by nature follow diplomatic manners and etiquettes. they normally will not say something unless they are certain. the british house of commons is one place to see how deliberations are made and how they are responded to on the floor of the parliament. it is sad that even after 41 years of independence, politicians in bangladesh have not learnt the language of parliamentary democracy.
family: nature's masterpiece
having a place to go -- is a home. having someone to love -- is a family. having both -- is a blessing." may 15 has been celebrated as international day of families since 1995. it is an occasion to reflect upon the importance of families, people, societies and cultures around the world. the theme of this year's day is "ensuring work family balance."
china slows down, and grows up
more than one-half of americans think china is already the world's leading economy -- an astonishing misperception, given that china's gross domestic product is still less than half of america's. as george orwell once observed: "whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible." china has grown at a breakneck pace for so long that its aura of invincibility has grown to outsize proportions in the western imagination.
finance minister's outburst
tv viewers must have seen an angry mr. muhith, our illustrious and occasionally outspoken finance minister, a few nights ago. he was giving his response to mrs. hillary clinton's comments on grameen bank and professor yunus. he said that mrs. clinton's comments were unwarranted. whether her comments were really unwarranted or not are a matter of value judgment and diplomatic nuances, but we do not know whether he showed his boldness by saying that to mrs. clinton directly when she was here. there was no media report indicating that he did so, so presumably he did not do so.
