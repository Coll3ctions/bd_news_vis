ivy's victory in ncc polls: 2011's most positive event
the year 2011 is gone and we are already in 2012. in my opinion, the most positive event in bangladesh last year was the victory of selina hayat ivy in narayanganj city corporation election and the daily star published her picture smiling with a 'v' sign in the front page of 'new year special 2012.' this was not an ordinary victory, it reflected the hopes and aspirations of the mass people against all odds and oppressions. she had to fight against a formidable adversary who got the blessing of the ruling party. but people liked ivy's simple and hard working nature. above all, she was not involved in corruption. ivy is an exception. she was elected first when the bnp was in power and now when her own party withdrew their supports from her, she was elected again. her father was elected in 1974 in a similar way.
bnp lawyers should join war crimes prosecution
recently one of bangladesh nationalist party (bnp)'s top leaders urged the government to stop the activities of international crimes tribunal (ict). the bnp has made it clear that it stands against the prosecution of crimes against humanity. we cannot betray the ideals and values of our liberation war. the crimes that were committed in 1971 must be dealt with very sincerely according to the law and this opportunity must not be lost. we are grateful to the government for starting the process. there may be some criticism, but the people of bangladesh should trust it.
violence against women
a report prepared by bnwla and published in the daily star on 9th january 2012 has surprised me. the report was about the safety and security of women in our country. very truly we can say that proper monitoring by the government agencies and raising awareness among the people will have positive impact. i am confident that those people who are doing the acts of violence are not unaware about it. a group of people are continuing with such acts including torture on domestic helps. formation of a national commission to protect the rights of women will be of help. we need to realise that all of us have sisters and daughters whom we love very much. otherwise one day our own sister or daughter may become victim of torture.
patients being fleeced at cardiac clinics
it is a great relief that treatment of heart diseases is now done pretty well here in dhaka. as we know, a patient with heart pain or heart related complaints is always advised to consult a cardiologist. if after investigations and angiogram, a patient is found to have blocks, one, two or more, the cardiologist is supposed to advise the patient what treatment s/he can undergo within his ability. but our cardiologists outright suggest implantation of 'ring', indicating nothing of the other method which is also widely available and he can follow. the cost of each ring is 1.20 or 1.40 lac and it is alleged that a hefty sum of commission is paid to the cardiologist by the ring-marketing coterie. usually most of the patients need two rings and with other charges (hospital stay, medicines and cardiologists' fees, etc.) the cost of implantation of two rings come to between tk. 3.50 and 4.00 lacs.
