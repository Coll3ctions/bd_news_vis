reckless driving and death on the road
there does not seem to be any seriousness on the part of the traffic authorities about curbing road accidents. of course, accidents happen everywhere around the world. but the general rule is that measures are always in place to handle such situations, meaning that corrective steps are taken to prevent a recurrence of mishaps on roads and highways. unfortunately in bangladesh, such steps are conspicuous by their absence. a sign of that comes through the sight of road accidents taking place on a daily basis not just in dhaka but in other parts of the country as well. the latest in this long litany of tragic road tales is the death of a pedestrian near eden college on thursday. hit by a speeding bus, he was dragged around by the vehicle for a hundred yards as his shirt got entangled with the bumper before the driver stopped the vehicle and simply ran off. on the same day, a student was killed when a speeding truck ran over him in narail. earlier last week, seven persons died in road accidents in the capital. even on-duty policemen have been killed by speeding vehicles.

addressing our environmental challenges
the government, sections of the civil society as well as the country's major universities have been following the evolution of the environmental paradigm in bangladesh with great care and seriousness. this has been reflected in the convening of several workshops and meetings since the beginning of this year, and also with the cabinet approval of laws related to the newly instituted climate change trust fund.
lacklustre governance
the manmohan singh government is only 500 days old. yet, it gives the impression of a setup that has lost its vigour and vitality. it looks jaded. governments are in such a state when they are at the end of their tenure, not at the beginning. the reason is not that the ruling party does not command a majority in the lok sabha -- 206 out of the 545-member house. it is the attitude. the party was in a minority even in its last term. but governance was not as lacklustre as today.

win some, lose some
hard to believe, but it is only ten years since this millennium began with a bang and we have already to a great extent put the millennium development goals (mdgs) on the shelf. why we ever had to set goals based on a man-made calendar is another issue, but the fact is that the year 2000 gave us an excuse to set goals that would do just as well had they been set in 1999 or in 2005, or for that matter even today. goal-setting in the context of the planet's life has to be a continuous process. or else we have to wait for the next millennium.
bridging the urban divide: an mdg perspective
bangladesh is one of the exceptional countries in terms of having already made impressive progress towards attaining the millennium development goals (mdgs). it has already attained the mdg on gender parity in school enrolment in both primary and secondary schooling, child mortality was halved during the 1990s, life expectancy has increased to 61 years, net primary enrolment went up significantly and women's economic participation has increased. additionally, the country is on track with regard to several other mdgs. however, despite such advances, there has been a significant deterioration of human level outcomes and quality of life in urban areas, which jeopardizes the efforts of bangladesh in achieving its mdg targets.

the bibliophiles we love to read about
you cannot resist getting your hands on this book, provided of course that you come by it. that adolf hitler was a great reader, that his private library was stocked with 16,000 volumes, is what timothy ryback tells you in his pretty gripping work, hitler's private library: the books that shaped his life. which makes you wonder. did those books --- and they were so many --- really shape the fuhrer's mind? it all depends on how you rate his reading or how you trace his passage through his books. there were the works he admired, such as shakespeare's the merchant of venice. and he did that because it put shylock in a bad light. and shylock, you will remember, was a jew. anything that spoke to hitler of the dark sides of the jewish personality appealed to him. he was upset that goethe and other german writers focused on mid-life crises and the like and so came nowhere near the english bard in their comprehension of life as it was lived and as it was portrayed in literature. 'i shall see thee at philippi', hissed hitler at anyone who did not agree with him. and those were the days of the third reich.
forgotten pride of our subcontinent
the art advisory committee for the decoration of the first three buildings of the unesco headquarters in paris, which were officially inaugurated in 1958, held its first session from may 16 to 18, 1955. it included herbert read, professor hassan shahid suhrawardy, then pakistan's ambassador to spain. suhrawardy had become a living legend because of his astonishing linguistic attainments and scholarly achievements. he was one of those rare men who broke the barriers of language and custom with ease. of iranian descent, the suhrawardys were settled in midnapur district of west bengal. later they migrated to calcutta. this family comprised of distinguised scholars, politicians, lawyers and public servants, the likes of dr. abdullah al-mamun suhrawardy, who was awarded the first ph.d from calcutta university in 1908 for his dissertation on the sources of muslim laws.
for a fallen star
last year, as spring colours were just beginning to show in the northeast and we were pulling away from a frigid and dark winter, came a sad news flash, forwarded to me by one of our mutual friends. i learned that moinul hassan, the poet, activist, teacher and my ex-colleague, had passed away. moinul was a batch younger than i am, and had been a star since the days i remember him from, and was in his prime when his life was cut short. how does a star, one that is so lustrous and at the height of its stellar cycle, fall so suddenly and inexplicably? i asked with a deep sense of loss and sadness. for myself, for his admirers, and for all the causes he so fervently and relentlessly championed.

obama’s secret trip to afghanistan: war to continue till end
president obama is breathing more freely these days after signing his domestically crucial health bill into law last week. as a sure sign of this president obama took his first trip to the war zone in afghanistan, his first since becoming the president. for security reasons, the visit was veiled in secrecy. the president left for camp david on friday afternoon to give the impression that he was going there for a relaxed weekend after his victory with the health bill. the small group who accompanied the president were assembled there and sworn to secrecy. from there, the president and his men left un-noticed for andrews air force base to board the air force one to take a 13-hour long flight mostly through the night. the flight landed in bagram air base at 7pm sunday evening from where he took a helicopter ride to the presidential palace. before afghans woke up on monday morning, air force one was on its way back to washington. the president's visit to afghanistan lasted in all six hours!
religious extremism and our youth
seeing a group of militant youths arrested by the security forces makes us ponder as to what positive contributions they could have made, had they not been led astray. as conscientious citizens, we need to act now to stop the rot before it gets out of control; failure to act could result in situation as is prevailing in pakistan and in many other muslim countries. we need to study why and how religious extremism enters into the society's mainstream, how it thrives and what measures we could take to prevent our youth from becoming extremists. this article would address some of these issues.

in search of the saintly
an amazing book containing amazing stories of the lives, activities, struggles and sacrifices of some outstanding women who lived during the time of our beloved prophet (peace be upon him). they are the luckiest of women. no, i am not talking about his mother and mother-like figures, neither of his wives nor his daughters because they are either related to him by blood, or as foster parents or by marriages that are only natural, but about those women who were outside of such bonds yet by association with the prophet shone into prominence. of course, they fortified themselves with strong will, indomitable spirit and fortitude that came into full fruition because they experienced the company of the prophet (pbuh), could seek his advice through waiting on his decision, oftentimes taking decisions on their own knowing that they would be endorsed by him because they knew the prophet (pbuh) so well and would listen to his deliberations. therefore, although this book is divided into four groups of women, nevertheless, the section on such women merits attention in its own right much more than the other sections.
founding father under siege . . .
abdul matin's persistence in keeping the historical record straight for bangladesh is admirable. more to the point, it has been a necessary truth in the collective life of the bengalis. you could suggest that if matin were not around to keep us focused on the politics of bangladesh as it was forged and pressed forward in the 1960s and the 1970s, there would be a huge need to go looking for someone of his kind. obviously, matin has done his job well. his preoccupation with bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman remains, a particular reason being his understanding that the founding father of bangladesh has, directly as also indirectly, been under unremitting siege since his assassination in august 1975. to be sure, over the years, bangabandhu's legacy has regained some of its earlier lustre, thanks principally to the particularly strong niche his daughter sheikh hasina occupies in national politics and thanks also to the concerted struggle his party, the awami league, has waged over more than three decades to restore his reputation as the man behind the creation of bangladesh.
