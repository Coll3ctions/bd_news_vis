ozone: good and bad
ozone is a relatively unstable form of molecular oxygen containing three oxygen atoms (o3) and its production occurs in two layers of the atmosphere, i.e. troposphere and stratosphere. it is blue in colour and has a strong odour. the production of ozone in ground level atmosphere (troposphere) is regarded negatively because it comes from pollutants, which result from industrial activities, transport operation and some natural sources. on the other hand, the natural production of ozone in the stratosphere is necessary because it plays a key role in protecting life on earth from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. the major environmental problems we are facing now is its decreasing level in the stratosphere and the increasing level in the troposphere due to anthropogenic activities.

global powers eye africa
africa-when the word comes forth, some stereotyped pictures appear in our minds. we envision africa as a continent of tribal strife, poorest nations and states with geometrically sketched boundaries. once upon a time oriental thinkers perceived africa as a 'dark continent'. but now africa is a sublime continent beyond all these imaginations. now many global powers are extending their interest and sphere of influence towards it. among these china and india are worthy of mention. bangladesh, this time, is not lagging behind. it is also looking for opportunities and thus exploring potentialities to meet the growing food insecurity and export of workers to new destinations.

diary of an idealist

gromyko and the death of a promise
andrei gromyko was a regular target of cruel humour, all the way from joseph stalin to nikita khrushchev to leonid brezhnev. and yet all these men knew of the invaluable expertise which gromyko, beginning with the onset of his diplomatic career at the height of the second world war, brought into soviet dealings with the rest of the world, especially the united states. he was there at dumbarton oaks when the united nations was given shape. as soviet permanent representative to the world body, he stamped his nation's signature on the formative stages of the un. he served as deputy foreign minister. as ambassador to the united kingdom in 1952 --- he presented his credentials to a very young queen elizabeth ii even before she could go through her coronation --- he cemented a relationship forged between london and moscow in the crucible of the struggle against hitler. as ambassador to washington, it was his job not merely to present soviet diplomacy in as bright a light as possible but also take a measure of the way american policy makers shaped attitudes to his country.
complex emotions at work
imagine a man attempting to understand a woman. he would fret over the complexities of female psychology, scratch his head in frustration and waste uncountable pages and pens. there would be several rewritings, broken threads of reason, sparks of emotion and passages of to-and-fro analytical narrative. and in the end after implementing much intelligence our diligent writer would come up with something very similar to the golden notebook.
