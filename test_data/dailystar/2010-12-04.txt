after sheikh hasina's trips abroad . . .
prime minister sheikh hasina's twelve-day trip abroad appears to have opened up some new possibilities for bangladesh in its dealings with the global community. in broad measure, the prime ministerial visit as also the flurry of diplomatic activities observed in the nearly two years the government has been in office reflects a clear emphasis on a strengthening and reshaping of foreign policy priorities by the administration. it goes without saying that in these times, a nation's global significance depends in large measure on how it utilizes the opportunities which diplomacy opens up before it. from that perspective sheikh hasina's visits to belgium, russia and japan, as her earlier visits to india and elsewhere, can be looked upon as an opening of new windows for the country.
a question of food security
the food ministry is preparing to stock up granaries with quick imports. this preparation is due to delayed monsoon and less-than-average rainfall that is casting uncertainties over the expected output in aman production in the southern districts. it is indeed worrying that the foodgrains stock has almost halved over the past year. it was 7.19 lakh tonnes in august 2010, compared to 13.75 lakh tonnes in the same period last year; and within the time limit set for the procurement drive, the government could buy only 4.66 lakh tonnes of rice. that is what the food ministry noted in a report to the purchase committee a few months ago. view the page sports
razzak bowls into history
probably the expectation of fending off the hattrick ball got to christopher mpofu. the tall strapping paceman from the small town of plumtree in southern zimbabwe looked ill at ease wearing pads and helmet as he traipsed to the middle. the noise at the sher-e-bangla national stadium was a deafening cacophony as skipper shakib al hasan moved junaed siddiqui to first slip and rokibul hasan under the helmet at silly mid-off. the no 11 took strike, unusually wearing bowling boots rather than the half-spiked options for the batsmen.

cornered tigers roar
the 1992 world cup. held in australia and new zealand, saw many innovations that had appeared in the intervening period between the last tournament and the current one. most of the 39 matches were day-night affairs, with players wearing coloured uniforms that had the players' names emblazoned on the back. for the first time, the balls used were white, and unlike today, there was a separate ball for each end to guard against the ball becoming too dirty and dark to spot in the night sky. rules for the thirty yard fielding circle, introduced in the previous world cup were refined; now only two fielders were allowed outside the circle during the first fifteen overs. after the fifteen overs, the old rule of four fielders inside the ring at all times applied.
anderson swings england to top
james anderson reduced australia to their worst start to a test innings in 60 years and despite a stirring fightback from michael hussey, england remained well on top after the opening day in adelaide. few venues in the world are kinder to batsmen than adelaide oval, and after winning the toss on a 34-degree day, for australia to be dismissed for 245 before stumps was not only sub-par, it was potentially ruinous.

summary trials and the worries
there is no denying that criminal offences cause worries in the minds of citizens and thus it was not surprising for many concerned bangladeshis to be worried about the increasing incidents of the so-called eve-teasing. there was widespread criticism of the lack of speedy and prompt action from the authority in tackling the offence and the offenders. one remedy that followed the public outcry was the application of summary trials to counter this dimension of juvenile delinquency.
the king is naked
however strident the voice of secretary of state hillary clinton, it lacked the ring of sincerity. she had to defend the indefensible but she could have been more transparent and more forthcoming on the leakage of the us classified documents (popularly known as wikileaks expose). this might have revived confidence among the countries which the united states has hurt. they would have got some justification to give it the benefit of doubt.

native plantation for biodiversity restoration
tropical forests are considered the most endangered due to deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, shifting cultivation, clear cut, illegal logging and other types of anthropogenic disturbances. now these forests consist of only 10% of their former areas and 12% of their former primary vegetations. about 1.8% (in amazonian forests, probably 2.6%) of the tropical forests is disappearing annually. these rates indicate that one florida per year is being destroyed; one football field is logged per second. tropical forests are also subject to destructive natural forces -- cyclones, landslides, floods, mud flows, volcanic eruptions, fire, drought, and climate change.

the invitation
hillol jumped over the railway track. the train was approaching and the gate had been shut. the gateman could not keep up with the little rogue. merely telling him off was not enough. like a dragon-fly he flung himself all over the place and feared no one's scolding. one who was so carefree outside would definitely fear no one at home! in spite of everyone's spanking, he remained cheery twentyfour hours a day. no, not exactly twenty-four hours, he laughed away till he went to sleep.
in the glow of a sleepy sun
there are great loves that make the world go round. and if you think of the relationships that have impacted on history, or made some dents in the way the world carries itself, you need to go back to how jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir longed for each other's company. they loved greatly, and they contributed hugely to the shaping of literary and philosophical perceptions among their contemporaries and in the young who flocked to listen to their discourses.
facing the inevitable
mati by name and major general by age fifty five, he had a tough life. at the time of his death he was adjutant general at army headquarters. he had lived hard, and had always been a bit of a loner, spending time regularly in a quiet corner of the room with a cigarette. he was a devout muslim, a loving husband and a caring father. he had been in the army, fought for the liberation of bangladesh. a grateful nation conferred the bir protik gallantry award on him for his bravery in 1971. but he always told young people, “there's nothing special about me; it is all about determination and it is self-belief that makes you a soldier. there's nothing ever more satisfying than serving your country as a soldier”.

when trees are gone, stories turn into histories
our life is fraught with stories of mission and intermission. both missions and intermissions are polyphonic. deleterious missions of destroying the environment of collective well-being through commercializing process call for salvaging mission of social activism. intermission on the other hand is both a desired and unwanted procedure of action. it is understood both as the deliberation process of our action having to do with environmental degradation as well as our lack of concern amongst other things for the vegetation. it is in the phase of intermission (understood in the second sense) that the depraved stories are woven around the theme of denial which has a direct bearing on deprivation because of the commercial destruction of the trees. we seem to suffer from an untreatable amnesia regarding the importance of trees in our lives. the way trees are being extirpated throughout the world and particularly in bangladesh is already taking its toll on our physical and mental health, as well as on the ecosystem we live in.

revisiting a people's struggle in its vocal totality
militancy has been part of the bengali political psyche. add to that a dash of poetry, for poetry is what has consistently defined the bengali, and what you then have is a powerful expression of nationalistic sentiments. siddikur rahman swapon does, in the work under review, the very creditable work of reminding the nation not only of the various phases of political struggle it has gone through over the years but also of the stridency that was brought into that struggle at successive phases in history. the growth of bengali nationalism, as it were, was fundamentally a rise of gradual political awareness among the people of this country. you could argue that nowhere around the world can you spot a society as radically inclined as bengalis, for whom politics has historically been a ceaseless struggle against oppression at various stages of time. go back to the seminal struggle for language that has come to be known as ekushey. it was in february 1952 that political slogans first began to acquire a pattern, with such demands, voiced collectively by young bengalis marching in defence of their language, as rashtra bhasha bangla chai. it was, at that point, a simple enough demand. after 21 february 1952, though, it not only came by a new potency but also spawned songs that only intensified the militancy. abdul gaffar chowdhury's amar bhaiyer rokte rangano ekushey february and abdul latif's ora amar mukher bhasha kairha nit-e chaaye went a good many steps further in hastening the march to bengali disillusionment with pakistan.
ancient desires coming alive
atika cherry is very young. as a poet, she is also brave, with that element of the profound which must define one who is acutely conscious of modernity. in nachchhi (dancing, in bengali parlance), she gives you all the reasons why you should take her seriously as a maker of verses with all the underpinning of imagery and pathos such poetry entails. observe the obsessions, a tiny sign of them, in the poem oshshosti (discomfort):
of the poor and the hungry
the history of famines as well as of regular hunger is full of blood-boiling tales of callousness and malevolence. it isn't just regular starvation that one sees in 436 b.c., when thousands of starving romans 'threw themselves into the tiber'; or in kashmir in ad 918, when `one could scarcely see the water of vitasta (jhelum) entirely covered as the river was with corpses;' or in 1333-7 in china when- we are told- four million people died in one region only; or in 1770 in india, when the best estimates point to ten million deaths; or in 1845-51 in ireland, when the potato famine killed about one-fifth of the total irish population and led to the emigration of a comparable number.
old love and passion, rekindled
if shakespeare's tragedy romeo and juliet is a manifest love story of two young lovers, antony and cleopatra is a mature version of love between two mature lovers.
