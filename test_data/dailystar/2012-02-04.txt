fuel economy and fuel efficiency
fuel economy and fuel efficiency" is a widely discussed topic in the world. fuel economy is dependent on fuel efficiency and people's activities related to fuel consumption. although these two terms are well known to the people in general, the technical term "fuel efficiency" may not be easily understood by every one. it is now important for every citizen to understand the term and to take individual responsibility to increase fuel efficiency for reducing fuel consumption that will in turn save our economy and prevent environmental pollution. it is true that if one is sincere about maintaining fuel efficiency of the machinery and equipment he uses in his day to day life, saving fuel cost is possible. in the context of fuel price hike, i would rather say hiking price will compel the people to know about increasing fuel efficiency that may help adjust their fuel cost within their ability, and at the same time contribute to national economy and environment.

alien in one's own country
i have a growing feeling these days that i am getting gradually alienated from my own society and culture. some kind of strangeness has surrounded me since long. or has it invaded my own small world, comprising my thoughts, emotions and actions? it is strange because it is different, rather very much different, may be absolutely new, but certainly it is a changed phenomenon in one's life. however, change being a normal occurrence is expected to bring better results, improvements and all in the positive direction, looked upon as a boon in society. an opposite direction of it certainly cannot be welcome, however large a segment of society may fall for it. then again, speaking practically, infiltration of one or two not so desirable things may perhaps be seen as small instances of cultural intrusion that no culture is immune to. but when all-out change in various walks of life shows itself with much force and is capable of metamorphosing the fabric of one's culture and society, one cannot but experience a vortex of emotions -- a whirlwind ready to make one frustrated and depressed. view the page star health

iran's nuclear programme and world's energy security

the depravity of pakistan's soldiers . . .
no one goes looking for a war. it comes suddenly, taking people unawares. and once it does, there is that sure, eerie feeling that huge havoc will be the consequence, that people will die and with them an entire set of values. that being the historical truth over the centuries, there is that other reality of war being a time when heroism and villainy make their appearance. individuals die defending the nobility of a cause, thwarting the evil designs made by other individuals for whom the idea of a good life comes in a destruction of the lives around them. some soldiers win wars. other soldiers, rendered or proved qualitatively inferior to their adversaries, end up losing them, with results whose ramifications can last generations.
