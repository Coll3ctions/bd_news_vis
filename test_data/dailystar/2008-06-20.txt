tib on the state of corruption
the transparency international bangladesh's survey report on the extent and severity of corruption during july 2006 to june 2007 portrays a more dismal picture than we had expected. the expectations, however, wouldn't seem to be that much belied if we were to take into account that only six months of the caretaker government has been covered in the report. it is the first half year of the government that saw a massive anti-corruption drive against financial misdeeds and abuse of power in high places including wealth statements procured from people thought to have been above reproach.
zero tolerance on human trafficking
the report that 50 bangladeshi women are trafficked to india every day, to say nothing of those who are trafficked even further afield, should send a chill down the spine of any sentient human being, and there is no question the serious measures against trafficking should be at the top of any bangladeshi government's agenda.
in defence of civil society
this is a tough brief. perhaps i would have better luck writing in defence of serial killers or kidnappers or puppy-punters. even writing in defence of lawyers, it seems to me, would be a safer undertaking that would garner me fewer brickbats. but if a columnist cannot take an unpopular position every now and again, then what use are we (don't answer that question).

us aid to myanmar
a front-page news report on the subject was published in a local english daily. it rightly reflected the mistrust of myanmar authorities on the us proposal to use navy and air force for relief operation. to some extent it is justified, given the us tendency to get control of energy resources overseas by means fair or foul.

game of politics
nothing is impossible in politics this proverb came true once more. i was astonished to learn that khaleda zia was happy after hasina's release. but some months back they were so hostile that they did not even talk to each other.
dr. kamal hossain
i wonder how many people watched the channel i "sangbadpatrey bangladesh" on 13 june. the conductor of the programme, a very seasoned editor, apparently put the famous politician cum legal expert in a most uncomfortable position. when asked about his role as the la of many multinational energy conglomerates in the light of so many serious allegations/court cases on the subject now in progress against the greedy/corrupt politicians/leaders, he was very evasive.
tax on teaching
recently, i came to know that in the national budget 2008 the government has planned to increase the tax on private teachers. owing to the increased benefits obtained from receiving education, people, even the villagers who cannot afford a day's meal, wish to educate their children. these days, as you might know, the english medium students are greatly encouraged to move to private coaching centres. this is partly because the skilled teachers no longer prefer to teach in schools. instead, they open their own private coaching centres where there is a higher profit. so to obtain a better grade we are compelled to take private coaching. however, there is an increasing number of coaching centres providing educational facilities for the hsc and the ssc examinees. the government has already imposed a tax on them for which most of the private teachers have increased their fees. now with an increase in taxes they might increase their fees. in fact, many of them have already done so. we, who belong to the middle-class families, suffer the most. the rich can easily afford this whilst the extremely poor cannot even dream of it. with the rising prices of the basic necessities, we find it extremely difficult to pay these extra fees. most of us are working to help our parents financially but the income earned is still insufficient to meet the household expenditure. i ask, with all due respect, how is the government compensating for this? if we do not go to the coaching centres we fail to obtain a better grade. this might force many of the guardians, though unwillingly, to abandon the education of their children. in the context of receiving higher tax revenues claimed to be spent for the welfare of the economy, is the government ignoring the fact that bangladesh is indeed a country where a citizen after twenty-four hours of hard work still fails to afford a wholesome meal for his entire family? what is the use of such revenues if they cannot be spent on the purpose for which they had been initially imposed?
corruption at bsmmu
bsmmu is the most respected and the highest post graduate medical education provider to the doctors. there is no place here for the corrupt elements to carry on their academic duties. they have defamed not only themselves but also our nation both at home and abroad.
politicians
even after the long-awaited therapy (?) of 1/11, our politicians are not admitting that they made intentional mistakes in the last fifteen years. whenever they come out from a prison van they wave their hands to the people, as if people are not aware of their misdeeds!
diplomatic norms
perhaps, bangladesh is the worst example in the world where diplomats of different countries can intervene most easily into any domestic issue and can talk on that even if it is apparently uncalled for, keeping sense of diplomatic decency far from their minds and thoughts. there are several instances in recent past, how the diplomats and ambassadors of some countries passed their unwelcome comments on our internal affairs. this kind of subversion of diplomatic decency is tantamount to showing thumb to our freedom and dignity as a sovereign nation. it is clear to the intelligentsia that our own leaders and top officials of government were acting as catalysts in this ill practice of foreign diplomats which, in effect, instigates those diplomats to easily intrude into our matters. dignity is something which cannot be compromised at any level. but the irony is that our beloved bangladesh has become a place of cakewalk for diplomats of european union, usa, and other influential countries. they often dictate openly on how we should adorn ourselves as a nation to look soothing to them. it has an interesting and tragic similarity to doll dance and to its director. here they are acting as a director and taking us for a ride and abusing us as doll to be dressed and dance for them the way they feel good. maybe, we are already late to take a position against this exploitation by foreign diplomats.
our leadership
"here goes my people and i follow them" of leadership, thus spoke m. k. gandhi a leader of leaders of the finest calibre. he was the undisputed leader of british india and yet he was not in the conventional league of leadership. leaders of extra-ordinary intellect and greatness like the likes of jawaharlal nehru and moulana azad, instead of being stifled, flourished under his rather expansive shade! "a leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves" - thus goes lao tzu (taoist philosopher).
be tough
dr. kamal hossain has reportedly advised the present ctg "not to go soft on corruptionists". i strongly support him because corrupt elements, whoever they may be, should not go unpunished. we believe "none is above law" and the rule of law should prevail above everything else.
recycling kitchen garbage
dhaka city households produce tons of garbage every day from the kitchen. this kitchen garbage could be turned into precious compost to raise flowers, fruits and vegetables in the home yard and on the rooftop. the city corporation could supply each family with two plastic bins to put their fish and meat trimmings, fruits & vegetable wastes in one plastic bin and other wastes in the second bin. compost is made by digging a big pit in a waste land and layering the kitchen wastes in one layer and covering that with a thin layer of dirt. continue layering kitchen waste followed by a thin layer of soil until the dug pit is completely filled with several layers of alternate layers of kitchen waste. finally, cover the pit with straw so that it is not dried up by the hot sun. periodically the compost pit should be watered to keep it moist. millions of waste decomposing bacteria will turn the compost pit into a precious composted soil which could be sold to the interested public with a minimal price. this simple inexpensive compost making technology will solve a major garbage problem of the city and initiate a household green revolution. i have not seen anywhere in the country any good quality composted soil for home gardening. this simple agricultural technology would be a revolutionary step in home gardening.
