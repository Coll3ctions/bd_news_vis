averting road accidents

genocide
my dictionary defines genocide as simply “the act of killing a whole group or race of people”. how, when or why they do it, is not relevant. therefore, if any 'act' results in the death of a group or race of people, then that act is “genocide”.
child bearing
these days you see professionally successful woman are having babies in their forties after they have achieved the pinnacle of their career. women lose their natural ability to conceive with age. egg formation process called oogenesis begins before a girl is born during the prenatal development of the ovaries. in the embryonic ovaries the number of eggs cells are determined. biologically speaking at birth a girl baby is born with two million eggs. during puberty only 3-400,000 eggs remained alive. in case of male, sperm production is continuous since the diploid mother cells that give rise to primary spermatocytes continue mitosis through out life. however sperm count become lower with age in man. sperms are freshly generated by spermatogenesis compared to the egg which started the process before birth and set the number at early stage of meiotic cell division. set numbers of eggs during prenatal development in girls continue to die and get aged with the passing of time.

school based assessment
the government has recently taken a lot of initiatives to ensure the quality of education. with a view to bringing qualitative changes in education the ministry of education introduced school based assessment (sba) of students as a part of creative question system. generally, in the secondary schools, the examinations focus on assessing students' ability to memorize what they have been taught. but to ensure a quality education, proper assessment is needed along with an effective syllabus. so, the government asked the schools across the country to carry out sba of students of class vi-ix, instead of the existing evaluation system that depends solely on examination. with the introduction of the new assessment system, students' promotion to the next class level will depend not only on examination results but also on their performance throughout the year and on their personal development. some essential qualities such as oral presentation, leadership, tolerance, co-operative attitude, school behaviour, co-curricular activities, and social values are included in the assessment system. but it is a matter of great regret that many a school does not follow the rules of the sba. there are some teachers in every school who are not at all willing to implement it. they are habituated in traditional lecture method, rather than participatory ones. that's why the students get bored and try to whisper in the classroom. at times, the teachers become emotional and are compelled to give corporal punishment to the students. if the sba is properly implemented, no student will get chance to waste his valuable time and won't be bored with the learning method.

recently, obama's bold claim regarding the rights of the muslims proved his greatness once again. it would act as a lesson and inspiration for any secularist of the world. his activities prove his greatness. if all the world leaders act like obama, then the world will be definitely a better place to live in.
