seeking more power for js committees
the parliamentary standing committee on the law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry has put forward a legislative proposal aimed at compelling individuals summoned by it or any other such committee to appear before it. the proposal also stipulates that the committees must be provided with any documents they ask for at any time. on balance, we at this newspaper feel that the proposal has much merit about it. and we feel that way because we think powerful, purposeful and functional parliamentary committees are one of the factors which strengthen the democratic process in a country. that is ensured through such committees stressing the need to study various issues in detail and clarifying the various aspects of a given situation through seeking information from relevant individuals. we have had occasion to observe the workings of parliamentary committees in the west, especially britain and the united states. the precedents established by these committees abroad could serve as the foundations our parliamentary committees are based on.

of widows, tears and murdered soldiers
there are the many spells of sadness we have gone through in this country. there have been the sepulchral silences we have enveloped ourselves in. there are the tears we have shed for those we have lost, through the laws of mortality or the predatory instincts of men. but nothing, absolutely nothing, compares with the vacuity you spot in the eyes of the widows and children of the military officers murdered in such insanity at peelkhana earlier this year. a silence, one you cannot quite put into words, has come over nehreen ferdousi. she is not the nehreen you knew only months ago, regaling people with her conversation, making her way to places where she knew people would sing good songs. and, yes, she and her husband, colonel mojibul haq, always made sure that at the end of the day the soul would give of itself to melody, to poetry.

the judiciary and extra-judicial indiscretion
it is indeed heartening to note that the highest court in bangladesh has directed the concerned executive organs to explain the reported continuance of extra-judicial killings. in a scenario where the police have been unsuccessfully struggling to transform themselves and the political class of the country is apathetic towards the need to revamp the police, the concern of the judiciary to keep the law-enforcers on the democratic track is gratifying. view the page sports

tin bigha issue
as part of our training in a tour 'know bangladesh' we reached lalmonirhat, and thereafter dahagram angorpota, a small chitmohol (enclave) of bangladesh in indian territory. on the way to dahagram-angorpota, our guide again and again reminded us not to take snap on the narrow passage known as tin bigha corridor. it is called tin bigha corridor because the total passage measures tin bigha. on zero line we got down from the bus and walked on to the corridor, a narrow passage marked by white colour on both sides of the passage. the guide warns us not to overstep the white marking. 'why?' i asked. ' that's india' he replied. i found bsf personnel standing firmly, guns in hand, eyes fixed on the corridor to notice any walker crossing the white marking. i found a bsf personnel, big camera in hand cautiously taking video of us, another one beside him was manually counting the poor, silent, timid walker passing over there. again two or more personnel having kingly moustache and wearing half pant and tea-shirt casually sitting on chairs putting one leg on another, chewing gum or anything else and casting merciful look on the passers-by before them. beside us the bsf personnel raising gun were patrolling their border on high speed open jeep.

banani bridge & traffic management
the new banani bridge connecting banani and gulshan has been a great relief for people of these two areas as well as people who come to visit this part of the city. the bridge was well managed at the beginning, but recently things have been let loose. first of all, there is no constant traffic policeman at this important bridge. rickshaws, motorbikes even sometimes cars try to take advantage of this by coming from the opposite direction in this one-way bridge creating possibilities of accidents. also, this bridge was rickshaw free at the beginning. now, rickshaws have been allowed creating traffic jam. for the greater interest of banani residents and for easing traffic jam, i will request the authorities concerned to provide traffic police in this bridge at least during commuting times for office and schools. also, this bridge has significantly increased traffic flow at road #11 at banani. this road should immediately be made off-limits to rickshaws and this can also be turned into a one-way road as kemal ataturk avenue runs parallel and that can be made one-way the other way around. let's face it, it will be years before subways can be built in dhaka. till then, we must be smarter about traffic jam to make our city liveable, no one else will do it for us, we have to solve our problems by ourselves. this is a good time to start addressing the big problems through small steps and one step at a time. kolkata can be a good example of how they have smartly managed their traffic by turning some key roads into one-way during peak times and reverse one-way after 1:00pm as well as turning all major roads off-limits to rickshaws and making auto-rickshaws run on selected routes only. we can start by implementing it at a few selective roads and take it on from there.

football coach
bangladesh football federation officials are now famous for sacking foreign coaches, right and left. recently, the axe fell on brazilian coach dido. his fault was he did not select experienced players. he did select players whom he thought would do well in south asian championship. so it would have been wiser for bff to decide dido's fate after the saf championship. now we will never know, whether dido's player selection was a good one or not. dido did not pick some experienced players, as he had conflicts with those which were never resolved. dido should have been more lenient toward those players given the fact that the players did apologize. perhaps dido was trying to build a team consisting of young players for long-term good results. we should also remember that when a great player falls out of favour because of conflict with a professional coach, that player usually does not get regular playing time and in most cases he has to move to another team. while playing for villarreal, elegant playmaker juan roman riquelme lost his starting line up playmaking duty, as then villarreal coach chilean manuel pellegrini (now real madrid coach) did not like riquelme's attitude. so finally riquelme had to go back to boca juniors. but it was riquelme's brilliant playmaking ability that took villarreal to champions league semi-final, a feat they failed to repeat after his departure. that did not matter to coach pellegrini. world class dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy fell out with sir alex ferguson that prompted van nistelrooy's departure for real madrid. a professional european and south american coach's thought process is just like what i describe about chilean pellegrini and scottish sir alex. view the page international
