bad blow to rmg
your editorial of july 25 on the subject rightly suggests the utter lack of safety in the garment factories; usually run on the whims of the owners; most of whom seem not to look beyond their noses! it was very surprising, to say the least; to note that there was no adequate and reasonably high safety wall around the open roof, so that a worker can fall over it while leaning on the wall! normally in any residence it is not possible to fall over if you lean across the wall surrounding an open roof! this is the height of negligence, for which the owners are fully responsible and liable, under any circumstances!
bnp-jamaat
i have been making the point through my letters that the jamaat and the bnp are desperate and there is widespread sabotage in the power sector. even the honourable prime minister has mentioned this. now it has happened again. three power units at ghorashal have gone out of commission. apparently, instead of producing 950 mw, it is now producing 300 mw, at least that is what the tv ticker (etv) says. i feel it is sabotage, because i had predicted earlier that whenever the bnp and jamaat go for agitation, there is always a problem, especially in the power sector.
for world peace
us support for israel is for strategic reasons and us will never back out on israel. no matter how much the world care to scream, israel will never give up golan heights or the occupied palestinian land, including total control on gaza and west bank.
secular states
i hear many legal opinions that secularity is not possible with a state religion, faith in allah and the starting words bismillahir rahmanir rahim. this of course is not true because great britain has a state religion and a state church and a religious preamble to all legislations ( as has the united states with its trust in god and christianity) but none of these hinder secularity in practice because this is a legal concept and not religious. provided laws are brought in to prevent favouritism on the basis of religion, colour , or creed, or on any other basis, and everyone is given a fair and equal chance on jobs, education and other civic entitlements, on merit or other stipulated transparent criteria, then the country will be secular. if such laws are broken there should be heavy penalties imposed by courts for such non compliance. there is simply no conflict between practical secularity and religion and it is not necessary to stipulate that the country is secular in the constitution either. bringing in laws to enforce equality of entitlement is a practical guarantor of secularity as in the west.
a right step
finally, some measures are being taken by the government for curbing the ever increasing menace created by unruly rickshaws. i am pleased to see that the government is taking stern steps in managing the traffic system. although there are number of other reasons that contribute to the terrible traffic gridlocks in our city, control and gradual elimination of rickshaws from major city roads is inevitable.
city government
city fathers and city corporation election candidates pleaded for government under city corporation within their jurisdiction. as a city dweller we could see the city corporation failing to remove garbage all throughout dhaka metropolis. even karwan bazar kitchen market, built hardly two decades ago, is in a dilapidated shape as the floors have big cracks while main beams have cracks in many places which are now supported by props. anything can happen like begunbari, very close to karwan bazar.
corruption at college
i am a student of a govt. collage. it is very sad to note that employees of a govt. collage, who collect collage fees, are corrupt.
the city
dhaka is celebrating its 400 years of age. it is recognized as the hub of tradition, culture, history, business and other aspects of bangladesh. nevertheless , to most people living in dhaka, this is more popular as a city of misery, trouble and harassment. the question is 'which problems do not exist in dhaka?' from a bird's eye view, it seems that these problems are quite unsolvable. frequent outbreak of newer problems has become a normal thing in dhaka. numerous problems such gas shortage, electricity and power shortage, alarming outburst of hijacker-'molom' party, pick pocketing, traffic jam, human jam have become the day to day companions for the dhaka dweller. land grabbing and pollution of the buriganga, shitalakhya, turag have been adding to the miseries of the city dwellers. as per recent statistics, dhaka remains within the top five polluted cities around the world.
auto-bike
a new kind of tiny vehicle called 'auto-bike' is seen plying on the roads in many regions of our country. this bike can carry six passengers at a time and it is totally harmless to the environment as it does not need any liquid fuel. it needs only electricity for charging its batteries.
corporal punishment
a society is best judged by the way it treats its children. the inhuman practice of corporal punishment not only results in grave injuries, often the victims succumb to the injuries. many innocent souls get affected by didaskale inophobia (fear of going to schools), thereby affecting their career adversely. there also exists a group of tortured children who are psychologically shattered or even resort to suicidal steps.
critically ill doyel
a movie celebrity of our country, doyel, who during her prime time delivered some superb performances, is suffering agonizingly from some incurable brain condition. as per news report, none have so far come in aid of the critically ill actress whose family is facing harsh financial constraints. after being operated upon and staying hospitalised for long nine months a bedridden, speechless doyel has been brought back to home with continuation of treatment.
an appeal to nu
i would request the authorities of the national university to publish the results of ll.b (part-1) examination by this month. it ended on 30 april'10. it may be mentioned that the results of the hsc examinations have already been published which the respective authorities took only 57 days to publish, and this is a very positive sign. now, may i draw the kind attention of the nu authorities that if they can publish their results in such a short period, then why the nu can't publish the same results by this month as our ll.b(part-1) examination started on 12th mar'10 with the regular interval of seven days for each paper. many students are leaving nu in the middle of their education session as their honours course of four years is taking up to seven years and two years ll.b course is taking four years ! and they are again getting admitted in the private universities spending a lot of money to complete their student life.
minimum wages
why don't the garment manufacturers agree to the fact that it is they who undercut each other to get orders, thus destroying the industry by themselves. giving out lame excuses of stiff overseas competition is an eye wash to avoid wage increases. just two weeks back hongkong had to revise minimum wages of workers when the workers revolted saying that they would no more accept excuses like bosses' plea of stiff overseas competition. about same time when the eu threatened that gsp of 9 percent to sri lanka will be withdrawn due to human rights violations there, the sri lankan president replied firmly that sri lanka is not interested in gsp, the country can face the market without gsp. it is the garment manufacturers in bangladesh who are spineless and submit to buyers price offers and undercut each other as well. minimum salary of rmg workers should be not less than tk.4000.00 per month. on the other hand, bgmea can request the govt. to bring down bank interest to a single digit rate on loans to exporters and give discount on other production related expenses.
religious extremists
in a column "the pakistani-american conundrum," dr. syed mansoor hussain, a pakistani american physician living in the us, wrote in lahore's daily times on july 26: "born-again muslims and some of the recent immigrants have however adopted a style of islam that is quite different from what many of us were used to while growing up in pakistan. ... as a result we are seeing a dichotomy within the pakistani-american community. the concept of a pakistani culture is now being replaced for a segment of this group by an arab-islamist culture driven by religious extremism. unfortunately, this style of religion puts considerable emphasis on the concept of 'violent' jihad. the consequences of this evolving change in attitudes is sadly becoming manifest in rather tragic ways and influences the reputation of the community at large." in fact, this is what is happening in pakistan where the taliban are slaughtering fellow pakistanis in the name of jihad.
