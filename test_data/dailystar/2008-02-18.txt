the most crucial pak polls
pakistanis go to polls today under international gaze and regional spotlight. many people look at this election as pakistan's precious opportunity to transit from a disguised military rule to a civilian elected government. given unalloyed liveried authoritarian rule in the country for a greater part of its 60-year-long history, the people's longing to see a true democracy flourish has only intensified over time into a virtual crescendo. pro-democracy agitation centring around musharraf's ruthless handling of highest judiciary to replace it by his own men, his dubious trickery in securing second term as president by doffing, had added a tremendous value to this election. the stakes grew even higher for the democratic forces with the assassination of charismatic ppp leader benazir bhutto and the events following the tragedy.
provocative act
we find the republication of a cartoon on the prophet of islam by a danish newspaper extremely provocative, utterly outrageous and malicious in intent. all this is highly condemnable. the cartoon meant to hurt the sentiments of the people of a major religious faith is not only unacceptable, it is diametrically opposite to what the progressive countries of the west preach -- liberalism, tolerance, respect for different faiths and freedom of expression.

our history
the history of our liberation war has already been recorded. bangabandhu and some other national leaders who contributed to the liberation war are now a past phenomena. these cannot be altered, made or changed or re-written by anyone. the almighty allah made it happen and gave us an independent state in 1971.
us presidential election
did someone ever say america isn't still ready for a president who could either be a women or a black? yes, many do say. well, this would make none other than john mccain the perfect individual for presidency. nevertheless, many might speculate more; as we should be rather considering the real world facts. the american population is not made of one gender. but it's approximately half male and half female population, like everywhere around the globe. so if we want to believe males might not find hillary as pretty as cinderella, this theory would also support the fact that female voters would not hesitate to vote for her.
bau
bangladesh agricultural university, a renowned public university, has a great impact on the economy of the country. lots of graduates from this varsity are serving the country to make it self-dependent in agriculture. we are still committed to making a poverty free bangladesh by strengthening its economy as well as agricultural economy. a graduate from bau has been declared as one of the most talented young scientists in the world. the most noticeable thing to say about this university is that there is no sessions jam, while it is the most common phenomenon in other public universities. bau has started the semester system of education (english medium) in every faculty and this system is running very smoothly. i would like to thank the administration as it has modernised the education system and i believe students are also playing an important role in efficiently running the semester system by cooperating with the faculty members. the university authorities have already ensured residential facilities for every student. i think, very soon it will be a fully residential varsity.

just a question
economic inequity and an unjust employment policy brought the east pakistani people to the battlefield in 1971 for having the basic rights. after 16/12, they won the war and got bangladesh. but the key problem has not been resolved. the highest recruitment body (psc) for government services is responsible for the discrimination as the quota system persists. the state of economy is identical too- only 20% people are the owner of all resources. what is the significance of independence, really?

old cameras
ghias's poignant article on nurul islam's historic century old pin-hole camera, brings back the memories of my photographic days in dhaka in the 1950s, that started during my school days in calcutta in 1945! in those days i was the helper to my uncle (late) prof. kazem ali of buet. he was a photography bug; having a number of cameras, and his own darkroom in calcutta. there he used to develop, print and enlarge still films. i was the keen willing helper, learning the fundamentals of the trade from him! it was a wonderful pastime for me which kept me in the house most of the time.

good news but ....
we are a nation of fickle minds. we remember things when it is better to forget and forget those when remembering is in order. so, perhaps we have already forgotten what happened in august 2007 centring around an altercation between the students and the law enforcers, while they were witnessing a football game in du playground. the incident led to clamping of curfew in the capital and all divisional headquarters as the violence exceeded the limit and was not controllable with even emergency power rules. it is heartening that the university teachers and students have been acquitted but the common people will like to know what really happened on those two days of august 2007, who were behind the scene and with what motive.
british foreign secretary's trip
we all wholeheartedly welcomed the timely visit of the very articulate and smart foreign secretary of britain. we hoped, back in london, he would take some lighter time to look back to his short visit to bangladesh, and assimilate what he has seen, what he has heard and what he has said in public and private for our people, politicians and the government. we only hope that he had opportunities to appraise himself of the current economic and political situation obtaining in bangladesh in its right perspective.

bird flu and wake-up call
thanks for taking up the bird flu epidemic which engulfed the country at a galloping speed leading to culling of innumerable poultry, ducks, pigeons, quails, geese etc. the farmers, traders, feed producers and those related to the poultry industries are in deep trouble. your reference to the observation of dr. domenech, chief veterinary officer, fao, may act as an impulse to the fatigued authority to wake up from the deep slumber. since the first invasion of the virus into the country in march 2007, avian flu has left scars of onslaughts in as many as 26 districts. although no human is yet to contract the disease, there is no reason to be complacent, for disaster may strike any time.
28th bcs
despite the fact that bangladesh is beset with various environmental problems, the government of bangladesh is not creating any opening for the graduates with degree in environmental science. every day we come across news and views on environmental issues of national as well as regional and international dimensions. the bapa, paribesh bachao andolon, various ngos and universities organise conferences and awareness programmes to safeguard the environment. the environment directorate of the government has many full-fledged programmes to protect our environment. but unfortunately, the only cadre that asked for application for filling in the posts in the 28th bcs exams has been the forest department, and that stipulated the educational qualification as having graduation degrees in physics, chemistry, botany, zoology and 'soil, water and environment' - the last one being a department of dhaka university. but it may be mentioned that environmental science/studies is being offered as an academic discipline in nearly a dozen of public and private universities in bangladesh. with the above mentioned degree in 'soil, water and environment' as set out by the psc, the students of du will get a kind of preferential treatment. it will deprive those having degrees specifically in environmental science/studies from other universities.
corruption in titas
i was a bit bewildered after reading the heading of a ds report published on 29 january, wherein it was stated that 126 highly corrupt officials from the titas gas have vowed to return over tk. 400 crore earned illegally to the government exchequer. this has been the outcome of the drill- down investigation by the joint taskforce aiming to curtail corruption as well as to identify the roots of corruption and the people involved. this is obviously a great achievement.
justice prevails
the verdict by the high court division will remain as a milestone in the history of the judiciary of bangladesh. this is a great victory for the al and sheikh hasina.
returning officer or returning body
roadmap for the election is rolling us to national polls to be held before the year ends. many proposals are forthcoming to reform the election procedures. but one very important task-- selection of the returning/assistant returning officers-- needs serious review. in the past we saw election engineering/result tempering/media coup, where ros and aros played a vital role. in many cases, the returning and assistant returning officers (who have to work alone) could not withstand the pressure mounted on them by powerful quarters. as an insider i have witnessed many a case of willing/unwilling surrender on the part of the officer concerned. resistance to such pressure often brought unfavourable posting, punishment and even end of career. so i would suggest placing the responsibility on a body, instead of a person. in addition to the deputy commissioners, district judge, police super, senior engineer, civil surgeon, bar and press club presidents, ngo representatives and members of the civil society may be incorporated.
illinois shooting
now another gunman went berserk in northern university of illinois and killed at least six students and injured more than a dozen before shooting himself. what we gather from the news is that gunman steven kazmicrzak had a mental problem and was on medication for sometime and was also receiving counselling; otherwise according to friends and teachers he seemed to be quite a good natured student and had no criminal records. now the question that remains to be resolved is what prompted kazmicrzak to take such hostile actions? a similar incident happened in varginia tech a couple of months ago where student seung-hui cho killed as many students during his stooting spree. view the page international
