mass arrests have created panicky situation
it is time to talk about mass arrests again, for the obvious reason that there is growing public disquiet about the whole sordid business. in the eight days since the government launched what was given out as a drive against known and listed criminals, as many as 12,000 people have been detained and carted off to prison. the sheer scale of the operation along with the ferocity of it has left an entire nation reeling. most surprising is the fact that despite the government's stress on nabbing criminals there has been a wide-ranging operation against political workers throughout the country. in fact, more political individuals than lawbreakers have been taken into custody, which makes hollow the government's claim that the action is only aimed at people who have committed crimes and who have so long remained outside the bounds of the law.
tackling global food crisis
the rome summit on tackling the on-going worldwide food crisis is a sign of the desperation nations are faced with. it is especially the poorer nations that have been at the receiving end, with all the rises in food prices in the past several months. the extent to which food has now assumed the shape of a serious problem can be gauged from the doubling of prices in the last three years. prices are at a 30-year high, a terrible reality that calls for concerted efforts to be expended in handling the situation. un secretary general ban ki-moon's belief that global food production must register a huge rise in order to cope with demand is in effect a broad hint of the problem on the world's hands.

anti corruption commission
after reviewing the story of corruption in bangladesh, i would recommend that three separate and independent anti corruption commissions be formed namely:
workers abroad
it is indeed quite unfortunate that one of our workers in bahrain committed such a heinous crime as murdering his employer. and for him now around one-lakh bangladeshi workers' fate is in jeopardy as bahrain has decided not to renew their work permits. but the question is one should not judge an entire country through the misdeed of one person. there is also an element of discrimination here displayed by the bahraini lawmakers. had he been a worker from the usa or europe they may have refrained from such stern actions. so, we hope that our diplomats will manage to handle the situation appropriately and soon come to a pragmatic solution. in addition, our workers are also the victims of shady manpower agencies. for example, 27 bangladeshis had to return from iraq. they were promised by the unscrupulous agents that they would be taken to dubai but they ended up in iraq! thanks to iom that they have helped to repatriate 118 of our workers from solaimania. then there is the case of 45 workers returning from malaysia with fake passports as their original passports were confiscated by their employers besides being not paid their due wages. similar is the plight of workers in saudi arabia.
population boom
i refer to various letters on this topic. in particular the letters of may 26 and may 30 are most interesting in that these assert that "population problem is the root cause of all the problems of our country".
foot-overbridge
there is a notice from dhaka metropolitan police (dmp) in some important areas of the city telling us that we should use foot-overbridges, rather than crossing the road. no doubt, it is a good move.
national budget and the disabled
salvation for the deserving (sfd) requests to allocate 5 per cent of the national budget for the development of the disabled.
lively cricket!
as shoaib akhter picked up the wicket of the ace (indian) batsmen virender shehwag and gautam gambhir, the entire eden-garden crowd burst into a roar, vociferously cheering a distant glimpse of victory. perhaps, for the first time in their lives the crazy cricket lovers of calcutta applauded the triumphs of the nightmarish pakistani fast bowler. subsequently, megastar srk was seen to be dancing to celebrate the crucial turn of the match. no, i'm not depicting a bizarre dream sequence. dlf ipl has successfully obliterated the fragile boundary that existed between the facts and fantasies of the cricketing world. in this groundbreaking competition we have witnessed the glorious return of legends like shane warne, pollock, glen mcgrath, and gilchrist, as if they have been reincarnated to represent this exciting version of cricket, we have also seen world-class cricketers of the same national squad aggressively battling against each other, and we have seen the gracious intermingling of cricket and the glamorous world of bollywood. i think dlf ipl is a creative concept that's not only promoting the prospect of twenty-twenty cricket but it's also providing an opportunity to the international cricketers to get used to this relatively new format of the game. at the same time, the tournament is entertaining the cricket lovers around the world to a great extent.
fbcci's demand
recently, the fbcci president requested the government to offer black money whitening facility for the last time. interestingly, it is also the last year of the current non-political government.
our football
the bangladesh football team left dhaka on may 27 to take part in the upcoming saff football championship. with the deterioration in world ranking every month, the tournament appears to be an acid test for our booters. now, the team will play in a situation when the football federation has an organiser like salahuddin as its leader. besides, this time the booters seem to be more confident than before.
vips and roads
i had just got out of a screening of the film “brick lane” on may 13, when my cell rang. it was my sister. without listening to her, i started telling her about the movie which i liked quite a bit. but, on the other end, she didn't seem to be listening and was rather quiet. i soon learnt that she was at the local clinic with her five-year old daughter who was being given saline. my heart jumped i remembered that, in the afternoon when i last saw them, she had vomited a few times and now the doctor is saying that she is dehydrated. i felt so bad for her - the poor little thing!
female commuters' problem
the number of women coming to the job market is increasing. their daily commuting often becomes a nightmare as most of them cannot get on a bus easily and they are often harassed by the men surrounding them. several attempts had been made to introduce separate female bus service in the city but they failed for obvious commercial reasons.
fraudulent 'tuition media'
working as tutor is a vital source of income for many students. students, who don't get notable financial support from their families, often depend on tutoring to get themselves through their student days. some others, despite being well off, prefer it as a source of some extra income. in dhaka and some other cities, many organisations are playing the role of mediators in providing such jobs to the people, largely students, who are interested in tuition. these organisations call themselves 'tuition media'. nevertheless, how reliable are they?
city transport system
the ctg has taken a bold and practical decision to construct link roads between the old airport road and agargaon, by using the marginal strip of the old airport at the city end.
unfair
the cng fares in chittagong are being raised abnormally. it happens every day because the cng-drivers are reluctant to take the meter-based fare. consequently, the passengers have to pay excessively high fares.
manpower export
