10th anniversary of 9/11
10th anniversary of 9/11has been observed. surely the losses of the bereaved families are incomparable. but was it wise for the usa and its allies to invade countries like afghanistan and iraq? was it wise to torture and kill someone who was not guilty? was it wise to rape innocent girls and torture young boys? after 10 years many americans hold different perceptions about the attacks. some say it was done by muslims, while others say it was a strategy of the usa to find an excuse to invade iraq and afghanistan. osama bin laden has been killed and saddam hussein has been prosecuted but when will the people who started these meaningless wars face trial? when will these wars come to a stop? these wars aren't eradicating terrorism rather these are bringing misfortunes to the families of middle east countries and economic crisis to the western countries.
