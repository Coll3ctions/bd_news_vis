our man mashrafe!
is he lucky? no, never! mashrafe bin mortaza, the bangladeshi player with whom 150 million people may take pride, has been sold at $600,000 and he brought priceless pride for bangladesh. this is it. the luxurious and expensive cricket auction of indian premier league 2009 ends and mushrafe stuns millions of cricket fans round the world. is $600.000 unbelievable price for mashrafe? i disagree, why we should forget that we have some world-class cricketers. the world knows them but is reluctant to acknowledge. bangladesh, a country of countless miseries, has gifted many hidden talents like mashrafe. his price shows the dawn of bangladeshi cricket. now we of course will be getting due evaluation from cricket experts.

indian hc's comments
the bnp has officially refuted the indian high commissioner for his, what the party has termed as, undiplomatic remarks on bnp's statements on indo-bangla relationship. the indian high commissioner might have gone a bit out of diplomatic norms because he has been accredited to bangladesh to represent his country to maintain and further develop relationship with this country. we do not support the way he has remarked on the remarks of the bnp over the expected signing of some agreements between the two countries. but we feel the bnp, which came to power twice and ruled this country for over a decade, should now return to sense and speak things of merit.
pm in traffic jam
in your paper i saw the photograph of the prime minister convoy stuck in the farm gate traffic jam which made me very happy because this is definitely a change that we the ordinary citizen welcome. we do want to see our vvips going about in the city without making a nuisance of stopping the traffic for hours till they cross as has been practised so long. prime minister hasina had promised 'changes' in her manifesto and she surely showed that with her cabinet choice. then one of the first parliamentary decisions has been the trial of the war criminals.
rangpur university
this is a matter of great satisfaction that rangpur university is now a reality. although, from its very outset, the university has been facing various obstacles.
disappointed
though it's too early to comment on the activities of the al government, i am not happy to see the proceedings actually. particularly, the picture that was published in the front page of the daily prothom alo was so disheartening for me. i voted for the al for a change but what i saw is something that makes me confused about the future of bangladesh. a few days ago, you commented in your writing about the theme (digital bangladesh) of the al's election manifesto. you rightly said that before making bangladesh digitally developed, the al should make itself digitally equipped. i am so much disheartened to see such a picture that makes me feel shy to my friends and relatives whom i suggested to vote for the change. but the al has failed to get rid of the allegation that is said brought by their rivals, which is that it is the “factory of hooligans.” now i think i have to believe in this allegation.
indian fm's visit
indian external affairs minister pranab mukherjee paid a brief visit to dhaka recently and signed some agreements and called on the prime minister. these were expected.
deprived enclave people
the world, despite having 194 independent states, has turned into a global village with the blessings of information technology. every nation enjoys the facilities and services of an invention by a particular nation. in this era of modern nation state, the citizens are ensured all kinds of rights and facilities and even modern amenities for the ultimate advancement of the nation. in this modern age, more than hundred thousand bangladeshi citizens living in the 33 enclaves in four lalmonirhat upazilas are deprived of fundamental rights and facilities; free movement, proper education, healthcare facilities, employment opportunities and communication, security of life and property and administrative facilities, due to the isolation of enclaves from the mainland by two kilometres. whereas the countries manifold bigger than bangladesh can properly ensure the citizens' due rights, we are reasonably optimistic about our government's ability and efficiency to do so.
dead turtles
a revealing news item published in the daily star of february 10 stated that hundreds of dead turtles were found ashore along the coastal lines from cox's bazar to st martin's island. the report is very alarming for our ecology. we came to know that the fishermen killed the turtles entangled in their fine fishing nets indiscriminately. they did not prefer to release them. some fishermen told that it was a very hazardous task to release the turtles into water. actually, the ignorant fishermen are not aware of the repercussion of their insensible act. they are ruining the biodiversity and polluting the environment immensely. the experts warn of an impending environmental disaster as the aftermath of the large scale deaths of the turtles in the bay of bengal. the authorities should take some effective measures to motivate the illiterate fishermen, so that they stop such insensible acts.
nation must know…
it is just a month that the al government has come to power after a landslide victory in the last general election. recently, general moeen u ahemd has launched his book titled “shantir swapney” where he explained how martial law was averted during 1/11 changeover. the speculation which was in the air prior to that change is now found to be true as mr. moeen wrote in his book that it sounded like a veiled threat to him when envoys of some powerful countries told him that they would request the un to withdraw bangladeshi peacekeepers if the army cooperated in holding the elections on january 22, 2007 without participation of all the parties. this is a proof that the vital internal matters of our country are being controlled by outside forces.
save btv
btv and btv world are the government televisions which people have easy access to all over the country. i didn't normally watch btv due to its o “loyalty” to the ruling party or the government. i had a satellite connection with our television before the al government came to power. after the grand achievement of the grand alliance, i have also disconnected satellite connection.
old habits…
it seems old habits die hard, especially for our honourable ministers and lawmakers. just a few weeks ago they were busy bragging about making parliament effective and now they are fighting about seat arrangements when the whole nation is falling apart. i am grateful to the daily star for exposing the horrendous state of our primary schools across bangladesh but what do our politicians care about, when they can afford to send their kids to schools such as isd, aisd, etc.
