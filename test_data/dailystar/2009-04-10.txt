annulling lease on khaleda zia's residence
the government's sudden action in cancelling the lease on begum khaleda zia's cantonment residence took us by surprise as it did everyone else. coming only a few days after prime minister sheikh hasina appealed to the leader of the opposition, in the jatiyo sangsad, to vacate her home, which was gifted by the sattar government in 1981, the move was truly precipitate. and it was because the authorities do not appear to have waited for a response from begum zia to the appeal. are we now to believe that the decision to have the former prime minister evicted from her house had already been taken and the appeal to her actually amounted to little? even if the government had legal rights to take such action, there are standard procedures that need to be employed in handling such situations. the most basic one is for the government, through the appropriate department (in this case the cantonment board), to have served notice upon begum zia and given her time to respond. had there been no response, the authorities could have gone ahead with appropriate action, including the one it has taken now.
new upazila law

r-e-s-p-e-c-t

'we started a dream'
not so long ago, football plunged into almost nothingness as the country's football chiefs, having failed to inject funds into the game, only lived on aids from football's world and asian governing bodies. after decades of living in the oblivion, football seemed to take off with a new leadership at the helm of the bangladesh football federation (bff). still, the kazi salahuddin-led committee struggled to put the game on the field due to lack of financial support but then came citycell with the biggest ever sponsorship deal in bangladesh's football history. the tk 16.5-crore agreement for three years has made citycell and bff 'partners in progress' and the outcome was evident during the super cup final last month when a 40,000-strong crowd enjoyed the game. it definitely proves that football is on the right track again but the sponsors think that 'they have miles to go' to build on this success. the daily star senior reporter al musabbir sadi spoke to citycell's head of marketing dr. anand rajasingham at his office on thursday about the sponsors' view on shaping football in the last few months. here is an excerpt of that interview:

high costs of education
what is the cost of education of our children in schools, colleges and universities? is it not like exorbitant prices of essential goods and commodities? is it not price hike of education for all students at all levels?
rickshaws in dhaka
it was very disappointing to read your article in ds of 29 march entitled “gridlocked”. being a former secretary to the government, i would have expected balanced views where the interests of all dhakabashis are served. unfortunately, some of your suggestions lack logic and practicability viz:
rohingyas
in recent times, the plight of the rohingyas has come to light. they have been subjected to extreme inhuman conditions by the military junta of burma.
bangla as official un language
i welcome the js resolution to this effect and hope that the long cherished hope of bengalis everywhere comes to fruition. having said that, from my own experiences of un service, i can see very cogent objections which we must be able to refute. firstly, although bengali is the 5th most widespread language in the world, the un membership is not of individuals but of soveriegn states. state-wise bangladesh (with a population of 150 million people) is the only member of un, so that on the basis of population of the state members of un, perhaps india with hindi, or indonesia with its own language, or even pakistan with urdu has a stronger claim to make these also the official languages of un.
rain and road digging
in our country, road digging is one of the major problems for the general people. i am also one of the sufferers.
pitiful pwd
a local daily's staff correspondent's interesting report of april 1 on the subject clearly showed that pwd had been fooled even before the all fools' day (1 april)! however, they can get some satisfaction, that they were temporarily fooled! now they are hopefully wise (?) after the event at least.
renaming bdr
many political organisations have changed their names but we have not seen any noticeable change in their way of thinking or in their activities. many examples can be given that only name changing cannot play any vital role in changing activities.
bcl burden
pardon me for my reaction, but it seems a footnote has gone missing in m abdul hafiz's post-editorial titled “a losing battle from a slippery slope” in your issue on april 6, 2009.
smoking in public places
the letter entitled 'smoking in public places' published in the daily star on april 3 has drawn my attention for a raft of reasons.
importing electricity
bangladesh proposed to import electricity from nepal, india and bhutan. does nepal generate enough energy to meet its domestic consummation? my personal experience in kathmandu does provide enough evidence that nepal cannot export electricity. kathmandu suffers from acute shortage of power supply, load shedding takes place for at least 8 hours a day even in winter.
remittance
remittance inflows will slow down in the coming months as migrant workers are returning home, following strict enforcement of immigration rules in different countries.
darbar hall rental money
we certainly do understand that it is somewhat a little too early to broach this since the govt. and bdr are preoccupied with important and urgent issues. still life goes on and we have to address and attend daily issues. we have to attend day-to-day matters and resolve pending matters.
unexpected
all higher educational institutions in the city, including rajshahi university of engineering and technology, rajshahi new degree college, rajshahi polytechnic institute and institute of health technology were closed following violent clashes at rajshahi university. this was really unexpected. every student wants to get a better environment free from any type of violence. from 1947 to 1990 student politics played a crucial role but now student leaders use their muscle power through showdowns on the campus, creating panic among the general students. our student leaders have no patience to observe the situation.
pay commission's recommendations
from media sources we came to know that the government is not in a position to implement the recommendations of the pay commission in one go. it was also learnt that the minimum salary bracket to be recommended by the pay commission will be 4,500 and the highest bracket will be 45,000. although it sounds reasonable that our government can not afford provision of additional funds required to implement the pay commission recommendations in one go, i would still request the government to consider implementation of the recommendations fully from the next budget for the government staff working in the lower brackets of the pay scale. for example, the government may consider implementing the recommendations fully from next budget for the group falling in the range of 4,500-6,000 taka salary bracket, as this group could hardly benefit from gradual implementation due to present high living costs.
bcl leadership
according to a recent newspaper report, 'ongoing crisis splits bcl leadership.'
foreign investment
investment in bangladesh will not be dependant only on cheap labour or govt's repeated calls to foreign companies. law and order is the second biggest point. legislation has to be done so that the police dept can work without political influence. although the pm and the home minister asked police to become honest and dedicated, but they failed to prevent unholy influence via telephone calls.
language issue
international mother language day was observed throughout the country. it is true that our martyrs who had sacrificed their lives for this language are remembered, but real respect lies in showing proper respect to the very language for which they struggled.
people's power
we must be aware of the fact that a government is a variable force which may change in course of time. but the common people together form a constant force which has an immense power of regeneration. the nation never mortgages its power to a government after a parliamentary election. so any problem, whether it is created to embarrass the government or not, certainly afflicts us. recently, our country passed through a series of violent crises viz. pilkhana carnage, helicopter crash, some terrible conflagrations, workers' turmoil and change in labour employment policy abroad. there is political instability and violence in many educational institutions. moreover, we are inflicted by a global economic slump. we are like prisoners whose destiny is uncertain. ultimately, there will be a great economic crisis in our country. view the page international
