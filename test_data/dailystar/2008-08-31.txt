a whimper in pakistan
general "busharraf" finally went down with a "whimper" in the wake of what may be termed as a sequence of inconsequential "bangs" to prop his "kubla khan" image. history would testify that this dictator, analogous to others before him, was also predestined not to build the "stately pleasure-dome" he decreed. his prowl as the most powerful sultan that ever reigned in pakistan, effectively silencing the voices of democracy, by rewriting the constitution, dismantling the supreme court, and using the military against his own people has ended up in the "caverns measureless to man/down to sunless sea: " so much for the denouement.
let there be an end...
outrageous. what happened on the streets as tarique fell in the bathroom cannot be condoned in any way. i wonder what will these goons called 'chhatra' do if tarique is convicted and imprisoned or dies a natural death!! are they going to kill everyone in sight and burn everything they can? i wish i could express my anger without any restriction at the way public properties and killing of people took place in the name of so called 'gonotantrik andolon'. may i ask, is tarique rahman's life more precious than the life of the person killed--don't call it an accident-- by the goons of the jcd? what is tarique's contribution--as prime minister's son-- to our society, economy or country? what has tarique done to bring change to our impoverished society? what has tarique done to uplift the image of the country? the man who died for nothing at least contributed to the economy as a businessperson by earning his livelihood through hard work. but allegations are that tarique only nurtured a group of cadres. if these and other allegations against tarique are true, then i would not feel a fig of sympathy for him even if he is convicted and imprisoned. tarique is not even a politician but a so called 'businessman' in his own words. it's time to call a spade a spade. let there be no place for corrupt people--- whoever they are-- in society. we must introduce the capital punishment for corruption beyond a certain limit and for certain level of people. those who proclaim to be our leaders should also be ready to face the consequences if they fail. we want a clean society for our future generation. will our intelligentsia dare show us the way?
parks in the city
like everything else in dhaka, the quality of life in the city has deteriorated fast due to many reasons. looking around us, one will notice that dhaka doesn't have sufficient number of parks where the next generation and the elderly people can go and have some fun and fresh air. i also think there is no data available in bangladesh about the ratio of parks to population in the cities. but any sensible person can guess that we certainly do not have sufficient open spaces for the residents. though the parks are considered the lungs of a city. this is especially true about a city like dhaka which nests over 15 million inhabitants.
dhaka's decay
shahnoor wahid's factual lament (august:19) on the brutal defilement of dhaka city's scenic greenery is a sad document on where dhaka has gone today. a nostalgic garden city, has been transformed into an overcrowded and polluted concrete jungle; all in the name of mindless development! stately old trees have been murdered in cold blood; replaced by ugly high rises; coming up practically shoulder to shoulder. even pristine areas like ramna green, and the model town; that was gulshan (meaning flower garden in persian) in the mid 1960's has now become a claustrophobic hotchpotch of trading, commercial and industrial (garments) high-rises, overshadowing and outnumbering the few residences that still linger on!

role of the media
i would like to thank the media for providing us important news as well as creating contemporary, worthy features. sometimes the media bring to light hypersensitive news. but the sad thing is that the media focuses on the incidents or accidents only after they take place. it is not playing any role in eliminating certain social evils like acid throwing or child labour.

housing issue
most people have no home of their own. the problem of housing is very acute these days. some factors are responsible for this problem, such as: overpopulation, amalgamation of lands, accumulation of lands, poor distribution of lands and illegal occupation by the so called powerful people. the middle class people in the cities suffer from this problem tremendously. the problem has dehumanised the city people, especially the students of colleges and universities.
dowry
since the early age of indian sub-continental history, the hindus and the muslims have been living in accordance with some norms and customs. as a result, some customs have been interchanged between them. dowry is a custom of hindus. on the other hand, in islam a woman can inherit her father's property.
the next drama?
what is really happening in bangladesh? the heroes emerged in january 2007 and took the power over as, to them, the country had been destroyed by the corrupt politicians. absolutely right! so they need to be punished. yes, the money they have looted and sent abroad should be brought back and used for the development of the country. so, what was the process involved? the same old process...using power to arrest politicians, even some innocent leaders, which many people have termed as the balance of arrest drama. arresting only politicians and sending them to jail, with no power given to judiciary. the same old story... mass arrest of opposition workers. so after a year what is the outcome? release those who have looted money and sent it abroad? release those who grabbed land, made the syndicate to control the market, ran a parallel administration which was more powerful than even the pm office? release the men who had killed the opposition mps including the most talented former finance minister? release the elements who were actively involved in bomb blasts and even tried to kill the former pm? release them because they are people like us, they cannot be criminals…disgusting! view the page international
