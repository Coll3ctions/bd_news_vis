when does a minister resign?

goodbye, sir!
every childhood hero takes away a little bit of one's life along with him when he dies. shammi kapoor filled those wondrously difficult years when laughter and optimism were the only pathfinders from an unknown jute mill settlement in bengal to an unwelcome calcutta teeming with every variety of revolution. even hope seems too ambitious in the second half of your teens. shammi kapoor was our torch, for he combined three essentials of teenage: he was mad; he got his girl on his own terms; and there was always a happy ending. he joined the dots between changing the world and dreaming of love.
strengthening the ties
the upcoming visit of dr. manmohan singh is surely going to be an attempt to reach out to the people of bangladesh, therefore it should not be seen as just an effort to strengthen the relationship with one party or the other. it appears there is a realisation in delhi that india has to build bridges with all shades of public opinion in bangladesh. at the same time, india has a particular affinity for the genuinely democratic, non-communal and pro-liberation section of bangladesh society. so, it is but natural that india will make a special effort to reach out to them.
embraceable and embarrassing you
the economist published an article on july 30, entitled "embraceable you," on the relationship between india and bangladesh. it has been embraceable to some and embarrassing to others inside and outside the country. it has, on the one hand, angered the government of bangladesh and many friends of the present government. on the other hand, the daily star reported on august 7, "bnp hails economist report," just after the london-based magazine published the government rejoinder. therefore, it is understood that the awami league leaders do not agree with the economist report and the bnp leaders do not agree with the government rejoinder.
is truth an illusion?
the epic mahabharata recounts an interesting story about the pandava brother,yudhishthira, who was known for his unwavering adherence to truth. during the kurukshetra war, between the pandavas and the kauravas, the kaurava commander drona mercilessly killed thousands of pandava warriors. krishna (avatar of lord vishnu and a trusted advisor of the pandavas), thought of a clever plan to deter drona. he asked yudhishthira to announce that drona's son, ashwathama, was killed, even though this was untrue. krishna knew that yudhishthira would never lie, so he constructed a ruse. he had an elephant named ashwathama killed and asked yudhishthira to declare: "ashwathama is dead, but i am unsure whether it was an elephant or the man." krishna ensured that the words were uttered while the pandavas beat their drums and cymbals in a way that drowned yudhishthira's critical trailing words. given yudhishthira's reputation as a righteous man, drona believed him. he laid down his arms in distress and was slain. the pandavas were victorious -- krishna justified yudhishthira's deception as a moral act toward humanity for ensuring justice and peace on earth, through a just war.
