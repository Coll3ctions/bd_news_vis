a failure of politics

primary school dropout
the dropout rate in primary education, we have just been informed by the minister for primary and mass education, stands at 21 per cent. there are those who will not be unduly alarmed by the figures, considering that enrolment over these past many months has been nearly 100 per cent in the nation's primary schools. it would be quite in the fitness of things to expect a segment of pupils to drop out, for schools not to be able to hold on to them. that is how one could look at conditions philosophically. view the page sports

save the families depending on rickshaw!
a man getting out of his car and slapping a rickshaw-driver right and left only because the three-wheeler touched his car's bumper is a very common scene in bangladesh. dhaka is known as the city of rickshaws. even so, rickshaws are neglected everywhere in bangladesh. traffic police hit the rickshaws when they are parked in wrong places but when it comes to a car, they say nothing or if at all, they say something very politely to the driver. now, it is a matter of great regret that rickshaws are banned on the 'major' streets. some people even think that rickshaws should be banned from our country! it is said that nearly 80% of the labourers are rickshawallahs. where will they go with their families? just look at the poor and hungry faces in the streets! i urge the wealthy people and their drivers- please kind to the rickshaw-drivers when he accidentally hits your car's bumper.

the international friendly match between argentina and nigeria, which took place at the bangabandhu national stadium on 6th september overwhelmed the football lovers of bangladesh. undoubtedly, it was a historic match.
kitchen gardens within households
monitoring the prices of daily commodities such as the vegetables are short-term solutions. what is needed is improving transportation and having better state-of-the-art storage facilities and buffering. as the vegetables that are affected are those that are easy to grow, another novel solution is to encourage the concept of kitchen gardens in the households. let us not forget what rainwater harvesting did. kitchen gardens will also ensure pesticide-free, fresh vegetables at affordable prices. in times of crisis, innovation is the key.
relentless load shedding
the government, as we all know, has taken some prudent steps to improve the power situation. ironically, nowadays it seems all those efforts are just gimmicks to misguide the citizens into believing that the situation is getting better. the scorching heat, with the added predicament of massive power failures, has rendered the lives of the people unbearable. people are trying to fathom what all those apparently substantial steps are providing us with. all our efforts to understand the enigma end in futility. we all expected a better power situation through all those efforts. but now it seems that no efforts were made whatsoever. they were just machinations to garner forex.
cabinet in limbo
in 2008 election, i voted for al-led grand alliance. i shall again vote for them in 2014 election, be it under caretaker or interim government. the present prime minister sheikh hasina is working hard to change the fate of the common people. our export has increased, agricultural production has also increased. development in education and social sectors are recognisable. but many of the cabinet colleagues of the premier are not performing well. as a concerned citizen, i strongly feel that a cabinet reshuffle is overdue. the finance minister, perhaps due to age constraints, should not be burdened with such a big ministry. law ministry's performance is not up to the mark. the communications minister with his innocent smile has already become a burden to the government. home and commerce ministries also need overhauling. the lone representative of jatiyo party may be given a more important job as he has a little to perform in that ministry. and shipping minister should mind his own business.
preliminary screening
students who have just passed the hsc exams are now passing through very critical days of their life as far as their getting admitted to any institution of higher education is concerned. they will now sit for admission tests. the government universities and medical colleges allow a very large number of students to sit for admission tests. on the other hand, varsities like buet, cuet, kuet, ruet screen off quite a large number of students by short-listing. since they take high standard admission tests, if a student can do well in those tests, that would prove his/her eligibility for studying in a particular institution. the students who could not do well in the hsc exams for various reasons, can do well in the admission test. so i earnestly appeal to the authorities concerned to give a second thought to their existing screening tests.
proposed mrt route
i am extremely disturbed by the undesirable debates and objections raised by the air force chief at this stage, which can delay the most important project for our capital. the route was approved by the cabinet on 8th march. this kind of "objection" by many agencies was the root cause for delay and/or cancellation of many important and vital projects in the past. i would like to put my points in support of the "approved" project. the project is of utmost national interest, so no delays should be allowed and the change will seriously damage the aesthetic view of our national pride, the sangsad bhaban.
greek debt
for most of the past decade, greece has run up budget deficits well beyond limits set by the european union, a group of 27 nations that allow goods and workers to cross their borders freely. when greece fell into recession two years ago, bondholders worried they wouldn't get their money back. to make sure they do, the eu is lending money to greece, essentially allowing it to use new debt to pay off old debt. greece looks like a bad bet. its publicly held debt is more than 140 percent of its annual economic output, or gross domestic product. the us debt is 67 percent.

connecting the leaks
in 2005, the las vegas convention and visitors authority came up with a nudge-nudge, wink-wink slogan. "what happens in vegas, stays in vegas," suggested that people could have all the fun they liked on vacation trips to that city and nobody was going to find out. a saucy aussie named julian assange turned that game on its head. what happened in vegas didn't stay in vegas, metaphorically speaking. this one-man cabal of truthsayers took the fun out of u.s. embassy cables and leaked them out to the world.
