a human is human because . . .
"stories are not always innocent,” states chinua achebe in his new essay collection, the education of a british protected child. whether told by a colonizer, a correspondent on the news, or in a children's book, a story can be insidious, dispossessing, and difficult to un-root from collective consciousness when disseminated without care. to illustrate this point, achebe recounts reading a children's book he bought for his daughter, in which a white boy's kite is caught on the wind and lands in a coconut tree outside an african village, where it is then solemnly worshipped as a supernatural object. sacrifices are offered, and a witch doctor leads “the village in a procession from the coconut tree to the village shrine.” how do we understand the telling of such “african” stories by people who are not african? with great circumspection, achebe replies, and with a keen eye towards the story's origin, and maker (achebe went on to write his own children's books). without such vigilance, he warns, we become intellectually complacent, and “we run the risk of committing grave injustices absentmindedly.”
