women's empowerment in asia
women's empowerment has certainly come quite a long way in bangladesh. even a cursory glance at the figures relating to women's advancement in the past two decades will testify to this truth. and yet the fact that a whole lot of distance yet needs to be covered by bangladesh's women as well as women in other regions of asia was highlighted once more at a discussion organized by asian university for women (auw) on friday. the plain fact is that there needs to be more investment in women's education and training regarding the varied regions of life and experience. interestingly, the meeting at auw, which has just seen mrs. cherie blair stepping in as its chancellor, brought together a number of eminent figures from around asia and elsewhere to focus on this very issue. the results, we are happy to note, appear rather encouraging.

ekushey and mamtaj begum
women had played an important role in 1952 language movement. unfortunately, their contributions were overlooked. among the participants, mamtaj begum (kalyany roy choudhury, b.1930) - the then headmistress of narayanganj morgan girls' school - demonstrated extraordinary courage. in narayanganj, she organised one of the largest women's demonstration in protest of the killings of 21st and 22nd february (1952) in dhaka. she was immediately jailed, condemned and dubbed as a 'communist'. strength of her character was tested when jailed mumtaj begum refused to sign the 'mercy petition' (admitting her mistake) prepared by the pakistan government. she spent over a year in jail. due to the dirty tricks of the then government she ultimately lost her job and family. away from family, friends and the loved ones, mamtaj begum died in armanitola, dhaka in 1967.

illegal commission to get business!
an informative and interesting front page lead report on the matter was published by a local financial daily on 4th january. it only indicates that instead of paying due taxes on premium income, insurance companies avoid it, to sweeten the palm of the insurers, and possibly themselves too, through clever play of financial figures and supporting paper, making their black deed white! instead insurance company authorities show it as fictitious costs, and create a 'slush fund', and to satiate the insurer's greed, you pay more and more illegal commission on premiums, beyond the limit set for it!
special supplement on 6th january
i read it in a few english dailies on 6th january issued by pid of our ministry of information, with three lead articles. the first one on the left; written by syed abul hossain and translated by sahana akhtar, had grammatical mistakes, both in the 'heading' and the 'sub-heading' too! the heading stated "the communication infrastructure is being changed." here the definite article "the" was totally superfluous before the expression "communication infrastructure" which is a collective noun here. the sub-heading was totally confusing, grammar wise. it was: "changes will there be in bangladesh"! was it not totally confusing? it really takes the cake! what was in the mind of the translator? did she just substitute suitable (?) english words for 'bangla' as set in the 'bangla' expression? i just cannot fathom the reason for this 'original' mistake!
a separate health care strategy?
the article entitled “health care in slums: no strategy works” published in the daily star on 31st december 2010, is an immature research in health care. although at present bangladesh don't have any prudent health policy, government and private health care facilities are accessible from rural to urban area either in the form of primary health care or primary to tertiary care. important aspects are public awareness and education.
tib's corruption survey
i was quite surprised to read the list of the corrupt in the tib survey. not the ones named, but the undoubted 'champion' who once again got away unscathed. this department of the government operates far from the capital, has the largest area under its control and has institutionalised and refined the art of corruption. yes, it is the forest dept.
desert turned green!
agriculture together with livestock, fisheries and forestry is a rapidly flourishing potential economic sector in the united arab emirates (uae). the uae government has attached priority to invest more in the agriculture sector with a view to increasing food production. in the recent days massive agricultural development has put 723738 hectares of barren land under the plough. greening the country with planting trees is also going on in full swing. agriculture is being done in green house and in absence of enough water for irrigation hydroponics technique has been adopted to produce vegetables. in fact, uae has so far achieved a remarkable progress towards modernising its agriculture as reflects in the saying of late president sheikh zayed bin sultan al nahyan “they used to say agriculture has no future, but with god's blessing and our determination we have succeeded in transforming the desert into a green land.”
cyber crimes
md. asadullah khan has aptly stated: “we have borrowed the gloss, but not the ability to fight a crisis” [the looming threat of aids, published in the daily star on 11th december, 2010]. undoubtedly, the government's pledge to build a digital nation is a commendable one, but i wonder if it is prepared to tackle cyber crime. fake accounts on social networking sites, uploading inappropriate materials and hacking are already prevalent in this country. higher levels of cyber crimes can easily creep in. it is very disturbing if hackers gain access to private information and send obnoxious or misleading mails to contacts.
be aware of taxicabs
it is very sad to say that taxicabs are being used to snatch vanity bags or luggage from the passengers of rickshaws. one of our neighbour had this bad experience. she and her relative were going by a rickshaw and she was aware that her vanity bag might be snatched. so, she held her bag strongly. but a taxicab followed them and a man in the cab snatched away her bag. as she was holding her bag strongly, she fell on the street and broke one of her ankles. she was admitted to a hospital for 2 weeks. the question is- is it not possible for our law enforcing agencies to stop such crimes? view the page international
