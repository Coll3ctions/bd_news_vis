pandemonium at bnp meeting disquieting
the foiling of the council session of the chittagong city unit of the bangladesh nationalist party amid bedlam in full public glare on monday is extremely disquieting. no one who believes in democracy wishes to see such pandemonium get the better of an established political party. in the interest of healthy politics in bangladesh, we expect the bnp to tide over its difficulties and truly emerge as a vibrant and cohesive organization. its troubles, let us note, should not be a cause for satisfaction on the part of other parties because the pains the bnp is passing through have to do with the bad tradition of nurturing unruly elements and feuds within a party. such a tendency is to be discerned in varying degrees among other political parties as well. all other parties may, therefore, desist from the temptation of feeling happy at the bnp's discomfiture and indeed hope that such disturbances are defused within the party before long.

(the daily star: 04.11.09)
trade union
the government has rightly decided to introduce trade union in the garment industry to safeguard the interests of garment workers, especially female workers. starting in the late 70s, the garment industry has now become the major contributor to foreign exchange earning of the country. it is the most important task of the government to maintain a healthy environment in the industry, so that smooth running of the industry is not hampered.
our transportation system
bangladesh is a developing country with a huge potential. but, we are still lagging behind in many aspects. we don't have a sound transportation system yet. most of the roads and highways need to be modernized and a robust expansion programme should be undertaken to expand those facilities to new areas. proper transportation infrastructure is a pre-requisite for the mobilization of resources throughout the country and to achieve cost effectiveness. movement of various industrial commodities, agricultural products as industry input, perishable goods etc. from one place to another quickly, will reduce various uncertainties and market imperfections. if a stress free human mobilization can be ensured among various places, it will reduce extra pressure on urbanization which we are observing in the large cities in our country at the moment. this will only be possible if a properly planned, consolidated transportation infrastructure is ensured. it will be possible by gradually developing the roads and highways, expanding and linking them to various economic centres with a modern fragmentation that will provide the speed that is needed to achieve a higher level of productivity and efficiency for various economic activities.
climate change!
perhaps talking about biodiversity or wildlife protection and conservation is against the present-day politics and those who speak about it are also on the wrong side of politics. the reason is 'change' - change in politics, change in time (dst), change in office time, change in the season (winter is approaching), change in wind direction and finally the most important 'climate change'. climate change has earned so much fame that for anything good or bad, the admiration or the criticism - it is climate change.
garment workers
the incident that occurred at nippon garment industries ltd. in tongi takes us back to the lane of memories. how many times will we passively or reluctantly watch on the tv screen or read the news articles about such horrible incidents? questions may arise about the desired role of bgmea regarding the monitoring function of garment industries. it may also seem that either the government is reluctant to tackle such occurrences or its hands are tied. but the victims are always the poorest people who lose their lives. have we ever thought that these garment workers' hands bring foreign exchange to our national economy?
what are they up to?

death
i think it is known to many that cryonics is an organization seeking to provide immortality to its investors. the way the fortunate people are seeking to prevent death contravenes principles of islam. if cryonics opens an office here, there won't be any dearth of finance as there are many willing and capable people in bangladesh.

sinister speed breakers

vip roads
i have never really understood why there are certain roads in dhaka that have been designated as "vip roads". ministers and other senior government officials supposedly travel by these roads a lot, hence the name. isn't the concept of having such "vip" roads in itself rather elitist? i admit, rickshaws do create a lot of chaos on the roads but for a rather significant portion of the country's population, they are the only (affordable) means of transportation for short distances. what, then, is the logic behind banning those vehicles on such roads? if the government and officials that we elect are supposed to ensure that all citizens are treated equally, why are they preventing citizens who can't afford other sources of transportation from travelling on such roads? when the plight of the majority is being ignored, there is something very wrong with the system.
greed!
we got the delectable information that after winning the oscar the producer of the film `slumdog millionaire' mr. danny boyle arranged a trust fund for the poor children performers and their family to secure their future, a beautiful house to live in outside of the stinking slum, to bear expenses for schooling and provided some other facilities.

congratulations for introducing the science and life page from november 3. this will hopefully increase the general awareness and knowledge of many readers; more so for students who will go through the page.
rickshaw issue
i came across a letter from mr. sikander ahmed in the daily star's “to the editor” column. his letter was nice reading apart from him being at loggerheads with mr. rahat of malibagh on the rickshaw issue. it appears that he is extremely disappointed at mr. rahat for advocating banning of rickshaws in dhaka main streets. i would like to request mr. sikander not to take things personally and try to understand the problem and react accordingly. in an example in one of his earlier letters he had stated that a fasting person would have to walk if there is no rickshaw. really this cannot be a strong argument. in the old days there were no rickshaw here or elsewhere and not every muslim had a horse or a camel but that did not stop them from fasting or crossing the desert during the month of fasting. sure it was tough for them but they adapted and managed. the truth of the matter is that when a facility is not available people learn to adapt. certainly, we are adapting to spiral price hike, poor law and order situation, intolerable traffic jam, global warming, etc., etc. we can complain about all we want but at the end we have to adapt because things won't change overnight.

please stop this name game
the awami league has started the name game again. when they were in power last time, many institutions' names which had been in use for a long, long time, were changed to the names of their liking in the last few months. they are on it again.
confrontation or cooperation?
two major political parties are increasingly becoming agitated against each other. the simple issue is whether we want "mujib's bangladesh " or 'zia's bangladesh" although many political pundits would not like my simplification of the fact of political culture in bangladesh, like any other event in history , mujib fell and zia rose as the ruler of bangladesh. both of them have left enough dedicated soldiers to fight their way for political power and rule over bangladesh. we are simply following the path of the mughal empire's history in undivided india. both the parties have successfully befooled the people through political propaganda. the media is their best projector and supporter. view the page international
