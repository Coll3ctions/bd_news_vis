the maestro's palette
when tagore came to rajshahi and kushtia (1890) to take charge of his property, it seemed miles away from a life he was used to. the setting was a sharp contrast to kolkata. but shortly he settled down to the different lifestyle, and spent long stretches of time watching the panoramic scenery from his boat on the river padma. the seasonal variations enthralled him. on a rainy day he would watch the lightning darting across the dark clouds, listen to the thunders echoing over the plains. in summer, the unruffled peace and tranquility, the truant boy who played the flute on the sultry afternoons, all enchanted him. and most importantly, the young 30-year old zamindar became increasingly fascinated by the folk melodies of the bauls, fakirs and bhaisnabas (folk artistes).

at least five people lost their lives and properties worth crores of taka damaged in the recent three days of hartal and pre- hartal violence, just because the opposition suspects the party in power has abducted one of its leaders. only on suspicion they embark on such actions that harm the unsuspecting public more than the targeted power that be. hartal is a democratic right, no doubt, but is the way it is enforced democratic? rather, it vitiates the democratic environment.

what is chandrasekhar limit?
the chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stablewhite dwarf star. it was named after subrahmanyan chandrasekhar, the indian-american astrophysicist who predicted it in 1930. white dwarfs, unlike main sequence stars, resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure, rather than thermal pressure. the chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction. white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit undergo further gravitational collapse. those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs. the chandrasekhar limit is analogous to the tolmanoppenheimervolkoff limit for neutron stars. view the page ctg edition
