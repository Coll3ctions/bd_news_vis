power generation scene
as per report in the ds on 09-08-10 total 871 mw of power has been added to the national grid since the present govt came to power. but this increase in power generation could not make any visible change in power supply as load shedding remains as before. this is due to the fact that in the mean time some running power stations were shut down. it is difficult to construct new power stations, but it is even more difficult to maintain a power station and keep it running in full capacity. some examples of such power stations are:
suicide along with children!
of late, the print and electronic media have been chock-full with suicide news committed by the dejected women, that's too along with their children.
doctors in rural areas
the prime minister recently warned the doctors against their absence in rural and upazilla hospitals where they are posted. in bangladesh, various ngos have appointed a good number of doctors in rural areas also and they are working there regularly. but in case of government service the scenario is different. the doctors are taking salary and other benefits from the tax payers' money but the people are deprived of getting proper service. moreover, they reside in the towns or capital city for private practices and for other benefits.
decentralisation
dhaka, the capital of bangladesh, is beset with many problems and the problems continue to multiply. apparently all incumbent governments try to sort out the problems, but the problems continue to remain. as for example, in an effort to reduce traffic jam, the authorities concerned tried to implement the lane concept resulting in severe traffic jam. this means the concept itself was wrong. in my understanding the authorities are not sincere or serious about solving the problems the country faces.
utilising natural resources
natural resources are the raw materials supplied by the earth. these resources include soil, air, water, sunshine, forests, wildlife, fish, fossil fuels, metals and minerals. using natural resources to meet human needs has an impact on global environment. each time raw materials are used to produce goods, there are ecological, social, and economic impacts. sustainable management of these natural resources and utilisation of conservation techniques are necessary to meet present and future needs. bangladesh is very rich in natural resources, specifically in coal, limestone, natural gas, peat coal, white clay, mineral sand, oil, etc. but yet we are not a developed country…why?
first day at school
for some of us school has already started and for others it will start after ramadan. but all of us will have to go back to school sometime soon. today was my first. even if you aren't new at a school you still feel new on the first day. new teachers, new classrooms, new classmates, etc. but some of us dread this day and others wait all the year for this day. for troublemakers it's a new shot at buttering up the new teachers. for the goody goodies, it's also about buttering up the teachers for a whole new year. but if we go back to the same school with our buds then we feel good. this is the time of year we can make an impression and we all use it.
billion dollar loan
the billion dollar loan provided by india's exim bank is a façade of a loan, and under the present terms and conditions of the loan, it will not be substantially beneficial for bangladesh.
premature death
premature death in road accident is a commonplace event in bangladesh. there is no improvement at all in the situation. why? why doesn't the government take any initiative? where is the problem?
miserable traffic
i don't know whether “miserable” is the correct word for dhaka traffic. every day the situation is getting worse. the sign of improvement is not there at all. i tried to change my schedule and thought of moving around the city after 10:30 pm, tried it for a week, but eventually gave up, as dhaka during the night is a different city. though the traffic is less but it is dangerous as no one cares if the signal is red or green. the fast moving trucks are all over the city making driving even more dangerous. the daytime traffic is no longer a topic to discuss, as it simply doesn't move. the number of new cars, rotten old buses with new paints, unusable footpaths and the rickshaws in each entry point of the lanes have made life horrible in dhaka. the drivers and the traffic police in action have no understanding of the traffic rules. who will take the responsibility of educating these people? jay walking is another factor which contributes to the traffic mess. the situation is out of control already. relocating english medium schools and private universities has become a must. the bdr and the cantonment need either to be shifted somewhere outside dhaka or should be opened for public use . we have to find a new place for shifting the airport.
foreign managers
i think mr. mamun (letter published on aug 10th) understood differently from what i understood after reading the original post by mr. imtiaz (letter published on aug 1st) on this topic. if i understand correctly the proposition of mr. imtiaz, it is not the question whether our educational institutes are producing capable managers, but rather whether we have done enough to groom our local people before allowing the recruitment of otherwise costly and partially grooming-inhibitive foreign experts. we need to understand that expertise does not come overnight. this is true for a foreign business-school graduate and this is equally a harsh truth for us too. further, we do not have the dearth of resources.
floods in pakistan
recently pakistan is facing the worst floods in the last 80 years, which have killed over 1600 people, left two million people homeless and washed away crops and firm animals. the flood situation is getting worse day by day.
combating load shedding
the news was about the government's desperate bid to end load-shedding from early next year through awarding contracts to about 2 dozen fast-track oil-based power projects which the government hopes will significantly cut power crisis but feared that it would impose huge petroleum import and cost on national exchequer.
corruption and government
it refers to the editorial of the daily star that there is little question that corruption in government is a sad reality we have lived with for years. even so, there is in us that certain feeling that as governance improves and public sensibilities get to be more sharpened, such wrongdoing will be rolled back and the country can move on toward its desired goals. that being the sentiment, it comes as a shock for all us that some government staff have been involved in the crime of leaking question papers in return for dishonest financial gains. candidates are in for a shock when they come to know about the cancellation of the exam after reaching their test centres. question paper leak of entrance or skill tests and competitive examinations has almost become a routine affair in the country. such leakages have taken place in the past. every time it happens, an inquiry is ordered . police catch smaller fishes. but after initial action, hardly anything is done to reach the mastermind. as a result, thousands of students suffer almost every alternate year due to various admission or employment scandals. the education mafia, which runs the seat-fixing racket and is involved in leakages, however, continues to operate with impunity.
why not nickname?
in response to the article, "why nicknames", i have some more points to add. at the very beginning i would like to thank to the writer m. rukanuddin for selecting such an interesting topic.
in the name of allah…
'bismillah-ir-rahman-ir-rahim” (english translation: “in the name of allah, the beneficent, the merciful”) is neither a mere collection of words nor a sentence but it is the first thing a muslim child learns and in everyday affairs “bismillah” is the first word a muslim utters. except one, 'bismillah…rahim' heads every surah (chapter) in the holy quran and these words which contain two attributes of allah, rahman and rahim, give expression to divine love and mercy. view the page international

the irons’ “final frontier” unleashes today
if you're a rock and heavy-metal fan, you know by now what this is about. it's hard to find any metal fan of this decade who hasn't headbanged to, admired, or at the least heard of iron maiden. yes, the true giants of heavy metal are back, with “the final frontier”, set to take the world by a hurricane of galloping basslines, sabre-like guitar solos, and ridiculously high-pitched screaming. the album, due today, has already induced huge anticipation among millions of maiden-frantics across the globe, and for good reasons too. at 76 minutes and 34 seconds in duration, maiden's fifteenth studio album is the longest they have ever released. also, this is the longest fans have had to wait for a maiden album, with their last studio album “dance of death” released in 2006.

impromptu measures make matters worse
the government's sudden decision declaring month-long holiday for schools ostensibly to give some relief to the city's beleaguered traffic raised many eyebrows. the city's traffic undoubtedly took a vicious turn in recent times. the daily journey to workplace and home of the commuters as well as other road users had already crossed the limit of tolerance. once stuck in long tailback, they curse the entire traffic system out of sheer desperation.

a japanese apology for korea
it was 100 years ago that the invading japanese forces landed in korea and forced the local authorities to sign a treaty under which the korean peninsula became subject to japanese occupation. the occupation lasted for 35 years, much less in duration compared to the occupation of territories by western colonial empires of the time.
student politics haunts us
the ongoing vandalism perpetrated by the student wings of political parties is shaking the very foundation of our national ethos. the grimmest doom falling upon us is that a section of the student community is ready to respond to the urging of political parties. but the question is "why"? the most rational answer would be that political posts are like the velveteen rabbit, which beckons those students and drives them crazy to take part in battle for supremacy in institutions.
