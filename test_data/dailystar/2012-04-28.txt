the desire to hear . . .
looking at the azure-whitish canvas of the skies heralding the season of autumn, one feels crispness in the air subduing the wetness of monsoon, sunlight staying young more or less for the whole day. then there appears, rather unconsciously in her, an assemblage of emotions evoking the past, relating to the present and looking forward to the future. not that they all appear at one and the same time, but in the cubicles of her heart they take their turn, oftentimes overlapping. as she ponders, one thing becomes obvious to her --- that in this mental state of hers, she feels a strong desire to hear some sounds, some voices, some music emanating from nature, some others from human voices. she is afraid that since her auditory sense is deprived of much of its yearnings, those in the passage of time could be obliterated.
