at last, justice has been done
nearly thirty-five years after the father of the nation, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, and his family, save the pm and her sister, were gunned down, thereby pushing the nation to an extremity of uncertainty, justice has been done to five of the men behind the monstrous deed. the execution of these men, brought about after a lengthy process of trial lasting as many as thirteen years, ought not to be a reason for a feeling of retribution to arise in anyone. it was for this nation, simply and very logically, a return to the great idea that rule of law matters, that justice is all, that anyone who commits a crime should not expect to get away with it. indeed, now that the legal process has ensured a restoration of the principle of justice, it is time for all citizens, irrespective of political belief or party affiliation, to reflect on the dark shadows that for long impeded our march to a better and an egalitarian future.
earthquake preparedness strategy
if the occurrence of tsunami or earthquake in littoral states of the indian ocean or the pacific rim jolted us into looking inward for assessing our vulnerability to seismic disasters then it has only been reinforced by the catastrophe in haiti. nearer home, we have had our own minor versions. but through it all what comes to fresh light is the formation of high-powered inter-ministerial earthquake preparedness and awareness committee following a high court order of july 27, 2009.
light of day
our long national nightmare is finally over. not entirely over, of course: there are still six killers absconding beyond the reach of the law, and there remain, and perhaps always will remain, unanswered questions about that dark night in bangladeshi history and its aftermath.
the people behind the plot
back in 2003, the history channel in the united states aired a 9-part documentary titled the men who killed kennedy. when the documentary directly implicated former u.s. president lyndon b. johnson in its last episode, it stirred an outcry in the political circuit. the channel apologised to its viewers and to mrs. johnson and her family for airing the show. the moral of the story is that conspiracy theories are like a minefield. even the most cautious step can land on a pressure plate, exploding in outrage.
who killed bangabandhu?
the usual response to the question that we have gotten used to hearing is the assassination was carried out by a group of misguided army officers. but the answer is not quite as simple view the page sports

vulnerable country
bangladesh is highly vulnerable to earthquakes, because it is close to the meeting point of the indian, eurasian and burma (myanmar) plates. the observatory at bangladesh university of engineering and technology (buet) recorded 86 tremors of over four magnitude during january 2006-may 2009. the meteorological department detected at least 90 earthquakes taking place in the country between may 2007 and july 2008, nine of them above five on the richter scale and epicentres of 95 percent being within a 600 km radius of dhaka city. experts say it is these minor tremors that indicate the possibility of much more powerful earthquakes hitting the country.

noisy capital

du
dhaka university is famous as not only the first and best educational institution but also for its glorious historical dimensions. located at the heart of the capital, the university boasts of, along with many other things, the rare blessing and picturesque beauty of mother nature. the age-old grand figure of the towering stout trees, the heart-cooling shadows, the lullaby of the numerous known and unknown birds, the green velvety carpet under the foot all over the wide palm of nature during summer, the rustling of grey crooked, crinkled and crispy falling leaves driven by the wind during the autumn days, the murmuring of the thick layers of leaves under the soft and cautious claws of the night cat next to the widow this is how you can portray dhaka university which elicits the exclamation “wow!” from the visitors. juxtaposed with rest of the mechanical and buzzing city, it won't be an example of an exaggeration to call dhaka university campus the heaven of the capital.
campus violence
campus violence is not welcomed in any educational institution. but in spite of its deadly effects known to all, such violence is visible frequently in our campus. recently, rajshahi polytechnic institute experienced this violence. hostilities erupted between the chhatra league and the chhatra moitree, resulting in the death of one student and some others were injured. one party wing tries to defeat another.
cartoon channels and kids
it is very unusual to see that kids do not love cartoons. if we conduct a survey among the kids, especially of 3-5 age group, we will find that most of them love to watch cartoons which they start watching at an early age and the language of these cartoons is mostly english. however, gradually they begin to understand the language, though not everything, and also the context. even they can explain to us what is happening. nowadays english learning is a must for all. so if our pre-school going or primary school going kids learn a bit of english from watching the cartoons, that will be a blessing for us because apart from entertaining the kids the cartoon channels are helping them to learn something new.
stop student politics
