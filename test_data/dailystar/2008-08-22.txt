our "international" airport
this is in reference to a letter titled "zia..." published on august 8, 2008 in your daily. i could not agree more with the writer in his observations regarding the poor standard of zia when compared to other international airports. however, given the fact that bangladesh is a third world nation, one does not expect zia to be in league with those of dubai, hong kong, singapore or any other airport in north america or europe. nevertheless, one would expect it to have a basic minimum standard since it so proudly incorporates the word "international" in its name.

national mourning day
the government deserves our thanks and appreciation for honouring the judgment of the court to observe august 15 as the national mourning day officially; and above all for allowing the people and the media to perform freely without intimidation or restriction. we are afraid how long this freedom of expression and information would be allowed to continue to observe the "sahadat" anniversary of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman. i think this should be a choice of the people to continue in future.
migrant workers
it is our migrant workers who are contributing so much to the national economy. there is no way to ignore these workers. if all the migrant workers are sent back to our country, we will be starving. even i myself am dependent on the revenue of migrant workers. though these workers are playing a vital role in our national development, their rights are consciously ignored.
