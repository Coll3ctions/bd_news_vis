population census: information discord?
the fifth population census has been conducted after ten years in 2011. it is impossible to deny the significance of population census in the development of a country. the researchers, planners, businessmen, learners, even the politicians of home and abroad are using the data and information of the census as the tools or raw materials for their research. if there is any discrepancy in the data and information, the entire work plan will be challenged. according to the preliminary findings of the population and housing census 2011, bangladesh's population now stands at 14.23 crore which has created debates among the experts and is not in line with the unicef, undp and other reports. other reports showed that our population is more than 16 crore. due to the negligence of the field workers in visiting every house, the reliability of the report is being questioned. needless to say that the information of the census is vital in preparing adp or other economic plans. the controversy about the population census is unexpected.

stop coaching business!
now-a-days, parents are not satisfied with the lesson rendered by the teachers at schools to their children. regardless of the quality and reputation of the institution, almost every guardian as well as student takes coaching as a must for gaining higher grades! some of the unscrupulous teachers use this coaching tool as a money-making tree. sometimes they even threaten the students of giving poor marks in exams if they do not intend to go to those teachers for coaching. why is coaching essential when students are attentively participating in the classes? only commercial minded teachers are not to be blamed. the mindset of both students and parents is also the reason behind this nuisance. the school authorities as well as the education ministry must take proper initiatives and make regulations in prohibiting private coaching.
rehab fair
rehab (real estate and housing association of bangladesh) fair at bangabandhu international conference centre, dhaka, was well organised and attractive. but it is a fair for the affluent people. can the middle class and poor people afford to purchase rehab land and apartments? why does not rehab make arrangements and sell land and flats for the poor and middle class people with a view to mitigating their untold sufferings.
all lies
after almost about a year we came back to houston, texas in order to retain our residency in the united states. in order to begin living once again in our host country, we had to do a lot of shopping. while staying in bangladesh for the last one year we experienced a great price spiral of essential commodities. the regime in power blamed the price hike on the international market. to my utter dismay, i found most of the things selling at the price that i found a year ago. only the gasoline price has doubled, yet it is cheaper compared to bangladesh. apart from this, the price hike is very nominal, for example, the bread that we used to buy from walmart for 80 cents now sells for a dollar. in general, the price hike of essential commodities here in texas is like this.

parents ought to be careful
i have noticed that the habit of smoking is increasing substantially. it is not that the adults only smoke, the young boys, especially the teenagers are also smoking significantly. whenever i go to gulshan i see that the young boys are smoking in groups on roadsides and in restaurants, even though 'no smoking' is written in those places, creating disturbance to the general people. it is so shocking that 10-12 year-old boys smoke freely in front of elders. so, i would suggest the parents to keep an eye on their children so that they do not smoke and keep themselves away from harmful habits. i also request the government to ban advertisements of cigarettes in public places.
stop this inhuman practice
there exists a bad practice in our politics, whenever any political leader or a minister or an mp visits any place, to give a show off the school kids are forced to stand on both sides of the streets, with flags and flowers. instead of attending classes they are obliged to welcome the 'special' people, standing in sun, rain, cold and storm. it is mandatory for the school kids. it is inhumane and medieval.
save the young generation
if the root of a tree is cut off, the possibility of blooming flower will nip in the bud. similarly, if our young generation goes astray, then our future will be uncertain. youths are involving themselves in many illegal activities like addiction, eve-teasing, hijacking, stealing, etc. the reasons behind their addiction are bad company, poverty, bad parenting, availability of drugs etc. in order to save them from this path, parents as well as government should take required steps.

sonia's tour and border killing

monsoon in bengal is anything but subtle: the gloomy sky often weeps away reminding us of the unforgettable moments of life, at times the rhythm of raindrops rejuvenates the passion, heavy shower amplifies that passion, nature wakes up and flowers blossom. these images and impressions of monsoon dominated this month's instalment of 'praner khela', a regular musical programme arranged by bengal foundation. the soiree was held on july 28 at the bengal gallery of fine arts, dhanmondi in dhaka.
shakespeare resurrected
directed and compiled by the founder chairperson of scholastica, yasmeen murshed and wajed al rahman, scholastica alumni association's production titled “who's afraid of william shakespeare?” opened with the three witches of “macbeth” resurrecting the bard of avon. the bard, awoken from his eternal slumber, found himself confronted by a couple of teenage students whining about his “endless iambic pentameter” that these students have to “stomach” to get through their exams. the hour-long production was characterised by fascinatingly dramatic, startling and above all, hilarious elements.
mohammad rafi: in old-fashioned pathos, in timeless passion
the evening descends. the rays of a tired sun play havoc with the cheeks of the woman you love to distraction. and you hum the old mohammad rafi song, “hui shaam un ka khayal aa gaya / wohi zindagi ka sawaal aa gaya”. and there you have it. in the 31 years since july 1980, life without rafi has been a time of declining, indeed increasingly mediocre music. he was a maestro, in that true sense of the meaning. think of “radhike tu ne bansri churai”; or dwell on “hue hum jin ke liye barbaad”. there was that command in him of the various elements of music. was that voice a gift from god? never mind the answer. but what we do know is that mohammad rafi was an artiste whose presence in indian music overshadowed every other presence in his time.

palestine's dilemma
an electrifying drama is being played out now at the un headquarters in new york. on one end is a state called palestine. on the other end is a zionist entity which has the trappings of a state called israel. the entity is nervous.
abu taher and the supreme court of bangladesh
in this regard, let me turn the clock back to the period of september-october 1977. i was then living in england. i had taken a sabbatical from my work as a journalist and took up a place up at cambridge university to pursue graduate work in economics. in the autumn of 1977 amnesty international approached me for my views on a developing crisis in bangladesh. at the time amnesty was receiving a flood of confidential reports describing mass executions that were taking place in bangladesh following an apparent revolt in the armed forces.
state policy, the constitution and equal rights for disadvantaged groups
constitution as the supreme state policy
national constitutions contain the broad principles of the supreme policy of a state. other policies, contained in documents other than in constitutions, are policies of governments. the latter policies constantly change, unlike the former. therefore, disadvantaged sections of citizens, seek to protect their rights by having express safeguard provisions included in their national constitutions. this is no exception in bangladesh.
education in transition: english based learning in bangladesh today
the growing availability of english medium education in bangladesh attests to the increasing demand for the global language, both domestically and internationally. even traditional, national-curriculum following bangla medium schools, such as viqarunnisa noon school or st. josephs have established “english medium” sections. these sections teach the basic national curriculum as translated in english, and usually have only one bangla class, for at most 45 minutes per day. in the o'level exams in english medium schools, the bangla section is easily passable, as discussed by several alums of such schools for this article. “since bangla is taught as a second language, the section is fairly easy, and almost everyone will score an a,” explained a graduate from sunbeams. this trend, along with the rise in british-curriculum english medium schools in the country, attests to the language's continued prestige in the region.
the curious case of rohingya refugees
typically we in bangladesh are used to seeing our people migrate to other countries in search of work, a better living, or simply to escape harsh economic conditions. we are used to emigration from our country, and not immigration. that perception was changed abruptly when we faced a large-scale influx of people in our eastern border, from the state of arakan -- a large swath of land in burma, now myanmar, in april 1978.
bollywood and dhallywood: contentions and connections
dateline dhaka, 1 july 2011. the leading bengali daily prothom alo reports: 'indian film enters the country [bangladesh]' (entertainment reporter 2011: 20). the report elaborates that three indian-bengali films were released from the airport upon a court order and are now awaiting the clearance of bangladesh film censor board for being shown in local theatres. within two weeks, it reports again with a heading: 'the film fraternity fights back the indian films [in bangladesh]' (kamruzzaman 2011: 20). it outlines how the five different associations of film professionals working at dhaka film industry promise to oppose 'the exhibition of indian films till the last' and urged the government to intervene. on the other hand, the film exhibitors' association wishes to bring more indian films as '[local] film production is dwindling, the audiences are not watching these films like before and the producers are also losing money'. (kamruzzaman 2011: 20).
