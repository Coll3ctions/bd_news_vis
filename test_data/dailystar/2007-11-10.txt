agriculture and land reform: poverty alleviation imperatives
according to statistics, at present 56 percent of the people in our country are landless. among them a vast number are absolutely landless not even having any homestead. and the number of this landless people is gradually on the rise, never decreasing. yet no effective or dynamic step has been taken to establish the right of the landless on all kinds of khas resources including agricultural land and waterbodies to check this disastrous trend. even if some demonstrative steps were taken sometimes, its continuity, too, was not maintained, on the otherhand the land grabbing circle is continuously occupying all kinds of khas resources of the country under different garbs. in some cases the problem is extreme indifference of administration, in others, non-neutrality and unfavourable mind-set, which have kept this grabbing process going. as a result social discrimination and deprivation have spread further instead of diminishing. thus have increased rich-poor gap, food insecurity, man-woman disparity and many other problems. view the page sports

rain diary
orchir was born on the 24th of boishakh . it was just after noon that the rain came pelting down. in that rain the mango trees at the bend of the road at shantinagar and the single-storey house dissolved to become as one. by the time one came to the verandah on this side from the other side it was like the meghna-jamuna crashing headlong into each other. a household's daily life supposedly has its portion of tears. compared to human tears the raindrops were like well-buckets. and in the month of chaitra came agniborna--orchir's daughter. the sky was clear the day she was born, when bangladesh had bloomed. that day was the day bangladesh was born. that girl is now four years old. she can smell the rain's scent. suddenly she'll sniff the air and say, “i smell rain.” even the ants know about the coming rain. even when all around is nothing but a desolate sunshine, when not even scraps of cloud can be seen in the sky, one will spy columns of ants marching on floors or up walls. sure enough, not even an hour goes by when suddenly a shadow settles on the earth, darkness walks in from all sides, and then the dense rain. are they twins, these children and insects who can foretell rain? or do they simply sense it, pick up the scent or some change in the wind or in nature? our tara miah, on the other hand, can't foretell a damn thing. like the bullock tied to a stake beside the hayrick. even as the rain slants down tara miah would muse, “ah, i suppose it's finally coming down, eh?” the bullock would be placidly chewing cud with the rope slung around its neck -- but then, was it its job to explore life's boundless mysteries?
reading manil suri
some readers may be disappointed when they realize that manil suri is not in the process of penning the last part of a “trilogy.” as the author has maintained, apart from the fact that both his books are set in his native india-- and the god theme and title are dominant--there is no common thread between the death of vishnu and suri's latest novel, the age of shiva (new york: w.w. norton, 2007) a narrative with a female protagonist. spanning 30-plus years, it is a portrait of maternal love set in a country in turmoil.

iran-us relations: conclusion
escalating tensions between the united states and iran can be attributed to the evolving state of energy geopolitics, and the future of energy security of the western world. this includes ultimate control over the strait of hormuz, through which tankers ferry about 40% of the world's daily oil needs. in the usa, both the republican and democratic parties share the same view as regards the middle-eastern oil producing nations. any oil-rich country in the middle east that refuses to sufficiently cooperate with us economic and strategic designs in the middle east will face punishment in the form of isolation and militarily threat. an armed confrontation between the united states and iran, and an israeli entry into the conflict, may embroil the entire region in a state of war. consequences of such a war will be catastrophic.
