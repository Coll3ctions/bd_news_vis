the collapse of a five-storey building at begunbari in the tejgaon area of the city on the nearby tin-shed houses leading to the death of some 20 people is a glaring instance of callousness on the part of those involved in the construction, supervision and maintenance of that building. from the way the five-storied structure fell down, it appears there was no proper plan for the building, nor was any rule or code followed during its construction. and it is also patently clear that the workmanship and engineering as well as the materials that went into the making of that house were also of very poor quality. view the page sports
