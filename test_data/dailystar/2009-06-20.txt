restructuring intelligence bodies
we believe prime minister sheikh hasina's decision to restructure the nation's intelligence bodies and ensure better and effective coordination among them is a right and necessary step considering the many happenings which have regularly left these bodies under a cloud. indeed, since august 1975, when bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and nearly his entire family were wiped out in a bloody coup, the failure of the many intelligence organisations to detect or put the finger on conspiracies in the making has been glaring. and dearly has the country paid for such lapses on the part of bodies whose professionalism should have averted the many tragic incidents we have seen happen in our lifetime. the failure to spot the august 15 conspiracy was followed, in embarrassing manner, by the inability of the intelligence bodies to apprehend the plot to murder president ziaur rahman in may 1981. and only recently, in february this year, the absolute failure of these bodies to understand that conspiracy was afoot among the rank and file of the bangladesh rifles led to the murder of seventy people, fifty-seven of them military officers of various ranks.

an ambitious budget

no more feather dust approach, please
the first budget of the incumbent finance minister, ama muhith, was delivered on 11 june and it certainly stirred an intense debate at least in two areas: the projected growth estimate for 2009-10 (5.5-6.0 percent) fiscal year and about the approach budget paper proposed to whitening black money. sensing the discord by the leading economists and former finance advisers, the fm was at the back foot on both the issues the next day (12th), when other economic minsters also addressed the media.
towards a pro-people direction
the finance minister placed the 38th budget of bangladesh for 2009-10 fiscal before the parliament on june 11, 2009. incidentally, this is his maiden budget. because of the people's high expectations, the size of the budget had to be a bit (14%) larger than the last budget. the budget is considered as the first step towards realising the visions for 2021. view the page sports

slums are forever
push' from the village and 'pull' factors from the city have been compelling the bangladeshi rural poor, depleting by percentage versus urban population, to migrate to urban centres for decades, the upshot being the doubling of the number of slums since independence.
urban slums of bangladesh
background
though still comparatively rural, bangladesh has an urban population of about 35 million, or just over 25 percent of its total population. moreover, the urban population has been growing very rapidly since liberation in 1971 and continues to do so at over 3.5 percent annually. the country will likely have an urban population approaching 50 million by 2015.this rapid growth has been due primarily to migration by the rural poor, particularly to large metropolitan areas. on arrival, these poor migrants routinely turn to slums and squatter settlements for shelter. all major urban centres in bangladesh have slums and squatter settlements, the largest concentrations being in dhaka, followed by chittagong, khulna, and rajshahi. view the page literature
jinnah coat*
sixteen years ago, i went to bid my father farewell. he sat on a leather recliner on the veranda of our ancestral village home in ghorasal, on the outskirts of dhaka. he held onto my hand very tightly. we have the same hands, father and daughter, hands that many found hard to tell apart. at that moment, it seemed our two hands intertwined as if they belonged to the same person. after a while, he let go, and i was sure it would be for the very last time.

on jibanananda's maalay, malay, and malayali
the author of this book (barisal and beyond: essays on bangla literature ; new delhi: chronicle books; 2008) is the protagonist of a charming inter-cultural romance. clinton seely is one of fewer than a handful of living westerners who fortuitously fell in love with bengali literature and made a distinguished career of teaching it - at the university of chicago in his case. a major in botany from stanford, he volunteered for the peace corps and spent a year and nine months (1963-65) training high school science teachers in barisal, in present-day bangladesh. in the process he picked up bangla (or bengali) and, through the desultory chitchat that bengalis call adda , gathered some idea about the greatest writer in the language, rabindranath tagore. at the end of his stint he enrolled for a phd at the department of south asian languages and civilisations, university of chicago and discovered bengal's greatest modern poet, whose hometown was his familiar barisal. his thesis, published as a poet apart: a literary biography of the bengali poet jibanananda das (1889-1954) , won him west bengal's most prestigious literary award. his other publications include three translated volumes, of which the one of michael madhusudan datta's epic, the slaying of meghnada: a ramayana from colonial bengal , got him the a.k. ramanujan book prize for translation. view the page star health

from 'no first use' to 'no nuclear use'
'resolve' is cardinal to ensure nuclear deterrence. if the 'will' to use nuclear weapons were seen to be lacking, this would impact adversely on deterrence. the draft nuclear doctrine encapsulated this principle thus, “2.6. deterrence requires that india maintain:...(e) the will to employ nuclear forces and weapons.” the other pillars of deterrence are 'capability' and 'communication' of the capability and will to the opponent. india is seen as doing well in capability building, even if its peer competitor, china, is way ahead. recent reports suggest that pakistan is doing equally well. view the page star books review
clash of the generals
general ziaur rahman's capacity for cruelty has never been in doubt. the number of bengalis --- and they include men in the army and air force --- who perished in the five years of his rule as bangladesh's first military ruler has remained at an all-time high. with as many as eighteen eventually abortive coups launched against his regime, zia clearly felt that all those involved in those conspiracies needed to be swiftly dispatched. and they were. but, then, this insensitivity in the man was to first manifest itself in the mid-1970s, when the murder of khaled musharraf, obviously a more brilliant officer than he, through the misleadingly named sepoy-janata revolution, did not move him at all. musharraf became a non-person. and so did the political architects of freedom. in zia's five years in power, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and the leaders of the mujibnagar government remained airbrushed out of national history. in july 1976, zia felt little or no compunction in sending his 1975 benefactor, colonel abu taher, to the gallows.
media and the public interest
the business and economics of media are extensively discussed. scholars and professionals are concerned about increasing corporatization of the media. in spite of this fact, the topic lags in well-researched books. sociologist david croteau and william hoynes's work provides an introductory discussion on concerns about business and economics of media with socio-economic perspectives. the authors were awarded the prestigious `robert picard award', named after world renowned media economics scholar robert picard, by the association for education in journalism and mass communication (ejmc) in 2002 for their outstanding contribution in the field of media management and economics.
