should we import teachers?
it may surprise many if not all, to know that acute crisis of experienced and qualified teachers in bangladesh will soon necessitate import of teachers. m. saifur rahman who enjoyed longest tenure as finance minister, predicted such a possibility in a london assembly of bangladeshi citizens in the early part of the last four party alliance government. he made this statement out of disgust in the face of serious shortage of english teachers in the country resulting in dearth of bangladeshis who could communicate fluently in english required for employment prospects in the united kingdom. with the passage of time and continued negligence of our policy makers at the helm of affairs, the crisis has deepened further bringing it to the present impasse, which draws serious attention to the non availability of teachers of mathematics and science subjects also. to speak the truth, even teachers who can teach bangla with correct pronunciation and adequate knowledge in the subject, have also become rare now. view the page environment
climate change threatens plant diversity in bangladesh
forests cover one third of the earth's surface and estimation is that more than two thirds of all available terrestrial species are found in the forests. bangladesh also supports a wealth of plant diversity and is located in transition of two mega-biodiversity hot spots of indo-malayan region. the country has been endowed with rich plant diversity because of its fertile alluvial land, warm and humid climate. more than 5,700 angiosperm species and several sub-species are available in bangladesh. the diverse agro-ecological (30 agro-ecological zones) regions or the 12 bio-ecological zones of the country have sustained rich genetic resources of crop plants, which are unique to this country. the forest of bangladesh covers approximately 2.60 million ha which is about 17.62 percent of the land area of the country. of these, the hills consist of moist tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which extend from northeast to southeast of the country. the forests are generally uneven-aged and multistoried with the valuable tropical species of dipterocarpus turbinatus, d. alatus, d. costatus, swintonia floribunda, aphanamaxis polystachya, artocarpus chaplasha, tetrameles nudiflora, duabanga grandifolia and pterygota alata. the understorey is a tangle of shrubs, creepers, climbers, ferns and orchids. the species were adapted to the different ecosystems after a long successional process.
conserving the sundarban tigers
the tiger is arguably the most magnificent and recognized of all animals, but is facing a very real risk of extinction in the wild. as human populations continue to soar, the tiger's forest home has reduced to about 7 percent of its former extent. this severe habitat destruction as well aspoaching and prey depletion has reduced tiger numbers to probably less than 5,000 worldwide. in bangladesh, this same forest destruction means that less than 10 percent of the country remains forested and the sundarbans makes up around half the remainder. the sundarbans ecosystem is essential for human existence, supplying oxygen, absorbing greenhouse gases, regulating weather patterns, protecting the country from cyclones and securing sources of fish, golpatta, wood and honey. the tiger is an integral part of the sundarbans ecosystem and its protection will also secure the protection of its forest home. the tiger is also the national symbol of bangladesh and often referred to in the country's literature. conserving the tiger both in its own right and as guardian of the sundarbans, will therefore preserve a cultural icon and help protect humans and their livelihoods. so, if we understand the tiger's importance and the threats it faces then why do tiger numbers continue to plummet, and what can we do about it? view the page literature

dhaka memories
it's been a little more than five months since i have been back from dhaka and with the passage of time bangladesh is ceasing to be a place, a geographical location, a physical reality which i can point in the map and exclaim “i have been here,” because i am no longer sure any more whether i have really been there. feeling like a deserted lover, bangladesh haunts me, creeps upon me when i least expect it, in the most unlikely of ways in the reflection of a woman's sunglass, in the tinkle of a certain laughter, in the rear view of a car, in the folds of a billowing shalwar , in the act of crossing roads, or in the columns of cigarette smoke. abruptly out of nowhere bits and parts of experience rise in front of me, like sudden flashes of déjà vu, mingle with the sense, smell, din, traffic roar, twittering bird, thuk-thuk of keyboard keys, television volume, suffuse with the teeny-tiny particles floating in the air and play out its course. i pause, and become a mute witness, while deep, very deep in my heart something stirs. view the page star health

changed scenario in pakistan and kashmir
the events of 9/11 and the subsequent american "war on terror" brought a perceptible shift in the course of pakistan's foreign policy, evident from its volte face, particularly in its relations with its immediate neighbourhood. president gen. pervaiz mushharaf is credited as the doyen of the gradual change in pakistan's traditional kashmir policy. he has always talked about finding an "out of the box solution", besides meeting india "half-way" in order to carve out a solution to this chronic problem. accordingly he drew up a "four-point formula" which created a stir in the valley and bisected the separatist camp - one supporting it and the other opposing it. view the page star books review
a poetic soul nourished by geography
khondakar ashraf hossain is perhaps the finest voice on the literary horizon of bangladesh, particularly in the field of poetic activity, at the present time. he has made his mark on the literary scene as a bengali poet and has published several volumes of bengali poems. on behula's raft is his first collection of english poems written on a kaleidoscopic variety of themes. although the poems are written in english, ashraf hossain does not claim to be an english poet. his soul, as he says in the preface to this volume, is nourished and nurtured by the alluvial soil of bangladesh the lush green countryside with clusters of boats sailing on the river, hosts of plants and flowers dancing in the breeze, the twittering of birds in the sky have always been a source of inspiration for his poetic creativity.
history taken with a pinch of salt
the title of the novel is a most fascinating one, particularly to a reader who is a bengali in spirit. the title sends out vibrations of musical elements to one's images. it is a family saga based on stories and events that actually had happened over a long period of time dating back roughly to 1950 and ending sometime in early 1971. the locale is the then east pakistan where the father, an ics officer, was posted in various places both small and relatively big, raising a family of six children along with his hardy and well-educated wife. also part of the family was nanibibi who was looked upon as a much dependable person, particularly by the children as they grew up.
the general in his own eyes
military governments or army-driven governments usually erupt in poorer countries. they even try to rule in countries that are at break-even point vis-a-vis prosperity. they do not have a chance in countries like the united kingdom, the united states or even saudi arabia --- nations that have already become prosperous and where the 'poverty' jargon does not work any longer for the ruling class.
a leader's story
there have been, since 15 august 1975, several attempts by different authors to write a meaningful biography of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman. unfortunately, they have been either fragmentary or superficial. in most cases, the treatment of the subject and his era were also not comprehensive.
