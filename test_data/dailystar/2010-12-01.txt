hartals and mass arrests disrupt normal life
one more hartal has come and gone, with the usual disruption of life and damage to property which such political moves entail. stray incidents of violence have occurred at different places of the country, with vehicles and the like coming under attack. now that the hartal is over, it is our sincere expectation that it will not be repeated and that the political opposition will find alternative means of expressing its point of view on the issues. we have consistently made our position clear, which is that we have never had any reason to think that hartals or general strikes accelerate in any way our march to stable democracy or a vibrant economy. we believe that the end of autocratic rule in 1990 and the elections of early 1991 should have been an opportunity for our political classes to guide the nation toward a new, substantive democratic opening through eschewing hartals and promoting a spirit of energetic political engagement and cooperation in parliament as well as outside it. unfortunately, at a time when we as a nation stand ready to take the necessary steps to catch up with the rest of the world in terms of political and economic advancement, we remain bogged down by issues that increasingly look more personal to politicians than fundamental to the national interest.

smoking
is there an obvious answer to why people smoke? some say it relieves us from tension, others say, it is a habit and may be the so-called 'coolness,' for the youngsters. well, i would definitely not re-mention the drawbacks that are being advertised all the time in symposiums or radios, because those who smoke don't give a damn about it; and this is why in economics when it comes to the example of a product that is inelastic, the example is always cigarette. some things depend on mentality, undoubtedly.

when politics worked on a higher plane
when was the last time we had political leaders whose minds were exercised by questions of public interest? and can you think back on an era where it was in the nature of politicians to dwell exclusively and purposefully on matters relating to the constitution, to the future of their nations, indeed to an adherence to principles they thought ought to define their own places in history? in bangladesh -- and that means we are speaking of the last forty years -- do you recall the last time you came across a leader who could reach out to an entire nation and shape dreams for them?
