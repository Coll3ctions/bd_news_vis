three years of sk. hasina's rule
when sheikh hasina promised a “politics of change” in 2008 people just loved it and massively voted for it, simply because they so desperately wanted it. at the end of the third year of a five year mandate, there is no sign of any change, especially in politics, governance and corruption, the three areas where change was needed and people expected most. regrettably all the indications are of a return to politics of violence, police oppression, use of mastans, black money, etc in politics and related areas. the above facts along with price hike of essentials, widespread corruption, extra-judicial killings, recent disappearance and partisanship in most of the activities of the government have overshadowed its considerable achievements in education, rice production, fertilizer distribution and power generation.

all-engulfing corruption
it is deeply frustrating that corruption is pervasive in the country. corruption now occupies the centre stage in public discourse in bangladesh. it is humiliating when we see the name of our country on the top of the corruption list of the world.
neutrality expected from president
at last, president zillur rahman has started a dialogue regarding the appointment of the election commission members. according to our constitution, the president has limited power, in all respects. but we were hopeful about the success of this dialogue. the bnp also agreed to take part in this dialogue. some of the parties, including bnp, requested the president to include caretaker government issue in the dialogue. but he did not do that.
rein in bcl cadres
what happened in kuet is very frustrating. not only in kuet, this is the situation in all our educational institutions. the pro- awami league (al) student body, bangladesh chhatra league (bcl) has been controlling all the universities and colleges of the country now. they are using their power to gain personal interests. they are killing students, beating students, raping the female students, and what not? they are against any logical demand of the general students of a university. we have seen what happened in jagannath university, how they tortured the general students. the al should rein in the bcl cadres immediately, for their own good.
we want punishment to criminals
i minutely read the news report titled “bike-riding muggers” published in the daily star of december 31, 2011. what i have understood so far is that our law enforcing agencies are unable to control crimes. i think this news will encourage the muggers to carry on with their activities without any fear.
dynastic democracy
some are of the view that democracy is not flourishing in bangladesh as it should. it has fallen in a trap. two major political parties, or to be more specific, two families have ensnared it. they say, the political turbulence of 2006 led to usurping of state power by a non-political government which gained acceptance of the people. so, they think we should come out of the cycle of the two parties and look for a third and new one. certainly, there are many examples which deserve serious notice. india has a good experience of this 'dynastic democracy.' no one can deny that india has a fast growing economy.
is it a wall, or a road divider?
every time i shop at gulshan 2, i marvel that a nation with some of the best architects and engineers in the world - and a reputation second to none for sheer cleverness - could have perpetrated the horror that is the road divider at gulshan 2. its height makes it a major obstacle for those of us past the first flush of youth, as we heave our shopping bags and ourselves over it.
rangpur express train a joke
the so-called rangpur express has turned out to be a joke to the people of rangpur. there is only one train that starts from dhaka at about 9am. it is is supposed to reach rangpur at 7pm and then begin its return journey to dhaka at 7.30 pm. then it is scheduled to reach dhaka at 6am. unfortunately, from day one the train was late by at least two hours in arriving rangpur and as such was more than two hours late in returning back dhaka.
save the hungry
it has been learnt from the recent oxfam report, as i learn from my teacher prof. m. zahidul haque of saub, that every day 925 million people go hungry. it is very alarming news, no doubt. but one thing is inspiring that the agricultural science is remarkably advancing in developing super yielding cereals and genetically modified crops. it is also true that to meet the food demand, chemicals are being used improperly which leaves adverse effects on the environment.
when money rules…
when the whole society is running after money, then who is going to appreciate someone's sincere endeavours to do something better for society? 'money for money' is the ruling principle of society. money can buy anything, from social status to even spiritual attainments. those who do not run after money are often labeled as worthless. in this money-wise society, few good people are struggling selflessly to put the nation back on the right track. will they ever win?
secret killings and disappearances
mysterious disappearances and secret killings have created panic in the country. fifty-one people vanished last year, according to a report published in the daily star. no clues have been found as to why these people vanished, although fingers are pointed at the law enforcers. but prime minister has hinted at bnp's involvement in these killings which is a sign of bad politics. it is the duty of the law enforcing agencies to find out the killers and the real reasons behind these killings. otherwise it will be much more dangerous in the future. we hope that our law enforcers will be able to perform their duty properly. we also hope that our top-level leaders would make responsible statement on the matter.

obama's risky path in egypt
obama administration officials say they are not taking sides between president hosni mubarak, america's key ally in the arab world, and the street protesters who purportedly represent a path to democracy in authoritarian egypt. these officials might even believe what they're saying. but the very assertion of "not taking sides" is itself a tilt away from the all-out support traditionally given by washington to this egyptian strongman in recent decades.
amartya's cheery words
what amartya sen said in dhaka last friday is perhaps as important as what he left unsaid. whilst reflecting on bangladesh's socio-economic progress he did not even remotely touch on politics. usually anybody talking economy expresses dismay over the state of politics in the country adding this hinders investment, productivity and sustained growth.
article 70 is no more welcome
if one provision of law had to be singled out for its contribution towards holding back our otherwise promising parliamentary democracy, it would most certainly be article 70 of the constitution. in line with the culture of our political parties, no party in power or in opposition has ever properly addressed the issue of mps not being allowed to vote against their own party, as article 70 stipulates. consequently, this provision has haunted our parliamentary practice for four decades and promises to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
