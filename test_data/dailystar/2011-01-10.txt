murders in the city
the murder of a tenn year-old boy and the severe injuries inflicted on his father in gandaria on saturday once more bring into focus the worries generated by unbridled crime not only in the city but also elsewhere in the country. add to the gruesome murder of the boy (he was subjected to dunking in a bucket of water only because he saw his father being attacked by local criminals) the murder of a trader in kamrangirchar. the body of the trader was found hanging from a ceiling fan. a few days ago, the decomposing corpse of a pesh imam was discovered in the city, with as yet no clear clue as to who was behind his murder. as a matter of fact, hardly a day goes by when some murder or the other is not committed in the nation's capital.
a major incentive to power plant and industry operators
in what appears to be breaking a gridlock in terms of local industries tiding over energy crisis on their own, the government has withdrawn import duty on furnace oil. this is a substantial incentive because it meant waiver on 37.5 percent levy on import. given that paucity of gas has affected power generation that is critically dependent on this hydrocarbon, liberalising import of furnace oil or heavy fuel oil (hfo) looked somewhat unavoidable. more so, in a context where no one knows when government would be in a position to supply gas with appropriate pressure to industries to run their boilers and generators. view the page sports

when the nightingale came home . . .
