rupchan the honest rickshawpuller
good, honest men are yet around, even in these days when values appear to have taken a nosedive. take the example of rupchan the rickshawpuller. the tk. 2.50 lakh he stumbled upon at nilkhet the other day could very well have been in his possession and he could have made as much use of it as he possibly could. after all, the owner of the money was not around. and there was the bigger reality of rupchan being a poor man. poverty often has a way of playing ugly tricks on conscience, to a point where it pushes individuals into dishonesty. but our very own rupchan simply stayed away from such thoughts. he found the bag containing the money and did what morally upright people always do: he took it to the nearest police station (and his passenger, another honest soul, was with him) and handed it over to the officers there.

a poetry reading: notes on authenticity
at a recent poetry reading i attended here in new haven, connecticut i witnessed an unexpected comedy show - a rare treat, as most readings tend to be like dour, precious funerals. in attendance were mostly students, in slashed tights, glitter headscarves and dark chiffon shirts. after the first, nearly inaudible poet left the stage, the second poet began to perform. he danced in epileptic bursts, crouched on the floor, burst into mawkish operetta, all the while feverishly interspersing his movements with gusts of shouted reading of his poem, which was opaque and difficult. of course, people began to laugh, and i found i couldn't restrain my laughter, either; i hunkered down into my seat and tried to bury my face in my hands, and yet all i could see was the poet's face bright with sweat. i considered getting up and leaving the room; then, i had an overt horror that the young poet, in his crazed dionysian state, would look at me and cry, “you there! stop immediately!”

the ghettoisation of gaza
israel's creation of a "warsaw ghetto" in gaza continues apace, using control of the food supply as a primary weapon against the civilian population. every time gazans sit down for a meal, they face a depressing reality. the selection of foods available to them is dictated almost entirely by a harsh policy imposed by the israeli government, which, as of late, has even refused to allow such innocuous-seeming foods as pumpkins, pasta or beans to cross the border. view the page star books review
war, suffering and those laws about them . . .
at a time when morality is being tested to the extreme and law is being subjected to rigorous interpretation, this book comes as a useful guide to an understanding of conflict situations and what the international community can do about them. if the world wars are part of the collective human memory now, if the cold war is somewhere in the distant past, there is hardly any reason to feel complacent about the circumstances we inhabit. remember that it was only in the 1990s that history, to the extent that war defined a large part of it, was badly mauled in the balkans in a conflict that lay rooted in the deep antagonisms of the past. serbia, bosnia-herzegovina, et cetera, are all reminders that the human capacity to inflict wounds on civilisation has not yet ended, that indeed conflict in its violent forms is but a truth we have all lived with and will continue to consider part of life. and then of course there are the innumerable hostilities which have left countries in africa maimed. you could even argue that all the decency and respect for individuals you expect will define these post-modern times have simply not manifested themselves in that unfortunate continent.
an awesome compilation for children
fables? extracts from a memoir? short stories? what is how i taught my grandmother to read and other stories comprised of? we could say, in a way, all of the afore-mentioned.
