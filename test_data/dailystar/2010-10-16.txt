how democratic are we?
this is perhaps the only country in the world where there is so much talk of democracy and yet so little in practice. even the illegal usurpers of power within days of entering into the arena start talking of democracy. true though that there were elected governments that came and went away since we gained our independence, but then that is all there is to it. all governments elected or unelected have been dictatorial and fascistic in nature and character. none of them has worked for democracy in the real sense of the term.
storm in a teacup
timing is an important factor for politicians. they should know when to speak. if they do not know what should be said and when, they can land themselves in trouble. india's first governor general c. rajagopalachari was correct in supporting the demand for pakistan in 1942. but since he was a tall leader of the congress, which was opposed to the demand at that time, he was not only vehemently criticised but also made to feel like a persona non-grata in the party.

dhaka city on the verge of subsidence
dhaka city, the capital of the country has always been the core of political, cultural, and educational movement and evolution. home of about 15 million people, the city is now worn out providing supplies to growing demand for housing, infrastructure, water supply and sanitation. among many civic problems faced by city dwellers inadequate drinking water-supply, most of which comes from groundwater, is one of the critical issues that draws periodic attention, particularly during the dry season (march to may) when so-called "load shedding" of electricity across the city especially disrupts groundwater abstraction (withdrawal) from its deepest levels in the underlying aquifer.
growing conflict and threat of climate catastrophe
at first the event sounds like a simple textbook story illustrating the conflicts which the world's rich nations have for centuries been fighting over access to fossil fuels and other natural wealth. on september 21 last, an arctic forum was held in the russian capital of moscow. organized by the russian geographic society together with russia's press agency ria novosti, the forum brought together hundreds of scientists and politicians hailing from countries bordering the arctic region and from countries located farther away. russia's government, evidently pleased with the forum, used the occasion to boost its own claims over large parts of the north pole which is (still) covered by an icecap.
urban green spaces: more important than structures
green areas are dwindling in an unprecedented rate in the cities all over the world. world wide urbanization in the fifties and sixties was marked by extensive use of construction materials to build contiguous anthrosphere costing destruction of natural environment. technological advancement and economic solvency the urban people achieved made them forget the pastoral and rural lifestyle their parents and ancestors lived. they became quite oblivious to understand the importance of nature and natural goods and services in their lives. view the page literature

of boreal forests and boomtowns
i am walking near a path leading to a boreal forest. there is a mist that ascends above the tops of the elongated coniferous trees and hangs in the northern air in wisps, rises and vanishes in the early morning sunshine. a boreal forest is named after boreas the greek god, and is also known by the russian word “taiga”. it is a unique ecosystem of a productive mosaic of interconnected habitats that include forest, lakes, river valleys, wetlands, peat lands and the tundra at its northern reaches.
my days with the mahabharata
the mahabharata, the most widely read book of the world both as a literary piece and as religious scripture, has had a deep-rooted influence on my life. though its religiosity has never been important to me, this acclaimed book has imprinted itself hugely on me for many different aspects --- heroism, wisdom, narrative, characterization and so on and so forth. the mahabharata is a book that can never be completely read; and this is the mystery for which writers of forthcoming generations, after its creation in sanskrit, have always felt encouraged to remake its episodes, translate the longest poem in newer forms and reproduce it in novel mediums. in my later forties, this gem creates a halo around me and hope.

in his speech at the united nations on september 23rd, 2001, president obama confidently stated that the palestinian problem would be resolved within a year. his optimistic statement was based on the success of diplomatic endeavors of his secretary of state hillary clinton and middle east (me) envoy senator john mitchell that have resulted in, first, bringing the two parties on the negotiating table, and second, to push the peace process ahead. he has been given significant support by jordan and egypt, with the latter also offering the venue for the talks that started early last month after being in cold storage from the time of president bush. view the page star books review
