sincerity the answer
commitment of the government, tough enforcement of environmental laws and formation of an effective river authority are the key to save the rivers physically and biologically.

dandy dyeing ltd owned by ex-premier khaleda zia's elder son tarique rahman got a waiver of interest worth tk 12 crore on bank loans within a week after the bnp-jamaat coalition assumed power in 2001.
grassroots leaders seek more time
bnp's plan to reorganise the party in the district level in two months is likely to prove futile, as grassroots level leaders think such a massive task cannot be done within this short time.
rally for rivers
one does not have to be an expert to identify river encroachments. it's just too obvious. but it's all the more difficult to prove as all the river-gobblers have ownership papers, thanks to our corrupt land administration and lax monitoring by river regulatory body. powerful, rich and ruthless, these river-gobblers find no difficulty in maneuvering legal system and managing law enforcement. they have become seemingly invincible.

diplomats' worry over crime
it is surely a matter of shame when even foreigners based in dhaka on diplomatic assignment begin to feel themselves under threat from criminal elements. indeed, as the dean of the diplomatic corps has already pointed out in a letter to the foreign office, there have been specific incidents where foreigners were mugged and threatened with physical injury if they refused to hand over their belongings to gangs of youths accosting them on the road. and these incidents have been taking place in supposedly the most secure of urban areas such as gulshan and baridhara. where earlier the probability of diplomats coming under assault from criminal elements in bangladesh was unthinkable, it is now clear that the overall slide in law and order we notice in the capital has simply spilled over into its diplomatic enclave.
perks and facilities to mps
marking a healthy departure from the much abused practice of providing duty-free luxurious cars to mps, many of them finding their way to the open market, henceforth the lawmakers will have vehicles from a pool created for them. this is a move in the right direction, although all concerned must still be conscious of the fact that purchase of new vehicles even slightly lower down the luxury scale for large numbers of mps and upazila chairmen would be a financially strenuous undertaking, especially in these hard times.
an open letter to president obama
let me start by congratulating you on your historic address to the muslim world at cairo university yesterday. you promised us that it would be something special, and we were not disappointed.
nothing is settled until settled right
if the south hadn't finally accepted the outcome of the civil war as being on the whole just, gilbert keith chesterton observed, abraham lincoln would have been wrong in trying to preserve the american union. in politics at least, right and wrong are matters of consensus. lincoln summarised it in his own homely words. nothing is ever really settled, he said, until it's settled right. what he didn't mention is that the settling must happen in people's minds.
women in politics and governance
a century and a half ago, john stuart mill asserted that the participation of both the majority and the minority must be ensured for a government to be competent and efficient. he included women in his definition of the enormously disfranchised "minority" of that time. politicians across national boundaries were slow to heed to this basic tenet of governance of state affairs -- bangladesh is no exception. however, bangladesh is catching up faster than most developing countries governed by democratically elected governments. view the page sports

tipaimukh dam
recently there have been protests from different forums and groups about the dangers and consequences that the tipaimukh dam will cause to bangladesh. the prime minister of india laid the foundation stone of this dam on 24 november, 2004 and the indian government is already going ahead with the controversial tipaimukh dam project with a target to complete it by 2012. the dam will be over the cross-boundary river borak, 100km upstream of eastern border of sylhet district. it will be 1500 feet long and 500 feet high and will cost around indian rupees 9,000 crore. once constructed, this dam would spell an ecological disaster for bangladesh through desertification and flooding in our eastern region.
water for cyclone victims
water in the cyclone affected areas has been contaminated by saline sea water. there is hardly any source of drinking water. this problem can be solved if barges are converted into floating water storage tanks in the affected areas and water is transported to these water storage tanks by using the fresh water supply barges/vessels belonging to chittagong and mongla ports that supply fresh water to the ships calling at the ports. small tankers preferably those that have coated (painted ) tanks could be thoroughly cleaned and be used to transport fresh water to these areas. water carried by the tankers should not be used for drinking but could be used for all other purposes. if these measures are taken on an emergency basis by the disaster management ministry it will be of immense benefit to the cyclone affected people.
muslims in the region
in the recent indian election, indian muslims voted massively for the ruling congress party despite their reservations about the congress. this was mainly because they were stunned by taliban slaughtering fellow muslims in neighbouring pakistan and they wanted a strong government to face such extremism spilling over to india. slaughter of fellow muslims by the taliban must have made them apprehensive that islamic extremists may also make india their target with disastrous consequences as happening in pakistan.

ssc results
according to the results published on tuesday (26 may), in the secondary school certificate exams of 2009, a total of 45,934 examinees achieved gpa-5, while it was 41,917 in 2008. but the overall success rate has declined a little compared to that of the previous year. the percentage of passes in eight general education boards is 67.41 this year, while the rate was 70.81 in 2008 under seven education boards. explaining the reason for the decline in the success rate, education minister nurul islam nahid said, “the pass rate has declined slightly as the examinees could not adopt unfair means this year.”

drivers asking for too much
it has been observed that the dhaka city taxis and auto-rickshaws do not take any passenger on "meter". they will demand a fancy and unreasonable amount from the passengers. you have to meet their demand to hire these transports. for a short distance the autowalas' demand is at least tk 50/-. they will not take anything less. the taxis demand tk. 100/- for a short distance. for any long distance they demand whatever they feel like. now the passengers are in distress and have no alternative but to accept their unreasonable demands.
why a luxury car?
the approval for purchase of 440 pajero jeep for the upazila chairmen is a glaring example of misuse of public funds. still a pauper country, bangladesh can ill afford to expend such huge amounts of hard earned foreign currency for the symbol or spectre of power the chairmen hold. as if when they will come to dhaka this will be proper to show off their status, as also to the village folks who elected them for their development, not to get amazed! their seat of work is in the upazilas, the headquarters of the rural unions/areas where there are hardly roads for easy and safe ride, and obviously this will cause unabated drainage of money for the upkeep of this inordinately pricey vehicle. this is a sheer unproductive outlay.
bdr tragedy report
thanks to the government committee on bdr tragedy for making the salient features public, a rare case in bangladesh. we hope the government would continue the investigation to unveil the real cause of the bdr mutiny because the national security and political stability of the country are directly linked with the incident.
icb dividends
payment of dividends against icb mutual fund has been kept suspended for almost a year because sec filed a petition to the court on some issue. as such the small investors, like retired officials, are suffering. the icb is earning interest at the cost of the investors. as nobody is pursuing the matter, only god knows when the investors would get dividends.
to the finance minister…
as you are going to substantially increase the salaries of the public servants with the taxpayers' money, please ask them to change their anti-people attitude and to be pro-people and friendly not like masters that they think they are. please brief them on how to behave with their real bosses -- the common people of bangladesh -- and ask them not to take bribe for the public services they provide to their real bosses.
the flip side
in some bangla newspapers of 27 may '09 there was a headline “speaker entertained president with tea costing 90 thousand taka.” this news item is reported to have been provided by the parliamentary sub-committee which is investigating irregularities committed by the ex-speaker of parliament. ever since the committees have started their fact-finding missions, news reports of their daily findings are being leaked to the press. people are reading those reports with interest, the press is getting good sale and the investigators are feeling great.
how could this happen?
we are outraged learning that to unveil the plaque containing the pictures of the players of swadhin bangla football team, our national flag has been used as a stage curtain. by this action total disrespect has been shown to the flag and we are appalled by it.
government's tasks
since this present awami league government took over power after the december 2008 election, the government has faced too many tough challenges. there were insurmountable problems already which this government had promised to solve if they came to power. added to these "already established miseries", more miseries followed. the bdr massacre is one of those added miseries which the government had to handle. whether they handled the situation well enough is not the question but such an incident surely upset everything.
minister's observation
one third of the total examinees could not pass the ssc exams. the overall results of the ssc this year are not satisfactory, because the percentage of pass in the eight general education boards is 67.41 this year, while the rate was 70.81 last year under seven education boards.
attention: mobile operators
different mobile operators are advertising call blocking option of their service. the technology is good, but i object to the idea of advertising it. the advertisements are presented in a way as if disturbing calls are a matter of fun. such calls are a social crime and civic nuisance. perhaps all mobile phones are now registered and it is possible to find out the caller. so there should be this warning message to disturbing callers. sometimes disturbing callers do it in groups (!). how many callers' connection one can block or how effective the option is?

vampires these days are sort of lovelorn and wimpy. not guillermo del toro's. his will suck you dry with a stinger-tipped tentacle. it's not really the kind of stuff teen girls want to read. but del toro, director of the oscar-winning “pan's labyrinth” -- as well as “the devil's backbone”, “blade ii” and the “hellboy” series -- is not trying to appeal to the stephenie meyer set with his new novel. the first in a trilogy (co-written with author chuck hogan), “the strain” opens with a plane that lands in new york city, lights off, windows drawn, everyone seemingly dead. naturally, it gets worse from there. the director, currently in new zealand, where he is working on the film version of j.r.r tolkien's “the hobbit”, talked about bloodsuckers, swine flu and more. view the page op-ed
a new beginning
i am honored to be in the timeless city of cairo, and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions. for over a thousand years, al-azhar has stood as a beacon of islamic learning, and for over a century, cairo university has been a source of egypt’s advancement. together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress. i am grateful for your hospitality, and the hospitality of the people of egypt. i am also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the american people, and a greeting of peace from muslim communities in my country: assalaamu alaykum. view the page environment
polluted rivers, risky water
the water of buriganga, balu, sitalakhya and turag are severely polluted. no biological survival can occur there as oxygen is depleted and might have reached nearly o level! oxygen level in fresh river water is 9mg/l at 20ºc and 7.6mg/l at 30ºc (summer).
a plea to combating climate change and water scarcity
to everything there is a season; but water is eternal. however, despite the looming crisis of water, the scenario is getting worse day by day because of nature's unpredictability along with industrialisation, illegal encroachment, negligence and ignorance of the authorities, which are turning our once pristine fresh water resources and riverine waterways into sewers. thus water is becoming increasingly scarce in consequence.
the action beyond a day
only one day is not sufficient to unite people to combat climate change but it should be sufficient to give a message -- "your planet needs you: unite to combat climate change." bearing this theme, the whole world is celebrating today the world environment day (wed) 2009 with a view to raising worldwide awareness of the environment as well as enhancing political attention and action. the world observes wed, which was established by the un general assembly in 1972, on june 5 to mark the opening of the stockholm conference on the human environment.
