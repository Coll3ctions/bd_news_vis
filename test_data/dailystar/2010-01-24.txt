caretaker government
in recent days it has become a fashion to blame the past ctg for the 1/11 episode. it is the human nature to pass on one's blame to others to hide one's own failures. some quarters are even asking for the 'trial' of the persons involved in the changeover. the hula, as can be seen, is masterminded by few controversial influential persons whose role during pre- ctg era came under drastic scrutiny. we all know why and how the then political circumstances and deteriorating law and order situation pushed the country towards the changeover. there was no other alternative whatsoever due to the intransigence of the power hungry groups. the fact, however, remains that the people of this country, except for the few disgruntled politicians, overwhelmingly supported the changeover. even the international community seeing the internal huge public support came out publicly in support of the ctg. the role of the administration of the ctg in handling the total affairs of the country cannot be termed perfect. but there is no denying that the corruption which bore its firm roots from the pre-ctg era got a tremendous jerk with the changeover. persons who once considered themselves too powerful and above any kind of law of the country were brought to face charges in the court. henceforth, i am sure before embarking upon any large scale corruption a person will now think twice about his accountability to the nation, may be at a later date.
