former prime minister khaleda zia has been enlightening expatriate bengalis in london on the dysfunctional nature of parliament back home in bangladesh. and that is not all. she feels, as she has felt since the results of the general elections of december 2008 began to pour in, that the awami league was installed in power by the caretaker government of fakhruddin ahmed. there is yet a little more that she told her party faithful in london on monday. if the former caretaker chief and the former army chief of staff, general moeen u. ahmed, were around, they would be subjected to a public beating.
