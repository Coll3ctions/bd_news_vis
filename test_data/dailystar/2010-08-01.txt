eruption of violence didn't look grievance-centred
we are appalled at the unprecedented violence which ravaged parts of the capital on friday. on the face of it, it was garments workers who seemed to be protesting against the new wage structure announced earlier. however, the rampage into which the protest degenerated showed clearly that the protests were anything but grievance-centred. the mayhem that was conducted in gulshan and banani was clearly aimed at causing maximum damage. it is something that is unacceptable and reprehensible. what is equally outrageous is that the police were nowhere to be seen during the first outbreak of violence. and when they did appear on the scene it was with belated action that really was ineffectual.

weekly currency roundup
july 25- 29, 2010
international markets
the international markets rallied on the back of positive data, and there was a general pick up in risk appetite. the euro hit an 11-week high against a broadly weak dollar on thursday as month-end demand for the single currency helped push it beyond a key barrier.market participants said some asian central banks were buying the euro, helping to push the dollar to a three-month low versus a currency basket. data showing a slide in germany's unemployment rate to 7.6 percent in july, adding to other recent upbeat data on europe's biggest economy, also helped to support the single currency. other analysts added that investors who had been wary of buying the euro before last week's bank stress test results had resumed picking up the single currency before the month ends, while position adjustments would also work in the euro's favour. analysts said ongoing optimism about second-quarter u.s. corporate earnings would add to the view of an improving global economy, which would support shares and keep euro demand intact. european stocks rose 0.5 percent in early trade. the dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 87.16 yen, and posted bigger losses against sterling , which hit a five-month high, and the australian and new zealand currencies. some in the market said that an announcement by california governor arnold schwarzenegger that the us state was in a state of emergency over its finances was another reason to dump the dollar as it highlighted fiscal problems in the country. the new zealand dollar rose 0.8 percent against the usd after the central bank raised interest rates by a quarter point although it warned further hikes could be more gradual.

university dorms
i am just ending my varsity life. i had some painful experience along with lots of happy and impressive events. the most painful experience of my university life is the state of our dormitories. i think after coming to university, every student needs motivation and facilities relating to studies. most of the students reside in dormitories. these dormitories are in very poor shape.
traffic issue
it seems that the traffic congestion is going to be a typical feature of urban life in dhaka city and it is getting worse day by day. the ever-increasing number of private cars is evidently responsible for this situation. on the other hand, with the upcoming ramadan, the invasion of unauthorized rickshaws has already started. in this situation, can we consider some of the following measures?

recognising our heroes
over the last few days this subject has been brought up by sir frank peters, and i believe his views must be seriously considered. climbing mount everest is one such achievement, accomplished by a self motivated bangladeshi climber musa ibrahim! giving him national recognition and award is the least that he deserves; and it has rightly been given to a real adventurous spirit, that he had really earned, without any official encouragement, backing or support!

it is very sad that almost every day innocent bangladeshis are killed by the bsf. according to statistics, about 38 people were killed by the bsf in the last six months.
rich and poor
i refer to the picture news published in the ds on 21st july, 2010. there it was said that prof yunus and the japanese prime minister had discussed application of the concept of the social business in japan and other countries. so far other countries are concerned, the idea may look good because the other countries like the third world ones are poorer. any good idea to help the poor in changing their lots for good would be a welcome proposition. but i am at a loss to understand what good it 'd bring to the japanese people who are already rich even by european standards. suggesting this idea to them, at least to me looks like carrying coal to new castle, a phrase we 'd learnt in our school days.
policemen murdered
the killing of three policemen in pabna is really shocking news for us. killing of law enforcers is a very serious matter, as people expect security from them. according to the reports, 29 law enforcers died this year. naturally, the question arises whether we are safe. local people claimed that they were killed by the members of the banned sarbohara party.
predictions
germany was defeated in the semi-final of the world cup, till then the performance of the german team was brilliant; the young players captivated the world with their agility.
politician and generals
on 21st. july i was a bit pleasantly surprised seeing sba's very well written article captioned "politicians and generals--". usually we know that our newspaper editors don't feel comfortable to publish these sorts of topics!!! sba is very correct in his observations. but i would like to add a bit that the bhuttos in pakistan were the civil faces of the military.
wanton violence
are we a violent people or a sick people? whenever there is something wrong people go wild and violent. please refer to the death of a garment worker from a rooftop fall at mirpur. does this constitute sufficient reason for the people to agitate and vandalize, destroying public and private property. what is the motive behind such agitation? who are responsible for all these agitations resulting in the loss of property worth millions?
harsh truth
the fact is that no single particle in the world can be defined as perfect, similarly, no single country can be modelled as perfect...so is our beloved motherland, bangladesh. the very last day i was in my business studies classes, my respected teacher said that a friend of his had narrated a story, where there was an eminent man from bangladesh visiting a hospital abroad with pain in his ear. the doctor affirmed that the tests he had done in bangladesh were perfectly alright and his very minor ear difficulty was not that serious. to this, the man began bellowing, that doctors in bangladesh are not reliable and not much qualified and trustworthy. after hearing this incident the doctor commented "believe me, bangladesh will never develop, because no single country can develop when people of its very own soil undermine it!”
foreign managers
it is noted with grave concern that more and more foreign management level staff is being recruited by different companies of bangladesh. the simple excuse is that competent manpower is not available in bd! have the companies put any ads in local newspapers? have the local available resources been tapped? it is pathetically negative.
minor illness, specialist doctors
a couple of weeks back, on a discussion of health matters, in the tv, our health minister and dr. prangopal dutta (bsmmu) were taking part. a questioner asked dr dutt, the reason why the top doctors give so little time to their patients. is it really possible to diagnose a patient in a couple of minutes?
transport sector
i have read with great interest the post-editorial of mr. shahnoor wahid appearing on tuesday in the daily star. his idea about underground transport system as a positive solution to the existing terrible dhaka traffic jam is a subject worth looking into. the fact is that it is a tested device in many countries, i do not find it as an absurd and unfeasible idea. certainly, the idea deserves to be taken up seriously. as regards his apprehension about the capability of a civil govt. which is always under stress and strain and often fails to implement any worthwhile project because of conflict of interest of various persons within the govt, i can not agree with him more. but i often fail to understand as to why an elected government with more than three-fourths majority members in parliament fails to appreciate a good idea and why the existing traffic problem and for that matter other affairs like energy problem or similar other issues cannot be tackled by the govt. if the author has meant that it is difficult or impossible for an elected civil govt. to solve its burning problems, it is really a pity. view the page international

taking opposition on board
the step taken by the al-led alliance government towards restoring the original constitution of bangladesh has created a sense of disappointment as both the major parties -- al and bnp -- are raising conflicting arguments on this issue.
sudden death, and gradual justice
it would be odd, and wholly unacceptable, if secularism were to be defined by the fate of a gangster in gujarat. at stake in the sohrabuddin sheikh case is not the religion of the individual, or his preferred means of sustenance [in this case, crime], but the rule of law.
world cup memories
the first world cup i saw, in quality footage, was the competition in britain in 1966, which was won by england defeating west germany, 4-2, in the final at wembly. i saw the film of this competition when i arrived in london towards the end of 1966 and in later years, videos of some individual games such as the final. i cannot say that i was particularly impressed with the skills of the english football team. geoff hurst, the west ham striker, who scored a hat trick in the final was hardly a top class player, nor were other members of the team, except for bobby charlton and their world class goal-keeper, gordon banks. i thought england were lucky to defeat the portuguese team in the semi-final, with eusebio, who was the star of the tournament, in top form.

the money game
less than a day after andres iniesta brought to a close a month-long festival of flag-waving with a thumping strike past maarten steklenburg, most hard-core football fans were already looking forward to the next season of club football.
gandhi and islam
