does titan support life?
of late, extra-terrestrial civilization has gained some importance both in the realms of science and fiction. according to hubble telescope's observation, there are at least 6.25 billion life-supporting solar systems out there! even the legendary theoretical physicist dr. stephen hawking has voiced the possibility of much advanced extra-terrestrial civilization somewhere in this universe. within our solar system there are indeed some strong candidates that scientists believe harbour alien life. these include mars, europa and now titan, saturn's largest moon. two very recent findings from nasa's cassini spacecraft, of which the details have been published in the journal icarus and the journal of geophysical research, have suggested the possibility of alien life-forms on titan. observations with the spacecrafts ion and neutral mass spectrometer and the probe's composite infrared spectrometer revealed that hydrogen, produced by uv-triggered chemical reactions in the planet's atmosphere, is flowing down titan's atmosphere and then disappearing at the surface. according to astro-biologist chris mckay at nasa ames research center, this could be a tantalizing hint that hydrogen is getting consumed by life. in his own words, “it's the obvious gas for life to consume on titan, similar to the way we consume oxygen on earth”. and at the same tim, another study investigating hydrocarbons on titan's surface found out with the aid of the probe's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (vims), that there is big shortage of acetylene, a chemical compound that could be consumed as food by life-forms that relies on liquid methane instead of liquid water to survive. according to dr. mckay, “if these signs turn out to be a sign of life, it would be doubly exciting because it would represent a second form of life independent from water-based life on earth”.

how did spectacles originate?
lenses are the key component of spectacles and were made even in ancient times. however, it is not known whether such lenses were used merely as ornaments or as visual aids. it was discovered around 1000 ad that a glass sphere, when placed on a surface, enlarged the contents of the surface beneath it. the first wearable eye glasses were made by an italian, salvino d'armate, in the 13th century ad. soon, they became quite popular with priests. while spectacles have undergone many design improvements since then, the credit for making spectacles with double-hinged side pieces is given to british designer james ayscough, who made them in 1752. in 1784, american inventor benjamin franklin made the first bifocals.
