once suchitra sen lived in pabna! the legendary 'first lady of bangla cinema' was living in pabna, bangladesh, before the partition. i came to know this from mr. shahnoor wahid's write-up in the art & entertainment page entitled 'discovering roma das gupta'. i became astonished and excited at the same time. then suchitra sen was roma das gupta. her father karunamoy das gupta was the sanitary inspector of pabna at that time.
farmers
farmers are the most neglected class in our society, whereas more than seventy percent people are engaged in agriculture. it is hard to believe that most of them are living below poverty line. we have celebrated our thirty-seventh independence day but do we ever think seriously about their needs? every government finishes the task just giving subsidy in the budget but they never did anything worthwhile that could bring some relief to the farmers.
khulna medical college
recently, i wrote a letter on medical education and now i feel my assumptions were very much right, after reading the news of present deplorable status of the khulna medical college. insufficient teaching staff as well as lack of adequate infrastructure and appropriate educational facilities are creating impediments in imparting proper medical education to the students, which are probably most common to all newly established medical colleges except dinajpur and bogra that got favourable treatment from the immediate past government.

bird flu
bird flu has stopped the wheel of our economy. our economy is now passing through a crucial moment. how can we handle the situation? it is a million dollar question. the government failed to understand this problem at a very early stage. now it has spread all over the country.
a bank for nrbs
should it be an existing bank or a new bank that is now the question. why? because a) vast numbers of nrbs are investing overseas through many different vehicles - from banking to real estate, from mutual funds to individual stock portfolios, from pension plans to retirement homes and much more. yet, due to the lack of an established and secure infrastructure in bangladesh this money is going to fill the monetary reserves of other countries. therefore, bangladesh is losing large amounts of foreign investments (foreign currencies); b) nrbs are no different from resident bangladeshis and they are not pbos (people of bangladeshi origin) who may think differently. how? consider that most nrbs left bangladesh when they were adults; therefore, their views regarding money management are similar to local bangladeshis'. confidence levels for small community banks (such as williamsburg savings bank) far exceed those for giant investment companies (like prudential bache securities). in fact, they also feel more comfortable investing with chase manhattan bank's investment banker over its parent company jp morgan chase, (a leading global financial services firm with assets of $1.6 trillion). this is probably one of the main reasons why local investment firms have had very limited success in bringing nrb investments to bangladesh. a bank in bangladesh established for the nrbs, of the nrbs and by the nrbs would go a long way in attracting many non-resident bangladeshis to invest in their homeland.
