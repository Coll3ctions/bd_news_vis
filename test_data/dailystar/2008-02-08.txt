how do i return home?
i am 75 and still work 8-10 hours every day. i commute by rickshaw from my rented flat in niketon to office in banani via mohakhali road. i do not have a car or even a mobile. for the last few months rickshaws have been banned from mohakhali road, so twice every day i am summarily ejected from my rickshaw by the dozens of cops on duty (have they nothing better to do?) and forced to walk the 1 km portion of mohakhali road like thousands of men, women, children, old, infirm, disabled, sick, students, small traders etc. etc. i manage somehow during the day but returning home after dark poses a problem. i have also undergone bye-pass operation. at that rush hour it is impossible to get a cng or taxi. even if i can, they refuse the short distance fare and laugh in the face of the policemen who interceded on my behalf once or twice.
nrb sermons
a well-publicised conference of non-resident bangladeshis (fancifully called nrbs) was held in dhaka last month with the expressed view of projecting the potentials of the nrbs in 'alleviating' the miseries of the lesser mortals who live in this country. in fact, almost every year, such conferences are organised in dhaka for nrbs in different formats. these routine meetings (or get-togethers) give the nrbs an opportunity to make holiday trips to this country in winter using tickets from conference organisers in the name of visiting bangladesh for participating in an international (?) conference. such visits also help them to enrich their curriculum vitae as well as meet their relatives/friends, and buy or sell properties here. lesser mortals or 'resident bangladeshis' do not need to object to all these until we hear the nrbs lecturing us in condescending tones on how we “should” live our lives. it is surely welcome if the nrbs come here with capital to invest in employment generating enterprises (like the united airways), but, certainly, we do not need any advice on floods or mass transit or urban congestion etc. nrbs please note that in bangladesh we have a large supply of resource persons who have more experience in development works than most of you. one nrb, participating in the recent conference, even had the temerity to demand that the expatriate bangladeshis holding foreign passports be allowed to head some of the development organisations and corporations of bangladesh as if the executives and academics of bangladesh are all nincompoops! it is unfortunate that the media did not see through the charade of the so-called nrb 'guest birds', who i presume have by now returned to their cozy homes gloating over a make-believe contentment that he/she has their bit for their motherland, which they had voluntarily left!

commuter's plight
a good system of communication was introduced for the commuters of the capital city. that was the introduction of ac bus services from uttara to motijheel. various types of buses were seen plying between different ends of the city and even to suburbs under the name of premium, nirapod etc. commuters of all classes used to go to different places comfortably and safely. for sometime i used to stay at uttara and visit different places in those buses. i saw lots of students studying in different institutions including medical college & engineering university travel in those buses . that system was serving so nicely that we used to feel like enjoying modern city life. middle class people, particularly female travellers having no personal transport, were benefited so much because they could travel at any time in those buses freely and safely. it got popularity among the middle class people, a major part of taxpayers. we expected that the system would be expanded and more such buses would be added to serve more areas, but to our utter surprise we found two major transport companies soon going out of the business.

national government: some thoughts
the change in the political landscape of the country, with the takeover by the present caretaker government, has given rise to the expectation of a national government. the proposal for a national government has met with mixed reactions from various political parties, and there seems to be considerable confusion with regard to the concept and the process of formation of a national government. there are also doubts about its effectiveness and stability, especially when the political system remains adversarial or parochial.

a great lawyer
syed ishtiaq ahmed (1932-2003) is best remembered by his admirers and jurists in bangladesh and the rest of south asia not only as a specialist in constitutional law but also as an eminent non-political activist who took special interest in trying to find a pragmatic solution to the existing problem of dysfunctional politics within our country. concerned about the prevailing "closed shop trade union" syndrome that afflicts most political parties in bangladesh, syed ishtiaq ahmed (a former attorney-general of bangladesh and an adviser to two successive caretaker governments) and a few others had the courage to try and find an effective method out of the madness. view the page environment
can the ocean slow global warming?
the ocean plays an important role in the climate system by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. it is generally accepted that more than 80 percent of anthropogenic co2 emissions will eventually be absorbed naturally by the oceans, primarily through a slow exchange between the atmosphere and the surface waters. this exchange process behaves like a clog in a sink's drain: drainage occurs too slowly to prevent a large build-up; in this case of co2 in the atmosphere. carbon dioxide entering the deep waters of the ocean is removed from interaction with the atmosphere for periods of hundreds of years. a significant fraction of the excess carbon dioxide released by man's activities enters the deep waters of the ocean and plays no further part in global warming over century timescales.
