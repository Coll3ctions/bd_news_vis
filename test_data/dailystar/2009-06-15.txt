begum zia's politics
begum khaleda zia should realise that she is standing on extremely soft ground. she led the most corrupt government in the history of bangladesh. all of her ministers were corrupt including her two sons. through the hawa bhavan, the bnp institutionalised corruption and other malpractices such as controlling postings and promotions of government service holders. her party patronized the rise of militancy in bangladesh such as harkatul jihad and bangla bhai with a view to eliminating political rivals. immediately after she took over power in 2001, she let loose violence against the minority community for voting for the al. she called back some diplomats sent abroad by the previous al government. there was large scale transfer and demotion of government service holders.
budget and tricky car business
every year even before the official announcement of our national budget, most people could sense what items would become costlier, thanks to the forecast by newspapers and electronic media. however, in this process some unscrupulous businessmen take the advantage of the pre-budget forecast and do brisk business depriving the government of due duty and tax. this year as well we came to know from the newspapers that the import duty on the motorised vehicles would go up in the upcoming budget and vehicles would become costlier, since the government is going to impose high tax on it. some dishonest car importers have already opened crores of dollars lcs on various banks to import new vehicles and some have already stocked a large number of reconditioned cars and selling them at high prices, thus depriving the government of tax. the question is how these car importers became sure that car prices would go up in the market even before the approval of the budget? how was it possible for them to get sure on this matter without a tip-off from the higher authorities? whatever might be the reason, the consequences of this will not bear any good result for the government or for the general people as a whole. on the one hand, the government and the nbr are going to lose thousands of crores of taka as revenue, and the general people are paying their hard earned money for buying these cars, falling prey to this tricky business by car importers and dealers.
money whitening
this year the government has again decided to give a chance to the black money holders to whiten their ill gotten money. it is a critical factor as far as our long-run economic sustainability and good governance are concerned. every year this process of money whitening is repeated by giving chance to the corrupt businessmen and people of various professions. it has taken a new shape when the government has decided to spare those persons if they invest their ill gotten money in certain productive sectors in our economy, subject to some conditions. but the question is whether it is a perennial process to be continued year after year or there will be an end to it. the authorities concerned should be aware of the fact that it's a kind of hidden motivation to those corrupt block of society as they go unpunished, depressing the honest businessmen and professionals. another aspect is that it is also inspiring people to get involved in the activities of the same kind to amass wealth illegally. though money whitening may be beneficial in the short-run for our economy by giving them a chance to enter into the formal sector, but in the long run, it will promote corruption, irregularities and havocs of various dimensions, paralysing the formal sector.
“dumb-slog” millionaires
the editorials and letters in your newspaper continue to lambaste the national cricket team for their poor performance in the world twenty20 cricket tournament, and rightly so. we need to ask the hard question why we (and at least two ill-advised ipl teams with deep pockets) have turned these reckless and thoughtless boys into millionaires. all they are good for are mindless slogging without any understanding of the game or any commitment to the team. and the dumb slogging at best gets the team a total of two fours and a six. one hears that they have "talent". hardly. there must be ten thousand teenagers in the country who can slog a ball out of the field. but what makes a true cricketer is mental toughness. that trait is sadly lacking in all the test stalwarts. that's why one of the most expensive ipl players melts down in the final over of the kolkata knight riders match, and becomes the most expensive bowler of the tournament! it is time to cut them off the millionaire gravy train and try something totally new. perhaps, psychological counselling could help.
