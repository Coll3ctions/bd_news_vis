garment industry in disarray
while shopping in the malls of england, i have often sorted through ranges of flawlessly designed clothes that flaunt on hangers with the tags 'made in bangladesh' sown onto them. whenever i wear these nicely fitted clothes it gives me a sense of great pride as i appreciate and respect the hard work that bangladeshi labourers put into making these high quality products which are not only popular in england but also several other western countries. however, at the same time i cannot help but feel a growing sense of dismay due to the unfair treatment that bangladeshi labourers have to live with.
hartal
hartal a hitherto democratic right like freedom of speech has already lost its appeal as it transcended beyond what democracy permits -- the spontaneous response to hartal call by keeping away from works and joining in protests against the grave wrongdoings/ failures, if any, of the government without taking resort to violence. but now the hartal callers give their activists the free rein to indulge in destructive activities to cower the public and this time in the evening before the hartal day the activists spread fear into the public mind by torching a number of vehicles and by terrorizing through coercive processions. during the last decade we have witnessed such enforcement of hartal to meet one party's end at the cost of human lives and properties. the present opposition leader begum zia and her gs were prompt to congratulate the countrymen for success of the hartal that took life of a promising young man and many others were injured and that damaged many private and public vehicles. what consolation do they have for the family of the deceased engineer of what gain did their hartal that took life of a promising engineer including many others injured and that damaged many private and public vehicles. what consolation do they have for the family of the deceased man or what gain did their hartal yield to them? she is awfully concerned about the well being and release of her sons (purpose of hartal had relation), but what about the mother whose son fell victim to the hartal? it only stirred and spurred the bnp activists and cadres and their leaders on to get the political atmosphere hot.

delayed decision!
the unb report on the matter published in all dailies on 19 july, about urgent import of pulses, edible oil, sugar and chick-pea is a delayed decision taken by the hon. prime minister. realistically, even with all urgency and speed, the minimum time needed from ordering to availability of these important ramadan food materials will be at least over two months, if not more! how can it reach buyers with ramadan in mid-august?
police excesses
“suffocating” seems to me the right word to explain how we are here in bangladesh now. bangladesh an “independent”, “sovereign”, “democratic” nation where everyone is supposed to have the free will to express their opinions, views and thoughts. however, the ground reality in the country now tells a totally different story. mainly due to the fact that major international news agencies are maintaining a 'strategic' silence about the current bangladeshi regime's human rights violations, people from outside of the country may not get the full picture of what is going on. we the insiders feel threatened to speak up! so the conscientious people of the world have few avenues to know about how we are in bangladesh.
smoking campaigners!
it was 15 july evening. i was moving from mirpur towards agargaon along rokeya sarani in my car. when i reached shewrapara, i saw 7-8 young men (age approx. ranging 20-30 years) gathering in front of 'shukria food', a food shop. all of these men were wearing green jersey marked with the word 'ovijaan'. i understood that they were campaigners of 'ovijaan', a nokia-banglalink (ovi internet) joint campaign. i noticed with extreme annoyance that every one of them was smoking, exhaling smoke rings in the air in different directions. it seemed to me that the motive of the campaign was to teach people how to smoke publicly!

session jam at nu
we cannot understand why session jam is prevailing in national university. national university is not the place of academic activities directly. students do not study on its campus. there is no student politics like other public universities. different public universities are often closed sine die due to unexpected clashes between rival student organisations. so exams and other academic activities are postponed for an indefinite period and session jam is created there.

a neglected ff
a few days back while i was staying at comilla circuit house, a news report published in a local paper named "comillar alo" drew my attention. it was news of the family members of freedom fighter kafil uddin. he was a up member of debiddar thana in 1971. he actively participated in the liberation war and was brutally killed by pakistan army along with his brother. his wife and two children were forced to leave debiddar, just after the independence, by his relatives just to occupy his property. kafiluddin's family neither got the recognition of a "shaheed paribar", nor got any support from any corner. for the last thirty-nine years they are leaving a miserable life. i met with the family out of curiosity.
stop patronising israel
we are of the opinion that israel is the only country in the world which practices dictatorship in the guise of democracy. the israeli dictatorship is worse than that of dictator adolf hitler of nazi germany.
public-private partnership
the parliamentary committee chief did express great dissatisfaction on meter readers of dhaka electricity distribution co. because of their unholy practices relating to meter reading, electricity bill making etc etc. similar is the situation with dhaka wasa meter readers cum revenue personnel. when the govt is preaching public-private partnership (ppp), the job of meter reading, bill making, bill serving and bill money collection may be given to large ngos, so that consumers are not harassed by electricity or wasa people. since those authorities do possess records of individual holdings of the past, the performances can be judged on digitally prepared records. in the context of accountability and transparency, let the present government do something in the name of corruption control as depicted in the js election pledge.
income tax
this is in reference to your star business report dated 9 july, 2010, regarding hon finance minister's explanation for the deduction of income tax on jatio sanchay patra. in his explanation he clarified the position that sanchay patra that matured before 1 july this year will not be applicable for income tax deduction. in this respect i would now like to draw the kind attention of the hon. finance minister through your column that the relevant quarters in practice are not abiding by what has been explained in the said star report in the absence of any directive issued to them. as a result, our sufferings know no bound. view the page international
