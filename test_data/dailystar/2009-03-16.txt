the dangers in and around skyscrapers
a study of six high-rise buildings in the capital by this newspaper has resulted in some disturbing findings. the bottom line is that these buildings (and one can be reasonably sure there are others as well) are dangerously exposed to disasters. these buildings are plagued either by a lack of fire-fighting equipment or trained manpower to operate whatever equipment is there. friday's fire incident at the basundhara city complex has only exposed the glaring gaps that characterise safety measures in skyscrapers or buildings that are regularly used by citizens.
stone extraction from underground
we are concerned at the unabated extraction of underground stones of various sizes with the help of machines despite a government ban. the extraction process has created large holes in some areas of jafflong and bholaganj, thereby completely altering the structure of earth below. according to environmentalists, for centuries boulders and small stones coming down with water from hills and mountains have been depositing underneath the top soil in the plain lands and in the riverbeds of bangladesh. over time these stones went deeper into the earth and became a part of the earth structure. therefore, extraction of the stones quickens the process of loosening of the earth deep below. it is therefore not surprising that environmental scientists and activists would express their fear that such distortion of nature might trigger a severe environmental disaster in the near future. we wonder what stops the authorities concerned from taking stern action against the violators of the law.
honeymoon about to be over?
three weeks on, the pilkhana carnage continues to be the staple of discourse in drawing rooms, the city's diplomatic cocktail circuit and across the country's formal or informal gatherings. in the meantime, the nation is suffering from nervousness and unease characterised by paranoid anxiety. throughout our existence as a nation, the breathtaking frequency of violence in the country would have us believe that we live on the top of a volcano, without knowing whether it will erupt. before we can adapt to one sad reality it is overtaken by another. barely out of the horror of the liberation war, we faced the ugly reality of the bangabandhu's assassination. the wound thus inflicted on the national psyche never healed. it rather festered, as the unfortunate tradition carried on.
does the pm deserve uncharitable remarks?

bashundhara fire

pm's speech
tragedy that has befallen people of bangladesh in the guise of a mutiny staged by some bdr jawans has pushed the nation into a chasm of grief, confusion and disbelief. a few days after the smooth handover of power to a political government and restoration of parliamentary democracy, this incident has given rise to many questions, some of which are legitimate, some far-fetched and some misleading. some questions that are coming up frequently from the opposition bench in parliament surround the general amnesty offered by the prime minister and the time that passed from the start of the mutiny to the surrender of the mutineers. a blame game started and it has disappointed many of those who hope for a united stand of our political leaders during a national crisis.
port city
the descendants of the portuguese are still to be seen in chittagong. most of them married local women and are known as kala firingis or matia (earth coloured) firingis. they are mostly roman catholic christians. during the british period they enjoyed certain privileges and were given preference in appointments in certain institutions like the port and the railway and in clerical posts in government offices. an area in the city known as firingi bazar is said to be named after them. the most significant contribution of the portuguese is the presence of many portuguese words in the bengali language which are in daily use till now. a few examples are - anaras (pineapple), pepe (papaya), padri (clergyman), fita (ribbon), alpin (pin), botam (button), chabi (key) etc.

a good book

soul searching
i'd been a coward… i kept thinking what would people say. what would my friends say? what if they don't agree with me. now, its high time i voice it out, if i don't write now, if i don't voice it now, may be it's not worth being flesh and blood. may be i'll lead a life of something i despise the most, a jellyfish--a creature with no spine.
tall building on fire
spending the afternoon watching the shocking live footage of yet another tragedy befalling us, i can only wonder what the enquiries will conclude, and what comes next?
hopes dashed
it just seems a split second ago our country was on the brink of a radical change. the ambience was of great optimism. and the wind of change was blowing which generated a fervent aspiration. now, barely three months have passed, and it's all chaotic. the government has plunged into a tumultuous situation which promises no end. after listening to all the biased and unbiased comments of numerous people nationwide, a question triggers one's thoughts. was it their fault? we are in the midst of an atrocious and wicked world where people are killing their brothers. the cause behind this hazardous situation is one simple thinganimosity. in adverse circumstances, we human beings are so carried away by our anger that we tend to transgress the regulations of plain rationality.
punish the oppressors
the other day my friend binod mangsang was reading a bangla newspaper. at one stage he got stuck up at a heading, it read “amar meyeke bachan, baba” (save my daughter ). i became curious at that and went through the report . to my utter dismay, i came to know that a woman named champa khatun had been barbarously tortured by her husband's family.
media coverage
the media is the main outlet through which people receive information. with the passage of time, getting news from every corner of the world has become easy. the electronic media is showing us what is happening throughout the world within a very short period of time. the media defeats autocracy and conquers humanity! it destroys root of injustice. while the media is to be used for serving humanity, we sometimes feel that in some cases it remains silent.
spring and our miseries
with the advent of spring, we have to face a myriad of problems in our day-to-day life. in other words, we are hard put because of the scarcity of water, to speak nothing about the other problems that continue to plague urban life. as we wake up in the morning, and turn on the tap, we find that there is no water. sometimes several drops of water trickle down, augmenting our vexation.
let's change
the other day i was travelling in a bus on my way back home from agrabad to gec circle. the bus was horribly jam-packed as there wasn't any tiny space left. at that moment, a young woman was struggling to keep balance as the people were rushing inside the bus to have a better position. i was surprised to see none around the woman showing any kind of respect for her. so, i decided to give my own seat to her. but to my utter surprise a burst of laugher came out from my right side where a group of young people were sitting and exchanging dirty jokes with each other. i was puzzled for a while as though i had committed a sin by giving my seat to that woman. view the page international
