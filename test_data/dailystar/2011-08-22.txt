seven years on . . .
the grenade attacks which took the lives of twenty four people at an awami league rally on august 21, 2004 remains a festering sore on the conscience of the nation. that is because seven years after the grisly attacks the process of crime and punishment is yet to run its course. in any civilised society, it would be the task of government to quickly go into a handling of such a crime, nab the culprits, bring them to trial and thereby restore public confidence in the rule of law. it might sound like a cliché, but it must be noted with deep regret that the government in office at the time of the explosions unconscionably failed to rise to the challenge of handling the crisis. worse, with subsequent allegations coming in of powerful individuals being involved in the crime and of a search for scapegoats getting underway, people's hopes for an unearthing of facts was rudely dashed.

market week for farmers
in the united states 'national farmers market week' was observed from august 7 to august 13. the national farmers' market week is officially designated by the united states department of agriculture (usda) with a view to encourage consumers to visit their local farmers' market, to purchase locally grown fruits and vegetables and to support economic viability of the farmers.i think, bangladesh being an agricultural country with economy largely based no farming, we can also organize such farmers' market week by setting temporary markets near the upazila/district railway and bus stations and other suitable places to help and encourage our farmers to sell their agricultural produces directly to the consumers in prices reasonable to both growers and buyers. such market weeks may be observed during the main harvesting period of different crops. this will help not only in establishing direct communication between the farmers and the consumers but will also enable the farmers to sell their produces directly to the consumers at a fair price.would the ministry of agriculture please give a thought over the matter?

goodbye hero!
in bangladesh we rarely call someone a hero as the number is very few but when it comes to tareque masud, he was, is and will be the ace of all heroes! his lofty ambitions resulting in films like 'matir moyna' made him receive nine international awards and as far as i know he was the first bangladeshi in oscar competition. he brought glory to our country but still we could not save him. i participated in one of his classes while i was in a film making workshop in dhaka and there he described what struggle he had to do with 'matir moyna'. thanks to conspiracy, he screened it in many countries but could not show it to the people outside dhaka. i realized that tareque masud did not take filmmaking as a profession but as his life and so he wanted everyone to call him 'feriwala' of films. we don't want to see any more deaths like this…we don't want to lose any more heroes.
an irreparable loss
every loss does not restore. this loss is one of them. alas, we have killed two great sons of our country- tareque masud and mishuk munier! yes, it was a pre-planned murder, as we have given them poorly designed highways, unlicensed and traffic rule-ignorant drivers,irresponsible and corrupt authorities who prefer to remain indifferent to all these problems. they were performing the holy duty of serving our country with their own brilliance, but in return we have awarded them death.
