they are killing our tigers
i was watching a programme named “jole jongole” on atn recently. the programme showed the evil activities of wildlife trust of bangladesh (wtb). i was shocked to know that this organization is killing our tigers in the name of saving or preserving them. they are doing the same evil experiments again and again by injecting them the wrong tranquilizer named "tenazol" which is dangerous for tigers. they knew very well that the tigers could be killed because of that injection, but they still applied it on them. they also put radio collar around their neck. two tigers died because of wearing this radio collar. it turned out that this organisation and the man adam who runs it are doing harmful experiments with our tigers. i urge the government to do something about it. we don't want foreigners to come here and kill our tigers.
amendments and expectations
in 1975- 4th amendment, in 1979 -5th amendment and in 1982- 7th amendment, all those amendments were the blazing indications for us that the government should not pass any sort of amendment which is not recommended by the main opposition party as well as the majority people of the country.
why should we pay tax?
it is a matter of great concern that even after paying tax, levies and tariffs on individual income, food items and other imported goods, there is no gratifying facilities even in the urban areas. it is true that a financially healthy government exchequer is essential in this regard, which can be made through proper collection of taxes, levies and tariffs. from a news report it has been known that the government's revenue generation through the collection of taxes, levies and tariffs has substantially increased in recent years, and despite the fact we don't see enough initiatives to repair the city roads. even in dry season we see damaged and potholed roads in some areas, let alone the condition of roads during rainy season. for instance, the roads of nikunja-2 residential area under khilkhet police station are damaged severely because no repair work has been done for many days. almost all the roads are in bad shape and causing daily sufferings to the residents. we drew the attention of the authorities to this issue many times but they turned a blind eye towards the problem. our appeal to the government-- either stop imposing tax on us or ensure public amenities.

a good decision
from a daily newspaper i came to know that mamata banerjee, the chief minister of west bengal, is going to introduce an extraordinary system for the people of kolkata as well as west bengal. traffic jam is grabbing the city which has increased people's sufferings. to mitigate people's sufferings, mamata banerjee decided to air the national anthem of india in every traffic signal point whenever the red light is on. this is really a good move. on the other hand, bangladesh has also been facing the same problem for long. why is our government not thinking like that?
scrapping ctg: a fatal mistake
majority in parliament is essential for smooth functioning of a government but absolute majority blinds the govt. absolutely. by doing away with the caretaker government (ctg) system the al government has proved this truth again. they have scrapped the ctg with the excuse of implementing the apex court's verdict. but they did not follow the advice of the apex court which said the next two elections could be held under ctg, for the sake of peace and public interests.
manmohan's anxieties over bangladesh
the anxieties expressed by the indian pm dr. manmohan singh are more than unusual. his suspicion may be based on intelligence report but the premises on which the prediction is deduced are not totally reliable. the arrow of suspicion thrown toward jamaat-e- islami is reasonably targeted. all the top leaders of jamaat are in custody facing war crime trials.
punish the rapist
while watching an episode of mina cartoon on tv the other day, i was reading some reports in various bengali dailies including prothom alo about the rape of a schoolgirl of viqarunnissa noon school & college by porimol joydhor, a teacher of the same school. the subject matter of mina cartoon was that we must give school education to female children right in their childhood. but the rape of a student of the most reputed school in bangladesh by a tainted person in disguise of a teacher is a satire to the mina cartoon. as a conscious citizen, i demand exemplary punishment of the rapist.
whose fault?
the sufferings of two female passengers in abu dhabi while flying etihad airways was well covered in bangladesh media. i am not trying to shift blame from those who are responsible, but in the matter of stamping of documents, the airline staff has no involvement and no power. such stamping are done by airport security staff who are non commercial government agencies (normally police), so it would be simplistic to argue that as it was the duty of the airline staff to stamp the boarding card which they had failed to do, they should take the card back and get it stamped to eliminate the queuing problem. the airline is a commercial firm and its staff tends to commercialize matters such as issuing of tickets and boarding passes but they cannot influence or carry out any security procedure. most of these checks and stamps are anti-terrorist measures and flying through indian airports i have felt that the number of checks and stampings (of all baggage tags and boarding passes) are most disconcerting.
no hartal please
hartal is considered as a democratic way for achieving any right putting a government in pressure, and there was considerable success in the past. nowadays the environment is totally different; open negotiation is possible to settle an issue and because of the strong stand of media there is no reason to fear any unfair play. every party in opposition always calls hartal. did they ever take into account the sentiment of masses about hartal? did any party count the losses caused by hartals? we request our leaders to go to the parliament and solve the issues through dialogue.
