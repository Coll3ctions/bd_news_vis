an aladdin tale
the yells were issuing out in unbroken waves. as were the screams. and, then, they subsided, almost simultaneously. and we looked at each other. the terrified yells had emanated from me; the high-pitched screams from the woman i was married to at that time. the year was 1977, and we had been united in wedlock for a couple of months or so. that the “united” unraveled into disintegration a few years later is another story, and will not be related here. but, then, life was a kaleidoscope of colours, everything was right with the world, and, what, we worry? certainly there was no call for a simultaneous cacophony of yelling and screaming. but we did, and, thereby hangs this tale.

bush: facing failure in iraq
what does bush, the sole superpower's boss, do when failure in iraq stares him starkly in the face?
environmental insecurity
bangladesh has an approximate population of 3 million in a landmass extending over 150,000 square kilometer and is probably the most populous country in the world. our economy is on down hill slide and poverty is on upswing as growth rate of gdp is lower than the actual growth rate of population resulting in a low level equilibrium trap. the resource we have is not only inadequate but also fast depleting. a greater percentage of our people live off the land and thus cause degradation of land, fresh water and marine resources. to top it all, our strides for development have paradoxically affected environments because of extensive use of fertilizers, undisrupted exploitation of nature and production of biogas. the cumulative impact of human activities of the nature mentioned above has caused among others: deforestation, topsoil erosion, acidification, depletion of ozone layer and loss of biological diversity. one apprehends that the “situation has become more pronounced with the onset of global climate change and environmentally induced conflicts are likely to intensify". environmental degradation of such magnitude threatens human sustainability. the plants regenerative capacity is increasingly being taxed to limits. deforestation, soil erosion, desertification, over exploitation and pollution of water resources undermine a few essential factors of human sustainability which are: the natural support system, reduced natural capacity of water and increase in the competition for normally renewable yet scarce resources. in bangladesh, expanding human population is outstripping the carrying capacity of the local resource base. “environmental degradation and resource depletion are triggering internal conflict and is likely to assume an ugly face as climate change is likely to exacerbate the situation”. therefore, the “task of strengthening the social, economic and environmental security of our people is as challenging as it is imperative.” new security assumptions will be necessary to combat this appalling situation. to guard against breakdown of stability and distortion of social fabric, a new policy-“one focused on human security must take into account a complex web of social, economic and environmental factors”.
us led joint naval exercise in the bay of bengal: a gunboat diplomacy
we can recall our history when u.s. navy's seventh fleet came to the bay of bengal in 1971 to defeat the liberation war of bangladesh. it was the time when this fleet tried to intimidate india as it fought pakistan along with bangladeshi freedom fighter in a war that led to bangladesh's birth. it was the period when indian foreign policy upheld the principles of non align movement and followed the path towards self-reliance. but now, the scenario has been changed.
china and the indo-us nuclear deal
after over two years of intense negotiations, the civilian nuclear agreement between india and the us stands today, on the cusp of full operationalization. no matter the current domestic turmoil over the deal in india, the chinese are clearly aware that more than a contribution of about five per cent to india's overall energy requirements that nuclear energy will provide in the next two decades, it is the larger political, economic and strategic implications of the deal that they will need to take into account. the malabar naval exercises that new delhi has gone ahead with despite the ongoing political uncertainty are a case in point. the chinese realize that whether or not the indo-us nuclear agreement goes through, india has served notice that it is becoming increasingly cognizant of and capable of leveraging its strengths to achieve its interests. just as important, india has in the process displayed acumen for bare-knuckled negotiations and a skilful use of domestic policy levers in the us. a people's daily (14 august 2007) commentary, concluded that "the us has made big concessions and met almost all indian requests" and that "a substantial change has taken place in the nature of indian-us relations despite possible turns and twists in future." it did not hesitate to accuse the us of "double standards" and agreed with the indian left parties saying that it was the american intention to draw "india in as a tool" for achieving its global strategic aims. the article finally referred to india's "practical political considerations" and rested its hopes on "india's dna" that would not allow it to play second fiddle to the us.and if the deal does somehow get through india's political maelstrom, then the onus shifts to the nuclear suppliers' group (nsg) where it needs to be seen how china will react. off-hand, the impression is that the chinese are not happy about the deal, as indeed they well might not be, but to take the argument one step further and to say that they are implacably opposed to it, is a bit presumptuous. the people's daily (30 august 2007) editorial titled "nuclear agreement and big power's dream" has been variously interpreted by the indian media but its main thrust is simple enough. the piece has noted that india was "extremely short of energy" and that civilian nuclear power development would help india to deal with its power shortages and allow for steady economic development. meanwhile a majority of indians appeared to support the deal and stood behind prime minister manmohan singh who "did not compromise" despite the left threat of withdrawal of support to the government. by pointing out india's desire to be "a powerful nation" and the "strong symbolic significance" of the nuclear deal, the article has also acknowledged india's legitimate aspirations. however, there are also notes of worry in the chinese commentary. given india's desire "to become a big power," the us wish to incorporate india in its attempt to "balance the forces of asia," is something, the editorial says, "fits in exactly with india's wishes." this last section has been interpreted to indicate chinese opposition to the deal. nevertheless, the manner in which recent chinese comments have been phrased, whether in the media or in foreign ministry statements, remind the observer of china's own rationale behind developing its nuclear program and probably give an idea of how it will proceed in its reactions to the indo-us deal. first, it is suggested - perhaps to domestic hardliners - that with needs that are similar to china's, india cannot be faulted when it adopts methods similar to what china has adopted. india is doing what it thinks is best in its national interests and this is something that the chinese understand. second, the chinese seem to realize that they have nothing to gain from opposing the deal at the nsg but everything to gain in goodwill and perhaps economic bounty in the form of expanding their own civilian nuclear cooperation with other countries not least with india and the us. china has for some two years now been offering to cooperate in the civilian nuclear energy sector with india; hu jintao repeated the offer during his visit in november 2006. china already has ties with the us in this sector - in july this year, it signed a multi-billion dollar contract with westinghouse for building four third-generation nuclear reactors - but seeks further relaxation of american restrictions on high-technology transfers. were china to cooperate at the nsg, it could result in what it is fond of calling 'win-win,' all around. third, a positive response to the deal also allows china an increased range of responses vis-a-vis the us on north korea, iran and pakistan. thus, plans for increased chinese nuclear cooperation with pakistan cannot necessarily draw the condemnation of either new delhi or washington unless they appear to be explicitly vitiating the peace. however, the chinese are perhaps not unaware that while they might continue supporting pakistan's nuclear program, it is just as likely that india could also soon be closely engaged in nuclear cooperation with japan. the question therefore is, if china and india will simply let things take their 'natural' course or take the bold steps necessary to ensure that the balance of forces in asia changes to mutual advantage. view the page star books review
tales shaped through stirring times
mohammad anisur rahman's memoirs, for these two volumes are what they essentially are, need to be read for the sheer spontaneity they come wrapped in. the economist, who has been part of the political history of bangladesh, especially in its early, formative phases, has consistently aroused curiosity about the role he has played in the shaping of his career as also the forging of new economic policies for a country born of war. he might have been expected to come forth, all these years after he helped shape events, with a tome laden with the kind of didacticism, even sermonising, that important men generally are tempted into producing. that rahman has stayed away from succumbing to conventional temptation is encouraging. his uninhibited narration of the events that went into the making of his life and career is therefore the instrument which makes these volumes rather gripping.
a protest or a sense of humour?
radha will not cook today is the english translation of arandhan. reading the short story, with lyrical intermissions, was beautiful indeed. however, the perception of the reader takes a restless turn in search of the connection between the title of the story and the narration that follows.
what tourism does for a community
tourism has always seemed to be a blessing to the community since prehistoric times when primitive man started to move away from his usual habitat, often to great distances, in search of necessities such as food, shelter and clothing. in a word, tourism has stood beside the poor community. with the passage of years, tourism has won over the world and the world in turn has won over tourism. present-day tourism is very theoretical. these days it is a subject of research and higher studies. nothing is left out of the close grip of tourism.
poems in delighted eyes
i had read a few columns and a couple of poems by arunabh sarkar before i came across this slim volume of poems a few weeks back. arunabh was working at the independent when i started writing for that newspaper, but i never met him at that time. it was only in march 2006 when i joined the news today that i met arunabh as my colleague for the first time. and it was the poet himself who presented me with a copy of narira fere naa which is his third volume of poetry. he has published only nine books in the past thirty years, with three volumes of poetry, one on journalism and five books for children. he has, however, written many works of fiction and poems, essays and columns since his days of youth in daily newspapers and periodicals.
