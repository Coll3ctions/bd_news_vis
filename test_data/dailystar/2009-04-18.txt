palestinians are non-entities everywhere
on 11 august 2008, peter clark writes in a guardian obituary that as a poet, author, and politician, mahmoud darwish 'did as much as anyone to forge a palestinian national consciousness.' while clark's comment is undebatable, it is also true that darwish's poetry transcends its national boundary by reflecting on universal humane values through the mirror of the palestinian experience. it is one of the major reasons why darwish now is a great name in world literature. memory for forgetfulness is his exquisitely written prose-memoir. ibrahim muhawi's adept translation brings out the delicacy of the piece. it is based on israel's invasion of lebanon in 1982 that was aimed at wiping out the plo's base from southern lebanon. the fact seems most startling when one reads the memoir containing evocative details of beirut under siege. darwish, however, lifts up the sufferings of the invasion to an aesthetic level through his musings on reality, belonging, history, resistance and the role of art involving these. the entire book is an extended internal monologue (the poet's thoughts in his mind) about which robyn creswell writes in harper magazine's january 2009 issue:
