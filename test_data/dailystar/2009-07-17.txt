bnp's dithering on commitment unfortunate
as the deadline draws close for political parties to submit their amended, ratified constitutions to the election commission, questions have cropped up about the inability of some parties to comply with the ec's instructions vis-à-vis the deadline for amending and ratifying their constitutions by july 25. the awami league has gone for a council meeting on july 24 to ratify the changes in its constitution before meeting the ec deadline. we understand that some other parties are also on track to meet the deadline. but what is certainly galling for the nation are the delaying tactics employed by the opposition bangladesh nationalist party regarding bringing about changes to its own constitution. of course, there can be no denying the fact that problems within the party have detracted it from holding a council meeting to ratify the changes in its constitution. but that cannot logically explain away the bnp's negative attitude towards standing by a commitment it has already made. prior to the december 2008 elections, the party along with other parties pledged to go through a democratization of its constitution within six months of the polls.
child labour in extremely hazardous circumstances
the more we hear of a malady or scourge, our sensibilities about it tend to dull. there comes a point when we might feel resigned to its recurrence. that may be the case with newspaper readers, radio listeners and tv watchers. but when the authorities whose responsibility it is to contain or eliminate the malaise should themselves show an attitude of resignation that can hardly be condoned.

no tree, no life
it is a matter of great regret that recently in our coastal area, shitakunda, trees were destroyed unnecessarily. without trees our existence will be threatened, and the tree is the great friend of humans. trees control the environment to be in a balanced form by preserving humidity in the climate. plants make the land fertile and cultivable.
recession and unemployment
the world has been experiencing a severe economic depression in the first decade of this century long after its appearance during the third decade of the last century. most of the nations are now paying the price. from that context, bangladesh is no exception as it is the victim of on-going global recession which, undoubtedly, is the result of western materialistic lifestyle and can be considered the major factor for unemployment problem throughout the country.
bsmrau
since its birth in 1983, the institute of post graduate studies in agriculture (ipsa) flourished as one of the truly potential academic institutions with its academic excellence within the shortest possible time. however, it turned into a fully-fledged university with the name of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman agricultural university (bsmrau) in 1998 with its true potential and the growing demand of higher study in agriculture. currently, bsmrau has been running with three faculties and twenty departments in light of some characteristic features which were missing and are still missing in many of the public universities in bangladesh. what is very special about this university is confirmation of the superior accomplishment of the academic tenure of the student in due course of time: no session jam even for a day. the second important feature of this university is everybody appreciates that there is no campus violence here. thirdly, the campus is totally neat and clean, there is no hand writing on the wall or anywhere else.
apartments and earthquake
in case of high-rise buildings not only the foundation, the ground floor must be made sufficiently strong, so that they can withstand the pressure in times of earthquake. i believe developers follow the design properly in foundation. but in ground floor maximum buildings are standing on some columns only as rajuk does not permit building apartments on ground floor which is to be used for car parking. in engineering terms, this type of ground floor is called soft-storey. but thinking about the earthquake and other disasters, the ground floor should be made stronger and we can do it if we make apartments on ground floor. the empty ground floor is really risky.
defaulters and finance minister
the finance minister is reported to have declared that "whatever powerful one defaulter may be" he will catch hold of him and recover loan money. in the past we heard similar vows from his predecessors but none succeeded. the reason for all fms' failures in the past, was not the defaulters alone, it was system of recovery, the banks' own faults and the government's faulty initiatives with absence of dynamism.
chinese restaurants
i was rather amused to read mr. kutubi's letter dated july 12, 2009 under the above-mentioned heading. my family has frequented chinese restaurants for many, many years and in all these years we have yet to find anything even remotely resembling the writer's description! of course i can only speak about the restaurants of dhaka city, not those of chittagong city. almost all these places are well lit, not dark as pointed out in the letter. some are expensive though, others are not so expensive, but all of them serve fairly good and tasty food combined with excellent and courteous service. the clientele are decent people belonging to the upper economic strata. one can spend a very enjoyable evening there with one's family for rest and relaxation.
transport problem
only a few private universities have their own campus. north south university recently shifted its own building to bashundhara residential area. at present, there are 6,000(six thousand) students studying in the university. the nsu campus is a few kilometres away from the main city. it takes two hours and sometimes even more to reach the campus. it's a great loss of valuable time.
corporate social responsibility
quite a large number of proprietor/partnership firms, private/public limited companies earn huge amount of profit at the end of each account-year. in many cases, large chunk of these profits goes undisclosed and remains outside the tax-net.
landslides
landslides are a natural phenomenon, but it is accelerated by human action. it is now a great concern in south-eastern parts of bangladesh like sylhet, moulvi bazar, habigang, chittagong and cht. it can be defined as the downward movement of a large mass of earth or rocks from a hill or mountain due to natural variability and human activity. landslide is not a new theme in the context of chittagong. during the last three decades, chittagong suffered about 12 landslides. death toll during the last three decades is around 200.
six months of al rule
in the backdrop of an uneasy two-year rule of caretaker government and subsequent landslide victory, the al has passed its first six months in power. so far there is no major failing in any sector but we can't say that they could initiate the jump start people expected. the whole administration is in sluggish hibernation and inept ministers failed to tune up the left over government machinery of the bnp-jamaat regime. the situation is comparable to the post liberation days. the bcl and field level al leaders are running for petty cash in local tender and toll collections in the absence of organisational control. the bnp-jamaat installed/owned electronic and print media are magnifying the shortcomings while microphone loving ministers and leaders are making immature and unnecessary comments inviting controversies. anybody is talking about anything at anytime.
power crisis
we all have welcomed the new time introduced by the government to save electricity. the government is trying its level best to meet the electricity demand of the country. as citizens, we also have to try from our level to help the government solve the crisis. teachers at schools, colleges and universities can instruct students to turn off the unwanted lights and fans; employers and employees at offices can ask each other to do the same; parents at home can teach their children and vice-versa not to waste electricity or natural gas. in short, every citizen has to make a habit of “waste not, want not”.
industrial police
