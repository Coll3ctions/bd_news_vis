govt living inside a cocoon!
prime minister sheikh hasina had addressed the nation on january 6, 2010 after completion of two years of her government. in her speech she pointed out the government's successes. she claimed that law and order was better after her government had taken a tough stance against crime and corruption. her observation was so preposterous that we were taken aback at that time. since then one year has passed. meanwhile, criminal activities have gone up. the prime minister and the home minister do not even acknowledge that criminal incidents are happening. home minister sahara khatun has said that law and order is better than ever before. how could she say such a thing when every day numerous incidents of robbery, looting, mugging, killing, abduction, rape, and arson are taking place, which are being reported in the print and electronic media.
bsf's brutality and lgrd minister's indifference
the recent circulation of a video footage, which showed a bangladeshi being stripped, kicked and beaten by the bsf of india, aired by indian tv channels, has sparked criticism across the country and abroad. at the same time, we have felt embarrassed at the speech delivered by lgrd minister syed ashraful islam who said that the government is not "much worried" about the recent incident of physical abuse on a bangladeshi citizen by bsf. while national human rights commission of india has served a notice to the country's home ministry seeking a report on the bsf jawans who were videotaped in the act of assaulting a bangladeshi youth, such insensitive remark from our minister is totally unacceptable. despite repeated assurances from indian authorities that bsf has been instructed to maintain the highest restraint while dealing with smugglers active at the border, such barbaric incidents are continuing unabated. it has to be kept in mind that the government is the a guardian of a country. it cannot ignore what is happening at the border. according to the newspapers, a number of lawmakers of parliament on january 24 have criticised the foreign ministry over its failure to address the issues for the sake of maintaining peace at the border.
age catching up with tendulkar?

choosing the right friends
friends play an important role in the life of every man. the young ones socialize with their peers and are greatly influenced by them. a good friend can be a source of inspiration and encouragement and a helping hand in the time of need. but very unfortunately, we have witnessed some tragic incidents in recent times where a person intentionally became the cause of harm for his friend. the greed for money and material possession ripped apart the ties of supposed friendship and prompted one to threaten, hurt or even murder the other. a true friend would never even think of such hideous acts.

'institutional support essential for scientific innovation'
professor quamrul haider, a bangladesh-born nuclear physicist and chair of the physics department at fordham university, new york has carved out his name in nuclear physics by opening up a new horizon in the field. he, along with dr. lon-chang liu, had predicted the existence of a new form of nuclear matter known as "eta-mesic nucleus" long ago. their prediction was confirmed in 2008 through a complex scientific experiment done in germany. in a time when research and innovation in pure and applied sciences have come to a veritable halt in bangladesh, bangladeshi scientists living abroad are making their marks in various fields. prof. haider believes that bangladeshi students, teachers and scientists are meritorious enough to compete with their counterparts in any other country in the world, but they lack proper government funding and institutional incentives. rifat munim of the daily star engaged prof. haider in talks about his scientific work and how to overcome the problems faced by bangladeshi researchers. excerpts:
