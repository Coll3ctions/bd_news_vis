chemical picture of a bacteria
for the first time, scientists have been able to paint a detailed chemical picture of how a particular strain of bacteria has evolved to become resistant to antibiotics. the research is a key step toward designing compounds to prevent infections by recently evolved, drug-resistant "superbugs" that often are found in hospitals, as well as in the general population.
testing blood type made easier
it would be, rather, a rare instance to find people not knowing their height or weight; but not knowing the blood type is a common phenomenon. be it for the health insurance card or the driver's license, many a times we fail to provide our blood type either because we forgot the type or we never knew it. blood typing is one of the most vital medical tests, yet many of us are unaware of our blood type and ignorant of the dire consequences this could lead to. conventional blood typing methods are time-consuming, not on-the-spot and require the use of sophisticated instruments that are unavailable in many less developed countries. in scenarios, like a blood transfusion or an organ transplant, where knowing the blood becomes extremely crucial, an instantaneous test is certainly a remedy. at monash university, australia, dr. mohidus khan*, a young bangladeshi researcher, and his team developed the first ever paper diagnostics to determine blood type, that costs only a few cents and is as simple as placing a droplet of blood onto the paper strip, revealing the blood type in a minute or two.
