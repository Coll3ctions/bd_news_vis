hartal signals a return to destructive politics
begum khaleda zia has given out a call for a hartal on 27 june. it is a decision at once regrettable and with implications for the future. we have argued, consistently since our inception, that hartals are the worst manifestation of politics gone awry. now that hartals are back, thanks to the bnp, we can only say that destructive politics we thought was in the past is now back in full flow. it is a sign of political bankruptcy on the part of the bnp and only points to the thought that the party has nothing substantive to offer in terms of democratic politics. reportedly, some senior bnp leaders had sounded a discordant note on the hartal option but were apparently ignored by the party chief. be that as it may, the fact that the call for hartal has come from an individual who has been prime minister on more than one occasion not only surprises the nation but also leaves it bewildered.

chemicals in foods!
the government shouldn't let this criminal activity of poisoning foods go on unabated and with impunity. it is the most horrible crime against humanity. it is incumbent on the government to act swiftly and save the nation. legal safeguards must be in place to protect the citizens from the deadly fruits. steps should be taken by deploying special forces, installing devices, to check the items sold and bring transparency so that consumers cannot be cheated and will have full and clear information about the items they purchase. stern and exemplary punishments should be meted out to the culprits. the government should not take this lightly for the consequences are well known, and especially for the younger generation it can have horrifying implications. it should be stopped now and at any cost as the effect is far-reaching and irreversible. it is a scary scenario. not that we didn't know about it but with every passing day it is sinking in deeper and deeper. it is also taking on serious proportions. it is getting more and more alarming as days go by.
our responsibility
wouldn't it be frightening if the ozone layer was destroyed and the earth vanished from the solar system, if the rivers were unclean and it wouldn't provide us with water and life-sustaining harvest, if the air didn't give us enough clean oxygen to talk, laugh, and most importantly, survive? believe it or not, our actions may improvise these consequences. we have forgotten that the earth is the most unique planet in the entire universe. its beauty can't be described in words. but are we showing appreciation of it?
is it freedom?
it is time to discuss about the visible or invisible powers that control us from near or distance. but am i too independent to expose them? i think i am not. we are not independent truly. we are still controlled by the developed world. and it is not an unknown or unusual matter for a developing country like ours. we have to obey them because we get financial help from them. so, it is our duty to be dependent. but why are we doing this?
altruism
how far we follow the teachings of our dearest nabi and rasul muhammad (pbuh) is open to question. the greatest rasul (pbuh) taught his followers to be caring about needs and happiness of others.
black and white money
we are really sorry to question the motive of a few journalist cum talk show hosts when they show total apathy to go into the fact finding mission on a national issue like black money. the current topic of black and white money is handled in such a way in the media that a grey area is established, doing irreparable damage to the nation and its democratic march. there is a proverb that "when money is lost, something is lost, but when character is lost everything is lost.” i would simply ask these journalist friends to kindly not to undermine the wisdom of the people and push the nation to darkness. therefore, the current issue is nothing but a case of total moral corruption if measured by any standard of the civilized and democratic countries we talk about so frequently in the media. the present effort of the sg of a party and the tax lawyer is nothing but to encourage turning the truth into falsehood. hopefully, the media will not join it.
powerless!
a heat wave is sweeping across the country. on other hand, power crisis has become a part & parcel of day to day life. the children and elderly people are the worst sufferers.
congratulations!!
rushanara ali has been elected to the house of commons in england . this is great news for all bangladeshis all over the world. she has another identity. she is an oxford graduate. moreover, she is the 5th asian to get such a position. being a woman of 35 years, she has made history. her victory would definitely give a new dimension to our nation.
robbers warning others!
a report from barisal was published in the front page of a local english daily on 13 may. it depicted the height of double standards and deceit. it is very much like a comedy act; where an experienced 'robber' is now warning bureaucrats that they will face jail for contracts of power plants without tender!
godfathers
in our country, the culture of political patronage by godfathers is a great hindrance to the progress of balanced politics. when criminals are caught red handed from the spot of crime, the godfathers get into trouble. they face a catch-22 like situation. so, they try to organise some kind of lobbying to free the criminals.
abusing internet
though we don't have wider access to internet like other developed nations but it is alarming that a large portion of internet users of our country are addicted to various unproductive internet based activities. excessive use of facebook, a so called social network, is one of them. the major victim of this curse is our young generation who don't have enough control over their activities. they are really vulnerable to the bad effects of this social network. according to socio-psychologists, the bad effects of facebook are-loss of concentration, lack of sleep, fatigue, loss of appetite, withdrawal syndromes, behavioural personality disorder etc. every technology has its own blessings and curse depending on how we use it for our betterment. the more frustrating news is that it is spreading even across the rural areas where people use mobile internet.
public statements
our so-called leaders should realize that the blatant lies never turn into truth even if those are repeated over and over again. one should remember that we are not living in germany of 1940s but in bangladesh of 2010. much water flowed down the river danube and the rhine as also the river padma and jamuna since then. due to rapid technological development, the world has become literally a big village, if not a small one. therefore, the deceit never goes unnoticed, whether it's done or uttered in a remote corner of bangladesh or at the splashy time square of new york. one may also notice that given a fair national election, people of bangladesh never gave a wrong judgment as indicated by our historical records.
hot and humid
the hottest month of bangladesh is on, all over the country. it has become impossible to bear the scorching heat of the sun. load shedding makes the problem worse and unbearable. to get at least some relief from this unbearable heat we need to be cautious regarding some important matters. here are some tips for everybody.
historical facts
apropos to your front-page report on may 7 'first bangalee to become british lawmaker.' allow me to register my point. as a bengali , although across the border in west bengal, while i am proud of rushanara ali's election to the house of commons, let me set a few historical facts right.
stop exporting arms
i think, if the us stops exporting war and weapons, all terrorism will be eliminated. i don't understand why all the experts can't understand this simple fact that it is far better to remove the cause of the disease then treat the symptoms. removal of the cause is the only way out. if the us corrects and cures itself first, the rest will get healed. avatar didn't get the oscar just because it showed what terrible destruction the marines do to innocent people. it is the best movie no doubt and everybody should watch it. you can't help but give credit to the director, producer and writer, james cameron for showing the world the true picture of the devastation they cause not only to people but also to the environment in the name of peace. they are destroying the only planet that we have, by exploding bombs in hundreds and thousands.
our mission
it refers to the editorial of the daily star that one wonders if the leaders of our country make statements at public meetings only to pander to the fears and prejudices of the gullible audience! can we not expect more respect for facts and responsibility from our national leaders when they make public statements? for half-truths are worse than lies.
