the carnage in mumbai
we strongly condemn the terror attacks that have left mumbai reeling. this attack, vicious in its nature and with wide-ranging ramifications, has brought home to all of us in south asia the lesson that a serious, purposeful and united effort toward combating the terrorist menace is now necessary. indeed, the series of attacks that have occurred in india in recent months, together with the violent attack on the marriott hotel in pakistan's islamabad, were broad hints of how wide the network of terror was getting to be. with the taj and oberoi hotels in mumbai (as well as other spots) now coming under attack, it is clear that terrorism is now no more a national but a broad regional menace. it is now anyone's guess as to where terrorism will strike next. but what is clear is that no one is safe and at this point it is for all south asian nations to come together to combat the threat. at the same time, people everywhere must condemn the atrocity perpetrated in mumbai. after having been claimed responsibility by the so-called deccan mujahideen, it is especially for muslims everywhere, seeing that such atrocities are being perpetrated in their names, to condemn the killings loudly and make it clear that their faith abjures violence of all kinds.

tigers' tantrums!
an interesting report from south africa was published in a local daily's sports pages on 23rd november. it was indeed a very sad and sorry state of affairs for our "always defeated" cricket team, now on tour there. the docile "tigers" after being slaughtered by the south african "lions" could only show their "rusty and blunt" teeth at the keen and may be, impatient settlers of bangladeshi origin, who went to see them after their test debacle.
a word of caution
the political parties should remember from now on, that they cannot continue doing what they did before; they will now have to have accountability to the people.
gazipur chowrasta
felt extremely dejected and despondent at the disgraceful conditions prevailing at gazipur chowrasta. the muktijoddha monument a prominent landmark in the area, built to symbolise the supreme sacrifices of the greatest sons of the soil is lying in utter neglect. it is a matter of shame and disgrace that our brave sons are not being honoured. the entire roundabout appeared extremely chaotic with buses, maxis, cngs and rickshaws parked haphazardly. garbage has not been removed for months. posters of school coaching, latest movie release, broadband are pasted on the monument itself. vendors sell peanuts, jhaal moori and chatpati and serve juice extracted from sugarcane and carrots. people gossip lazily and throw all types of litters. the roundabout is devoid of any ornamental garden. after dusk, the entire area is shrouded in dark as there are no overhead lights. such is our respect for the brave sons of the soil! i find it extremely audacious on the part of the gazipur administration to show disrespect to the muktijoddhas.
our children
i get frustrated when i hear yet another reference to children being part of the 'future' of a country. this is, surely, not the basis of 'child rights'. no, no, no! they are part of the present! the purpose of their existence is not because of what they may be in the future but because of what they are now. they are not merely adults in the making a smaller version of ourselves. they are real people with their own fully justified needs and demands, at this very moment, and worthy of respect and consideration as part of society and the world today.
bleak future?
the educational institutions in chittagong and dhaka are burning. the flame may engulf the entire education system. the psc is showing its true allegiance and colour. the political leaders are back to square peg one. the constitutional authority of the state of emergency has been challenged in the court, but very late. the whole scenario might be overshadowed by unconstitutional forces. the last political weapon, the militant act, is yet to be unveiled, and might be seen if politics of power so demands. a grim uncertainty has engulfed our political future.
