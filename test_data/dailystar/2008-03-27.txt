new vitality to independence day celebrations
a one-minute black-out at the central shaheed minar at midnight on 25-26 march, followed by a lighting of candles, captures the spirit of this year's independence day celebrations. such national resolve to uphold the principles of the war of liberation surely augurs well for our future. we note here the rekindling of the old wartime spirit in recent weeks among the people of bangladesh by such bodies as the sector commanders' forum. other organisations have also been active in shaping public opinion on such issues as preventing war criminals from taking part in politics and so recreating the ambience in which we waged our war for freedom in 1971. all these bodies, the patriotic men and women behind them, certainly deserve our collective gratitude for the awareness of history they have caused among all of us again. it is thanks to them that today public consciousness of the spirit of the war of liberation is resurgent. we now build on the momentum to forge ahead.
four years of rab
against the background of rising crime and proliferation of criminal networks across the country, the rapid action battalion (rab) came into being four years ago to turn the tide on lawlessness. the battalion within no time busted a number of networks of anti-social elements that have been engaged in smuggling, women and child trafficking and organising various other nefarious activities. we believe their biggest success came when they netted the ring-leaders of some terrorist groups and handed them over to the police. rab's success in penetrating the dens of the dangerously armed and motivated obscurantist elements got words of praise from all quarters. such focused and unrelenting operations by rab did counterbalance the modus operandi of criminals and helped in creating a favourable law and order ambience in society to a large extent.
