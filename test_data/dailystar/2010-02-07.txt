mid-term budgetary review is a good move
it is encouraging that the finance ministry has carried out, for the very first time, a mid-term review of the current fiscal year's utilisation of adp and revenue budget allocations. on the other hand, it is disappointing to note that ten major ministries could not even utilise 40 percent of their allocated resources.
death, hardly a matter for casual remark!
while the family and friends of the slain dhaka university student abu bakar have been mourning his untimely demise, the comments of the home minister shahara khatun came as a rude shock to all of us. one wonders what prompted her to say that it was an isolated incident and suggest that such things could happen anytime? her remarks may have been construed to make light of a tragedy in which a whole family is reeling and the nation left shocked. this is completely out of sync with her position as the home minister.
the murderous transports
deaths due to road mishaps are on the rise. reports on such fatal mishaps, taking a human toll, appear routinely in print and electronic media. each death is a tragedy and, if given a closer and deeper look, has a moving human side to it. but all those deaths are not lucky to get wide media coverage and draw the general public's attention. only a few of these sad incidents, that get extensive public attention thanks to the media, make the public aware and the authorities concerned to a new level.

currency
jan 31- feb 4, 2010
international markets
there was very contrasting mood on the two sides of the atlantic this week, as the news from the us was very encouraging that the economy was on a strong recovery path. news from the euro region however increased worries that the fiscal health in the euro zone was a cause for concern. the euro hit a seven-month low against the dollar, knocked by concerns over the fiscal health of peripheral euro zone countries ahead of a european central bank policy decision later on thursday. worries over spain and portugal have increased as investors speculate the two countries may face similar debt problems to greece. such concerns pushed the safe-haven dollar to a six-month high versus a currency basket. traders said moves in the euro could become volatile should ecb president jean-claude trichet make any strong reference to fiscal problems in the euro zone. he will speak after a policy meeting at which the ecb is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold. traders sold the single european currency on the view that dismal finances in euro zone countries may hinder any economic improvements in the region, increasing the probability that the us economy may recover faster. strong us data this week supported this view ahead of non-farm payrolls numbers due on friday. a reuters poll estimates 8,000 jobs were added to the economy last month. view the page metropolitan

a peaceful congregation
bishwa ijtema is undoubtedly one of the most significant religious congregations of muslims and has become a global event. it is not sure when the first bishwa ijtema was held. some believe that this event started back in 1946. one facet of this religious congregation that has remained alike over time is that the tabligh jamaat of bangladesh organises it every year. starting out as a tiny event that was attended by a few devotees, it has grown into a massive congregation that is attended by millions from all over the world.
justice, at long last
i was reading a.l. khatib's narration of the sinister night of august 14, 1975 in dhaka in the daily star. the vivid details of the gruesome murders are once again imprinted on my mind. i am so pleased to know that the senseless massacre of bangabandhu's family is finally avenged through the legal institutions of our democratic nation. this is a day for bangladeshis to be proud as a nation.
greed - the green-eyed monster
just over a year after taking oath to serve the people of bangladesh, the fat cats have duly emerged from kahn's white elephant stables (kwes). there will now be the descent of “manna from heaven” for the lucky 345 denizens of kwes in the shape of duty-free gas guzzling monstrosities (ggms).

this nuisance must stop
of late, mobile telephone companies are taking advantage of their knowledge (of our cell numbers) and taking this 'keep connected' mission beyond civic sense even by jungle standards. mobile telephone companies are rather inquisitive and personal. it is possible that at 2:00am in the morning your sms alert will sound, you would obviously want to know what it is that is so urgent, and the words at the push of your 'read now' button would unveil the company's profoundest desire to learn whether you would like to get the latest ring tone from some indian movie of a foreign language. and this is a bangladeshi operator, licensed to operate in bangladesh in taka and not rupee.
the tragic incident
it is surprising that there is no official reaction to what has happened at the imperial hotel, i am not sure whether the pm had been informed of the incident. if she has been, we expect her to visit the wounded players and asked for explanation from the concerned in-charge of the saf games and the person in charge of accommodation and safety. apparently, the hotel management failed to prevent over loading in the lift. this is pure negligence of duty by the hotel management, and do not blame the poor liftman alone.
support the needy
my attention has been drawn to the advertisement published in your daily on january 23 last “inviting applications for 2010 higher studies scholarship”. this is undoubtedly a good gesture on the part of a bank of ours when, as far as my knowledge is concerned, i have not seen any such endeavour shown by any other institution or agency as yet. this is a praiseworthy step taken by one of our banks for helping and encouraging higher studies by the meritorious students.
chhatra league activities
we have become very upset by the activities of cadres of bangladesh chhatra league.
a different ministry
the ministry of science and technology is an applied ministry which deals with so many applied subjects like biotechnology, r and d research project, fellowship and funding to the researchers who are engaged in short and long term research, fellowship to the masters and doctoral students, especially with science background in different universities, different type of prestigious scholarship offered by different countries etc. two national institutes like bangabandhu novo theatre, national institute of biotechnology are under this ministry.
request for website
zia international airport is one of the important international airports in our region. however, it is a matter of regret that there is no official website of the airport. many countries in asia have already launched official websites for their international airports. an airport website helps to promote the airport, its services, and makes it easy for the users to navigate through the airport. moreover, a website of an airport can help the passengers in many ways. domestic and international passengers can easily receive relevant information from the website about their travel.
price on heads
even in the usa, when police fail to net some most wanted criminals like serial killers they declare 'price on heads' for bounty hunters. the bounty hunters in the usa is a group manned by ex-police and military personnel who are well equipped with past experience and hunting for money is their business. their network is so wide that they can penetrate anywhere in the world and catch the absconding criminals in exchange of declared money.
u-19 world cup
after an impressive build-up to the under-19 world cup cricket championship, bangladesh again comes away with a “plate”. to me, this is like being the best of the worst. being the worst of the best at least, would have been a step in the right direction. unfortunately, we are not good enough for even that. from dreaming to be in the last four we slipped to 9th. we do not seem to be able to do the right thing when it matters most, as we witnessed in this tournament. the score in the last match with ireland is proof of the fact that the boys from bangladesh actually belonged in the big league. “this is cricket” maybe. “you can have good days and bad days” sure. but when you have one bad day after another, this is not cricket. this is wandering about in the wilderness. i don't claim to know the answer to this impasse. i know only that there is no quick-fix solution to this problem. but fixed it can be by those who walk the halls of status and prestige of the world of bangladesh cricket.
bnp's reaction
our leader of the opposition madam khaleda zia refrained from making any comments and also instructed her party men to do the same after the execution of five killers of bangabandhu and his family. by the way, what is so surprising about that? this attitude, this exercise of caution, certainly reflects her personal feelings towards the whole matter.
clinton and obama
most people are talking about u.s. president barack obama's losing the senate seat vacated by the demise of democratic senator edward kennedy without ever mentioning that former president bill clinton also lost congress in 1994 and yet he was re-elected in 1996 with a wider margin.
pope and jews
the substantive thing that i agree with mr. kokoskl's letter of january 31st is that nazi germany was a “complex period of history.” during that period the role of the german catholic church in particular and the vatican in general is at best murky and perplexing. before the roman catholic church can justify pope pius xii's elevation to sainthood there should be responses to numerous answered questions. to begin with, firstly, why the vatican was one of the very first independent political entities to recognize hitler's government, and why it was in such a rush to make its unwise "reich concordat" with hitler, six months after he was in office, thereby giving it unwarranted moral legitimacy in the eyes of the rest of the world? view the page international

the recently concluded visit of prime minister sheikh hasina to india for the first formal summit meeting of her new regime, with her counterpart dr. manmohan singh, promises much. it would, however, be unreasonable to assume that in such a visit outstanding problems, left festering due to the neglect of previous regimes, would be subject to instantaneous resolution. nor may we expect that anything would happen to warrant the leader of the opposition laying out a carpet of thorns for the returning delegation or indeed to now launch a political movement to protect our national sovereignty.
