a folklorist supremo: dinesh chandra sen
dinesh chandra sen (1866-1939) was an antiquarian and esteemed scholar who wrote the first history of bengali literature and conducted pioneering work in bengali folklore. he helped set up the bengali department at calcutta university, where he was ramtanu lahiri professor. he was a tireless researcher, compiler and collector of bengali folklore, chiefly in the form of east bengal's gitikas, or folk ballads. among his prodigious and original contributions to bengali folklore is the four-volume eastern bengal ballads with its priceless collection of a total of fifty ballads. the first volume of the series contained what has famously come to be known as the mymensingh gitikas.
kali o kolom (jaishtha 1415 - may 2008)
on this centenary birth year of manik bandhapadhya (born 19 may, 1908 died 3 december, 1956) the issue of kali o kolom under review has three lead articles on him, with kamruzzaman jahangir detailing the novelist's development by following the path of his novels, and noting the salient features about them, including manik's innovative use of language. here it might be interesting to point out that one of the noticeable features about this article is kamruzzaman's own linguistic style, with its widespread and no doubt deliberate use of english words within his bengali text ('internal,' 'lifestyle,' 'serious,' 'style,' 'total,' 'develop,' 'specific,' etc. spelt in bengali), and which may be signifying the renewing of english as a source of loan words for our mother tongue. among other interesting pieces are two poems by long-dormant shahid quadri (’ apnara janen ' and 'biplob'), and kali o kolom is to be congratulated if it succeeds in nudging this new york-based poet towards greater productivity. the other thing of specific interest is the translation of a sajjad zahir short story from his sajjad zahir ki muntakhib tahririr , a collection of his writings. readers today may not know much of him, but sajjad zahir was one of the founding members of the progressive writers association during the ‘30s, which left its mark on all indian vernacular literature. he was also one of the contributing writers of the famous angaray collection of urdu short stories published from lucknow in 1932, which provoked the blood-wrath of conservative indian muslim society then.

export targets for bangladesh embassies and economic diplomacy
the commerce secretary recently announced a number of stern measures including closing down or relocating commercial wings of bangladesh embassies for failure to meet his ministry's export targets. this reminded me of my own experience with export targets as an ambassador. my first tryst with export targets came in egypt when the commerce secretary expressed disappointment in a letter after my embassy failed to meet the target. that depressed me but not for too long for soon i learnt that the embassy that topped the list as the most successful embassy was one in the middle east that was headed by a non-career ambassador, a former private college principal, whose main concern was politics with the bangladeshi community. in japan, in the space of a few months, i was once “congratulated” by the commerce secretary for surpassing the “target” but “reprimanded “the following quarter when the embassy fell short. in four years in japan, i was “congratulated “and “reprimanded” on export targets without realizing why my embassy “failed” or "succeeded!” the strange fact was that there was really no tangible reason for such failure or success.
strategic players in the middle east
the hallmark of the bush administration is not to engage in diplomacy with america's adversaries. during his visit to israel in the second week of may, president bush criticised democratic presidential contender senator barack obama's readiness to pursue diplomacy with the so-called 'perceived' enemies of america. the president called the strategy as 'appeasement repeatedly discredited by history'.

the history behind a maker of history
literature on bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman has been copious, especially in the last decade. analyses of his life and politics --- and do not forget that he began to loom large over our political horizon from the mid-1960s onward, a position that has only been strengthened over time --- have continued to delve deep into the personality and leadership qualities of the man. for all the attempts made by his detractors since his assassination in 1975 (and those detractors have been many and vicious), mujib has remained even in death a pivotal force in bangladesh's politics. his place in history assured, there is today an endless interest in assessing all that he stood for in his life. that is certainly reassuring, given the many instances between his fall in 1975 and the rise of his daughter sheikh hasina to power in 1996 when he was sought to be airbrushed out of bengali history. those attempts have clearly not succeeded, as these books under review would suggest.
stars on an amabashya night
i first read shesher kabita in its original form many years ago when i was a first-year student at dhaka university. i was eighteen at the time, i was desperately in love and it was the girl who had laid claim to my heart that gave me a volume of collected works by tagore and suggested that i read it. little did i suspect the hidden message that she may have wanted to convey at the time! she cried as she gave it to me, i cried as i read it and we both cried afterwards as if the banks of the mighty jamuna had erupted and overwhelmed our tender, young lives with waves of bittersweet sorrow. melodramatic bordering on the absurd, it felt as if our lives had been torn asunder despite the fact that we both sat there holding hands, bunking class and casually shelling peanuts on the grounds of modhu's canteen.

parliament and its committees
the mammoth contextual complexities, structural heterogeneity, and functional diversity render modern parliaments no easy subject of research and exploration. dr. taiabur rahman has ventured to explore, usually with verve and insight, a number of major challenges and issues surrounding the operation of contemporary parliaments in the three south asian democracies of bangladesh, india and sri lanka. the main focus is on parliamentary committees -- especially on the role they play in holding the executive to account in these countries. notwithstanding the growing emphasis on and repeated attempts to ensure such accountability, ensuring 'government accountability through parliamentary control' has, thus far, proved to be one of the most elusive goals for politics and society in south asia. dr. rahman's long pursuit in searching for the ways and means of developing an enabling democracy in this region has produced a series of research articles; and the current volume represents his untiring zeal for and continued commitment to the search.
