just the facts
i was extremely intrigued by the results published yesterday about the survey conducted by the institute of governance on the levels of confidence enjoyed by various professions in bangladesh. the lack of trust in politicians and police are not much of a surprise for any of us but the similar low levels of trust in lawyers and 'top businessmen' is of interest. lawyers and business leaders are supposed to be driven by laws and market forces. one would think that these would be less subjective and susceptible to manipulation!

save bangladeshis in bahrain
on 23 may 2008, one bangladeshi worker had a brawl with a bahraini and unfortunately the bahraini was killed. in connection with the same, the bahrain government banned issuing work permits for the bangladeshis and stopped the renewal of work permits. if the residence permit expires, it cannot be renewed and the worker concerned will have to leave the country. nearly 100,000 workers are engaged here in various fields and many of them have been staying for 15-20 years. they are employed in construction, hotels, tailoring, teaching, hospitals, accounting, administration and so on. many of them are settled here with business, self employment etc. many people have been staying with families; their children are being born, educated and brought up here. many children are going to attend the o level, a level and even university exams. but as their parents' residence permits are not going to be renewed, they will have to leave the country. many people have invested here in the hope of better economic freedom but everything is going to be wasted. now everybody here in bahrain is upset and hopeless.
school attendance
we must all be concerned about the recently published figures showing that bangladesh has one of the poorest levels of school attendance of any country. among the suggestions was to extend the school day, week and year and change the school year to one that goes from august-july.
end of monarchy in nepal
this is undoubtedly a historic event which all of us should recognize and support wholeheartedly. in the tv news we have heard that the democratic government of nepal is receiving recognition and appreciation from abroad. unfortunately, i have not heard anything about bangladesh's position. is our government waiting for green signal since ‚Äúmaobad‚Äù doesn't quite appeal to them?
no vote
a true free, fair and impartial election requires that the voters are able to exercise their voting right without any constraints. but unfortunately in our country the voters are not able to do so because the political parties are divided into two groups and field candidates just to win the election. in order to secure victory in election, the jotes (alliances) primarily consider not the merit of the candidates but their matching capacity, that is, if one jote fields a strong candidate in a particular constituency the other jote must field a candidate who would match his rival in terms of money and muscle. in such a situation, the voters become helpless. they have no option but to vote for one of the two. hence the fundamental objective of an election as well as democracy is frustrated.
medical ethics and business
many patients are aware of the rapid cutthroat commercialisation and its presence in the medical profession. now medical ethics has been trampled down by commercialisation and corruption which has the doctors as its silent beneficiary! it all started rather innocently; with drug houses giving all expenses paid trips to influential doctors for trips overseas (or shopping holidays?) presumably to attend conferences and seminars. the idea behind or the smokescreen was to gather knowledge! the trend has now gone much further!
utopian vision
the changes have given rise to a lot of visionaries keen to express their love for the country. many of these visions are of course the result of a genuine desire to see a better bangladesh making its mark on the world stage. many of these visionaries are people fed up with their identity of being citizens of an impoverished state and are now seeking to cease the moment to dictate a way out of it. this, of all things, must be accepted with much appreciation, our people have begun to dream the unthinkable!
forensic voice identification

beggars carrying infants
begging with infants is increasing in gulshan area. as a mother of a child, it is so painful to see that female as well as male beggars are begging with infants.
dialogue between al and bnp
the dialogue between political parties and the caretaker government sounds more like a job interview. the parties may place their demands but the ctg will ultimately define the terms. both the awami league and the bnp have already declared that they would boycott the dialogue. the smaller parties may make themselves look important by their participation in the dialogue but the ground reality is that none of them can get elected without ‚Äúnouka‚Äù or ‚Äúdhanershish‚Äù as their election symbol (with a few exceptions). as a result, i doubt whether the dialogue will bear any fruit. even the dialogue with the al and the bnp will produce nothing.
you will be watched!
this refers to mr. shawkat anwar's article in your may 27 issue regarding dmp's plan to install 176 cctv in dhaka city costing taka 610 million.
ctg's priorities
the way it looked initially this government came to the power with a specific commitment to fighting corruption and reforming the political culture of bangladesh. after all these efforts it seems now they are still hesitant to do the right things for the sake of the country. they have handled disasters successfully, they could put all nasty corrupts in jail.
free online map of dhaka
until recently bangladesh has been lagging behind in the technological craze of digital and online mapping. unlike in other parts of the world, on-line maps, that are printable, are not available here to orientate people. luxury cars equipped with gps do not have proper routing maps and internet users have access only to google's satellite image of bangladesh.
the two worlds
manual labour work shifted to the developing countries in the last five to ten years. the main idea behind this is to exploit the availability of the cheap labour force of the developing countries to produce at lower costs and keep the knowledge based work for the developed countries in order to facilitate better management services. this situation will have a big impact on the economy, education and health.
a fresh start
