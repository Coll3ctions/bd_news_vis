regional task force on anti-terrorism
a feature of the awami league election manifesto, insofar as its foreign policy commitments are concerned, is to work towards forming a regional task force to address the issue of terrorism and militancy. this has also been reiterated on quite a few occasions by people in the government since the assumption of office by prime minister sheikh hasina.
this is utter cruelty
we are appalled by the photograph of female garment workers walking barefoot on hot concrete during lunch hour, as their footwears were kept in possession of the employers lest the former traveled too far during lunch break. the news item on the front page of the daily star on sunday says that it is done so not on a one-off, but regular basis to compel workers to come back to work after a short while as they would not be able to endure the rough walk for long. it is beyond comprehension that female workers are subjected to such cruelty right in the middle of the capital city and well into the 21st century. by all means, the whole episode smacks of gender discrimination of the worst kind, because the male workers are not meted out such treatment. such practices remind us of the days of bonded labour and barbaric treatment to workers that civilisation was thought to have consigned to oblivion.
the priority for major parties
after having gone through two years under a state of emergency, it was presumed that the politicians would have learnt to conduct themselves in accordance with the universally accepted norms of democratic politics. a highly credible election, followed by a magnanimous gesture by the awami league, reinforced those assumptions.

our pride
we, bengalis, have many reasons to take pride in ourselves; we fought for our language in 1952, fought for our identity and liberty against the pak occupation forces n 1971we obtained independence after a long struggle. we have our cultural mooring intact and vibrant, and keep on upholding the sense of our national self-respect and the sense of "enlightenment" amid all odds. we've so far been standing tall; we will be doing so in the days ahead.
culture of violence
violence and indiscipline start at the top tiers, and trickle down to the lower rungs of society. in politics, this is very visible, as the politicians in power consider themselves to be above the law [protection, indulgence, partiality, nepotism, hidden godfathers; abuse of power and position]. use of violence is not a solution [it includes the us foreign policy].
rental power plants
there was a report published in the daily star that refers to mr. debajit das, managing director (asia) of uk based aggreko co. which is operating a 40 mw diesel powered rental power plant in khulna since june last. mr. das believes that bangladesh would have to rely on the rental power system as the best short-term solution for the next few years until it could bring some large power projects online. reasonably, the company is interested to expand its business in bangladesh and outlined the details it can do to provide extra power for a term as short as one day, like beijing olympics and us presidential inauguration. according to him, aggreko can quickly mobilize installing and supplying 200 mw plant in just one month if the plant site is ready.
higher education
all english medium schools are following the rules of british council and students are also concentrating on that. a time comes after completing their o' level and a' level when the students are bound to go to foreign countries for obtaining their higher degrees. but every student is not capable of doing that, because they do not have enough money.
role of oic
we noticed that from the beginning of israeli invasion of gaza, the oic did not express solidarity with the oppressed palestinian people.
diesel price reduction
we, the common people, would expect from the new govt. a reasonable diesel price reduction, so that the agriculture sector would be benefited. but all our hopes were nipped in the bud. how will the farmers be inspired to grow more paddy with the high prices of fertilizers lingering, when the price of paddy is lower than before.
acc
some politicians are very unhappy with the role of the acc. but mere accusation of the acc will not clean them from charges and public will not accept them as their clean leaders. they should prove beyond doubt that all the charges brought against them by the acc during the ctg were false and the acc did imprison them out of enmity!

residential plots
we all know that in bangladesh, particularly in dhaka city, the demand for land for housing is increasing every day and if this trend continues for the next 20-25 years, dhaka city will have no lands left which we call the open space for public.
risible attacks
it is not at all relishing to see the bnp still continuing its ballyhoos of an allegation against the ec and obliquely against those who were at the helm of affairs that they, through conspiracy and wide-spread vote rigging, got it routed in the general election of december 29. such allegations, in fact, appeared queer and deprecating or dismissive as the people cast their vote in the most transparent ballot boxes under fool proof security, after correct scrutiny of their names and identifications and also in an utter fear-free mood, never felt in any earlier elections, and as hundreds of local and foreign bodies of observers who observed and monitored the election proceedings found no notable anomalies and commented to their satisfaction that the election was international standard. that sets aside the allegations as phoney and expressive of shameless wallowing in lies which the bnp was always observed to live in and thrive on. that the respective polling agents and even mp candidates of both camps could not observe any irregularities to complain about, such as the use of fraudulence or manipulation by any quarters until the end of the counting, as nothing of the sort was also reported in the print or electronic media, the bnp's allegations simply fell flat and many of its supporters were heard saying that the bnp's claim or blame was for its own sake only and many gave vent to that: “the bnp needed this kick in the teeth.” one rarest thing was that this time hardly anybody returned saying, 'oh god, my vote had already been cast'.
dismissed correspondents
about a total of twenty-eight district correspondents of bangladesh sangbad sangstha (bss) were dismissed by the past bnp 4-party alliance government after assumption of power.
hajj agencies
in the year 2008 the undersigned and his wife performed hajj. we used a private agency about whom we heard many good things. but to our utter disappointment we found that the agencies were more involved in business (making money) rather than looking after the hajjis. i would mention one incident which is an evidence of their activities.
a change?
on 23rd january a new prime minister took over. sheikh hasina with several promises of bringing a positive change to bangladesh stepped into the prime minister's office. yes we are going through a change, but is it the change we wanted? is it positive? every day there is news of terror, mugging, hijacking, killing and extortion in ds and other newspapers. where are we really heading ? view the page international
