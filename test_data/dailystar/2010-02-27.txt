gazipur factory tragedy
the blaze at garib & garib sweater factory near gazipur on thursday night, supposedly caused by electric short-circuit, that didn't spread beyond the confines of the first floor proved lethal nonetheless in its consequences. that is where the tragedy becomes all the more poignant. as though that was not enough, topped off as it was by a supreme irony that it was so very avoidable. as panicked workers in their desperate bid to escape flames rushed to the upper floors thickly circulating smoke choked up 21 of them to death. such a large number dying from smoke inhalation, and not from burn injuries brings into sharp focus the dismal state of preparedness against fire-related accidents in a factory stacked with inflammable materials.
streamline ship breaking industry
the ship breaking sector is running in a free-for-all style with no legal framework in place to make the parties concerned accountable to any authority. allegations are often heard of anomaly and corruption right from procurement of vessels from foreign buyers to getting hazardous ships cleared for entry into our territorial waters. one wonders how toxic vessels could get past the port into the yards when there is a ban on import of such vessels posing risks to environment and human and animal health. questions keep surfacing as to why no pro-environment measures are in place at the ship breaking yards and why the condition of obtaining pre-shipment inspection certificate from a qualified foreign inspection company has been waived. although environment officials are said to be examining ships, would it not have been more effective a safeguard against hazardous vessels if pre-shipment obligations were complied with by the exporters?

"the advent of this great teacher, whose life from the moment of his ministry is a verifiable record," says syed ameer ali in the spirit of islam, "was not a mere accident, an unconnected episode in the history of the world. the same causes, the same evils, the same earnest demand for an 'assured trust' in an all-pervading power, which led to the appearance on the shores of galilee, in the reign of augustus caesar, of a prophet, operated with greater force in the sixth and the seventh centuries."

shakespeare offerings in bangla
mohit ul alam has accomplished a splendid job for those who want to read shakespeare's great tragedies in bangla. he completed with virtuosity his arduous but praiseworthy task by presenting us with the bangla rendition of shakespeare's great plays in one edition: hamlet, othello, king lear and macbeth. alam's translation is innovative as well as new. this is because he is candid and honest about his abilities. rabindranath tagore was intelligent enough when he abandoned his attempt to translate macbeth in the middle. shakespeare is so great that he is sometimes untranslatable because of his divine language, astonishingly varied imagery in poetry and infinite variety of vocabulary. alam rightly presumes it to be so.

evolving a strategic matrix
in the backdrop of an increasingly assertive china and an uncertain pakistan, india has embarked on a major strategic offensive which includes taking american allies on board, cooperating with countries that are apprehensive of china and, last but not least, using its more than average economic growth to entice export led economies of asia. if one analyses state visits to india in the last six months, it becomes clear that though climate change and wto negotiations have been the issues discussed with trans-atlantic countries, however, economic resilience has proved that india rather than being a 'swing state' is very much on the path of becoming the 'second state' in asia. the strategic community in india has witnessed visits by the japanese prime minister, german president, canadian prime minister, australian prime minister, south korean president, vietnamese defence minister and malaysian prime minister in a period of three months. this shows india's elevation as a relevant regional power. india has initiated a comparatively quick defence procurement process and defence budget allocation has also risen dramatically in the last five years, despite the fact that each year thousands of crores are left unutilized.
the human element
during the cold war, the security discourse centred on east-west rivalry, a global struggle for dominance between the usa and the soviet union. in 1946, george kennan, then us ambassador in moscow, argued that the soviet power was inherently expansionist and would have to be contained. that was the beginning of the “policy of containment” that marked the us security policy throughout the cod war. security between the two sides was ensured by what was diabolically called “mutually assured destruction (mad). it was assumed that because none of the adversaries would be 'mad' enough to seek self-destruction, they would not attack each other. while the peace activists were calling for banning the nuclear bomb, the security experts were arguing that the bombs were actually ensuring a “warm peace” by preventing direct confrontation between the two super powers. thankfully, the cold war ended, when soviet union broke up in 1991, not due to any war or invasion, but because of the communist economic structure collapsed in the face of democracy and free market. during the 1980s, thanks to the initiative by the un, there was gradual realization that the concept of national security need not be confined to the narrow ambit of east-west rivalry, but should to be broadened to include other issues that pose serious danger to individuals, societies, states and the humanity. view the page star books review
somewhere between rajshahi and nachol
sanjeeb drong writes with quiet passion and with a lot of nostalgia. the loss of heritage, the disappearance of land that was home is a theme that recurs in this work of intense devotion. but, then, drong is not alone in the way he feels. anyone who has watched the gradual assaults that have been made on the way, or ways, of life that bangladesh's indigenous people or adivasis have suffered through since the british colonial period will empathise with him. consider the recent forest fires in the hills, the casualties in terms of lives and homes put to the torch. but drong's is not a partisan view of conditions. that he belongs to one of the tribes which have found bangladesh to be home for long generations is a truth that does not mar the quality of the essays he presents in this work. there is, of course, anger in him as he narrates the tale of the tribal girl from the chittagong hill tracts, a young woman forced by poverty to take the road to the city. it is in the putatively secure confines of domestic employment in that urban centre that her virginity is taken from her.
medical science with shakespearean undertones
a common allegation against physicians in bangladesh is that they do not discharge their professional responsibilities with a mind of service to humanity, which their profession is meant for. maybe it is not applicable to all physicians but it is true of a large number of them. there are multifarious reasons for this. as a nation we lack a humanitarian service-rendering tradition; many physicians coming out of poverty-ridden families set money-making as their only goal in life; at the institutional level it is not ensured that physicians will come to patients' service whenever and however necessary; ethics of medical practice are not inculcated properly in a physician's mind; and a wave of capitalism has driven medical practitioners into a rat race for material gains. it is undoubtedly a sorry state of affairs.
of reputations proper and misplaced
swedish linguist sven ohman (1936-2008) knew differently, and it would be even harder to imagine why he believed that noam chomsky (b. 1928--) has never been a linguist. it is something hard to believe for anyone who is familiar with the name of chomsky and the reputation it carries. formerly an uppsala university professor of linguistics, sven ohman in his book, the essence of language: a philosophical problem, has successfully established his observations and findings denying chomsky's position as a linguist.
exploring the mind landscape
the field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concept of cultural ideas, symbols or practices being transmitted from one mind to another through speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena. the etymology of the term relates to the greek word “mimema” which means something imitated. this controversial new field, therefore, makes an elaborate study of the universal human tendency to imitate.
