the fine art of doing nothing
sensible politicians are wary of big words: they never know when one will rebound and bite them, with painful consequences. the philosophy of power is one word too many in a phrase about politics. politicians keep their nose to the ground, philosophy out of their thoughts, and their conscience in a safe deposit vault, so that, while it remains out of sight, it can always be taken out, brushed up and put on display when expedient.

khetur dham premtali
an escape from the hectic schedules of urban life is travelling far away from the city to delight ourselves with the serene beauty of nature or to visit a historical monument. as it was my summer vacation and the mind-crumbling exams were over, there was enough time for me to take a break from my daily life and a trip to know about the incredible bangladesh having wonderful tourist places to allure foreigners. unfortunately, due to lack of maintenance, many beautiful architectural monuments such as temples and mosques are laid in ruins. i had visited india some months ago and so i decided to journey into the deepest core of bangladesh. with the consent from my parents, i was ready to go then. such a chance could never be missed.

mission impossible?
most political observers reckon that bangladesh may have plunged into yet another period of political uncertainty. it is probably naive to expect that the present caretaker government will be able to put an end to these long periods of political deadlock very easily. however, with the departure of sheikh hasina and the expected release of begum zia and her two sons, perhaps there is a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.
tantrums of a former premier
during the last decade and a half none of our premiers could achieve the height of a really good administrator. rather, their total failure resulted in establishment of an army-backed caretaker government to save the country that was on the verge of becoming a "failed state."
what can the people do?
last year, when sheikh hasina returned home after overcoming a failed attempt by the present government to bar her from returning home, she told the journalists at dhaka airport that the caretaker government made a mistake by trying to stop her from returning home and they would make another mistake if they arrested her.
