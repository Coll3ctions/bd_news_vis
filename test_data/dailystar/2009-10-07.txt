passage of city corporations bill in js
the passage of the local government (city corporations) bill by the jatiyo sangsad on monday is cause for satisfaction. it is so because the move came after the js rejected the recommendations made by a standing committee of the house to the effect that lawmakers be given advisory roles in the corporations. with all the recent emphasis placed on a promotion and strengthening of democracy at all tiers of politics and administration, it is only natural to expect that local bodies, both in the metropolitan areas and across the country, will wield unfettered authority and will thus be in a position to ensure economic and social development. in such circumstances, when suggestions are made that mps should be given powers to virtually supervise the working of such elected bodies as upazila parishads and city corporations, the question of a conflictual arrangement naturally comes to the fore.
our position in human development index

politicians' work?
congratulations to shahnoor wahid for reminding the politicians of our expectations, published on september 29. however, i believe the politician's understanding of their work is different! after all the musician's work is to make music, the statisticians produce statistics, the electrician does electrical work, and the anaesthesiologist gives anaesthesia.
rape victims
the recent report in the daily star regarding the alleged abduction, rape and torture of a schoolgirl by bcl activists is extremely disturbing. as the victim and her family appear to be almost imprisoned by the alleged perpetrators and their political big brothers, the first step would be to free them from their clutches. in bangladesh it is very difficult to achieve unless human rights and/or women rights activists come forward and play their due role. in the prevailing situation, i urge the honourable judges of the supreme court to be proactive and issue a suo moto rule on the issue to bring the culprits and their protectors to book.

taxpayers in trouble
out of 15 crore people in this country only 7 lakh people are taxpayers. this is the story going on through different newspapers, talk shows, and income tax bosses. this is evident from their attitude, talks, behaviour in every forum that they want to extend the tax net to every sphere of life in order to increase revenue income of the government. conscious people who were so long ignorant about the importance of income tax payment are becoming interested to pay income tax from their salary income, business income or whatever may be the source after observing different advertisements in print and electronic media that payment of tax in time would save them from harassments and legal complications in future and at the same time the poor country would be largely benefited.
indian superstars
i never understood why as bangladeshis, we are so enamoured with indian/bollywood stars. i bring this issue up and it is most definitely an issue because of the love i see in my fellow countrymen for these so called superstars. i myself have seen one bollywood movie in the past twenty years but i do know my mother loves shabana azmi as an actress and has been her fan since shabana azmi's debut on the golden screen. recently, ms. azmi made an appearance in bangladesh. she made an appearance last week at a prominent business tycoon's residence for dinner and snubbed a lot of these ladies(adoring fans) attending the party. superstars never should forget what got them there - their fans ! ms. azmi should do well to remember that the high precipice that she walks on was built by her fans. she should not be riding such a high horse just because a few adoring fans wanted their pictures taken with her.
'killing' of a playground
we were shocked and angry to read the news in the daily star of 30.9.09 that some 'filthy' rich people are conspiring to convert the dhanmondi playground in road no.8 into a stadium etc. this is a sinister move by 'bhumi dacoits'. in our opinion they are crossing all limits of greed. we wonder what benefits the residents of dhanmondi will reap from this conspiracy to hijack the playground. they have also shown the audacity and evil 'intelligence' of using sheikh jamal's name and goodwill to advance their conspiracy. this is a blatant emotional blackmail of the awami league and the nation. probably we, the common people, love and cherish the memory of sheikh jamal more than these 'new rich matlabis'.
terrorism
the assertion by the honourable home minister that terrorism came into being with the assassination of bangabandhu is not correct. terrorism has been there since time immemorial. with the assassination of bangabandhu terrorism has become multi-faced.
