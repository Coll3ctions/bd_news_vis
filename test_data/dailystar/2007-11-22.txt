cyclones past and present
i have been living in dhaka for the last forty six years. during this period i have experienced various natural calamities afflicting the capital. cyclonic weather was not uncommon in the city, and we were not much concerned about it. the magnitude and the intensity with which it bludgeoned the city in the late evening of november 15th was unprecedented. the sound and fury was unnerving. it was as if a monster had been unleashed. i live in a tin roofed villa. though it was a decorative roof, i was alarmed that my house would be badly mauled by the devastating cyclone that was raging through.
experiencing hajj
many seniors have told me that not everybody with abilities and willingness can perform hajj. one receives a kind of invitation from almighty allah in this regard. it was pretty late when i decided to perform holy hajj last year. even then, with the help of many seniors, our travel agents, their representatives in the two holy cities and our accompanying friends, it turned out to be a fantastic experience. yes, we had disturbing experiences as well, which we thought could mostly be avoided with a bit of extra planning and, hence, we decided to share those with the readers.
