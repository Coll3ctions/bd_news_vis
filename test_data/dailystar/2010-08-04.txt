religion-based political parties
prime minister sheikh hasina's categorical statement to her cabinet colleagues that her government has no intention of banning region-based political parties should set at rest all speculation about it in the wake of the hc's invalidation of the fifth amendment. what particularly strikes a responsive chord in all right-thinking people keeping welfare of the nation upper most in their mind is her reasoning behind her decision. her argument is that if banned, politics of such denomination would go underground. she sagaciously visualises that when driven underground such politics could acquire all clandestine implications with portents for wreaking havoc on national psyche, let alone fuelling militancy.
clashes in chittagong university
the student-police clash at chittagong university was most unwarranted. the violence, which erupted between the police and the agitating students, who were protesting the hike in tuition fees, appears to us a matter of administrative failure too. a large number of students and policemen have suffered injuries, apart from the fact that several vehicles were also damaged during the clash. understandably, the situation came to such a violent state after the police intercepted a student procession in the campus. view the page sports

corporate stress
a condolence message in the daily star mentioned, altaf karim, the regional compliance officer of a european multinational in bangladesh, died of cardiac arrest recently at the city's united hospital. he was only 49. i knew altaf karim since early nineties -- an extremely polite professional and a god-fearing person. he used to work for the company's finance and treasury functions. this ever-smiling person, altaf bhai, was doing a great job, always going beyond the boxes to serve his company's interest to the highest possible level. i even didn't know that he was transferred to compliance division. no doubt, altaf was the best person to handle a long laundry list of duties. but again, it was a tough, unpleasant and possibly a thankless job, in a country where 'right and wrong' is interpreted in many ways or in a company, which faced reputation issues in the recent past. altaf karim might have some health complications. however, i feel stress also had a significant role to play here.

minimum rmg wage
it is commendable that the government has declared a minimum salary structure for our poor garment workers. but before we make a big deal out of this, there is something very important that we all need to remember: this is bangladesh! we all know how things are done in bangladesh, don't we?
polythene bags
garbage containing nearly 80 percent used plastic bags has become a major problem along the 840 miles of california coastline. authorities are processing a bill to impose a ban on the single-use of plastic bags by grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. if the bill is passed in the senate, paper bags will be given to the customers by shops at a cost of minimum five cents per bag. and most of these bags will be recycled. good move indeed!
death of a leader
i was a government employee who had some experience of working with mr. mannan bhuyan in various capacities. on the other hand, mannan bhuyan was an influential minister for the local government and secretary general of one of the major parties of the country. yet he attained the stature beyond his political prowess which most of the leaders of present time lack.
vat on education?
the decision of imposing 4.5% vat on the private universities is a very wise decision of this government. because in some cases, the owners of these institutions are making profit much higher than the industrialists (albeit most of them claim their organisations to be non-profit). these universities are taking tens of thousands of taka from the students as tuition fees (most of the time without showing any logical reason).they increase their tuition fees now and then without any permission from ugc or relevant authorities. so it is not vat on education, rather vat on business.
assistant teacher recruitment
the written test for selection of candidates for the post of assistant teachers of government high schools was postponed due to the allegation of question paper leakage. it was reported that some bg press employees and officials were involved in the leakage and a syndicate had long been involved in it. we hope the government would take tough action against the culprits so that no one in future thinks about it. however, the candidates for the post of assistant teachers of government high schools are now highly frustrated as the govt. has not yet fixed the fresh date for the exams. on the other hand, the govt. schools have been facing a lot of problems due to teacher shortage. at the very beginning of this year, the govt. ordered opening of double- shift classes in 80 schools at the district level. as there is shortage of teachers in those schools, the authorities of those schools started double shift classes only in the entry classes. without recruiting an adequate number of teachers it is not possible to start double shift in all classes.
it's biman again!
i agree with biman's managing director because some people say that statistics is the trade of 'tricks' or 'treats' depending on the subject and on the audience looking at it. regarding growth of air travel market in bangladesh, the md should have given some idea about the market growth, both for the local as well as overseas flights from dhaka. biman is the direct descendent of the erstwhile pia, which was in those (east pakistan) days, called “perhaps. it arrives”! it was surprising that the md did not provide any breakdown data on market growth, to that extent his remarks were subjective!
on nuclear power
as a nuclear engineer, i appreciate engr. s.a. mansoor's promotion of pebble bed reactors (pbrs) for heat or power generation (dec. 13). it is one of the six concepts being investigated for generation iv rectors (current reactors operating round the world being of the generation ii and iii type). generation iv reactors are not expected to be available for commercial operation before 2030.
agitation and nsu
a report published in the daily star on 27 july entitled “students block road, vandalize vehicles in city” stated that students of some specific private universities were involved in the road blocking and vandalism at mohakhali area on 26 july to protest against vat on tuition fees. the report specifically mentioned the names of some institutions quoting: “students of north south university, east west university, american international university bangladesh (aiub), brac university, dhaka international university and other private universities took to the streets around 1:00pm demanding withdrawal of 4.5 percent vat slapped on their tuition and other fees.”
vat
we are being told that people from all walks of life are expressing their indignation due to imposition of vat on different services. vat, imposed even on education, resulted in a 5-hour jam on mohakhali uttara road on that day. it is pertinent that to broaden the tax net imposition of vat is necessary. but the impact of tax burden on the people must be considered.
mosque needs generator
as the electricity supply is not stable these days, mosques in the city are making alternative arrangements to keep the power supply steady during the holy month of ramadan so that the devotees can offer tarabi prayers comfortably. the imam of mohammadpur jame masjid for the last two weeks has been appealing for generous donations from devotees to help buy an electricity generator. last friday, after jummah prayer, the imam while appreciating the devotees' response had once again appealed for donations because the price of a generator was yet to be raised.
judiciary
suranjit sengupta , chief of the parliamentary standing committee on the law ministry, at a press briefing at the jatiya sangsad media centre said the constitution of the country did not authorize the chief justice to evaluate the past of the judges who have been appointed. the supreme judicial council and other bodies were there for this purpose.
predictable unrest
i do not understand how our city police commissioner still has his job. on thursday night our lgrd minister went on record warning of a possible rmg labour unrest due to the newly declared wages, yet we saw what happened on friday morning. i mean in any other civilized country the commissioner would have lost his job for failing to prevent the chaos in and around gulshan. moreover, he has gone on record saying none would be spared and so onafter the heavy losses suffered by businessmen.
public transport or private car
most people accuse the private cars of contributing to traffic jam but the question is whether public transport is a better alternative. the answer is definitely “no” .the public buses are overcrowded , broken and dirty and the risk of losing something is always there. people often hang to the doors and getting in and getting down from the bus is really very hard. whereas private cars are also cheaper now after the cng conversion started . the comfort is always there and most importantly the turmoil in transportation compared to the public transport is minimum . of course the cars are faster and safer as the commuters don't have to wait in the long queue.
minimum wages
a big controversy is going on for the last few months about the wages of the garment workers. only god knows when it will come to an end. the government has fixed it at tk. 3,000. per month. to general public like me (not stakeholders in the sector), it is reasonable considering the pros and cons. i talked to many owners of garment industries and most of them vehemently oppose this minimum wage for different reasons. i agree with their point like our workers' efficiency is much less than others', bank interests are too high here, higher shipment costs with many uncertainties etc. but when i see the increase in minimum wages of chinese workers to $140. (about tk 10,000), thailand's $ 70.00, vietnam's $60.00 and cambodia's $50.00, why are we afraid of paying only $40.00? if our workers' efficiency is less, then industry management must find out means to improve it and if they cannot, then they must not adjust their failure with the hard labour of workers. if our workers are best certified in korea, japan and singapore, then why do garment industry owners here fail to make the best use of them?
spurious medicines
