climate change and food security
world food and agricultural organization's (fao's) recent projections to 2030 suggest that globally the share of food in average household expenditure will continue to decline. however, recent trends, at least for some commodities, appear to be showing the reverse, with food prices increasing faster than incomes. growing scarcities of water, land and fuel are likely to put increasing pressure on food prices, even without climate change. additional pressures on these resources due to climate change, the introduction of mitigation practices that have the potential to create land use competition, and the attribution of market value to environmental services to mitigate climate change, also have the potential to cause significant changes in relative prices for different food items and an overall increase in the cost of an average food basket for the consumer.

green plot ratio: environmental planning of cities
weeks ago i went through the article 'blazing dhaka: an urban heat island' written by one of my departmental fellows in the daily star. it should undoubtedly be a great concern for the urban experts. the uhi is the worse outcome of urban metabolism process (exchange and transformation of material and energy flow) and is very much explicit in most of the densely built urban environments. but most of the economically developed countries are totally dependent on artificial air cooling system to get rid of the uncomfortable local climatic situation which again discharges waste energy in the atmosphere attributing to the global warming. dhaka, unless address and takes proper initiatives to attenuate the impact of uhi, the city life will be really very much miserable and not unlikely that the city becomes abandoned while also facing other environmental issues as majority of city dwellers are not so rich to own ac and ac in every house in congested localities simply unbearable environmentally. view the page literature
dacca december days 1971: “sartre would dig this place.” *
(excerpted from 'dacca diary,' by peter r. kaan, the wall street journal, 14 december 1971)
reporting on south asia
this collection of western reporting and journalism published by viking/penguin india was timed to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the foreign correspondents' association of south asia (fca), later re-named the foreign correspondents' club. the fcc entrusted the job to three senior 'india hands': simon denyer (the reuters' india and nepal bureau chief since 2004), john elliot (currently reporting for fortune and the economist ), and bernard imhasly (ex-swiss diplomat who was the overseas correspondent for the neue zuercher zeitung from 1991-2007). that the club was founded and is located in new delhi seems right. historically western, or to be more precise, british reporting on india began in calcutta in the early nineteenth century. in those days, it took four months for news from calcutta to reach the english port of falmouth. word of the 1857 sepoy revolt, which began on 9 may, did not reach england till a full month later. the first full-time british correspondent in india was reuters' twenty-two-year-old henry collins, who arrived in calcutta along with the first telegraph line between europe and india in 1865.

the regional dimension in the aftermath of obama victory
regionally it seems that everyone expects a lot from president-elect barak obama, mainly in terms of changing the strategic environment in favor of each party. what israel wants from obama is to continue his verbal commitment to the security of the state made during his campaign. israel also expects to get the same political, strategic and financial support of the us for its policy. israel's main concerns are that due to domestic economic reasons, the us might reduce its financial, security and civilian aid in the amount of 3 billion us dollars. israel also wants the us to continue with its agenda of containing iran, hamas and hezbollah. if obama continues that policy, israel will continue its policy as well.

two arrogant men obsessed with themselves . . .
both men were obsessed with ambitions of coming by power and using it to the full. both were arrogant and looked down on the world around them in huge disdain. and both, in the end, were recipients of less than admiration in the world of geopolitics. that is the core message which springs from robert dallek's analysis of richard nixon and henry kissinger in partners in power. if there are people who still think nixon and kissinger were meant for each other, in that political sense of the meaning, they must brace themselves for some very hard truths. one of those truths is the degree of dislike the 37th president of the united states had for his secretary of state-cum-national security advisor. and kissinger returned the favour in equal measure.
academics in incarceration and on remand . . .
everything that happened in august 2007 at dhaka university, and around it, promises to remain a dark chapter in the history of this country. of course, the university has seen some terribly bad, difficult days in the past. take the 1960s, when the ayub-monem regime unleashed the corruption that would in subsequent times give student politics a bad name. the national students federation, with the support and encouragement of the pakistani establishment, went cheerfully into the business of clubbing anyone and everyone promoting or upholding the bengali secular democratic cause into silence. and then there was the scandal of the hamoodur rahman commission report on education. finally, in the last phase of the pakistan state in these parts, the frenzy with which pakistan's soldiers went into murdering teachers and students alike at dhaka university in 1971 remains a blot on civilization.
of a painful, beautiful war . . .
the formation of the provisional government of the people's republic of bangladesh on april 17, 1971 remains a pivotal event in the history of this country. by and large known as the mujibnagar government, it sketched the bare outlines of a nascent war of national liberation; and as the months wore on, those outlines were to be fleshed out in finer detail, to a point where the international community steadily began to acknowledge the gravity of the bengali struggle.
tapestry of an artist's life
the work emerged from bangladesh shilpakala academy quite a while ago. art aficionados have enjoyed murtaja baseer's painting from 1950 and all the way up to 2003. baseer's major specialty is painting and drawing and it is this inclination which has helped him to hold his position in the forefront of the bangladeshi art scene. but his profound grasp and expression regarding other mediums are equally praiseworthy. he is exceedingly fond of experimenting and trying out new forms and techniques. to search for fresh themes and present them with a novel approach is one of his characteristics.
