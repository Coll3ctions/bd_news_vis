govt austerity measures welcome
the decision to cut back on avoidable government expenditure is a timely one. but what is important is to see that the measures are put into effect on a sustained basis. it may not be out of place to mention that we have been witness to similar articulations in the past from governments assuming the reins of power but down the road the instructions were seen to lose much of its force and in the end to frizzle out. however, we would like to believe that, given the current global economic downturn whose effects we have already begun feeling, the government means business.

having a ball with the ball

weekly currency roundup
april 26-30, 2009
international markets:
the international markets continued to remain volatile this week. concerns about the swine flu contributed to an increase in risk aversion and weighed on investor sentiment. the mexican peso fell 3 pct versus the dollar, and hit a 3-week low after reports of the outbreak surfaced. the wsj report on bank of america and citigroup further contributed to the strength of the yen and the d +ollar, which tend to rise in times of risk aversion. by the end of the week the dollar fell broadly, hitting a three week low against a basket of currencies as speculation the global economic downturn is slowing continued to raise demand for riskier assets. the euro climbed along with high-yielders as investors looked beyond a weak headline reading of us growth and focused on signs the economy may soon pick up, an outlook suggested by the federal reserve in its policy statement on wednesday. this kept intact a broad, ongoing improvement in market sentiment and risk demand, which analysts said would continue so long as economic data does not significantly alter the view that the global economy is starting to show signs of recovery. concerns about the spread of swine flu waned on the view that the disease thus far would have limited economic impact, and a report of an imminent bankruptcy filing by chrysler did little to stifle the risk rally, with analysts saying that markets have already priced in the us automaker's failure. view the page metropolitan

bleak future of old dhaka
dhaka city is 400 years old and it is only recognised when one visits the old part of the city. although it is the city heart but now it's in a very deplorable condition. the slums are increasing and footpaths are occupied by poor people. this part is endowed with architectural masterpieces like lalbagh kella and ahsan monjil, etc.
introduce more buses
the busy, clogged up dhaka city and it dwellers need to have some sort of comfort while commuting throughout the day to their destinations. cars and rickshaws, according to many people, are the main reason of the city's traffic congestions.
education commission
it is good to note that the present government has felt the necessity to reform our existing education system which is not only obsolete and ineffective but also corrupt. it has constituted an education commission with some of our illustrious educationists as its members. may be within the next three to six months, the commission will compile a report and submit it to the government for its consideration. the government will probably take another six months to study the report to find out how quickly and efficiently it can implement the recommendations. finally, in about another six months or so, the government will forget about the report and put it in the deep fridge. one may ask why i should be so pessimistic about the new education commission. the answer is very simple. all the reports submitted by the past education commissions in our country had met the same fate. in the face of agitation on the streets, the parties or persons in power never found it expedient to take any action on these reports. however, in the process the state every time had to spend in vain a huge amount of money to launch and run the activities of such education commissions.

talk shows
arrangement of talk shows on regular basis in private tv channels has become routine programmes. whenever someone switches on the television set the viewer will find a talk show or personal interview of people from different fields. many of the participants are not eminently known to the viewers. by the grace of private channels they get opportunity to express their views on many issues. the idea of the tv channels is good and i believe it is intended to educate their viewers with in-depth knowledge and information on some current issues.
road accidents
i am writing in response to sayed zain almahmood's letter 'seize the moment' published in the star magazine on 13 march. at the outset, i would like to convey my heartiest thanks to him for his outstanding, timely & informative article on road accidents. in his writing, he gave a vivid picture and statistics of the causes & casualties of road accidents occurring in bangladesh and around the world. he terms road accident as a forgotten epidemic & compares it to malaria and tuberculosis which get timely attention from the government, media & donors. he also mentions that road crashes cost us roughly 2% of the gdp every year & is almost equal to the total foreign aid received by bangladesh in a fiscal year. bangladesh has one of the worst crash rates in the world-- more than 100 deaths per 10, 0000 vehicles. he further shows that the official figure for road deaths is three to four thousand a year.
