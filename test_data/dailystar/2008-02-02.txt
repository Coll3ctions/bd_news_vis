a lot at stake for musharraf
democracy is the same all over the world. what it means is that people rule through their representatives whom they elect freely and periodically. pakistan is no different. abraham lincoln has defined democracy as a government of the people, by the people and for the people. the words "of the people" are the most important because they indicate that power resides with the people. they are sovereign and everything flows from them. when president pervez musharraf tells europe that their kind of democracy is different and far advanced than that in pakistan, he talks about the system where the military enjoys a pre-eminent position. it is not that the pakistanis are lesser people. it is that they have been denied the right to rule themselves. europe has a long history of democracy except the countries which were satellites of the soviet union during the cold war. the successive army chiefs in pakistan nipped democracy in the bud. why should mushrraf say that pakistan was not yet ready for a full-fledged democracy when he himself came through an army coup? the system was never allowed to operate in pakistan.

the song a young santal woman sings
sanjeeb drong writes with quiet passion and with a lot of nostalgia. the loss of heritage, the disappearance of land that was home is a theme that recurs in this work of intense devotion. but, then, drong is not alone in the way he feels. anyone who has watched the gradual assaults that have been made on the way, or ways, of life that bangladesh's indigenous people or adivasis have suffered through since the british colonial period will empathise with him. his is not a partisan view of conditions. that he belongs to one of the tribes which have found bangladesh to be home for long generations is a truth that does not mar the quality of the essays he presents in this work. there is, of course, anger in him as he narrates the tale of the tribal girl from the chittagong hill tracts, a young woman forced by poverty to take the road to the city. it is in the putatively secure confines of domestic employment in that urban centre that her virginity is taken from her.

cushioning the blow, in soft phrases
it is these days quite fashionable to consider oneself politically correct. look around you. you don't have red indians any more, only native americans. though you might consider barack obama as a black candidate for the american presidency, you must be extra careful in avoiding using the old, denigrating 'negro' while describing him or any of his kind. it is african-americans that you have today. on a lighter level, do you realise that there are no housewives any more today? there are only homemakers, whatever that means. it tends to remind you of a rather pernicious term, home-wreckers, one that you associate with men and women who have nothing better to do than making a mess of other people's lives by falling in love, or lust, with other people's spouses. and then there is the way you describe a child whose intelligence is obviously of a poor quality. but, no, you cannot suggest by any means that he is unintelligent. he is merely one who has an attention deficit disorder.
lament of a lonely soul
love is a symbol of truth and beauty and gives us insights into divine and spiritual life. without love and affection, it is rather difficult to think about the existence of the soul in the body. loving humankind and feeling empathy, delight and liberty are the four aspects of true love. love is tranquil, quiet, honest, virtuous and based on conviction, esteem, confidence, support and truth. it does not have any room for jealousy, distrust, conceit, snobbery and unfairness. love excuses all. love happens when a wish is developed from an attraction, which leads to submission and then urges one to take the path to commitment. a deep attachment is felt for the person we love; we feel sensitive and are mesmerised by our love and thus seek devotion and regard. love brings people together, as opposed to hate which separates people from one another. love is refined and if allowed to flow naturally will smoothen the trail chosen after birth. love makes life healthier and fuller. these constitute the essence of mahadev saha's poetry. mahadev saha is one of the leading romantic poets in our bengali literary world. he is a poet of silence and mystery. since the inception of his poetry, he has carefully kept himself removed from any disquiet and unsteadiness.
