weekly currency roundup
may 8-12, 2011
international markets
the us dollar strengthened significantly this week. the dollar hit a three-week high versus a currency basket on thursday as a rout in commodities prompted an unwinding of dollar-funded bets on risky assets, dragging the euro through technical support to a five-week low. the single currency was also weighed down by euro zone debt worries; with concerns increasing that greece's debt burden may be unsustainable. steep losses in commodity prices -- with silver falling more than 3 percent and oil down around 1 percent after tumbling overnight as well as weak equities encouraged traders to cut exposure to riskier currencies. the dollar index rose to 75.643, its strongest in more than three weeks, taking it well above a three-year low of 72.696 hit only last week. koji fukaya, chief fx strategist at credit suisse in tokyo, said the dollar index could target 77, a 50 percent retracement of its decline since january. before that, a 38.2 percent retracement sits just under 76. some analysts pointed to a strengthening correlation between silver prices and the euro which could mean further falls in silver would be a warning sign for a further downward correction in the common currency. speculation over whether greece will receive more bailout funding kept risk appetite volatile as investors continued to price in a high probability that the country will eventually need to restructure its debt. among commodity-linked currencies, the australian dollar was particularly weak, tumbling more than 1 percent to a one-week low of $1.0568 after surprisingly weak australian jobs data reduced market expectations of a rate hike. a broad recovery in the dollar also pushed it to a one-week high against the yen at 81.35 yen before it edged back to trade at 80.90 yen. view the page metropolitan

cruelty on children!
dilip roy's objective report and the photograph published in your back page on 3rd may is a shameless and disgusting example of cruelty to innocent children. the decision of the school authorities, keeping the children standing under the hot sun, was a thoughtless and stupid deed; directly violating official orders to the contrary! why did not the concerned government officials punish the school management for this thoughtless and cruel act? such crude 'oiling' of visiting dignitaries and others should stop forthwith. i will request the concerned minister who went there, to take up the matter seriously with the local administration and the school administration for such act of wanton cruelty on the young students; by compelling them to keep standing for five hours! this gross cruel action can not be ignored, and the authorities should be taught a lesson for this.
unwise decision of dmp
in recent times, we, the people of dhaka city, mostly the lower income and middle income groups, are experiencing uncertainty in the streets of dhaka. we do not know which road will be banned tomorrow for rickshaws by the dhaka metropolitan police. dmp even does not give any prior indication that they are going to restrict rickshaws in certain streets of dhaka on a certain day, which is creating a big problem for the office goers, students and people of all ages. because of skyrocketing prices of foods and high prices of other daily essentials rickshaw-pullers have increased the fare. and this recent decision of dmp has increased the rickshaw fare further. sometimes people find it difficult to find a rickshaw, because either the rickshaw-puller asks for high fare or he does not want to go to the specific area because of the ban/ restriction. in absence of proper bus service for all areas of dhaka city, it is difficult for the common people to cope with the situation. we hope dmp will change their mindset, that is giving priority to the private car owners, and take a better decision for decreasing the sufferings of common people.
of birds and trees
all sorts of disappointing incidents are happening around us and we are almost drowned in those. in the front page of the daily star of april 24, 2011, was the picture of a few rose-ringed parakeets resting on the branches of a cassia fistula linn tree on the hare road near ramna park. nestled among the yellow flowers and green leaves those birds were looking beautiful, a heavenly sight indeed.

is your textbook the latest one?
although the idea of education is a necessity, the actual implementation is a luxury. in bangladesh, this luxury is further exemplified by the high tuition fees imposed by schools, especially english medium schools.
death in custody!
in every country, police or other security forces are considered as the guardians of laws and regulations within a country. unfortunately, in bangladesh sometimes it is seen that police takes the 'responsibility' of punishing the accused even to death! of late, in tangail, an owner of a pharmacy has been beaten to death by the cops.
saqa chowdhury is a barrister!
i would request the election commission to disclose the highest educational qualification of salahuddin quader chowdhury mp. the nation has the right to know his actual qualification since there is a lot of debates/controversy about his educational qualification. and the election commission should officially disclose it before the nation since it's mandatory for all honorable parliamentarians to mention their highest educational degree before the election is held. a half-educated old woman told me that salahuddin quader chowdhury is a barrister and she knows it very well!
save the small investors
the al-led government again failed to handle the share market crisis. their amateurish handling frustrated the small investors during their last tenure. they incurred a great loss then. this time people started to believe that the key manipulators have strong link with the top ranking people of the government. however, i urge the government to solve the problem professionally as soon as possible for the sake of millions of small investors.
sending female workers to ksa
i fully agree with ms nisha varia, a human rights activist, regarding our government's decision to send 10,000 female workforces to ksa. these female workers will definitely be abused physically or sexually which is a common practice in those countries.
don't bask in reflected glory
the die is cast! the coterie of all-powerful (perhaps 1%) have decided that dr yunus must go. his appeal (ds 08 may) will fall on deaf ears. reading your illuminating article “achievements in 10 'unlawful' years” on 6th, i wish all our government, semi-autonomous, ngos and private sector could have 'unlawful' heads. if only 25% is achieved compared to dr yunus' 'illegality', bangladesh will be a semi-developed country within 2 years!! so what next? as the honourable man that he is, dr yunus has no alternative but to return all the 110 ++ accolades, including the nobel prize, that were showered on him (and bangladesh) during the time he was in an 'illegal and unlawful' chair by dozens of governments/institutions at home and abroad. if his own government, disowns, defames, dishonours and demeans a person, then they have no right to bask in the reflected glory of his reputation.
per capita income
according to world almanac usa, 2009 the per capita gdp of bangladesh is us$1,300, in almanac 2010 us$470 and in almanac 2011 us$ 1,600. we fail to understand such differences.
stop acid throwing !
nowadays, acid throwing is a common phenomenon in our country. it is happening both in urban and rural areas. but this is happening more in villages. poor girls are the main victim of this heinous crime. many survivors of acid attack had to give up their education, occupation and other activities of their life. the govt. and the social organisations must come forward to stop acid violence.
ban car parking on roads
panthapath is one of the busiest roads of dhaka. recently rickshaws were banned on this road. rules are strictly being followed by the traffic police. there are several hospitals here beside the road. parking areas of these hospitals are not adequate. so, a lot of cars are parked on the road on a regular basis. the authorities have banned the rickshaws for easing traffic congestion, but the authorities have turned a blind eye towards the cars. isn't it absurd? i think if the authorities take a stern action for preventing car parking anywhere, traffic congestion will be eased by 70 percent.
