begunbari and nimtoli disasters
the observance of national mourning day yesterday in memory of the victims of the nimtoli blaze and begunbari building collapse was yet more reason and opportunity for the country to reflect on the two tragedies that have left us all scarred and grieving. these heart-rending happenings, we need hardly say, will leave permanent marks on our collective consciousness. more tellingly, they will always serve as a reminder of all the things that government over the past many decades has not done to make life safe and secure for citizens. there is absolutely no excusing the authorities for the gross lapses in the way they have exercised, or not exercised, their responsibilities in ensuring citizens' safety in as densely populated a city as dhaka. which is why we believe that the time has come for us not merely to observe mourning days but also a 'national accountability day', for it has been a huge absence of accountability that has brought the nation to such a pass.
