exploring a road less travelled
benazir durdana completed her doctoral dissertation, which forms the basis of the book under review, muslim india in anglo-indian fiction, in 1997. by that time samuel p. huntington had his article, “the clash of civilizations?” published in foreign affairs (summer 1983), followed shortly by the book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order (1996). nowhere, however, in her book, has durdana even a passing reference to either of huntington's works. not that there was any reason for her to have cited him. yet, her own words, as well as the general theme of the book indicate that she views the depiction of muslim india in anglo-indian fiction from a clash of culture perspective. “i am of the opinion that focused critical attention is called for to examine the implications of the west's particular defamation of islam,” durdana writes. “this cannot be explained as just one among many examples of colonial reductionism; it is the inevitable outcome of long-standing open, latent and anticipatory political rivalry between the two cultures, one which has contributed to the systematic evolvement of an other in western literature that is more “other” than all the other others.”
fiction that resembles real life
human nature is a complex phenomenon. it varies from individual to individual. in fact, it is said that we cannot really grasp how differently human beings react under different situations. we cannot really understand how we feel until we are in the same shoes. in the puzzle bark tree, stephanie gertler plumbs the mysteries of the people we can truly never know. it is the author's testament to showing the passion and power of the human heart.
turning myths into morality stories
storytellers wonder as to what actually their readers or listeners want to read or hear. in fact, writers over the centuries have spent time thinking about this when they sat at their desks to write. many who realised that readers do want to hear about their own lives in the story have succeeded as good writers. writers who like to deal with people's dreams, aspirations and certain intricacies of human existence are set to be remembered for a long time to come.
the heritage issue
it is a great pleasure introducing dr enamul haque's latest comprehensive publication on bengal art. this excellent voluminous empirical treatise indeed is a new plume on his crown. this rather costly publication comprises 408 pages of text (including bibliography and index) and 536 plates, mostly in colour. according to the author, it was initially planned for ordinary readers on a broad spectrum of the art heritage of bangladesh. on second thought, however, he modified its scope to make it useful to scholars as well, as a handbook representing the noteworthy facets of the arts of all ages (albeit the handbook is too heavy to carry). it is an ambitious work and certainly a commendable attempt to sweep across a vast vista of over two and a half millennia of history and development of our creative art heritage.

dark princess
kamrun haq
nabajug prokashoni
this certainly is a work with a difference. it combines fiction and art in the sense that the realities of life are explained in terms of the images that have shaped the human imagination over the centuries. think here of ellora and ajanta. think back on all the creativity the world has been subjected to. and then go looking for the dark princess.
