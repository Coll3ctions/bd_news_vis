martyred intellectuals' day
the nation observes martyred intellectuals' day today even as it stands at a crossroads of history. for the people of bangladesh, no sacrifice can be greater in dimension and more profound in substance than the dignified manner in which some of our best men and women were huddled to their death on the eve of the liberation of the country in december 1971. indeed, the three million bengalis who died at the hands of the pakistan occupation army and its local collaborators in the nine months of a do or die war of liberation have left behind an uplifting message for those of us who survived, and for our children and their children: that freedom which comes at a huge price is freedom that needs constant sustenance and succour for it to continue playing its due role in the welfare of those who mean to benefit from it.
ringing indictment on constitutional violation
in this country where the most obvious, sensible and expected gets overridden by governmental expediency, without a blink of an eye, it is the high judiciary that comes to overturn the aberration as a breath of fresh air. it is in this light that we welcome the high court verdict declaring 'illegal' the appointment of justice ma aziz as chief election commissioner while he was an incumbent justice of the supreme court appellate division. that nobody could concurrently hold two constitutional posts was never in doubt and that is why controversy stalked justice ma aziz from the first day of his assumption of office as cec bringing down credibility of the ec with it. the pertinent question is he being himself a serving judge with vast experience how could he accept the offer from the government of the day to be the chief election commissioner?
cometh the hour
another year, another december 14. once again, we mourn the loss of the intellectuals butchered on that day as well as the hundreds of others who were hunted down, tortured, and killed during the course of the none months long liberation war. and once again, once december 14 is safely behind us, we conveniently forget the martyred intellectuals for another year, and go back to our everyday lives.
the conspiracy of silence
a freedom fighter went to court to bring sedition charges against three men. his lawyer prepared the brief and the judge accepted the case. then the law minister threw a cold blanket on the entire thing. he rightly pointed out that all along it was flawed by a procedural mistake. sedition by definition is resistance to the legal authority to disturb the peace or disrupt the government. so, the government alone has the locus standi to incriminate its rebellious citizens. once again, we have let our conviction for the trial of the war criminals of 1971 slide into confusion.

trial of war criminals
in relation to mr moinul chowdhury's analysis of my previous letter, i feel it is necessary to say a few things. firstly, i would say that mr. chowdhury is not listening to the law adviser. he has given all the answers mr chowdhury requires. i would also suggest the ctg to take action against the previous ruling parties for not taking any action against the anti-liberation forces. i totally agree with the law adviser in saying that no individual has a right to file a case of treason against any citizen of bangladesh.
return of a valiant son
as a bangladeshi living abroad for years, i feel tremendous pride in the efforts taken by the current rulers of bangladesh to bring back the remains of one of our valiant sons. unfortunately, this should have been done years ago by the previous regimes, especially the ones who claim monopoly over the liberation war. however, better late than never.
concert for bangladesh
two issues remain to be addressed for successful conclusion of our independence struggle. one issue, the trial of war criminals, has been discussed a lot in recent times. we, as a nation, owe it to the persons who gave their lives to free us, to the children who were denied their parents' love, to the parents whose dreams about their children never materialized, to the mothers and sisters who were violated by the criminals and to our next generation. another issue is to express our gratitude and recognise persons, who supported and contributed tremendously to our freedom struggle. of many such people, i will mention two who had enormous contribution in bringing our struggle to the attention of the world. music maestro ravi shankar along with george harrison of the beatles had such a tremendous contribution in bringing the tragic bangladesh situation in front of the western world through concert for bangladesh in madison square garden, ny on august 1, 1971. we as a nation failed to give them due honour. i feel very sad that we will never be able to show our gratitude to george harrison as he died in november 2001. his widow recently contributed half a million dollar for the children of bangladesh and drew world's attention to the recent disaster. i hope it is not too late to honour ravi shankar as he is also not in very good health though still performing once or twice a year. it would be a tremendous expression of our gratitude to invite ravi shankar and the widow of george harrison to bangladesh and honour them, may be on the occasion of our next independence day celebrations.
killing of intellectuals
i would like to share with your readers a poignant moment in my life, one that has left deep scars and now a deeper understanding of 1971. my story should leave no one in doubt (detractors please note) that the struggle in 1971 was indeed a struggle to liberate our soil from colonial forces bent on destroying our bengali culture and heritage. i was an eyewitness to the horrific manifestations of an ideology, which was racist and violent in nature. it would stop at nothing to perpetuate the communal bias of the pakistani ruling classes and its armed hordes. it didn't matter that the majority in east pakistan were muslims- what really mattered was that the bengalis must never be allowed to be the managers of the state of pakistan.
seminar on 1971genocide
on a cold rainy sunday afternoon (9 dec 2007) we the bangladeshi expatriates in new jersey and surrounding areas were presented with an excellent retrospective on the genocide in our motherland committed by the pakistani occupation forces and their local bengalee collaborators in 1971. this seminar and exhibit under the auspices of the department of holocaust and genocide studies at kean university was largely the work of a few young people of bangladeshi origin at kean (who were born at least a generation after 1971) supported by a professor of english, dr. bernard weinstein. the seminar was preceded by a moving exhibit of rare photographs painstakingly collected from scattered sources around the world. this well attended seminar started with a moment of silence for the three million martyrs due to whose sacrifice bangladesh is now a free country and a short film documenting the history of the liberation war. it was addressed by dr. farahi, president of kean university, dr. rounaq jahan of columbia university and a number of scholars, freedom fighters and noted personalities. the highlight of the seminar was a segment consisting of short talks by family members of genocide victims and survivors of the genocide. every participant at this seminar (who came from various parts of the usa) left the auditorium with a strong feeling that as civilized humans we must make every effort to ensure that a genocide of the likes of what happened in bangladesh must not be allowed to happen ever again.
a fresh start
we will never move forward as a nation (even after 36 years) until or unless every single rajakar still living amongst us is brought to justice, including those who until very recently occupied seats of power. i understand that "to forgive is divine" but we do need a fresh start very badly and the only possible way we can continue our journey as a nation is to make these people face the music which they thoroughly deserve. we cannot continually live with this wound in our hearts. the genocide of our people in 1971 is officially ranked second only to the nazi holocaust of the jews during the second world war. how can we pass another day without batting an eyelid?
a freedom fighter's son
my father sm momtazur rahman was brutally killed on 27 november 1971. my mother did not get her husband's body. my mother has passed 36 years since 1971. i was the youngest of her five sons-- one year old at that time. my elder brother was eighteen only. now he is a professor of sociology at rajshahi university . after a long time, i am thinking about my helpless father who sacrificed his life for the country silently, vigorously but his name was not enrolled as a freedom fighter in the list of freedom fighters prepared by the government. my father's offence? view the page international
