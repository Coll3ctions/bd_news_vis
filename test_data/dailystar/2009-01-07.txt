new govt starts with healthy food stock
although the current foreign currency reserve can be a reason for a slight discomfort of the awami league-led grand alliance government, it will very likely be nothing major as the new regime is starting with a pretty healthy food stock.
small and fresh
the small cabinet with fresh faces is something very rare in the arena of the political culture of the country, which has created a space for new leadership and political reforms, civil society members and educationists said.
many landmark laws among ordinances
the caretaker administration led by fakhruddin ahmed has handed over power to the awami league-led government along with the fate of at least 114 ordinances to be decided about in the first 30 days in parliament.

welcome transition to elected government
as sheikh hasina had promised, the cabinet that was inducted last evening is largely composed of new faces, with a few surprises. for the most part, it is an inexperienced team. it will therefore be a big challenge for the government to deliver the goods in full measure to the nation. even so, we wish the government well and expect it to bring about the changes that the people of bangladesh so keenly look forward to.
reviewing dap
not very long ago in these very columns we had called upon the caretaker government not to approve the detailed area plan (dap) before addressing all its flaws that had been pointed out by the experts from time to time.
fortifying democracy
the new government that sheikh hasina will preside over as prime minister will need to hit the ground running. that will call for decisive action on the part of the prime minister and her colleagues in the government. and such action must be taken in those particular areas where public interest has been intense in these past couple of years.
small boys, big game
there is only one relevant question in an election year: who will win? the pundits have begun to get themselves into the usual tangle, most of the tangle created by the spin of bias. the right thing to do would be to admit that no one really knows, but that would reduce a column to just one sentence. since pundits get their money from columns rather than sentences, this is an inadequate solution to their dilemma.
relations with india and myanmar
although bangladesh's relations with india and myanmar (burma) are characterised as friendly and mutually supportive, there is room for much improvement in interactive relations in all sectors with both the neighbours. in the past, an inconsistency existed in the conduct of bangladesh foreign policy. on the one hand, there appeared to be a set of policies, which were designed to turn the country into “a cocoon,” on the other hand, there was another set of liberal policies that tended to operate in a trans-national environment. view the page sports

fair election, but…
by all accounts, the election of 29 december can be regarded as free and fair. but the outcome of it is so one sided that the winning party may take the result as the 'mandate' for them to do anything they wish not that they will but it is within their right. this is where bangladesh is sadly lacking the benefit of a second chamber as in india, the usa and in the uk who can 'moderate' the actions of the elected prime minister and the cabinet. a strong opposition also helps but here the opposition has been routed so completely, but still has the audacity to have already shouted 'foul'. that is really laughable, but worrying nevertheless.
ctg deserves congratulations
congratulations to the ctg for organising a nice, peaceful and credible election. according to people, this is the best election they have seen in their lives.
al and its pledges
the landslide victory of the awami league (al) is welcome at home and abroad. people of bangladesh wanted a change with a new dimension in the country's leadership. most of the citizens gave their verdict against corruption, against sky-high price hike of foods and daily essentials. al chief sheikh hasina should not forget her pre-election pledges.
israeli aggression
the un has requested israel to stop the deadly attack but israel does not care, because there is a strong veto of the usa on israel's behalf. it clearly proves the worthlessness of the un. processions and demonstrations are continuing throughout the world. the world is witnessing once again a large-scale condemnation against israel's aggression after the end of iraq war. palestine does not have any air support, navy and enough arms. so why is israel still killing hundreds of palestinians daily? israel is violating not only human rights but also international laws.
an open letter to sheikh hasina
happy new year and many congratulations on this historic victory. while you surely know the peoples' aspirations, as you prepare to assume the vast responsibility in the new year, we would like to briefly reiterate what we, the ordinary people of this country, expect from the new prime minister and her new government, we would like to declare in very clear terms that we do not expect your government to fulfil all election pledges. let it be very clear that neither we expect to receive free fertilizers and rice for taka 10/kg, nor do we expect you to flood the country overnight with electricity and build all those highways and seaports in immediate future. we are much more realistic than the architects of the awami league election manifesto are and we know that much of the pledges are over ambitious and it may take decades for a government to attain those goals.
ec's failure
the election commission had earlier announced over tv and radio, that provisions would be available at polling centres for the elderly and handicapped voters, however this was just a hollow statement from the ec, as i could not cast my vote at our polling centre at bit school in
mandate against misrule
the grand alliance triumph is a historic and unprecedented landslide win. it is a clear mandate against corruption, plundering, killing, violence, terrorism and ineffective and incompetent running of government. it is also an outright rejection of the war criminals. this election sends strong and clear signals that the days of ignorance are over and the electorate is conscious and aware of its environment and wants to be a partner in the development of the country. the voters want the politicians to know that they are watching and will not hesitate to respond whenever they deviate. this election is a backlash against misrule.
intransigent khaleda
as expected, khaleda, true to her intransigent nature, did not accept the results and came out with various unfounded allegations of voting irregularities, despite the nation's and the world's total acceptance of the election being free and fair. minor irregularities and mismanagements compared to the magnitude of the total operation will hardly make any impact on the overwhelming verdict. though her non-acceptance of the election result did not matter, had she accepted the result gracefully, her image before the nation and the world would have been brightened. an honest soul searching perhaps would help her and the party to identify their misdeeds and mistakes and help reorganize for future. but she preferred to defy the verdict of the nation. perhaps she had sensed her inevitable debacle earlier. that is why throughout her election campaign, instead of offering countrymen better governance, she remained busy in delivering negative speeches which had no value to the general public. therefore the public overwhelmingly exercised their franchise right and clearly spoke against her and her party through ballot. the misdeeds and lust for money of her sons and close aides allegedly under her direct protection and patronage knew no bounds. crores of taka was allegedly siphoned out of the country through money laundering, by none other than her son, apparently with full knowledge of the administration as evident from the disclosure of the foreign governments which ultimately confiscated those illegally earned and transferred money.
trial of war criminals
the much talked about election was held with the al-led grand alliance's historic victory. so, of course, the ever-expected democracy has been restored, bringing back the derailed train on the right track. but it may de derailed again if and only if the present al government fails to try the war criminals working as designers of conspiracy theories.
khaleda zia's options
i was prompted to write after reading mridul chowdhury's article “what sheikh hasina should do now.” in the wake of a mesmerizing election, the article aptly calls upon sheikh hasina to make good on the promises she made in the early hours of her campaign and take other steps which are long due in the interest of this country.
free & fair election
the national election of 29 december was a remarkable event in the history of bangladesh. more than eight crore people voted across the country. every young male and female, man and woman, even the elderly people were excited and enthusiastic to restore democracy by giving valuable votes. people had to wait for the day for 7 years. so, after 7 years, when the expected election appeared before us, we could not stay at home. people came out simultaneously and went to the polling centres to vote.
our president
if i may state it correctly, dr. kamal hossain deserves to be our next president, not prof. dr. yunus, not zillur rahman, and definitely not ershad. view the page international

sheikh hasina's carte blanche
even some staunch supporters of bangladesh awami leauge (al) were pensive instead of being over the moon following the landslide victory of the al-led grand alliance. yes, there was a kind of apprehension as to whether the al leadership would be able to keep the promises and live up to the trust reposed in them by the people who have given sheikh hasina free rein to move ahead through a silent vote revolution.
tyranny of irrelevance
as many as 38 political parties contested in the national election 2008. only eight parties, including those in the alliances, have at least one of their members elected to the parliament. to be specific, except awami league, bnp and jatiya party, no other party has got more than three seats in the parliament.
