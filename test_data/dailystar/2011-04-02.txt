poetry in sediments of meaning
the very title of this anthology of poetry by nazmun nesa piari attracts attention: "prem-e-aw-prem-e". but then what is "aw-prem-e?" does it mean a state of non-love? i shall come to this question later in this review.
peregrinations into the jungles
as i walk through bookstores typically authors known to me grab my attention. i also lack reserve when it comes to browsing book titles; an indulgence that i have not been able to overcome. on one such occasion while my eyes were scanning the shelves, the title storyteller attracted my attention. aren't all writers storytellers? to my pleasant surprise, the book by mario vargas llosa had a different story to tell, not what one anticipates in a fiction. i marveled at the finesse with which the author committed his pen to bring us the tale of moral judgments that are tag-ons to laws of development. in this case, it is the story of integrating the machiguenga tribe into the 'modern' world, the mainstream culture of peru. the writer sensitizes us --- that the world views of people are social constructs which are subject to change inherent to time and place. simultaneously he also leads us to the edge of questioning whether the principles of right conduct are a good framework to understand the logical world of other people.
swathes of tradition
you judge the place of a nation in history by the culture that has deepened its roots. and when the matter is one of bangladesh, the idea of it that is, you need to go back a pretty long way in time. there are those who will inform you that in a very proper sense, it is a time frame of a thousand years within which you can place the evolution of bengali culture. and, of course, everything else --- politics, governance, poetry, music --- comes within it. but how does that culture begin? where does it begin? these are some of the questions you could push saymon zakaria's way. and he, for his part, appears ready to come forth with the answers.
