a sign of negative politics
time and again, when the government promises strong action against war criminals and acts against humanity, the main opposition comes up with knee-jerk responses that inevitably undermine civil liberties. the main opposition seems to be no exception, despite the plausible assurances by the prime minister that her new anti-terrorism measures are directed at extremism, and extremism only. if anything, the main opposition has shown a readiness to compromise on human rights and the much cherished bangladeshi tradition of freedom of expression and liberal values. the attention of the political observers in bangladesh has been focused since the last week of september. the ruling party came down heavily on the opposition leader's remarks that the government had deliberately orchestrated many issues against opposition leaders and activists.
earthquake and the hc order
the high court ordered the government on 29th july 2009 to collect the required equipment for the rescue operation if any deadly earthquake hit the country. we have learnt from the newspaper reports that the rule has given a guideline to form a committee in this regard, and the eligibility and assignment of its members were also mentioned there. however, we heard that according to the high court order the committee made a list of the available equipment and the requirement, and already submitted it to the government.
road safety
these days the issue of road safety is a much talked about one. the media--both the electronic and the print--has relentlessly drawn our attention to the topic. as we open the daily newspapers we are bombarded with the news of road accidents which are often fatal. it seems, we are no longer shocked by the news of death on the highways. in some cases, it is reckless driving that causes accidents. of late, the communications minister commented that education is not necessary to qualify as drivers. he also said that anyone who can identify a cow or a goat is eligible to drive a motor vehicle! he is ready to give driving licence to anyone. it is time the authorities did something concrete to ensure road safety. the ministers at the helm can not get away with silly comments.
lax law encouraging smokers!
smoking in public places is not unusual in our country. we all know the demerits of smoking, and not only the smokers but also the people around them get affected by the smoke. the government has banned smoking in public places, but who cares? at present, the law enforcers themselves smoke in public and nobody dares to complain. the government should take the initiative of totally banning smoking, as it affects a large number of people. by banning smoking we can set an example for other countries to follow.
bangladesh's own communications satellite
bangladesh cricket control board on september 20, 2011 has decided to set up a satellite tv channel to telecast their cricket matches and they have also allocated tk. 30 crore for this project. currently, all the satellite tv channels of our country are airing programmes via foreign satellite. a few years back, some bangladeshis completed their training abroad at the government's expense to set up bangladesh's own satellite . also, a few months ago, the telecommunications minister said that bangladesh would soon have its own satellite.

tolerance is needed
people did not know in advance what might happen on september 27, the day on which the bnp-led four party alliance held a grand rally. they heaved a sigh of relief when it ended peacefully. we thank the bnp chairperson khaleda zia for not announcing any hartal programme. the common people do not like hartals, they have had enough of it when the awami league was in opposition. the opposition leader opted for road marches and we think it is a very wise decision. we also like to thank the government for allowing the opposition to hold the rally without any major hindrance though there are reports of awami league activists and supporters obstructing the opposition activists in many places who were going to join the rally. these are uncalled-for and should be avoided. we hope the government would not obstruct the road marches or take any steps which can create a confrontational situation. people are already very annoyed with the government. so, for its own good, the government should act rationally this time.
police brutality
i was against hartal till i saw the newspaper picture of brutal police boots smashing the face of a protester during the last week's hartal. while condemning the vandalism by jamaat protesters, we cannot deny the fact that every political party has the right to press home their demands through peaceful demonstration. but unfortunately, police, instead of escorting the procession, pounce on it without the slightest provocation. admittedly, the police do as they are instructed to do, but i still don't think they should necessarily be so mean as to push a human being to the ground and smash him under their boots. i think it is time we put a stop to such inhuman treatment by the police.
monkeys in old town!
the residents of old dhaka have been living with a serious problem. monkeys frequently visit their houses taking away foods, damaging utensils, water-pipelines, etc. often these monkeys, in a group of 40-50, attack and even bite the children.
battery-operated rickshaws
the battery-run rickshaws are now visible on some dhaka roads. the other day, i had my first ride on one. i found it more comfortable and faster, and as maneuverable and cheap as traditional rickshaws. if their centre of gravity could be shifted to a lower position, arm rests installed and powered with solar cells, they would be more stable, safe and economical - the ideal non-polluting vehicle to phase out the rickshaws and to cut the arrogant, pricey and noisy cngs down to size. those behind pressing these battery-operated rickshaws into service should be commended and rewarded. i suppose, with the usual sagacity of our 'public masters' (previously servants), they will soon realise that here is a startling development to solve transportation for the masses, where they have not got their 'cut'. also, they would not look good on their multi-billion dollar rickshaw-free illusory freeways. so, they should be banned.
we need a change
in the recent past, the government while evicting the leader of the opposition from her shaheed moinul road residence made a display of the house wherein she lived for long. the nation, nay the world at large has come to know about the lavish life of a leader of a third world country where more than 80% of the population lives below the poverty line. honestly speaking, the nation has become sick and tired of both the parties. if a free and fair election is held without any intervention from any quarter, none of the parties will come out victorious with the necessary seats to form a government.

flying blind: waiting for a real reckoning on 1971
forty years after 1971, the bangladesh liberation war remains a frozen object, not yet fully open to heterodox narratives. historians need to unpack the complex and contradictory matrix that gave rise to bengali nationalism, and the mixture of racism and hysteria that spurred the pakistan army on to a path of atrocities. this is essential for bangladesh to decipher its post-liberation trajectory, and for pakistan to excavate the roots of its current crises. among several new books on the war is sarmila bose’s dead reckoning, carrying a bizarre and shrill agenda of absolving pakistan of allegations of a genocide. what we are left waiting for is a deep investigation into 1971– about the nature of violence, crisis bargaining, unintended consequences, and history’s orphans. people’s actions during war are always a combination of contradiction, heroism and failure of nerve; they are a fundamental aspect of being human. bangladesh is still waiting for that human history of 1971.
