indira gandhi . . . in our collective memory
our acknowledgement of indira gandhi's contribution to bangladesh's war of liberation has always been there. and now that the government of bangladesh has officially taken note of that acknowledgement, through honouring the late indian prime minister posthumously, we reassert the crucial and decisive role mrs. gandhi played in that long ago war for bengali freedom. the role, if you go back to a recapitulation of history, was for us, indeed for south asia as a whole, defined the nature of what would come to shape and characterise geopolitics in the region.

a self-defeating amendment
while amending the charter, the difference between the constitution and an ordinary law must be understood. the constitution is the foundation of all laws for the state. it provides the framework, some elements of which may be irrevocable (e.g. article 1-3 of the turkish constitution), for the organisation of government and establishes the stringent structure, referendum or 2/3 majority, needed to amend it, while so-called "ordinary laws" are the statutes enacted or abolished by the simple majority of legislative body. constitutional amendment thus demands maximum possible national consensus and open public debates outside the legislature.
