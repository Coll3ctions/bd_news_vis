corruption in administration
law minister shafique ahmed has come down hard on government officials on the issue of corruption. his considered view, one that large sections of people surely agree with, is that the inability or reluctance of senior officials to oversee the activities of officers at the lower tiers of administration is a major reason for the corruption in which government employees are mired. we at this newspaper would add somewhat to the minister's feelings on the subject. it is simply this: all too often it is corruption among the top levels of the administration that encourages those at the lower levels to indulge in similar wrongdoing. in other words, when the head begins to rot, the rest of the body soon falls prey to the resultant putrid smell.

tipaimukh dam
there are many earthquakes in this world which were generated due to water load from a manmade reservoir. moreover this region is one of the seismically active zones of the world (we all are aware if it); any large earthquake would be a big threat to the dam as there are geological evidences that the shilong earthquake propelled large boulders even up to chhatak area. any seismic failure will cause a sudden onrush of reservoir water through the surma-kushiyara valley and will reach up to meghna floodplain. interestingly, there are many ground elevations in upper meghna valley which are just at sea level. this water will be enough to inundate about 25% area of bangladesh by 5 ft. this volume of water would be capable to submerge the greater sylhet district under 10-ft of water. the higher gradient runoff would be of extremely high-energy flow at least up to the downstream region of both surma and kushiyara rivers.
budget 2009-10
the proposed budget document has been well presented addressing various crucial issues relating to infrastructure development, trade, commerce, sectoral management by giving emphasis on good governance and efficient public administration. the issue of rural safety net is commendable. if it could be implemented efficiently it would achieve positive results in the rural economy, and hence , a very strict and efficient management policy needs to be ensured. corruption and mismanagement should be addressed firmly starting from selection of beneficiaries to distributions.
swine flu
the world health organization (who) has declared a global flu pandemic after holding an emergency meeting. the swine flu (h1n1) virus first emerged in mexico in april 2009 and has since spread to 74 countries. hence, there is no chance to say that it will not spread in bangladesh.
drivers or killers?
i am more than convinced that all of us living in dhaka feel the pain, agony and utter helplessness caused by the inexperienced and unfit bus drivers. god only knows how they get on the roads. how come there is no control over them. and the biggest question of all: who owns these buses? looking at the accident that took place yesterday (june 17, 2009) at the moghbazar rail crossing; we can clearly see the insane behaviour of the careless and notorious bus driver whose impatient move caused so much damage. however, the news reports on tv seemed to have pointed out more of the fact that no one died on the scene, and not emphasize enough on the mindless, inexcusable act of the bus driver who could not wait a minute longer and stop before the rail. in this regard, i also want to inform you all of another very recent accident i myself was caught in where a speedy bus hit my car from behind on the airport road. i was slowing down under the foot overbridge and passed the radisson hotel, when a 'minibus' came rushing and hit me from behind breaking the entire back window of my microbus and damaging the whole back side severely. like a miracle, the gas cylinder of the car was not hit and the car was saved from blowing off. surely, the bus immediately took off and no one tried to stop the bus from fleeing the scene. (not surprising!) although i was lucky not to be seriously hurt, i had to undergo catscan and other neurological treatment to check for internal brain injury. the point is simple. this is a free, democratic country, i suppose. then, there must be rule of law that holds these irresponsible thugs responsible for their actions and they must be punished. or else, we all may have to live in a city where neither we nor our children or loved ones will be safe from the horror and terror caused by these reckless, foolish, immature and negligent bus drivers.

rmg buildings
ready-made garments are our number one export item. starting in the late seventies, this sector accounts for over 64% of the country's total export earnings. there are about 2,500 export oriented ready-made garment industries in bangladesh, those are clustered over mainly dhaka.
tigers lose
one bengali newspaper has rightly epitomized the defeat of bangladesh cricket team, or the so-called "tigers", at the hands of an amateurish irish cricket team with the news title "bagher garjon noy, biraler mew mew". what a shame and what an embarrassment for the cricket lovers and for the nation as a whole! and it is nothing new, it has been happening at regular intervals.
some suggestions
it is just a matter of time to see how the budget will be for the next year but i somehow believe that some business sectors are neglected in the budget. i can blatantly say that there are business people who hang around the ministers to fulfil the demands only for their own business sectors. whether it is fbcci or mcci or even bgmea, all these bodies talk about the needs and wants of only one particular sector, which is, of course the garment sector. because most of the top individuals of these bodies are garment owners. we do not see any individual or group of people from any other sector who play a vital role in influencing the government. toiletries sector is one such sector which is neglected beyond imagination. there are extremely good opportunities abroad for exporting toiletries in continents like africa or south america or even in eastern europe. but unfortunately, with heavy duties on raw materials and higher interest rates on bank loans, it is impossible to compete with other countries.
mps and people
elected representatives or the mps of a democratic government are supposed to be 'employees' of the people. the people hired them to serve them. in a democracy, all men and women are supposed to have the same rights and privileges.
bangladesh cricket
it saddens me to say this, but it seems like our entire country is perennially stuck in the phase of a journey that prompts travellers to say, "we are not quite there yet but almost there". we are close to our 40th year of independence and literally have nothing to show for it; corrupt and visionless governance, re-cycled politicians with re-cycled promises. we had some hope that our cricketers' would make our lives enjoyable more often than not but it seems like they are following in the footsteps of our political leaders. big promises at the beginning but just "crap" at the end, over and over again.
ashraful's captaincy
i am mainly addressing the bangladesh cricket control board, and at the same time requesting your readers' valuable judgment on my opinion against the following:
holocaust and israel
six million jews were killed or perished otherwise in europe during the second world war. the whole thing is identified as holocaust. president obama during his famous cairo discourse cited the matter as the root of sufferings of all jews. he also touched upon the plight palestinians are suffering in the hands of the zionist state of israel.
pre-schools or residences?
how many residences in dhaka have been converted to pre-schools in recent years? may be there is no accurate statistics, but the traffic situation during school closing time only in dhanmondi indicates that the number of such converted schools is pretty high. the debate only remains in the domain of unbearable traffic situation in a residential locality. but we seem to be ignorant of the fact that there is also a child psychology perspective of this process of conversion of schools from residences. view the page international
