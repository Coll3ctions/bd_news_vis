judiciary
thanks to your columnist mr. nazrul islam (25 october) for throwing light on the mutiny of the admin cadre by quoting solid numbers. when a person without any background of education in law is awarded to rule as a magistrate based on a three-month training course on crpc, it is a recipe for corruption and cronyism. no wonder that egos of these people were excessively bloated. i would urge the ctg not to give in to the blackmail. we need to give a decent burial to the vestiges of the british raj.

your du correspondent's report (oct:24) about saifuddin ahmad's prize-winning essay on agricultural innovation is a worthwhile tribute to one of our talented fellows. agriculture is the backbone of our economic system; and any improvement in this important sector will result in qualitative improvement in the lives of our farmers. such creative effort deserves national recognition. our government should take up the issues presented in the essay and transform it into applicable pragmatic work methods and instructions to encourage our farmers to adopt the proposed methods outlined in the essay.

"minus one" theory
it was a very disgraceful scene to watch and listen to the secretary general of the jamaat on satellite tv. it is not only outrageous but also full of lies what has been uttered by the jamaat leader. i can guarantee that the jamaat is politically bankrupt and will never have the guts to run any election in bangladesh with their own manifesto, because they know that the people of bangladesh will not vote them to power based on their own manifesto, despite the fact that the people of bangladesh are god-fearing and religious. they have many times discarded politics of religion and will do the same in the future also.

drug abuse
the recent reports on drug abuse have shocked us. sale of drugs in open streets is not only a hazard to those buying it due to addiction, but also to those selling them. but if effective measures are taken against it then it is only a matter of days before things get better. besides police action, the general public will have to remain aware of these criminals. if this does not happen, then dangerous consequences are likely to follow. access to knowledge can help people to protect themselves from the ill effects of drugs.
service sector
recently i met a person from a company, which is based in the subcontinent and also operating in hk. it prompted me to revisit the visions, at least theoretically, bangladeshi organisations can have in the service sector. there has been much progress in the financial services sector under wto.
"denial is the final phase of genocide"
in regard to the current disturbing discussion about the genocide committed by the pakistani army and its allies during the liberation war of 1971, i would like to add the following: the oxford english dictionary's definition of genocide is "the deliberate extermination of a race of people". this is exactly what happened in 1971 in the then east pakistan. it is time that the bangladeshi government and the un considered taking action against the architects of this genocide. view the page international
