tiny tormentors!
mosquito menace has become the talk of the town in the chittagong city. the problem is deteriorating by leaps and bounds. it becomes so intolerable and annoying that there is hardly any place to stay for a while. people of all walks of life, particularly the students (ssc and hsc candidates in particular) being the worst sufferers cannot concentrate on their studies. the irritable song of mosquito is not be stopped by the coil or mosquito prevention spray.

sin of mediocrity?
through your paper i would like to draw the attention of the higher authorities in the ministry of education to a stigma which the students and parents of some schools are facing. it is seen that when the students are in class viii, those who fail to secure their desired marks (say 60%) in exams, are forced to leave the school. this is done in utter disregard to a child's fundamental right to education. they forget that all the fingers are not equal. allah, the almighty, has not made all human beings equal, in physique, mental capabilities and character. this is applicable to children also. this sort of pruning by the authorities of such schools put the future and even life of a student in jeopardy. the cast away students go through mental agony for being reprimanded by parents, feeling guilty and shame for not securing the 'desired marks' and ridiculed by fellow students and it affects their psyche. how are the people in these school sure that a child who secured less than the desired marks set by the school will not be able to pass the public exam? why do they like to have only a grade students? perhaps to boast about their 100% a grade result. this is not a credit of the school. the real credit of the school lies in making mediocre students better. if a grade is the only acceptable grade for them, then why b, c and d in public exams? why do they demoralize such low grade students by showing the door?
natural mosquito repellent
a friend of mine wrote to me from australia that if you cut a lemon into half and stick a few cloves into them and place them around the house you will be free of mosquitoes and this is a lot safer than the usual mosquito repellents, i have tried this formula on a slice of lemon with few cloves on it and placed it near my work desk. surprisingly, it worked and mosquitoes did not bother me. a slice of lemon with cloves will last for almost two weeks. so it is inexpensive too. i hope your esteemed readers will try this formula to keep mosquitoes away. a natural mosquito repellent indeed!
city crime rate
every time we have an elected government, the law & order situation deteriorates. i would request ds to do an statistical analysis as to what's the city crime rate during an elected government as opposed to a caretaker govt. because it's apparent to citizens like us, that with every elected government package (sorry to say both parties) we see a direct link to higher crime rates. it is evident to everyone, that some quarters (mostly belonging to ruling parties) take advantage of their elected godfathers & our elite police force work, simply as an audience (knowing even if they do catch these criminals ... there would be someone calling from high ups to release them instantly ).. simply analyse, how many of ruling party thugs have been arrested during their tenure. in al time you will see only bnp activists getting caught & vice versa !!
sba's article
the writing of mr. badrul ahsan attracts serious readers who want to keep abreast of the matters happening around them every day (daily star: 5 march 2010). but this time, i surmise, he has wilfully evaded or failed to single out the main players for the failure of the spirit of 1/11 in our country. it is very much unlikely that mr. ahsan does not know them all. if he was honest enough for the purpose he wrote about, he also should have at least hinted at those who foiled the whole game wilfully.
chinese world order
with the united states facing a financial meltdown and record budget and trade deficits, the world is witnessing an emerging world order where the united states is no longer the dominant force. unlike earlier dominant powers -- rome and britain-- that faced catastrophic military crisis before collapsing economically, the united states is dwarfed economically by china's industrial might. rome collapsed when it faced the attacks by the vandals and british empire collapsed in the wake of two world wars. but the united states is facing an economic meltdown although it faces no real military threat. it is becoming dependent on rising china as an economic juggernaut. by the middle of 2007, china achieved several historical milestones: it displaced canada as the biggest exporter of goods to america; it displaced america as japan's biggest trading partner; it displaced japan as australia's biggest trading partner and it displaced america as the european union's biggest trading partner. all this happened at a time when the united states has been facing a financial meltdown and massive budget and trade deficits.

steel export
mr. ju khan's report on the matter published in your 'star business' on march 7 is a heartening matter. not being basically an iron and steel manufacturer, it is really good to hear that we are exporting steel flat products (gp&ci sheets) to africa, competing with steel giants like japan, south korea and india-- all asian countries! our steel producers deserve congratulations for their breakthrough in a non-conventional sector in international export. it would have been good to know the percentage of total tonnage of these (gp&ci flats) products that we export compared to countries from asia and europe.
