in boraigram, it was an abomination
what has happened in boraigram in natore is not just a tragedy or an outrage. it is an abomination, a clear hint of the depths to which politics in bangladesh may have sunk. the bad mauling of boraigram upazilla chairman sanaullah noor babu by awami league activists and his subsequent death are once more a warning to the government that unless it can get matters under control through putting a leash on its supporters, we could be headed for some grave times ahead. in the light of what has occurred in boraigram, there can be no scope to argue about who did what on friday. there can be no philosophising and absolutely no room for a laid-back dissection of politics. the plain and simple truth is that an individual, a citizen, was brutally waylaid by more than fifty workers of the ruling party and simply beaten to death in medieval fashion. no one came forward to help him. the police, standing close by, watched it all with little thought to performing their duties. that babu lay on the road for an hour after the beating, that it needed his wife to come and take him to hospital speaks of the steep decline of our value system.
ctg port still troubled
we know of the turnaround time at chittagong port gradually relapsing into the old timeframe of nearly double digit days which basically increases the cost of business and reflects on the lack of competitiveness of the port. this has brought to the fore the whole issue of erratic trade unionism with links to political parties. the situation calls for an intervention by the government on an overall basis which hopefully should be getting underway before things go out of hand. view the page sports

parliamentary democracy
we dream of a country free from poverty, hunger, pollution and climatic hazards. after our independence we could not achieve much success due to military dictatorship. after we have regained the parliamentary democracy in 1991, the people of bangladesh thought that the country would now follow the path of democracy. but this dream was not fulfilled due to lack of good leadership.
arsenic pollution
recent surveys show that about 80 million people of the country are living under the risk of arsenic poisoning as the groundwater of a vast region is contaminated with arsenic. arsenic pollution is not only causing serious health hazards, but also affecting the environment and creating social problems. more than two million tube-wells are presently being used as the source of drinking water in bangladesh. out of those, only fifty thousands have so far been brought under inspection by various government and non-government agencies. the actual picture of the severity of arsenic pollution is yet to be revealed, as the entire country could not be surveyed till now.
awareness needed
traffic jam has made our life miserable. we have been told to use public buses rather than private transports. but, are there any good quality buses? is there any space left for us in those buses? the government should put good quality buses on the city roads, create effective traffic rules and appoint more traffic police to implement those rules. it is also necessary to take the rickshaws off the main roads. a bus can carry 60 to 70 passengers and it requires less space, whereas only four rickshaws occupy the same space and are able to carry only 8 to 10 passengers. there should be lanes fixed for buses with bus stops to pick up passengers and not to block the road. the govt. should persuade the public to use the footbridges and zebra crossings. to make people aware of the traffic rules use of advertisements will be highly effective.
reading books
i read the excellent article "boi para on the wane" in the star magazine which has given a true picture of the bookstores. in this regard i have a few more things to add.
ominous signs
i am a superstitious person and this even grew stronger while living in houston. how could i possibly refuse to be influenced when i found the scientifically advanced houstonians believe in such things?
ayodhya verdict
in 1949 an idol was placed inside the babri mosque and later in 1992 the hindu fanatics, blinded by wild faith that ram was born at that site though it is not a historical fact, demolished it. now the indian court in its rule doles out two- thirds of the site to the hindus, as if a reward for desecrating and demolishing a historic mosque. however, i'm not surprised, given that indian politics is highly charged with antagonism towards the minority communities and the indian muslims powerless from division into different denominations.
who will amend the constitution?
president zillur rahman's appeal to senior officials to discharge their duties according to the constitution and rise above partisan politics is significant. but for this to happen, the appointment of senior officials should undergo a change.
helping the bhola slum dwellers
ariquzzaman's feature and the photographs with it, published in the daily star on 1st october, is a human tragedy. it is for us, the better off in our society, to come forward to help these desperately needy people. i wonder if some interested persons from bhola will take the lead to organise help, and lobby the government to arrange a place to build their new homes.
bcl
awami league leaders are not taking any punitive action against the bcl cadres. at present the bcl can do anything they want. they are now above the law of the land. the al leaders should think seriously about this issue.
autism
when i think of the lives of the mentally and physically challenged, i feel lucky that i am leading a normal life. previously we were not aware of mental disorders and we used to think that people who act abnormally are mad and should be put into mental asylums. autism is a brain disorder that often results in impaired thinking, feeling and social functioning for a lifetime. experts have estimated that 3 to 6 children out of every 1000 have autism. males are 4 times more likely to have it than females. girls with autism have severe symptoms and greater cognitive impairment. three major distinctive behaviours in them are as follows:
ridiculous reception!
the prime minister of the country has been awarded by the un for achieving one of the millennium development goals, that is reducing child mortality. the target was fixed in 2000, and the then incumbent government got only one year to run the country. in 2001, bnp came to power and ruled the country for five years. then the caretaker government ruled the country for almost two years. the present government has been at the helm only for nineteen months. so, the credit should go to all the governments that ruled the country since 2000.
indecent attack
the chief justice mohammad fazlul karim went into retirement recently. a farewell ceremony was arranged for him where some other justices, the attorney general, president of the bar and other dignitaries were present. but the pathetic part of the farewell was that he was told off harshly by none other than the attorney general himself, which crossed all acceptable boundaries of nicety and courtesy (ds: 30.09.10).
lack of motivation
bangladesh cricket team has been playing odi matches for more than a decade, but still they lack consistency. i believe the reason behind this is lack of motivation. we should watch how the world champions play. the difference is - in adverse times, the world champions don't get upset and thus overcome the situation, but even when the situation is in our favour, we often fail to perform well because of our complacency.
corporal punishment
a letter entitled 'physical punishment in schools' published in the daily star on october 4, 2010, drew my attention and i would like to write something in this regard.
electoral pledges
it seems that the al leaders have forgotten about their electoral pledges. this is our culture. we waste time and wait till the last minute to complete any job. the al leaders should realise that they have zero prospect of coming back to power if they do not fulfil their commitments about the power sector, infrastructure development and administrative reforms. on the other hand, al should also realise that a pro-bnp group within the administration is working actively to disturb the government's development efforts so that the benefits may be taken in the next election.
legal education and research
legal education in bangladesh has been experiencing a downward trend for a long time. we need lawyers with good legal knowledge and skills for our legal and judicial system. view the page international

the voice of a woman
a prostitute by birth, one of the first women in theatre by profession. capturing the life and times of controversial 19th century bengali actress binodini, can be a steep challenge for even the most seasoned theatre director. dhaka theatre's nasiruddin yousuff deploys the soliloquy technique to depict binodini's complex personality in his eponymous play. on the contrary, well known indian theatre personality amal allana in her “nati binodini” uses a multi-layered approach where action shifts between the aged binodini and four other actresses who depict her early days.
