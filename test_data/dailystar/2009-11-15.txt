weekly currency roundup
 november 08th-november 12th, 2009
international markets
this has been a very volatile week for the international currencies. the euro offered limited reaction to a slight rise in euro zone output, which affirmed the view that friday data would show the 16-member bloc officially emerging from recession. the euro broke the $1.50 barrier, only to come back and settle just below it. with few major economic data and events scheduled for the european and us sessions, players were focussed on a meeting of asia-pacific and other asian regional issues, including a us state visit to china next week. some analysts said the focus on asian currencies was also a factor capping gains in the euro. pressure on china and other asian countries to revalue their currencies "could take away some of the upside pressure on the euro. china's central bank, which holds the world's largest foreign exchange reserves stash of more than $2 trillion, said it would consider major currencies in guiding the yuan, suggesting a departure from an effective dollar peg that has been in place for more than a year. analysts said the move was beijing's clearest signal yet that it was close to letting the yuan appreciate after an 18-month hiatus that has frustrated many of its peers. the sterling lost ground against the dollar on the back of comments from the bank of england on its quantitative easing programme. the steady pace of dollar selling in recent weeks -- also on the view us interest rates would remain low for some time -- stayed intact market participants said. view the page metropolitan
