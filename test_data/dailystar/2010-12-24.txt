bangladesh on eiu democracy index
we in bangladesh cannot but feel happy at the placing the country has been given on the economist intelligence unit's index of democracy 2010. we have advanced to 83rd position from our earlier placing at 91st (which was back in 2008). we certainly feel encouraged but at the same time we might as well remind ourselves that this new report comes against a background of elected, democratic government in bangladesh at this point of time. the 2008 report was prepared in light of the country being under emergency caretaker rule. naturally, therefore, the general feeling is that in the current democratic dispensation we should be finding and indeed do find our state of politics at an elevated level. that said, it must also be noted that the eiu survey is a comparative study which even includes countries where not even a semblance of democracy is to be spotted. even so, it feels good to know that we are better off than many other nations that profess to practise democracy.

justice must prevail
history has hardly seen the like of the calculated annihilations of the intellectuals by their own people which happened in our country in 1971. the pictures of disfigured dead bodies and the mass killing sites are stark reminders of the heinous crimes the collaborators committed just two days before our victory, obviously with a motive to make the new nation crippled. they had also involved themselves in the genocide the pakistani occupation forces carried out during the whole period of our liberation war when three million people were killed. they were the members of rajakar, al-badr, and al-shams and belonged to jamaat-e-islami, nizam-e-islam and muslim league.

power generation scene
the news published in the daily star on 12th december stated that our capacity of power generation is 6000 mw but only 4300 mw is being produced. the authorities blame the low quality equipment, old machines, etc. to hide the real reason behind this situation.
cholera outbreak in haiti
the cholera patients in haiti are going through unbearable sufferings. on december 17, i have watched a news report on bbc about this. the cholera epidemic has claimed nearly 1200 lives. it has been almost a year since the epidemic started after the devastating earthquake hit the country. it has been alleged that the nepalese un peacekeeping mission have brought the disease there. investigation is now going on. haiti is in a big crisis. the international community must come forward to save haiti from this disaster.
cultural dominance
undoubtedly, shahrukh khan is one of the most famous heroes in india. recently, he along with his troupe performed gorgeously in dhaka. the event was organised by some private organisation. definitely, the cultural heritage and costumes of our country are pretty different than that of mumbai. we must keep in mind that foreign cultural elements are gradually infesting our showbiz. people are more willing to accept foreign films, songs, etc., being exposed to them. thus, our native cultural products are being neglected.

electricity from coal gasification
there has been no follow-up news on the interesting and important news report by shamim jahangir on the matter since last reported in your daily on 4th november. in our national interest, i feel as far as the report goes, we should take up this offer to set up an experimental 10mw power plant, based on coal gasification of the rather deep jamalpur coal seam; which lies 500 to 1000 metres below the surface! given the depth of the coal seam, possibly power generation by gasification should be a cost effective option for power generation, rather than mining it, in my opinion.
60th anniversary of holy cross college
on december 18, 2010 i attended the 60th anniversary programmes of holy cross college as a former student. words are not enough to express my happiness to be a part of this educational institution. the college authorities arranged the grandest occasion with disciplined preparations. arrangements of chairs according to batches in the pavilion next to the college field were set systematically, volunteers' services were highly noticeable and the performers enthralled us with their singing and beautiful presentations. with scintillating words and loud clapping the celebrations won the hearts of thousands present there as the audience. all of us were very much thrilled meeting with old friends. the great occasion ended with the hearty meal and unforgettable photo sessions.
one child policy
the pcp article (19 dec) on china's economic development and taking out 500 million people out of poverty is indeed very interesting. many political and economic policies and actions are cited for this, however, the most important and effective policy of 'one child per family' is completely ignored! this is the main reason for china's prosperity and this is why it is bound to lead mankind in near future in the global village.
playgrounds
there are many educational institutions in urban areas. most of the institutions are situated in the buildings used for commercial purposes, with markets, shopping centres, etc., adjacent to them. and there is no playground in these institutions.
china-india relations
china's ambassador zhang yan has said the relations between china and india is fragile. i appreciate him for his aptness in choosing correct diplomatic adjective and obviously for his outspoken remark. india should take it positively bearing in mind that an outspoken enemy is better than a reserve friend. we hope indian media and the govt. stakeholders will take it positively, and consider this a step to erase the misunderstanding between the two countries.

"leaks-ing" light on bangladesh!!
wikileaks rendering of commandeered official communications between the us state department and its embassies world-over in their website will be viewed in different ways depending on which side of the fence one is on. although most of the cables deal with analyses, some based on assumptions, some on local assessments, and yet many on shared information of diplomats of other countries on similar errands, some indeed have helped to reconfirm the geo-strategic aspirations of the only superpower on earth. no wonder the us government has given mr. assange the new appellation "high-tech terrorist."
leave them alone
the recent exchange of invectives between two major political camps targeting each other's patriarchs is an ominous sign of acerbic politics corroding into its foundations. if awami league is trying to vilify ziaur rahman and bnp is trying to undermine sheikh mujibur rahman, it only shows that our bankrupt politics has nothing left to do but abuse its own stalwarts. even a better analogy: a prodigal son having spent all his money is going after family treasure.
