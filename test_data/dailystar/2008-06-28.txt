talking with kamila shamsie
ah: how important is it for you to know your 'audience'?
ks: not at all. by that, i mean i don't know my audience. my novels are not only published in several countries, they're also published in several languages, so in some cases i have no way of even knowing what version of my book is coming across to readers (because all translations are, of course, different 'versions' of the original text.) i suppose my attitude towards 'audience' is shaped by the fact that i grew up reading books for which i couldn't have been the 'intended audience.' i mean, i don't suppose any of the writers i read and loved thought of an anglophone pakistani as their 'audience.' and yet, i was still able to appreciate and love books which showed no sign of having a pakistani readership in mind - even though i would often run into cultural references i didn't understand. i learnt to read around those moments of confusion, or to understand them via context - and as a writer, i always assume that my readers will be able to do the same. view the page star health

that unmistakable knock in the night
time is the unmistakable knock in the middle of the night that must be answered. abul hussain is no exception to this truism. in his twilight years he has come forth with his memoirs, dushswapner kaal, reminiscing on the liberation war. hussain, our doyen of poets, still throws off sparks in his poem: 'surely there is no escape to aging'. in such moments of his age, the obviousness of such thought is inarguable by any measure. what is amazing is that even after decades, the minutiae that enrich the memoirs so worthily are drawn from his memory alone and are surprisingly flawless. it is intriguing that the author, who is so well-organised in his personal life should have done without keeping a diary and relying only on memory for information. his long writing career blossomed as far back as the 1940s with naba basanta, which he dedicated to rabindranath tagore. the author came by appreciation for his book from literary stalwarts of the time --- binoy kumar sarkar, nihar ranjan roy and subodh sengupta.
fiction crafted in a new ambience
in my last book review i tried to describe the brilliance of shaheedul zahir's fiction, especially dolu nodir hawa o annanya galpo, and called him one of our best story-tellers. i was happy to pay my tribute to the quietly writing and abruptly dying author. after a lot of thought i decided to write on the stories of abid anwar this time. he is slightly older than zahir and equally brilliant as a literary figure. they have another similarity. the bangla academy and our ekushey padak department have blissfully ignored them all these years. much lesser men have been recognised in the past. this makes me all the more affectionate to these highly gifted writers, who are only a few years older than me.
making sense of so much nonsense?
this book exposes many luminaries/philosophers/cultural theorists' abuse of scientific terms in their writings. particularly, intellectuals belonging to the genre 'postmodernism' are caught by this endemic. the writers of this book are professional physicists who have examined the various treatises written by these intellectuals and shown that oftentimes they used scientific terms without any honest regard to their true meanings. it is as if to show-off the rigour of their work. “the story of this book starts with a hoax”. disturbed by the 'abuse of science' or more explicitly “…an intellectual current characterised by the more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition of the enlightenment, by theoretical discourses disconnected from any empirical test, and by a cognitive and cultural relativism that regards science as nothing more than a “narration,” a “myth” or a social construction among many others”, one of the authors, alan sokal, wrote a “parody” of the type of work that was “fashionable” in the mainstream american cultural-studies journals. this was titled “transgressing the boundaries: toward a transformative hermeneutics of quantum gravity” and got published in a special edition of the journal social text in 1996. when sokal revealed this hoax, it was a big embarrassment for the postmoderns. this particular parody was constructed “around quotations from eminent french and american intellectuals about the alleged philosophical and social implications of mathematics and the natural sciences”.
the going gets tough
the media are doing wonders in today's world of a continuous flow of breaking news, views and photographs. people these days do not even think of spending a day without being in touch with the media. frankly, people globally have become very much dependent on the media for the daily developments around them. politics, economy, lifestyle, human rights, crime and even traffic jams all these matter so much in people's lives that they have to be in touch with the media all the time.
