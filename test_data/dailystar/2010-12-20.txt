there's a time and place for everything
begum khaleda zia's visit to china is obviously a good indication of the importance the beijing authorities attach to relations with bangladesh. we expect the leader of the opposition to speak for bangladesh, especially in terms of its foreign relations, when she meets the chinese leadership. we are, however, quite intrigued that begum zia, just before her departure for china, made a demand for the awami league government to quit office over what she called its manifest failure to govern. she, like everyone else, is entitled to her opinion on how she perceives the performance of the government at this point. but what we cannot quite agree with is begum zia's berating the government on an occasion which should have been focused on what she expects out of her visit. what kind of signal is she giving out on the kind of politics she and her party have been pursuing since the general elections of december 2008?

live and let live

the real stalking issue
underlying the stalking issue are some cultural assumptions that need to be questioned. it is about a great deal more than punishing the deed. some girls seem to be being indoctrinated in the belief that, if they were ever raped, they might as well be dead. why else does the victim of threatened rape choose death, again and again? she obviously believes, rightly or wrongly, that, if she were raped, her family would be so shamed, even victimised, that she would be a terrible burden to them.
be fair to dr. yunus
i sadly noticed that a section of media people, intellectuals and politicians are making irresponsible comments on the activities of the grameen bank founder dr. muhammad yunus. it is very easy to comment and give lecture on poverty alleviation sitting in an air-conditioned room than working with the people in the field.
be fair to dr. yunus
much has been talked about and thought of siphoning off the fund of the norwegian donor agency norad, granted for the grameen bank in bangladesh. inevitably, dr. yunus has been targeted to be criticized from every direction being the chairman of grameen bank, for 'embezzling' the fund. whatever, the norwegian government has finally made it clear that there has been no anomaly of fund and that the norwegian govt. is satisfied as there is no corruption or misuse of money, nor even is it utilised on unintended purpose.
insolence and arrogance
i am sorry to say i find most of the people of the country insolent and arrogant. prophet sm of allah swt said, "a smile to your brother is a charity." i wonder how many people in this country talk to a person with a smile.
excusing ourselves!
usually in the national parliament we find the national leaders busy finding faults of others, rather than cooperating with each other with the intention of building a successful nation. we must stop this blame game, because blaming others is nothing more than excusing ourselves.
the postage stamp proposal
three cheers to professor faruq aziz of chittagong for putting into words what most people are thinking and asking, “has prime minister sheikh hasina lost touch with the common people?”
christmas on my mind
deck the halls with boughs of holly… whenever i hear this i think of christmas. red and green presents flash in my mind. i imagine santa going over the moon with rudolf guiding him. i think about the big christmas tree standing proudly by the fireplace, with presents wrapped in shiny wrapping paper, cookies and milk beside the fireplace, waiting to be eaten by santa. i think of baby jesus lying in the manger glowing, the three wise men gathered around him, gazing with amazement.

the beleaguered garment sector
after the 14 december's devastating fire at the ha-meem group's sportswear factory at ashulia near the capital and the huge toll of life and property that it claimed, fear has gripped the factory workers. in consequence, on saturday, december 18, workers of the factory were again in panic. why so? because some plaster and cement came off the ceiling of eighth floor and fell with a thud on the floor. a rumour that the roof of the building was collapsing also went the rounds pushing the panic button. as expected, there was a stampede and in consequence 25 workers were injured.
who has the last word?
do we remember what we have heard or what we wanted to hear? famous last words are tricky. even strangers can get infected with nerves at the bedside of a dying man, not least because evidence of mortality induces depressing thoughts of your own inevitable departure. relatives and friends are too affected by sentiment. assuming that the deathbed utterance, if there is one, is more likely to be a mumble rather than oratory, the opportunity for tweaking is high, either in the interest of clarity or to improve the quality. did groucho marx really say, "die, my dear? why, that's the last thing i'll do!?" or conrad hilton, founder of the eponymous hotel chain, depart on the less-than-grand note of "leave the shower curtain on the inside of the tub." the great italian traveller sounds far more credible: "i have not told half of what i saw." as does the brilliant welsh poet dylan thomas, "i've had 18 straight whiskies. i think that's the record." such pitch perfect sentences seem edited by a benefactor for an anthology, which is where i have picked them from.

out of africa . . .
there is something terribly wrong going on in cote d' ivoire, or the ivory coast as we once were wont to call it. remember the country's first president, felix houphouet-boigny, in that remarkable era when africa began to break free of colonial rule in the 1960s?
