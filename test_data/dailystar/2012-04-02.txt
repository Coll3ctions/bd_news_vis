the tenacious tigers did themselves proud in the asia cup this spring and for the first time reached the finals of a major cricket tournament and even then only narrowly missed out on victory. this represents the culmination of hard graft for the best part of a decade to re-build bangladeshi national cricket. a relatively young team of this stature and promise, of course, brings great hope for the future.
taking proper care of our children
any agenda for educational reform must start by recognising that children belong to a special category of citizens because they cannot protect their own rights. children must be warmly hugged by the state in respect of all their needs, namely, health and nutrition, safety, security, and education. significant reforms in governance are required to ensure that the efforts to be made by different departments come together. this is not easy, but there is no alternative to evolving a child-centred system of governance so that bangladesh stops wasting its huge human resource potential on account of malnutrition, illiteracy, and child abuse. with widespread low haemoglobin levels and frequent illness, especially among girls, bangladesh cannot compete with its neighbours like india and china, let alone the europeans and the americans.
