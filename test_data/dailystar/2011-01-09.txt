moving against canal and river grabbers
the dhaka district administration means to reclaim five canals within the capital city within this month. that sounds like a decisive move and we hope it is. we are also enthused by the idea of the administration taking those who have been developing housing projects illegally through encroaching on the buriganga, turag and balu rivers to task. now, such moves are clearly reflective of public concern on everything that has been happening to our canals and rivers, a worry which has for a long time been reflected in editorial comments and even judicial moves. obviously, the grabbing which has gone on where canals and rivers are concerned has had grave ramifications for the environment, not to say a clear disrespect for the law on the part of those responsible. now that the district administration has resolved to recover such lost public property, we hope the enterprise succeeds. for that to happen, the authorities must take into account the recent high court directive regarding a demarcation of rivers in a concrete manner and ensure that the recovered canals and rivers are protected by green zones around them. view the page sports

money is important in life, especially when you are working. but it does not always get the job done when it comes to motivation, as you have to get a lot of things right to have a lower staff-turnover rate than your competitors. at citibank na bangladesh, a leading global financial services company, the turnover rate is “one of the lowest” in the industry, according to rashed maqsood, managing director of the bank.

weekly currency roundup
jan 2- 6 , 2011
international markets:
the first week of trading in the new year saw the dollar surging ahead on robust data from the us. on thursday the dollar steadied after surging the previous day on strong us private sector jobs data, but investors were reluctant to chase the greenback higher ahead of friday's payrolls numbers. a string of robust us data have driven the dollar higher on expectations that the world's largest economy would recovery faster than other major economies. the adp jobs report on wednesday showed a record 297,000 private-sector jobs were created in december, boosting expectations for friday's official jobs report. us factory and services sectors' data this week has also buoyed the greenback. the adp report drove the dollar's 1.5-percent gain versus the yen on wednesday, its biggest one-day rise in three months, although dollar-selling by japanese exporters tempered gains. by 1011 gmt, it was down 0.2 pct on the day at 83.09 yen. the single currency got a slight boost after spanish newspaper el pais reported that china was willing to buy about 6 billion euros of spanish government debt. the market gave little reaction to data showing that euro zone economic sentiment jumped in december while retail sales fell in november. the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, as steady at 80.341, a sharp turnaround from last week's 78.775 trough. even then, the dollar's gains could be limited unless the data changes expectations for the us federal reserve to keep its quantitative easing in place through june. view the page metropolitan

optimum use of land in bd
our per capita land is seriously scarce. therefore, we must always be extra cautious, smart and innovative in planning and taking up projects that involve huge land mass. case in point is the proposed bangabandhu city and airport. the project is needed and is really grand in its scale. but do we have so much of land mass to go ahead? i am not against having an airport with future needs. but i strongly feel we are simply rushing to 'launch' such programme. local people are apprehensive about its impact on their life and economy. they do not see any good in mass displacement and local culture is likely to be disturbed. worst of all, most of the land lost to the mega project will be arable land. farmers will lose their livelihood and a lot of crops will be lost as a result. we can not forget how important is our food security, when every hour there are new mouths to be fed!
setting up permanent power plants
this vital matter was very rightly taken up in a front page news report published in a local english daily on december 29th. it is a cause for worry, that no prompt positive action is being taken to expedite the important matter of issuing letter of intent and sign the agreement for setting up four already government approved power plants. as stated in the report, summit group and ge energy &associates have been selected by the cabinet committee for purchase, to set up three power plants for generating 1350mw of power, while a malaysian group is to set up one rated at 150 to 225 mw in bhola.

why they talk too much?
after a landslide victory in december 2009 election, the present government has spent two years in office. one of the main reasons behind this victory was the immense corruption of the bnp-led 4 party alliance, of which the countrymen were informed by the media and some other watchdog organizations like tib. when the al-led grand alliance spoke against corruption before the election, we thought they would really do something to eradicate corruption. but of late, comments of some ministers of the government regarding tib's annual report have raised a question in my mind whether they really want to do anything to curb corruption. why are they (some ministers who seemingly want to be jack of all trades) so eager to talk to media about each and every issue?
new traffic rule
i don't think restricting cars to ply the dhaka streets is practical without creating first class and safe public transportation in the city. the present state of public transportation is highly unsafe, unhygienic and very unappealing.
price of rice
to arrest the rising trend of rice price the government has started oms of rice. under the open market economy this sort of intervention is appreciable. oms is a method to arrest the price hike, especially when the situation is not entirely dependent on normal supply and demand.
need for strong islamic media
this refers to the report, “oic chief affirms need for strong islamic media.” unfortunately, especially after sept. 11 terrorist attacks, muslims are stereotyped as extremists, fundamentalists, fascists, terrorists and suicide bombers. a school of thought in the west play double standards, and some of their remarks and comments naturally fuel muslim anger. muslim anger is also fueled by the deaths of over a million iraqis following the us invasion and washington's support for israeli occupation of palestinian lands, and the ongoing us occupation of iraq, afghanistan and other muslim countries.
