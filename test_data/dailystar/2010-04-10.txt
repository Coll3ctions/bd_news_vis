combating political corruption
it is often said that "corruption has always existed, it is pervasive, and has far reaching consequences on the functioning of democratic institutions." unless key institutions of democratic bodies are strengthened, democracy is sure to receive a body blow.
not through the gun
not many indians are happy with the prevailing system. too many disparities have come to be entrenched and too many people have been driven to live on the margin. corruption of the bureaucracy and the involvement of political masters are too blatant. "crime has been politicised and politics has been criminalised" may be a cliché but it aptly describes the situation.
panic-driven policies hurt the incumbent
implementing public policies is always a major hurdle for any government, democratic or otherwise. managing them after implementation is even harder for a government when the press and media enjoy complete freedom under democracy. in recent weeks, the mohajote government has been experiencing major difficulties in managing the panic-driven policies in the power sector. in this regard at least four recent moves have been facing public scrutiny.

water is life
importance of water is supreme. for there wouldn't have been life on earth had there been no water there. water is life. we, for that matter all creatures, have right to life, so we, they all have right to water. why not, water is there in the environment and we are born in it; we stretch our hand or just move around and find it. this was the situation even, say, a thousand years ago. then and upto a few centuries thereafter, people also dug their own ponds and wells further enhancing water in the environment. potable water was accessible by any one where it was naturally available except the deserts where it is naturally scarce.

the serenity room
i see the well manicured green rolling hills through tall windows. the crimson of twilight caresses the green creating a glorious ambiance. i look around the room and see it distinctly divided into small spaces by open walls, yet there is this perception of continuity. it is an empty room, no chairs, no furniture. i sit cross-legged by the window with most view. no sound, so serene. the silent voice question me, what matters most? layers and layers of thoughts, of dreams, of calibrated expectations, of give and takes some calculated, some uncalculated overwhelm my mind. now and here is the time of gentle meditation, of reflections, yet i am not in unity with peace. i delve in my living, i cannot rewind life, cannot fast forward, i can simply take a pause, now…this present…i can retrieve bits and pieces of moments, few words, few smiles, few feelings, silence and embrace these glimpses to relive. sensing the tingling numbness i open my palm, and then the tears flow, uninhibited, as if there is no answer to the question that forms by what i see.

a stranger in native land
seasonal adjustments traces a man's return to his village in bangladesh after an 18-year absence. adib khan's novel, however, is not in the tradition of expats who return with a willingness to embrace their native land after years of romanticising it. the central character, 43-year-old iqbal ahmed chaudhary from shopnoganj, simply isn't in the mood. he has recently endured the pain of matrimonial breakdown, so he arrives in bangladesh with his young daughter and a shattered ego. however, iqbal is not too preoccupied to discover that spending nearly two decades in australia has profoundly altered him, and he is shocked to realise that fitting in might not work out. seasonal adjustments is a poignant, sometimes painful account of a middle-aged man coping with loss and struggling to identify with a nation, culture and family he is no longer familiar with.

the imagination, through images
a majestic and rather unorthodox book of poetry, nirbachito haiku revolves around the theme of nature with human relevancies as the main catalyst, which constructs the prime foundation of the poems written. this volume brings together the works of poet shamsul alam khandaker, who has written these poems in a diverse format that have originated from the lands of japan, known as haiku. for those who are not familiar with this form of japanese poetry, a haiku verse falls in the category of a non-rhyme poem that expresses an image or feeling in the span of three lines, usually with a seasonal orientation. in the case of nirbachito haiku, the poet has playfully assembled all the poems in order to deal with nature and the place of human beings within it.
