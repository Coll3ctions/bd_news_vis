tib report on power sector revealing
a study report by transparency international bangladesh (tib) on our power sector has made startling revelations. due to mismanagement, corruption and irregularities in the sector, the country sustained a loss of tk 10,626 crore in 2005-06 fiscal year alone. to sample other staggering loss figures, between 1994-2005, tk 18,930 crore was lost through distribution leakage and pilferage and tk 4,000 crore went down the drain through purchase of six overpriced power plants between 1996 and 2006.
election commission after the stay order
the election commission has called off its scheduled november 22 meeting with the saifur rahman-led faction of the bangladesh nationalist party. it really did not have a choice, seeing that the high court has served a stay order on the ec's earlier action of inviting the faction despite the brewing conflict between the reformists and pro-khaleda zia groups in the party. we recall that we had made it clear in an editorial that the ec appeared to take sides by their move and suggested it should have sought legal advice before issuing a letter to any of the bnp factions. we did so because we could clearly see the potential for controversy about its neutrality that underlay the ec's action.
ageing war criminals and their old crimes
general harunur rashid has been doing an admirable job of keeping us all posted on the need to resist the anti-liberation elements which have, of late, been rearing their heads. his careful and determined handling of conditions, especially through his efforts to organise the surviving sector commanders of the war of liberation, is proof, if proof at all were needed, that the spirit which informed our view of the war and underlined our participation in that war is yet alive, and that it only needs men of courage and patriotism to rekindle it in order for the dark forces endangering our liberty to be sent packing.

more of the same
seldom do problems have a quick fix, neither can an authority worth the name let them snowball into a crisis. if it does, it is a failure. when such failures are added up at the end of the day, it might appear that the present caretaker set-up could turn out to be not much more than its predecessors. view the page sports

our response to the cyclone
tropical cyclone sidr, the deadliest storm to hit the country in a decade, has caused massive devastation in the southwest region of our country and ruined much-needed crops just before the harvest season. the country was just recovering from the impact of floods when it was hit by another major calamity. this is the ideal time for the people of bangladesh to unite and work together to help those people who lost their belongings completely. we feel sorry for those who lost their dear ones. our country has faced a lot of troubles before and we are a nation accustomed to coping with natural disasters. we shall overcome this time as well and move forward for building a stronger nation.
“of suhrawardy udyan of history and golf”

well done, ctg
i am writing this letter in the same tune as one of your writer nur jahan from chittagong.
help the man
i came across a news item in the uae media about a bangladeshi labourer suffering from plastic anemia who was treated in a uae hospital for certain months for free. he was then sent back to bd as he was an illegal entrant to this country. he is in bd now and apparently no hospital in bd is ready to treat him, though money is no issue for him. this man's name is abdul hakim and since he is not educated he cannot communicate his problems. i seek the readers' assistance in finding a volunteer who can guide him to the doctors. let me reiterate, he does not need financial assistance at this point of time. his number is 01715979961.
our democratic rulers
khaleda zia's incompetent and corrupt government created such a situation in bangladesh that those who were paid by our poor people to arrest criminals and fight crime didn't perform their duties, because they were afraid that they might lose their jobs. in some cases people even lost their lives for doing their job. according to a ds report (“alarming use of yaba in posh areas”, 28 oct), a narcotics officer said, “we did not dare to challenge the suspected traders though we knew well how some people in luxury cars were peddling the drug.” in the same report, a high official of the police said, “most of the users are students of private universities, colleges and a and o-levels. they thought they were above the law in the last five years. but the situation changed after the caretaker government came to office. we have been working without interference for the last one year and the recent hauls are a result of those sincere efforts.” so much for our democracy!
fate of war criminals
we are going through some democratic process/filtration. that "democracy means what people want" is a totally wrong concept. democracy means what the majority wants. and the majority means constitution. therefore, we should strictly follow our constitution. it should not be left useless. we have two options, either change the constitution (saving war criminals) or implement it quickly. if it is implemented politically then the country may again be unsteady. if anyone(s/he may be a victim of the war) wants to implement it, then the best s/he can do is to personally file a case against the war criminals. what the present government can do is to ensure proper justice. if the government files a case against the war criminals, then the situation may get chaotic. i personally believe in forgiveness. but forgiveness should be viewed from the angle of the victims. personally, i don't like politics which is based on religion but again it should be viewed from the angle of the majority i.e. constitution. sooner or later, people will realise the negative effects of politics based on religion. anyway, we must not forget the actual definition of "democracy" which is majority or constitution.
a suggestion
to the best of my knowledge, illegal voip operators use either land lines or mobile phone networks to re-route voice/data/call upon termination. how about taking a temporary measure to turn off all the land lines as well as mobile phone network for the period of interruption resulting from sabotage, to take away the means to re-route illegally terminated calls/voice/data. this measure would leave no incentive for the illegal operators to cut off the submarine cable. and, this should be strictly a temporary measure until the government/bttb has a backup cable line installed.
public servants
from my childhood, i have been noticing that top level positions e.g. prime minister, minister, secretary, additional secretary, chairman of any commission or bureau, etc. carry a lot of prestige, and those who hold the offices, barring a few exceptions, behave like being esteemed. but i wonder why it is so. aren't they public servants? in that case, they are supposed to be humble, unassuming, unprivileged, subservient, obliging and all the other synonyms you could find in the dictionary.
cyclone coverage by our media
a thousand people dead in the cyclone probably does not sound like a big number to a lot of bangladeshis. after all, no politics is involved in these deaths. why would a tv station or a newspaper bother to send their crew to the remote village of far south to see whether people are prepared? there is no political party quarrel involved in that news. why would the media bother to analyse whether the government can evacuate so many people in time, whether it is 30 lakh or 15 lakh? view the page international

the cyclone and its aftermath
a perspective plan aiming to transform bangladesh into a hunger, homelessness, and disease free democratic and prosperous country is essential. resource mobilisation and deployment from domestic, remittance, and external sources is certainly a priority right from now. the last one and a half decades have seen the governments dealing with the natural disaster issues with courage, self-respect and authority. external assistance had rarely been sought, and that too was done only for rehabilitation purposes.
