the bnp's call for hartal
we would like to remind our readers and everyone else that this newspaper has as a matter of principle opposed hartals as a means of achieving partisan political aims. we of course have never lost sight of the fact that at certain stages in our national history, particularly in the 1960s, early 1970s and in the movement against autocracy, hartals played a role in galvanizing public opinion against misrule and bad politics. since the return of elected government in the early 1990s, however, we have held fast to the idea that hartals should be abandoned if the cause of democracy and of deepening its roots was to be served. it is from this perspective that we believe today's hartal called by the bnp is unacceptable.
drug addiction and trafficking menace
the problem with a socio-global menace that admits of no easy solution is that much as we would be voluble and even resolute to fight it, we might give in to a state of fatigue over its perceived intractability at some stage. daunting as the odds maybe, insofar as its banishing goes, we can at least settle for reducing its scale towards a reasonable degree of containment. that is quite within the realm of possibility provided we proceed with a national plan, give it a resource boost and put in place a sustainable preventative and curative infrastructure. view the page sports

world cup
i know what it would be like to see the matches of this year's fifa world cup. i could easily assume that i can hardly watch any matches because of frequent load-shedding. i missed the first two matches of the opening day of the tournament and i knew how it would be like throughout the tournament. the moment i was about to watch the matches, electricity went off. this is so ridiculous. is there anything our so-called government is doing for eliminating this problem? i was so angry and depressed. i would kindly request our government to stop supplying electricity the whole day, i.e. from morning to evening and give electricity after the evening so that we could watch all the matches. if they really cannot solve this problem then this is the only solution i can give to them just for the world cup.
price of rice
i was watching the famous talk show tritiyo matra on 19 or 20 may 2010.the two honourable lawmakers were invited, nilufer moni and israfil hossain. both the mps discussed logically their points of view but when the price issue was raised in connection with the foods and the necessary commodities, mp nilufer moni gave reference to sheikh hasina, honourable prime minister, that she promised to provide rice at tk. 5/- or tk. 10/- per kg and now she has failed to do so.
power crisis
the recent decision of approving 360 mw power project by ecnec is a wise decision as the country is facing intolerable load shedding over the last few months. it is expected that the untold sufferings would be minimised as in future more power is going to be added to the national greed. in fact, the present govt has given greater priority to the power sector.
raise tobacco tax
the 'star business' report on the matter published on 8 june is welcome news, particularly for non-smokers. the tax should be raised sufficiently, so as to discourage people from smoking, as well curtailing the amount of their indulgence. additionally, since all public places are non-smoking areas, this must be rigidly enforced, with exemplary punishment for those caught smoking there. a severe punishment for this civic offence, can be passed as a law by parliament and a minimum, on the spot, fine of say tk.1000 (one thousand) at least, should be imposed for this offence.
rajuk and public money
rajuk, once again, is planning to play with the public money, forgetting the sufferings of the people. everybody understands that the role rajuk was supposed to play is patently a failure or a wilful shift towards land purchasing, acquiring, selling and extracting public money in as many ways as it can. it has two umpteen benefits for rajuk and its employees. first: it can collect a huge amount of public money for an uncertain period, even paying no compensation or any wee share of profit or interests out of that accumulated money; two: it can earn a handsome amount of money selling the forms of applications to the public; third, and the most important, is the benefit of rajuk employees, right from the top brass down to the liftman alike(according to power echelon and responsibility).
political climate
the forecast of the political weather of bangladesh is not very good. the way the ruling regime awami league is treating the opposition parties and stifling dissent reminds people of the baksal (bangladesh krishak sramik awami league) of 1975 when all opposition political parties and newspapers were banned.
old dhaka
there are many unsafe buildings in dhaka city. most of them are situated in densely populated old town. once upon a time, the old town was the centre of dhaka city. many inhabitants of dhaka are continuing to stay in the same place.
install fire extinguishers
for want of fire extinguishers, a terrible havoc may occur any time anywhere. dhaka's japan garden city is its glaring example. after this high rise building caught fire and a number of lives were lost, our fire department personnel said if there were fire extinguishers in the right places and the residents were trained to use them, loss of life and damage of property could be avoided.
amar desh
there was countrywide buzz on sudden closure of a bangla daily, the amar desh and arrest of the paper's acting editor mr. mahmudur rahman. this humming noise was mostly against the government's sudden closure of the daily.
judges and politicians
it is very difficult to make any comment on the behaviour of the politicians about the highest court of the republic. this is neither civil nor conducive to dispensation of justice.
what can we do?
what can we do when life becomes more mortifying than death? yes, i'm referring to the tragic fire of old dhaka. this tragedy has left 118 people dead and many more injured. though it was fierce and ruthless, it wasn't unusual. it's an outcome of unplanned urbanization. we know dhaka is now a risky place to live in. but people are not aware of this increasing risk. both the government and city dwellers are responsible for the tragedy.
not fair!
it is very curious how keen the authorities are to claim that they are about to destroy a row of little homes on stilts that have been built by the poor to jut out over the gulshan-banani lake when they never mention demolishing some huge great apartment blocks that have been built on 'land' created from the lake by the rich!
demise of bangladesh observer
while i was a student of a school in a semi-urban township far from dhaka city, knowing english was considered extra qualification apart from our class study. so, we had a prime target to learn and practice english in those days. i was advised by my school teacher to read the english newspaper 'observer' regularly. at that time observer was the only english newspaper within our acquaintance. i still remember that every morning i used to go to the downtown newsstand quite afar from our home. i used to walk down for a few minutes and collect a copy of the observer, occasionally, if not daily. that habit of mine lasted for quite a long while.
eve teasing
though there are a lot of campaigns and preventive measures but the condition is not improving to the desired level. we have to think deeply about the remedy of this problem.
maintain sanctity of mosques
the behaviours of people in mosques are at times not decent. it is not surprising in bangladesh to see people sitting closely together under ceiling fans although there are plenty of rooms in the preceding rows. again it is intolerable when you see people sweeping away dust just to make his place cleaner. they hardly care about guys sitting next to them who may get covered in dust. sometimes devotees in the mosques place their foot-wares in an improper way which can and does make mosques dirty. there are yet others who are oblivious of their stinky socks. sometimes you overhear people mispronouncing verses and they do it aloud when it is forbidden to do so. sometimes you see people voluntarily fasten up their lungis every time they start a new portion of salat. what is more astounding is that some of the elderly people take front row sits especially those beside the imam, most desirable and prestigious ones, unseating others mostly youngsters.
nimtoli tragedy
at least 119 people have died and hundreds were critically injured. it's really hard to hold back one's tears to see such a horrible tragedy. the deaths were caused by carelessness and unplanned urbanization. view the page international
