slashed adp
one ought to be surprised. and yet the news that only a third of the annual development plan has been utilized in the last seven months does not quite surprise us. and that is for the simple reason that over these past few years fund utilization has generally been low. that is in itself a telling comment on the efficiency with which the government or, more precisely, its various ministries and departments perform. as a result of the low utilization of funds this year, the adp will likely be slashed by as much as tk. 5,500 crore. in other words, in the seven months we speak of, of the total allotment for this fiscal year, 34 per cent or tk. 15, 784 crore has been spent altogether. view the page sports

speak proper bangla

govt's confrontational stance
although i am not a staunch supporter of either awami league or bnp, we (me and my family) voted for al in the last election with a lot of expectations that there may be some qualitative change as promised by the prime minister. but right from the beginning, we have seen a total u turn from all her promises. the very attitude of the prime minister to the opposition party is very negative which is quite contrary to the democratic norms. as they are now in power it is their responsibility to reach some kind of understanding and give them some respite so that the opposition feels some moral responsibility to help the government in its smooth functioning. instead, we are observing that the present government is bringing up things one after another which were never in their election mandate. forget about cheap and irresponsible election slogans like "ten taka rice per seer" or "job for every house" etc, we are observing that they are bringing up controversial issues one after another like elections under government in power, dividing dhaka city in two parts and so on with an evil design to stick to the power and creating an environment of instability, chaos and confusion. when bnp has reverted back from negative programmes like hartals, it is the government party who is resorting to undemocratic practices like giving a counter programme on 12th march endangering the peace in the country.
