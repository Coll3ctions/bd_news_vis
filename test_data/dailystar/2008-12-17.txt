monorail system: a personal view
may i refer to the report published in your newspaper on 27th november 2008 (thursday) after the roundtable titled “significance and task of rail in developing economy and communication”. prof dr m anwar hossain, vice-chancellor, ahsanullah university of science & technology (aust), dhaka has given the clear and rightful message that underground rail system would not be an economic and effective viable option to reduce traffic congestion and transport crisis. i agree 100% with prof dr. anwar hossain, about their conclusion after the round table discussion. i feel that the government and its relevant agencies should think twice, if not thrice, before they start digging mass graves all over dhaka city considering the geographical condition of our soil, electricity problems and other factors related to construction and maintenance of underground rail system.

open university
bangladesh open university (bou) is a great platform mainly for the dropped out students. it is furnished with good establishments all over bangladesh. luckily, i am a degree student of bcu. my tutorial centre (tc) is one of the colleges in dhaka, so my regional resource centre (rrc) is dhaka. this why i am to visit dhaka rrc very often to collect programme related information. but as ill luck would have it, recently i had to acquire some sad and bad experience at dhaka rrc. i want to mean that some officials concerned of the rrc don't attend the students professionally. they always seem to be annoyed with the students, so non-cooperation is a regular phenomenon at the office. very often, officials refer the students to the lower staff who are quite unable to solve the problems. there are some problems which might be solved by the officers only. actually many students don't know even where they will complain against the ill-behaved staff. even i don't know the table where i should go to for seeking remedy. it must be noticed that bou is a public university; it runs with taxpayers' money. so the students have every right to be treated well at the bou office.
