empowering women for development
while the nation celebrated the 100th international women's day, the stark reality is that the status of women has not substantially changed for the better even after an appraisal of the fact that empowering women, meaning redistributing power from men to women, can ensure more balanced development. gender inequalities in access to resources and opportunities negate the concept of human development and the spirit of democracy. empowerment that would have given the vast majority of women the choice and self- development is missing.

climate oddities: bangladesh case
despite claims of late that polar ice and mountain glaciers would not melt at the dreaded rate apprehended, bangladesh remains one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts as before. its low lying coastal belt just gets inundated whenever there is even a mild cyclone surge from the bay. only half of the calculated rise in the sea level due to envisaged lesser melting of polar ice would render quite a sizable of its population climate refugee.
safe drinking water and sanitation
while complaining about the gas and power crisis, most seem to overlook the diminishing supply of water against the increasing population in both urban and rural areas of bangladesh.
protecting crops against stresses

risk factors for oral cancer, its prevention
the death rate for oral cancer is higher than that of cancers which we hear about routinely such as cervical cancer, hodgkin's lymphoma, laryngeal cancer, cancer of the testes, and endocrine system cancers such as thyroid, or skin cancer. it is not because of the fact that it is hard to discover or diagnose, but due to the cancer being routinely discovered late in its development.

two countries, their dictators, their politics
william b. milam served as america's top diplomat in bangladesh and pakistan at points of critical and crucial significance for the two countries. you can call that a most opportune happening or a mere coincidence. but the fact that the united states government thought it proper to have milam serve in countries which once were linked through politics, indeed were a single state, is a rarity. and rare too is something else: milam witnessed the fall of general ershad in late 1990 and the beginning of a move back toward democracy; and then, in october 1999, as us ambassador to islamabad and away in california, he heard about the coup that brought general pervez musharraf to power in pakistan. and over the years since then, milam has clearly made it his preoccupation to study politics in the two countries, which again would be regarded as analyses of the similarities that have characterized their political landscapes. milam's subtitle, flirting with failure in south asia, is a pointer to the questions he has before him.
the dilemma in the middle east
the wound in the heart of the middle east has been bleeding ever since the jewish state came into existence. thousands of palestinians have been killed, hundreds have been evicted from their homes and abodes have been pulled down to make space for the growing number of jews migrating from across the world. this never-ending process has the direct support of the united states and many european allies. despite efforts at eye-washing on the part of the united states to establish peace, nothing concrete has happened. such efforts have only acted as an intoxicant to keep many a middle eastern country in a state of stupor.
innocence losing it all to hard realities
inspired by his boyhood in rural arkansas, john grisham has come up with this unique novel. set in the early summer and late fall of 1952, it is a heart rending account of a little boy's journey from innocence to experience. it is the writer's first major work outside the legal thriller genre in which he has established himself. narrated through the eyes of the seven year-old luke chandelier, the story comes with pictorial descriptions of the cotton harvesting season. arkansas, called the natural state, is depicted with picture perfect sceneries throughout the moving tale.
