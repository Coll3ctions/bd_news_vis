protect rivers and trees
recently, a daily newspaper reported that instructed by some army officers some people felled several trees beside dhanmodi lake. only when a senior citizen (a lady) and a journalist intervened that activities stopped and those doing the logging said sorry. but by that time many trees were cut. is not dhanmondi lake a public property? can anybody cut trees in this way? the contractor who was engaged to cut the trees said that those trees were for sell. would it be wrong to term this as robbery in broad daylight? our judiciary can order to punish those miscreants. i wonder whether they have any freedom to perform their duties properly. in the recent years, thousands of trees were felled by the so-called powerful people and no action, whatsoever, was taken against them. people's power need to be established in this country for an exploitation-free society and safe environment.
overcrowded shaheed minar
all kind of people are found spending time in and around the shaheed minar area all day. it is okay to hang out there since open places are becoming rare in the city these days. but when too many people hang out somewhere, the place runs the risk of being overcrowded. the vendors sell badam, jhalmuri, fried chips and ice cream. people eat food and leave the packets of chips, chocolates, puffed rice etc there, and definitely shaheed minar is not a place for doing this kind of things! i don't mean to say that people should refrain from visiting shaheed minar. one can definitely visit shaheed minar any time with friends and relatives but they must not disrespect the place. the authorities concerned should take steps to uphold the dignity of shaheed minar.

"the ballot is stronger than the bullet"
"government of the people, by the people, and for the people" --- unfortunately, lincoln's quote is not true in case of bangladesh. in our country political parties take decisions without considering the sufferings of the people. it is said that awami league is consisted of some of the most experienced and intelligent political leaders. but this political party is working against people's interest which has already damaged its image. i am astonished how such decisions come from a ruling party just for creating hindrance to a political gathering called by the opposition. i am talking about the june 11th agitation programme of the opposition.
