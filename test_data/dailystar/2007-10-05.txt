now, a truth commission for businessmen
law adviser mainul hosein's comments on the possibility of the formation of a truth commission that will give businessmen accused of corruption the scope to 'confess' and so let them get back to doing their jobs took us a bit by surprise. part of our surprise springs from the fact that the commission is meant only for businessmen. the suggestion also lacks details. while we certainly appreciate the novelty of the idea, there are some significant aspects of the issue that are not known to us. among those aspects are the probable terms of reference of the body, its legal basis, the morality governing its establishment and functions and finally the applicability of the commission's decisions. besides, to what extent does such a commission affect the working of the normal laws pertaining to criminal conduct?
manpower export to malaysia
there is no denying a sense of loss being unfortunately felt over the malaysian authorities applying a freeze on fresh intake of bangladeshi workers into their country. in the middle of last month two incidents occurred highlighting mismanagement and nexus between bangladeshi agents and their counterparts in malaysia over export of manpower to that country. bangladeshi workers' agitation and hunger strike at the bangladesh high commission premises protesting poor working conditions and a few thousand of them being stranded at the airport without any malaysian company receiving them created a disconcerting situation for all concerned. while the poor exploited workers suffered in the process and there was no satisfactory resolution of the issues, the suspension of new intake comes as a heartbreaker for the employment seekers from bangladesh. more so because an earlier ban put in 1999 had been lifted not so long ago. currently, the country is hosting about 200,000 bangladeshi workers and 100,000 more are expected to arrive in malaysia by virtue of a previous approval. the potential for intake is huge into that country.
the little things

reaz rahman on shehabuddin book
i am prompted to write this letter to tell some truths which mr. reaz rahman in his letter published in the daily star on 24 september preferred to conceal. rahman refers to his crossing over to afghanistan when he was denied permission to join bangladesh in 1971. the fact is that rahman crossed into afghanistan only in early 1973 with many thousands of other bengalis who were following the same hazardous route of the pakistan-afghanistan frontier and from there to kabul and onward to new delhi. these people after crossing the frontier to afghanistan would make their way to the indian embassy in kabul and the indian embassy would in its turn arrange air tickets from kabul to new delhi for them by afghanistan's aryana airlines. the bangladesh high commission officials in new delhi were receiving these bengalis returning from pakistan via kabul at delhi airport and arrange their onward journey to calcutta and finally their home country.
problems of teenagers
rahat, a teenager, has become a drug addict after the separation of his parents. he left his college and mixed with bad fellows and has started taking different types of intoxicants. rahat's mother has become anxious about his condition but finds no way to take him out of this. another boy from an aristocratic family has developed relationship with a woman who is older than him. this has become an acute problem in many families. the c problem is worse in the aristocratic and lower class families, rather than in any middle class family. teenage girls face the same kind of problems. the psychologists have noticed that the age between 13 to 22 is a very critical period in a person's life because most of the mental and physical changes occur during this period. the malicious attributes can easily influence them. their parents pursue them to give up addiction and they fail to do that. their fortunes are nipped in the bud. the factors behind the problems of the teenagers are :(1) too much mental pressure and rules and regulations that have been imposed by the parents, (2) mental and physical changes (3) negligence of the parents, (4) the confused and curious ideas about sex, (5) lack of family bond and religious values, (6) influence of western culture and so on. parents have to take the most important responsibility to save them from this kind of moral degradation. they have to make their children aware about their future. life is only one, so if a person has done anything wrong , there is no way to amend the fault by returning back to the past. so, the teenagers have to be cautious when they take a step. parents must make their children's life more enjoyable and panic-free. they must be friendly and expressive and they must talk with their children openly about their problems. they must teach their children about moral and religious values and also about our culture.
