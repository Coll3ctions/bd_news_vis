the death of a president
the death of polish president lech kaczynski, his wife and scores of senior polish government officials in a plane crash on saturday is a tragedy that has stunned not only the people of poland but also people across the world. that the crash occurred even as the president and his team were on their way to mark the 70th anniversary of the massacre of 20,000 polish soldiers in the katyn forest by soviet forces makes the tragedy doubly heart-rending. more important is the fact that the plane crash has left almost the entire polish government bereft of its key figures. it is one of those tragic instances which, in hindsight, leave a good number of thoughts for people to mull over. fundamental among these thoughts is whether it is wise for a large team of government figures, in any country, to travel together. the probability of disaster overtaking the entire team becomes very real. in the polish case, a combination of weather conditions and an inability on the part of the authorities to consider the chances of a disaster has now led to unmitigated tragedy. view the page sports

rural development
the state of rural development was not so deplorable in the remote past. it is clear that the villagers did not suffer from food crisis at least. but at present, villagers are failing to meet the bare necessities of life such as food, clothing, education, medicine, housing etc. it is because the population is increasing at a higher rate than production. besides, villagers are not getting modern technology, which they can use to increase their production. moreover, only 28% of the rural people are literate and the number of educational institutions is inadequate. for the village people technical and vocational education is very important. of course, it is a matter of hope for us that the literacy rate is now 65%, according to a government survey. all the mills and factories are situated in towns and as the people of the villages are moving towards towns, rural development is becoming slower.

natural disasters caused by climate change have a tremendous impact on the livestock population of bangladesh. livestock suffers large-scale death in cyclonic storms. prolonged floods can also cause such deaths. during droughts, livestock in bangladesh do not suffer death, but lack of water increases their vulnerability to diseases.
blame game
blaming each other is the cultural heritage of the ill political practice witnessed by the people of bangladesh over the years. the ongoing shortage of electricity and gas has created a looming crisis in the scorching heat of summer across the country.
talk show
i was watching the prestigious talk show " tritiyo matra" on 01 april, 2010, i found there were two guests-- . ferdous akhter wahida (ex-mp) and aupu ukil (mp), both of them blamed each other for their party's past and present activities likes poor performance, corruption and the war crimes issue.
water cries
i congratulate abdul hannan for his illuminating piece. 'tighten your water taps to fight the water crisis' published in your daily on monday last (april 5). it graphically juxtaposes the fact that while the richest nation, america so jealously guards any wastage of water, we in bangladesh, a rank poor nation do it with no qualms of conscience. what a bewildering irony! it is high time that the government enacts a water policy forthwith and puts it through urgently to prevent further wastage of this precious commodity--water. perceptively, the brewing summer of discontent has much of its roots in water.
understanding big bang!
according to reuters report, published on march 31 in a local daily, scientists now have smashed sub-atomic (really small, or mathematically: smallx10 to the power minus infinity) particles of matter to re-enact the big bang, hopefully in a very small way!
attestation
to apply for a job and so on, one needs academic certificates as well as photographs to be attested. regrettably, one has to face harassment after going to a first class gazetted officer. because most of the officers normally do not agree to attest our documents without a pre-familiarity. if one can manage a peon with tips for the purpose, then he gets the documents attested easily. it is an open secret that now almost all are using fake seals and signatures in respect of attestation. earlier, much was written about it. but no initiative has yet been taken.
gulf air
its first flight was in 1950. till then it has been serving passengers from all over the world. bangladeshi workers who go abroad & bring remittance to our economy are also well-acquainted with the gulf air. congratulations, gulf air.
unbearable load shedding
in our area kalabagan, we are experiencing digital load shedding i.e. 2 hours x 5 = 10 hours a day out of 24 hours. every day we are burning 20 litres of diesel to run the generator to supplement the power supply. it is understood that this diesel is not home grown, it is imported from abroad with foreign currency. like us hundreds of city dwellers are doing the same thing. had the government been serious, with these hard earned foreign currencies, it could have very well built the necessary infrastructure for power generation.
health and progress
the concept of health-led progress is not a new-fangled one it surfaced at alma-ata and is also set up in the 1993 world development report. health, seen as a form of human asset and not just an output from the growth process, deserves to join education as a key policy instrument for promoting the success of developing countries.
child workers
this is in reference to your article on children working at balloon factories without any protection. in my opinion, people living in bangladesh are very selfish and non-caring.
war crimes and jamaat

a sweet name
recently aktel has changed its name into robi, a very sweet name. the name is very significant. firstly, it is the synonym of surya, the sun. secondly, it is the name of a day i.e. sunday. thirdly, the name has a strong affinity with the name of world poet tagore. last but not the least, this name is cent percent bangla. thus the name is not only sweet but also royal.
us security measures
the major shake-up of air travel security measures announced by the us, will definitely help them in avoiding unnecessary wild goose chase. this will be easing the agony of innocent people from 14 countries, who were targeted by the previous measures. the current system was worked out long before but took time to come into effect.
