garment sector's achilles heel
after each episode of violence and vandalism wreaked by garment workers in the ashulia factory belt, one would have expected a bit of wizening to avert another round of indulgence in self-destruction. but this was not to be -- after a spell of uneasy lull induced through adhocism, back again on a suicidal track!
suicide attacks in pakistan
the increasing frequency with which terrorists are targeting pakistan's security and defence establishment demonstrates the ever-escalating levels of danger posed to the country. this past week alone there have been two suicide attacks, the second one taking lahore in its vicious grip on friday. this latest attack has left no fewer than 45 people dead and scores of others severely injured. the worry is that this new attack was targeted at the army, which included the cantonment, homes of military officials and institutions such as hospitals and schools run by the army. the bigger worry is that where the aim earlier was to spread fear among soldiers, it now appears that these suicide bombers have widened the net to include anyone and everyone related to the military. of the greatest significance is the fact that the terrorists are these days finding it rather easy to penetrate the perimeters of the security establishment in the country. they have killed policemen, soldiers and others before and now they feel they can keep doing it with ease. view the page sports

weekly currency roundup
march 7-march 11, 2010
international markets
the euro steadied against the dollar and yen in quiet trade on thursday, recovering from earlier falls after strong chinese data fuelled expectations of possible further monetary tightening by beijing. chinese inflation rose to a 16-month high and other economic data showed broad-based strength, boosting safe-haven flows into the yen and dollar against the euro and perceived riskier assets. the yen's rally later fizzled out; however, as the market took the view that the economic recovery in china remained broadly on track to drive global growth. the euro was steady against the swiss franc at 1.4608 francs after earlier falling to a one-month low around 1.4597 as markets awaited a swiss national bank policy decision. the snb is expected to keep interest rates very low and maintain its policy of foreign exchange intervention to curb any excessive appreciation in the swiss currency and aid switzerland's nascent economic recovery. analysts said many in the market expect the snb to tone down its rhetoric on intervention, but traders were also wary that the central bank may be ready to step in if the franc appreciates too much as a result. this kept the euro steady against the franc, with traders reporting good demand for euro/swiss options ahead of the snb's policy assessment. the australian dollar rose 0.1 percent against the us dollar, cutting earlier losses made after the strong chinese data and on data showing a smaller-than-expected rise in australian employment. the new zealand dollar fell 0.2 percent against the us dollar after the central bank said there was no urgency to lift interest rates. view the page metropolitan

madrasa education
it is a piece of good news that the government has taken the initiative to modernise the madrasa education system. the purpose is to produce islamic scholars imbued with the knowledge of science and technology. in the holy quran, there are at least 800 verses which are directly related to science and technology revealing the basic tenets of cosmology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, genetics, geology and marine science. the glorious past of muslim rule claims that there were 17 universities in muslim spain whereas europe was far behind in establishing such qualified institutions at that time. this proves how advanced the muslims were in spreading education and civilization. so, the present degradation and distress of the muslim world is due to their isolation from the scientific and technological research of the holy quran.
grading system
in our country we see different types of education system. but at the university level we see the pretty much same education system. but there is another problem at the university level. usually, the better students get admitted in the public universities. but public university students are not getting the proper logistical support and proper environment for study which should be a matter of concern for the government right now. and it is going to be worse day by day. when the students complete their graduation and post graduation from universities, they face the grade problem. the school and college students who have completed their school level recently are getting much higher marks than their seniors got in the past.
save our tigers
at least seven royal bengal tigers were killed in the adjoining areas of the sundarbans in the last 11 years when the wild animal entered localities in search of food. villagers beat six tigers to death and shot dead another during the period.
terrestrial service
in 1996, during the rule of the awami league, chittagong tv centre started their terrestrial broadcasting with their daily programmes all over the country, so we could watch it from every corner of the country. but while the bnp came to power, they stopped it. and the “closing practice” is still there. the present government, committed to making a digital bangladesh, is expected to take steps so that chittagong tv centre can re-launch their national terrestrial broadcasting with more extended time, wider and colourful arrangement.
student politics
the british east india company left the sub-continent in 1947. their goal was to loot and plunder the resources of the country. from the activities of the politicians, it can very well be said that the frankenstein of the british east india company still lives on among them.
the prime minister
i am feeling so sorry for prime minister sheikh hasina, almighty allah gave her the opportunity, by availing it she could have become a saint-like person, people would have looked upon her with awe and admiration. she would have been treated as an icon, people would have remembered her as an idol.
state honour
the practice of honouring the dead at the state level surprises me. some four to five solders/policemen salute the coffin wearing shoes. they also play flute. it can not be an honour for a muslim after his/her death. some ayats of the holy quran should be recited after making ablution and sura fatiha must be recited. otherwise, the state honour is pointless and the departed souls do not get any peace from it.
medicare
as the expenses of medical care have mounted in a lot of countries, much concentration is focused on incompetence, the occurrence of unproven interventions and the strange practice variations from one geographic area to another.
pmo on solar power
running the prime minister's office on solar power has set a national example for the country to go for all measures in adopting alternative energy options. this should create the awareness on the urgent national need for mobilising alternative energy sources, given our fast receding natural gas reserves and the lack of other local energy resources. the hon. pm should instruct the ministry of information so that this awareness is well projected in all our audio-visual and print media, both official and private, to generate public interest and awareness.
honouring the heroes
language martyrs are our national pride, as there is only one nation in the world that has the history of sacrificing life for language. for honouring them on 21st february we come to shaheed minar barefooted. foreigners also come without shoes, as they evaluate properly the heroes of the language movement.
partisan government
the al is hell-bent on sorting out pro-jamaat officers for giving them forced retirement, or at least putting them on osd status. now our unabashedly partisan government has started to point finger to jamaat-bnp for every trouble and humiliate, intimidate and torture them to smother their voice.
for god's sake... why?
this refers to your captioned commentary, published in the 18th february issue of the daily star. this write-up inspires me to write something more about the 'name-game' of the government.
a testing year
after browsing through the first supplement of the daily star's 19th anniversary issue, i sighed with relief. the learned contributors have pointed out issues which are not broached by our politicians and by the mps in national parliament. the well-off political leaders handle national issues through the party angles and give lower priority to mass issues which are not in party interest. this sham display of political rhetoric in depicting democracy continues even after four decades after the learning process started since 1972. this supplement spotlighted views from the non-political society leaders.
for a peaceful planet
to my sheer ecstasy, i chanced to read some long-missing blissful words titled 'prayer for peace' written by tapan kumar shil published in the daily star on january 23. with our beloved planet long-starved of peace, security and hope, being perpetually bedevilled with man-manufactured miseries, these words echo the yearnings of all peace-loving people. inconsolably enough, our afflictions are not effected by the aliens. thus the planet named 'earth' will remain strife-stricken in perpetuity, eventually forcing hopeless 'humanity' to sob away into evanescence? and undeniably, we owe a debt of gratitude to the poet for producing and to my beloved ds for disseminating those soothing words.
sincerity is not enough
a government's performance in our times is dependent on the presence of an administrative system not hostage to politicisation or subject to excessive centralisation. in this context, the prime minister and her administration must move swiftly toward initiating and implementing administrative reforms. a mere expression of intent is not enough. over the past three decades, a raft of recommendation has been made about reforming the bureaucracy. it is time to go back to them and update them and indeed, get things moving again. only that will see a fulfilment of promises.
killing by bsf
yet another bangladeshi was killed on 4 march by the bsf (ds, 5 march,2010). i really fail to understand how we talk about a blooming friendship while they keep killing our countrymen almost every alternate day, if not daily.
medical check up
shame on our doctors and the medical system. our doctors are not qualified enough even to perform a routine medical check up! is this the reason that the president has to go to singapore for a medical check up or is it because it does not cost him anything? or is it our politician's utter disrespect for anything bangladeshi? if the president thinks that our doctors and medical system is not good enough for him, why can't he do something to improve it? perhaps what is good enough for millions of ordinary people is not good enough for him. what else can be expected from our politicians?
trial of war criminals
in 1974 india signed the simla pact with pakistan because of which 90,000 pows with 195 war criminals went back to pakistan.
protecting people?
president obama did not dramatically change at all the surveillance policies of his predecessor. this strategy has made it simpler for the us government to spy on every american and millions of others around the world, you would think that eight or nine years now after the 9/11 attacks, the government would have done a better job just getting management over the information it already had. view the page international
