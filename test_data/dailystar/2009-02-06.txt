humility, not humiliation
the gandhi peace foundation once published a compilation, which included an essay from famous economist kenneth e. boulding. in why did gandhi fail, he argued that it was a fatal mistake for a weak nation to behave as if it were a strong one, which was precisely what india was doing. that was way back in 1964, when the country was still finding its feet on the ground. if alive, boulding would have wanted to eat his words. india is a strong nation today.

the occasional one-off incident aside, australia and new zealand share a strong cricketing relationship and encounters between the teams are generally friendly. unfortunately, one of those out-of-the-ordinary occurrences came up at the waca last sunday, when brad haddin's gloves appeared to knock the bail off when neil broom was adjudged bowled. it has sparked a vigorous to-and-fro and while both teams want to put it behind them, it is yet to be seen whether tensions will remain in the second match at the melbourne cricket ground today.

[online glossary of the british institute for learning & development]. and, on the flip side, e-inclusion is overcoming the digital divide using systems developed to lessen the risk of 'e-exclusion'.
broken promises
last general election of bangladesh was really an exciting experience for me. i was able to vote for the first time. that is why i made sure i did not vote for the wrong party or candidate. i searched for my answer in the past records of our country. both the leaders of the most powerful parties have been involved in corruption. so choosing between two was a dilemma for me. it was as if i had to choose between a snake and a crocodile as a pet. that is why i went for the so called “no vote” option. i urged my friends to do so. literally, i ran a mini campaign for this option. despite my decision i had sub-consciously hoped that if awami league came to power, things might change. people change and learn from their mistakes. but now i think that i was right all along. as soon as they came to power jcl, the student wing of the ruling party, took over the chittagong university as if it was some kind of a business. awami league must be forgetting the promises they had made before the election. they are underestimating the power of the general public. i guess just like bnp next election will mean end for awami league as well.

top of the news of this week is the trial of the war criminals of 1971. undoubtedly, it is a great decision of the government. we the bangladeshi people have been waiting for the day for 38 years. this process was strongly supported by the ctg, and for this reason i want to give heartiest thanks to the ctg. we know that most of the senior jamaat leaders are blamed for this war crime. how the trial will be directed? my question is, if an al leader is found involved in this incidence then whether the trial would be fair or not? according to "sujon" an al leader was also involved in the crime.

load shedding
it is bad news for us, that though it is winter season we face load shedding. not only in the villages, but also in the cities we see this problem. load shedding is a national problem. at the time of the caretaker government this problem was acute. they could not ensure electricity. now a new govt. is in power. they promised to solve electricity problem.
baitul mukarram mosque
the problem at baitul mukarram remains unresolved. the khatib was appointed by the outgoing caretaker government. we do not know on what basis a khatib is appointed and by whom? why was it not possible for the ctg to confirm the acting khatib? i think the shadow of deliberate misrule (?) of the ctg is still haunting our society and might eventually spread all over. the activities of the then law and religious ministry needs to be reviewed and made public.
ban student politics
after the national election of december 29, most of the campuses of the public universities of bangladesh have become very turbulent. the rank and file of bcl have become desperate to establish their supremacy. the tug of war has destabilized the congenial atmosphere of the prominent educational institutions of our country. actually, student politics is a great setback to the educational progress in our country. the general students cannot carry on with their studies smoothly due to nefarious student politics. view the page international
