the conflict between development and environment still remains unresolved. industrial revolution in the 1780s, green revolution in the 1960s gave great prosperity to humankind but snatched away many things of importance and in some cases caused irreversible damages. england first had the industrial revolution and edwin chadwick in 1842, 70 years after the industrial revolution submitted the world's first famous report on water pollution to the british parliament. following the start of green revolution, silent spring published by ms. rachel carson indicated the toxicity of insecticides such as ddt in 1962.

the magic in literature
when omar khayyam wrote, "i desire a little ruby wine and a book of verses, just enough to keep me alive, and half a loaf is needful" in the eleventh century, he was pretty convinced that reading was one of the most important aspects in a person's happiness. after all these years, the appeal of books and reading them has remained the same. a good work of fiction or a thought-provoking poem is capable of leaving a lifetime impact on people's minds. it won't be an overstatement to say that khayyam left some perfect lines for book lovers to apply to their thoughts on literature.

'every moment spent with you . . .'
what happens if one day you are caught cheating on your valentine; what happens even if the heart is broken into a thousand pieces? does it really matter? after a bomb blast, trees are uprooted; buildings blown sky high; and sounds of window panes breaking are heard from afar. but have you ever heard a heart break? buildings are reconstructed with improved looks; trees are replanted with imported saplings; but what happens to the broken heart? the crevice never heals!

and the winds scream
the earth trembles
as the heat rises
from the earths core
when the lightning dies
quiet descends
the warm soaked earth
is radiant
with the musky scent
of satiated love. view the page star health

the star, until the sun came out . . .
heidi holland subtitles her otherwise revealing work on robert mugabe as 'the untold story of a freedom fighter who became a tyrant.' that, if you remember, is how the west has portrayed the president of zimbabwe for the past many years. to be sure, mugabe has himself provided his critics with the ammunition to fire away at him. his increasing intolerance of dissent, his refusal to accept what was perceived to be a clear victory not long ago at the presidential election for morgan tsangvirai and his condoning of a land grab by his followers (who called themselves freedom fighters) have in a big way tarnished his reputation worldwide but especially in the west. even so, holland's assessment of the man who has led zimbabwe since it achieved freedom in 1980 through the lancaster house agreement reached the previous year appears to be directed at discovering as many signs of the 'monstrosity' mugabe has become over the years.
romeo and juliet redux
how many times has the romeo and juliet story been retold? having asked that question, i'm not certain that eritrean writer sulaiman addonia had shakespeare in mind when he wrote his evocative story of two star-crossed lovers, not in eritrea but in saudi arabia. however, the publishers of the consequences of love highlight the connection to a story that depicts the near impossibility of love in such a stultifying and repressive country. the young lovers, naser and fiore, have eritrean parentage, but the obstacle they encounter as foreigners attempting to fulfill their love is not familial but religious: fundamentalism.
