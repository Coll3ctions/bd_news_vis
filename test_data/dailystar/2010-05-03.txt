observing may day!
each year, all over the world, the historic may day is observed through arranging different programmes. in bangladesh, the workers feel gratified as it is a national holiday. nothing additional is achieved or felt by its stakeholders. is it all about that day of sacrifice?
rmg sector's future
has anybody gone through the opex workers demand list? they are asking for revision of minimum pay scale from tk.1663 to 5000, attendance bonus increase to tk.500, & yearly leave encashment, + 6 months' maternity leave (for all those who are not familiar, none are included in our existing factory acts! ) so, basically all these demands are over the law requirements. these issues can at best be requests but definitely not demands.
desertification
desertification means land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub- humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities, leading to reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rain fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands. bangladesh experiences long spells of dry weather and moderate to severe droughts are spread over a region of 5.46 million ha. during the 7-month dry season in some regions, the evapotranspiration exceeds the amount of rainfall by a factor of 2.0. between 1960 and 1991, droughts occurred in bangladesh 19 times. very severe droughts hit the country in 1951, 1961, 1975, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1984, and 1989. certain physical observations of desertification are:
water crisis
a detailed front-page report on the subject was published on 25th april in a local english daily. unfortunately, it was more confusing than clarifying! there were major errors in it, both language wise and technical. i would like to point out a few glaring anomalies.
sheraton hotel
the dhaka sheraton hotel is the oldest five star hotel of our country. previously, it was called hotel intercontinental. it is situated in one of the best locations of dhaka city beside the picturesque ramna park. the hotel is a govt. property and run by a board selected by the govt.. but they have no experience of operating five star hotels.
no place for cars
karwan bazar market is in the heart of dhaka city which caters for wholesale and retail markets of the central dhaka area. previously, there was not much vehicular traffic in this area. but of late with a five star hotel, many large commercial establishments, banks, insurance companies, 2 tv stations, two major national newspaper offices and other establishments, this area has become very important. throughout day & night people come here and face a serious car parking problem. many people are compelled to park their vehicles at any place available which causes a serious traffic jam. in front of the karwan bazar there is a "car parking" space, but these are all the time occupied by a large "fleet of mini trucks". this is used 24 hours as their "garage." most of the other places are occupied by vehicles of different companies.
ershad's suggestion
former president ershad, a veteran politician, is bold enough to suggest publicly the formation of provinces in bangladesh and making dhaka a federal capital (like islamabad and new delhi). but the other political leaders, especially belonging to the two major (dynastic) parties and the mps won't agree, due to obvious subjective advantages.
rights of women
it is islam that has comprehensibly given womenfolk the right to education, training and so on. a good mother obviously means the one having proper education as well as skills to keep pace with time.
dowry
the bride's family has to collect a huge amount of money for their daughters or sisters' marriage. sometimes they are to take loan, sell their land, furniture, ornaments and even their house to collect the money. they are to lose many things and face many problems due to this dowry system.
mindset
dr. sn mamoon's letter “ bnp's tears” on 26 april caught my attention because it not only illustrates dr mamoon's mindset but that of a large majority of supporters of both the parties in particular, and all our political parties in general.
stock market
some endemic problems have been bedeviling the investors especially those who are new and small. these relate to mutual funds that were embroiled in a court case for over a year in 2008-09 resulting in non-payment of dividends since 2007. even after the high court has given a clear-cut ruling about the issuance of stock dividends and right shares, some of the lucrative companies are facing problems in payment of declared stock dividends for 2008 and 2009. in fact the oldest of these aims 1st mutual fund has virtually disappeared from the trading board for well over a month after the sec vetoed their dividend and right declaration. what is going on here is also not known as both aims & sec are silent? meanwhile thousands of mutual fund investors are suffering.
recipe for change
bangladesh is country of immense potentiality. despite being so, we couldn't achieve major goals even after 38 years of independence, whereas other countries achieved the goals within a relatively a short period of time. what is the obstacle that keeps us backward with every passing year? the most obvious cause is that we, as a nation, fail to appreciate anything good. we never applaud any positive approach, nor do we nourish goods ideas. we always think about the negative impacts. to be precise, we hardly apprehend anything good. this negative attitude of ours towards everything is the prime cause of our falling behind other modern nations.
punish the stalkers
it has been observed since a long time that the girls in the streets, villages and even in colleges and universities become the worst victims of the stalkers. it is astounding and alarming news that even in the university of dhaka girl students are frequently teased and if anyone comes forward to protest it, he is allegedly attacked by the supporters of the ruling party. whoever might be those miscreants, be it of the ruling party or the party in opposition, or the sons of the king or any queen, it is the time to take stiff and stern action against those miscreants, if we really want to save our sisters and daughters from the oppression and torture by those evil forces. the time is not very far away when the people will lynch them if the government fails to take timely and effective measures against those vicious elements of society.
trip to puthia
i looked around, awed, surprised, mesmerized at the temples looming on other side, their reflections on the filthy, grubby water, small polythene bags floating near the edge--not quite an introduction to the estate once governed by kings wearing wide, large turbans--the impression i had gained from 'gupi gain bagha bain' movie. it reminds me of the king's moustache, its sheer black depths and it is truly depressing to take note of the fact, that there no longer are the kings, queens and countless servants to obey their orders, except the remnants of the magnificence they have left behind which still continues to hypnotize us by their beauty, and the strength they show standing straight and imposing, regardless of the fact that countless years have gone by and they are in dire need of repairs.
sovereign credit rating
bangladesh has recently got credit rating by two internationally reputed organisations. it has created positive feelings among the people who want to see bangladesh as a promising economy and a middle income country within the next few years. bangladesh has achieved this level for its performance in maintaining stable economic outlook for the last one decade. it maintains almost 6% gdp growth for around a decade. its foreign reserve condition, restoration of democratic process, macro- economic indices were very much supportive in achieving this rating.
