bangabandhu murder case judgement
the supreme court's upholding of the convictions of the killers of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and his family should now bring a long national agony to an end. the pains the nation has gone through since the father of the nation and most members of his family were cut down on 15 august 1975 have also been for it a living shame. the shame stems from the fact that for twenty-one years from 1975 to 1996, the course of justice was obstructed by the infamous indemnity ordinance protecting the assassins. the ordinance, decreed by the usurper regime of khondokar moshtaq in september 1975, was incorporated in the constitution through the fifth amendment by the ziaur rahman regime in 1979. nowhere in the world has there been such an instance of a deliberate closing of all avenues to justice. and this was the shame we lived with, until the awami league government led by sheikh hasina repealed the black law in 1996 and brought bangabandhu's assassins to trial. in november 1998, bangabandhu's assassins were condemned to death. the process unfortunately was not taken to a logical judicial conclusion. the delays, the frequent instances of judges feeling embarrassed to hear the appeals of the convicted and the clear, pathetic indifference of the bnp-jamaat alliance government toward pursuing the case were to lead to a stalemate. despite exhortations to reconstitute the bench by placing new judges there, the then government kept looking the other way. it could have done better.

future of parliamentary democracy in bangladesh
parliamentary democracy is a way of life that demands of its adherents qualities like tolerance, respect for differing views and freedom for all to express their grievances and seek legitimate remedies. the raison d'etre of our war of independence was parliamentary democracy, and that commitment had been reflected in the constitution although subsequent amendments stood in the way of smooth functioning of parliamentary democracy. parliamentary democracy, despite the fact that it is very expensive, is the best form of governance in the contemporary world.

relocating factories
tawfiq ali's report on this important matter, published by you on 8 november, is the current headache for metropolitan dhaka city. the report related is to the growing environment pollution of the city. the report also clearly points out the illegal activities of a number of public bodies and utilities in permitting the location of the factories in dhaka city, in the first place! the vice president of gulshan society has stated that at least one hundred factories are located in the gulshan residential area for which we the residents here have to suffer the most. it deprives us of water and power facilities which are usurped by these illegal factories!
obama's achievement
another big achievement by the us president. the house of representatives has passed the hcr bill by 220 to 215 votes. the significant issues are that 39 democrats representatives voted against the bill, and only 1 republican congressman has voted in favour. this is already known all over.
rickshaws- should we continue this way?
well, i didn't think i would have to write so soon again on this topic. but my friend mr. sikander (thanks to him for considering me a friend) has once more compelled me to write back. before i continue, i would like to request mr. sikander to look at the front page picture of the daily ittefaq dated november 6, 09 with the caption “city's busiest road dainik bangla crossing is almost obstructed due to rickshaws” which perhaps will bring him to reality and the nuisance rickshaws are creating in our city.
zoonotic diseases
zoonotic diseases are those transmitted from animal to human and vice-versa. we know that zoonotic infection spreads rapidly under rural conditions, especially in the developing countries. no systemic data is presently available to evaluate the socio-economic impact of diseases in general and zoonoses in particular. although livestock is the main source of meat and milk for human consumption, human health hazards associated with these foods of animal origin have great importance from the public health point of view. diseases like avian influenza, rabies, tb , brucellosis, tetanus , amoebiasis, cysticercosis, fascialiosis etc are found to be common as zoonotic disease in bangladesh. approximately 2,000 people who come into contact with rabid animals die of hydrophobia annually in bangladesh. tb of cattle can be transmitted to man through contact with diseased animals or their products like milk or meat. milkman and other people drinking raw milk are infected with brucellosis each year in bangladesh. amoebiasis is a common disease among the rural people of our country.
season of waste!
the yearly ritual of wastefulness has begun and this usually lasts till march. during these 4-5 months, the privileged class (net worth 10 crore +) indulges in their annual orgy of throwing lavish parties in 3*,4*,5* hotels, clubs, resorts and convention centres. the occasion could be anything, though birthdays, engagements, weddings are still the most common by far. receipt of a foreign award (purchased or wangled?), arrival of a 'foreign dignitary' (junior minister from moldavia, for instance), academic degrees obtained by children in some foreign university, etc, are also some of the fit excuses for the parties.
overburdened city
our economic & administrative activities and infrastructural developments are centralized in dhaka as the capital city. nowadays, dhaka is worst affected by acute traffic congestion that leads to loss of working hours as well as costly fuel imported with foreign exchange. our economy is not in a position to allow this type of luxury. however, the only positive aspect of the acute traffic congestion is- it makes people read newspapers!!
role of teachers
the new age in its front-page article of november 8th, 2009 quoted a dhaka university professor saying that he does not support public university academics working as consultants because it “warrants no creativity” and that “teachers should be engaged only in teaching”. i strongly disagree with both these statements.
