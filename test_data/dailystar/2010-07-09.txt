policy on checking mobile phone crime
the government plans to have in place a policy designed to check mobile phone-related crimes. no one can deny that of late threats, intimidation and extortion through use of mobile phones have risen to quite an alarming degree. these crimes vary in nature but in the end leave those affected in various degrees of distress. in the first place, it is generally young women who are the targets of unsolicited calls, to a point where these calls turn into harassment. in the second, sometimes families are the recipients of calls that leave them in a state of agitation. in the third place (and this is the worst), individuals are often threatened over mobile phones and generally asked to pay the caller and his associates a toll, failing which those at the receiving end might be in trouble. in such instances, the callers take care to hide the numbers of the phones they are calling from.

a news report was published in a local english daily on june 29. it indicated that according to the survey carried out by comprehensive disaster management programme (cdmp); 78,000 out of 326,000 buildings in greater dhaka is at risk of earthquake damage. unfortunately, there was no indication, that at what level of intensity (in the richter scale of 1 to10)), this devastation is most likely to occur. not that it will effect the immediate "first aid' level of safety and precaution from being taken; as that is necessary for everyone to ensure safety of his or her own life!

eve teasing
whenever the issue of 'eve-teasing' comes up, men usually comment that modern women 'crave' for it. then they boldly add that the kind of clothes women wear these days in public places invite harassment. the question generally arises what do women wear in public places? other than few exceptions in the posh zones, what do women wear in public places? fourteen female students committed suicides in bangladesh in the last few months. they were teased, harassed verbally and physically while they were going to their educational institutions. if indecent clothing is the reason, then can someone answer how these unfortunate girls wearing school uniform provoke men ?

dhaka, then and now
“ expedients, are for the hour, but principles are for the ages.”
airport
my workplace is very close to the airport from where i hear the roaring of both civil and military aircrafts all day long. along with that, we the north and south sides are chosen for take off and landing respectively. may be the growing skyscrapers on the south side of the airport, i.e. banani, gulshan and motijheel c/a, are the reason that made the former zia such a handicapped airport. such a functional diminution of an international airport in no way adds to the safe movement of aero-vehicles in and out of it. in addition to that, a new trouble has been added to the system --the ear blasting noise of the jet fighters.
jamaat leaders
i was wondering why the government had been so lenient to the jamaat till its top leaders were arrested that too on the flimsy ground of hurting the religious sentiment of the public. the jamaat justifies their islamic authenticity by the amount of suffering they undergo at the hands of the incumbent. but they should keep in mind that people all over the world were and are being persecuted not necessarily for their belief. as far as i have studied islam, the jamaat-e-islami is not on the right track because they deliberately hide some key facts of islam. one of them is the special significance of the ahle bayet we sufi muslims so strongly believe in. besides, in violation of the islamic tenets, the jamaat believes in their dubious version of democracy. as they vacillate in theology, they are seen veering to this party or that party for their support. so people cannot have confidence on them. this is the very submissive nature of jamaat that prevented them from supporting bangladesh's freedom movement. i think it is the jamaat's cardinal crime.
