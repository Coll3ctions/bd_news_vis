weekly currency roundup
feb 7- feb 11, 2010
international markets
this was a very volatile week due to the swirling speculation about the extent of support for greece, although currency moves have calmed down ahead of the meeting in brussels of the european union's 27 leaders, along with economic advisers, the head of the european central bank and other officials. it is expected that a political agreement will be reached on helping greece. the euro edged higher on thursday, underpinned by that expectation of a potential rescue package for greece. elsewhere, australia's jobless rate hit an 11-month low and chinese inflation moderated, prompting a rally in the australian dollar and supporting risk-taking sentiment. concern over how athens will service its debt has hammered the euro; it is down nearly 10 percent versus the dollar since late 2009, but it has found its footing this week as expectations of an aid package have firmed. the euro was supported by tighter yield spreads between greek government bonds and their german counterparts considered the safest in the euro zone on optimism an agreement on greece would be reached later. investors remain wary that greece is not the only euro zone country suffering from fiscal woes, as indicated by simmering concerns about debt-impaired portugal and spain. view the page metropolitan
