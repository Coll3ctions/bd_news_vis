sudden, bloody death in india
the suspected involvement of maoists in the train crash which left at least a hundred dead in west bengal on friday renews fears of the threats india faces from these extremist elements. the very fact that since february this year the maoist guerrillas have been making violent raids on targets in west bengal and chhattisgarh, in the process causing the deaths of scores of people, says a whole lot about the horrific and mindless lengths to which extremism can go in staging such orgies of destruction. it also points to the desperate measures they appear to be adopting in their war against the establishment. this desperation becomes clear from the fact that the maoists are now beginning to target civilians, a clear change in strategy considering that earlier the focus was on soldiers and policemen. obviously, with the indian government going in for a direct, no-holds-barred assault on maoist strongholds, the rebels find themselves in a beleaguered position. it is a back-to-the-wall approach that they now have decided on. the consequences have been horrendous.

material quest?
advertising to children has become big business in recent years. all around the world, children spend a lot of time watching television. such prolonged hours of tv expose them to various advertisements, convincing them to buy. as kids are becoming more powerful consumers, marketers are targeting them more bluntly. advertisers are letting their imagination run wild using catchy jingles, dances and cartoons, portraying mysterious worlds, implying false reality. young children have difficulty distinguishing between advertisements and reality, and may not understand that ads are there with pure intention to sell something for profit. additionally, many parents feel guilty about buying products for their child but they worry that by constantly saying “no” they will increase their child's depression. parents, meanwhile, in their earnestness to give the best to their children may go a bit overboard with their generosity and give in to their endless demands.
joy and tarique
the perpetuation of the dynasty rules and the culture of obeying two leaders of the mujib & zia families have become the norm in our politics. bangabandhu & zia, by dedicating their lives to the freedom struggle, earned the right to lead the country. but the same cannot be said about the later day sheikhs and zias. as long as the ruling and opposition parties retain their outdated, feudal organisational structures, where sycophancy, nepotism, and ad-holism rule, a revival of their past glory will be a far cry. so can joy and tarique as leaders help?

criminal behaviour
a local english daily reported on the matter on 22nd. may. it was a disgusting and deplorable criminal act. more so is the impotence of the law enforcing units of police and rab who in this matter seems to be 'sucking their thumbs', although police had apprehended a few persons! are the law enforcers a party to the crime, given their indifference to it? can they not take any initiative?
khaleda's call and public reaction
on 19 may khaleda zia called a dawn to dusk hartal for 27 june for what she called, electricity, gas and water for dhakaites. in her public speech, she told the nation that the present government has done nothing during the last one year or so. the supply of electricity, water and gas that people are enjoying at present are her own legacy. this government has not added any unit of those utilities.
nuclear power generation
the setting up of atomic power station has become the crying need as the people of bangladesh are facing many problems over the years due to the shortage of power generation. power generation has become the key index for the continuous development of a nation. for example, we can cite china where the production of power generation is doubling every year and the country has already secured the position of the 2nd largest economy after usa. needless to say, power generation ensures the rapid growth of production and hence takes the pivotal role to boost the gdp of the country. according to statistics, bangladesh is a country having only 3000 to 3500 mw power generation but our demand is more than 5000 mw. the deficit of power generation is around 3,000mw.there is no controversy that power sector is the driving force for the continuous development of a country, especially for a least developed country like bangladesh. considering the projected demand, it is advisable for the govt to step onwards for setting up the atomic power station. the recent visit of foreign minister dr. dipu moni to russia will open a new horizon of bilateral relationship between bangladesh and russia. as a least developed country, bangladesh would be benefited in different ways. making the frame-work deal with russia, setting up of an atomic power station would be possible and that would contribute to lessening load shedding as well as meeting the projected demand of the country.
dress code in islam
in an article entitled “religion and women” published in the daily star on may 18, 2101,columnist mr. chaklader mahboob-ul alam commented, “as far as the dress code is concerned, the holy quran requires both men and women to dress and behave modestly. nowhere does it ask women to wear burkha (full veils).”
smoking
as a matter of fact, we all know about the ill-effects of cigarette smoking and tobacco use but a smoker really is helpless against this menacing addiction. when he has to, he 'will' smoke. the 'will' is associated with the short-term effects. let us see the quick-effects of a cigarette smoke that makes a man physically and mentally dependent on it.
moral development of children
a child is compared to a bud in which the potentiality of sweet smell is concealed. usually a bud needs a favourable environment to be bloomed well; like a child needs a good family environment and care to be developed morally. here, moral development means learning of good manners or behaviour and formation of character immaculately.
traffic at nccrhd gate
every day of the week, except friday, thousands of patients, their attendants, medical students and on-duty physicians and other professionals and visitors who have business at the hospital and the medical college have to cross the mirpur road on foot or by car to enter the hospital and college premises from early morning to evening. the mirpur road in front of the hospital is always filled up with all types of speeding motor vehicles, especially the big buses which never slow down to allow the pedestrians and physicians' cars to enter the hospital and college. every entrant to the hospital has to risk his/her life and fear damage of the vehicle in their attempts to enter. considering the arrogance of the bus drivers and reckless driving of cars, people and physicians cross the road and enter the hospital at great risk of being run over. there is a traffic signal but all bus and car drivers disregard it.
ideological warfare!
the two major political parties are fighting out their last ideological war with records of respective political history. we are innocent watchers of the events since early 50's. the independence movements which began back in 1952 and ended in 1971 all belong to the ordinary " lungi clad" people and not to any generals; rather the war was against the generals, internally grown or externally directed. the leadership came from the politicians and not from any generals. unfortunately, the generals have succeeded in taking away the democratic rights of the people time and again during the last 39 years.

khulna pdb power plant units
khulna pdb power station has two power plant units, one having 110mw capacity and the other one having a capacity of 60mw both fired by hfo. though old they are supposed to generate altogether about 140mw power. but the reality is that these two power station units are constantly remaining out of generation in the name of maintenance or overhauling or due to this reason or that. on the other hand, the nearby rental power company has been producing 40mw of rental power by diesel in khulna since 2008 under a three-year rental contract. the cost of this rental power is high. with this costly power what are we actually doing? it is simply mixed up with the low cost power generated from the other fuel sources, dispatched and consumed in a fashion business as usual. what specific purpose is being served with this costly power? this is nothing but luxury in the name of supplying electricity. though the khulna pdb power plant units remain out of operation but expenditures are regularly being incurred against purchase of spares, service etc. etc. making it a double loss. we could avoid purchasing high cost rental power if khulna pdb power plant units could be made operative, thus saving a huge amount of money and supplying more power. the business of rental power plant is ensured while khulna pdb power plant units are shut. view the page international
