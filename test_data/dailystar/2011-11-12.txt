systemic deficit of containing political annihilation
the brutal murder of the young mayor of narsingdi, though shocking, does not come as a surprise. the sad reality is that many such murders of persons having political identity have occurred in the last decade and even before that. temporarily, there were some worries for such unsettling crimes but with the passage of time all concerned chose to forget the dark episode without displaying the resolve to effectively combat the menace.

kremlin's quest for multipolarity
the cold war was widely seen as a bipolar world order dominated by the era's two rival superpowers, the united states and the soviet union. while the two of them did not (indeed, could not) control the rest of the world, there was a soviet-american dimension to much of the cold war era's international relations, especially where there was conflict. however, with the collapse of communism as well as of the soviet union itself in 1989-91, moscow was no longer able to play the role of superpower. since then, the united states has been seen by many, including many in russia, as the sole remaining superpower, or even a hyperpower, attempting to unilaterally impose a unipolar world order. and this, in turn, was seen by many, especially in russia, as unfair, undesirable, and to be resisted.

the world of an indian civil servant
one of the more enduring legacies of british colonial rule in the indian subcontinent has been the civil service structure it forged into shape, the better to ensure its hold on the psyche of the country. it has not mattered much that the withdrawal of the foreign power in 1947 through the partition of india left two countries created out of the original one, and that too through much communal bloodletting. power may have passed into local hands and politics may have gone into a process of reshaping the land. and yet such new configurations of authority have hardly affected the administrative structure the british thought, and rightly too, would help bring about governmental discipline in the country. in independent india, the indian civil service, the fabled ics, was quickly replaced by the indian administrative service, or ias, with the indian foreign service (ifs) not far behind. in the new state of pakistan, the pre-1947 ics was quickly supplanted by the central service of pakistan or csp. it is equally interesting that in both countries, the federating units developed their own civil service structure which of course was, in the ultimate analysis, subservient to the central administrative organ. for bangladesh, the pre-1971 csp administrative structure was succeeded by the bangladesh civil service (bcs) soon after the country's military triumph over pakistan in december 1971.
to centre stage from the fringe
this is a difficult book to review, but, strangely enough, also a relatively easy one. survival on the fringe: adivasis of bangladesh is a 600-plus-page tome whose dizzying array of topics relating to the indigenous people makes it a taxing task to take stock of within a limited space. however, the editor, philip gain, has simplified the task by presenting a thoughtful and comprehensive introduction (“an introduction to the adivasis of bangladesh”) that encapsulates in twenty four pages the diverse contents of the rest of the book. the entire book and the introduction are monumental efforts in presenting the sometimes misunderstood, often partially understood, at times totally ignorant of, and ignored, life and society of the diverse indigenous people inhabiting bangladesh. the entrancing cover photograph of a garo woman who was reported to be over a hundred years old when photographed in 2006, gives one a partial insight into the editor's passion. he is an avid and accomplished photographer and a vigorous advocate of upholding and advancing indigenous rights as a distinctly minority community with its own cultural and societal norms, traditions, and practices. gain is director, society for environment and human development (sehd), an ngo, researcher, freelance journalist, and adjunct faculty teaching environment communication in the department of media and communication, independent university, bangladesh.
containing poverty --- a new approach
there have been many approaches towards poverty alleviation for many years. poverty was attributed the degree of scourge following population, the number one problem of the nation. one of the notable approaches or rather the most notable approach has been the concept of micro credit. it gained popularity and credit that has brought it and its pioneer the highest honourthe nobel prize. by now there have been a number of institutions and ngos operating microcredit services across the country and beyond. but the spread of the problem is so vast and deep that despite all this only a partial result is apparent. so there is scope, rather need for further effective approaches and innovation of more potential ways towards an alleviation of poverty.
