rid administration of corruption
the recent scandal involving seventy lakh being carried purportedly to the railway minister's house is an issue that should be seriously addressed. are there any government jobs available without paying bribes to the relevant authorities? here in bogra, over the years and under successive administrations, i tried to help people obtain government jobs for peons, hospital workers, sweepers and so on. my success rate has been zero. in every case, the candidates came back to me to say that a large amount of money has to be paid before their application could be accepted. i approached higher authorities, but their response was: "signed approval must be brought from higher authorities," preferably ministerial approval. how does one approach a cabinet minister to endorse an application for a peon or sweeper?

budget 2012-2013: relevant issues
the budget for the next financial year will be placed in the parliament, as a matter of regular practice, on the 2nd thursday of june (june 14) and will have to be passed by the 30th. generally parliament sessions are not held on fridays and saturdays. if this practice is followed this year the parliament will be left with ten working days only. ten days for budget discussion in the parliament, as well as consideration of comments from experts, professionals and stakeholders outside of parliament, before finalising the proposals for both revenue and expenditure, will be too short a timeframe for such a nationally important and vital matter affecting each and everybody of the country.
