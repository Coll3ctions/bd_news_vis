pit of despair, peak of hope
when we were slowly drowning in the pit of despair, musa ibrahim took us to the peak of hope. we travelled to the top of the world with him where the air is thin but pure, heavenly pure. i hope musa will bring some of that pure air to drive away the contamination that blackens our souls. we want to breathe the fresh air to our lungs' content. musa proved the hardest way that reaching the goal is not impossible if only one can remain steadfast in one's determination. it is the tough who do not stop but get going.
face-off
i first heard the news from a friend on facebook a couple of hours ago. a quick google search turned up a couple of blogs and a wikinews post that corroborated it. the final confirmation came from a journalist friend at the bbc (again via facebook): facebook, the world's most popular social-networking site, has been temporarily blocked in bangladesh. my friend wasn't sure about the exact reasons, but there were rumours about a youngster being arrested for posting 'not so flattering' doodles of political leaders on his social profile. when i asked him about the media community's reaction to this incident, he told me that it is still a "non-issue." after all, the facebook user base in bangladesh is still quite small and a little delay in posting status messages or playing farmville is not going to do any serious damage. (i must admit that for a moment, the idea of not having to see stupid notification messages seemed quite appealing.) however, the fact is, in this day and age, blocking a social media is just as unfortunate as shutting down a mainstream newspaper or tv channel and just as alarming.
