evaluating services of sundarbans
forest is a bounteous gift of nature that provides the basis of life and livelihood for humans. according to human history, hunting and gathering, the first and foremost livelihood of homo sapiens, was forest based. interestingly, mangrove is the most diverse forest and is maximum service provider of all the forest types. today, it is man whose relentless activities are, however, at the root of eroding this invaluable biological capital of nature.
growth at the cost of environment?

in search of henry james matthew
i had planned to be in simla (now spelt 'shimla') for a day and a half but my flight from delhi was cancelled due to bad weather and i caught a later plane to chandigarh (punjab) and then took a four-hour taxi ride to shimla, arriving late at 8.30 p.m. the next day i went to the church, christchurch, where our ancestor was chaplain from 1877-1886. when i asked about the stained glass window which had been installed in his wife's memory, i was told that it must have been broken. in any case, i took photos of the stained glass window behind the altar. later in the day, i was in a photo shop which was selling old photos.
a matter of reading
the indian journalist and writer khushwant singh was once asked about the importance of books in life. his reply came in a melange of hindi and urdu, pure hindustani: a home which has no books has ghor andhera- pitch darkness. in homes where there is only one book, everyone living in it is like a one-eyed kaana. homes where there are plenty of books, there is ujalaa hee ujaala -lots of light. you don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. just get people to stop reading them. perhaps aldous huxley said it in a terse statement, 'the proper study of mankind is books.'
books to shape perceptions 
i was brought up in a family that was always associated with books. i still remember the sugarhouse that fascinated me in my primary school. i grew up reading walt disney books and collected golden tokens unheard of these days. goofy the detective and the three little pigs gave me thrills i can still imagine. there were days when my brother read to me tales form sukumar ray's hojoborolo and kumropatash, all of which seemed real. i remember buying the english version of the book, select nonsense of sukumar ray, when i visited kolkata in the 1980s. it contained an introduction by satyajit ray. i wonder why some schools do not attempt enacting excerpts from it as plays or skits. they could be interesting musicals like mary poppins or little red riding hood. view the page star health

the insurgency in afghanistan's heartland
the insurgency in afghanistan has expanded far beyond its stronghold in the south east. transcending its traditional pashtun base, the taliban is bolstering its influence in the central-eastern provinces by installing shadow governments and tapping into the vulnerabilities of a central government crippled by corruption and deeply dependent on a corrosive war economy. collusion between insurgents and corrupt government officials in kabul and the nearby provinces has increased, leading to a profusion of criminal networks in the afghan heartland. despite efforts to combat the insurgency in the south, stability in the centre has steadily eroded. yet, with nearly one fifth of the population residing in kabul and its surrounding provinces, the afghan heartland is pivotal to the planned transition from international troops to afghan forces at the end of 2014. given the insurgency's entrenchment so close to the capital, however, it appears doubtful that president hamid karzai's government will be able to contain the threat and stabilise the country by then. countering the insurgency in these crucial areas requires the implementation of long-overdue reforms, including more robust anti-corruption efforts, stricter oversight over international aid and greater support for capacity building in the judicial and financial sectors.
reformation in uzbekistan and the political realities
since its independence in 1991, the government of uzbekistan took the development initiatives for the reformation in economic and political sectors. as the country was under the structure of the soviet union so for the sake of the development as an independent country the government needed to take such initiatives. but from the very beginning, uzbekistan has followed its own way of political and economic development, showing little interest for political pluralism or an open economy while preserving several old principles of soviet structures. now-a-days, the reformation process of the country has been questioned by the political realities because no development is possible without a sound political structure. the country is ruled by dictatorship, headed by president islam karimov, with no legal opposition parties and no free elections since its inception as an independent state. the economy of the country is closed, which is largely run for the benefit of a small elite group of families in or close to the government. the existing political realities of the country have made the reformation process difficult to be implemented.

rabindranath tagore in analysis
ritopotro , a little magazine on poetry published from chattagram (chittagong in anglican terms), has brought out a special issue on rabindranath tagore on the sesquicentennial birth anniversary of the nobel winning bengali poet. on this great occasion, which is being observed across the world through the initiative of the united national educational scientific and cultural organisation (unesco), scores of books and periodicals dealing with the works and life of this internationally acclaimed author and activist have flooded the west bengal book markets. however, worthy publications on the poet are only a few from bangladesh and among those ritopotro can certainly draw the attention of many.
