the fire at nctb warehouse
the devastating fire which broke out at the warehouse of the national curriculum and textbook board on sunday raises a number of questions about how it happened and what lessons can be learned from it. that a fire could occur at such an important place, one which has a direct link with education, is certainly beyond the imagination. naturally, therefore, the first question which springs to mind relates to the presence or otherwise of adequate fire fighting equipment in the warehouse. given the fact that till yesterday the fire could not be put out fully, one can reasonably guess that the nctb warehouse did not have any equipment it could employ to limit the damage caused by the conflagration. and so from our question we move on to another: how is it that in all these years no one gave a thought to the necessary fire fighting equipment that might be needed at some point? when a building houses important documents and papers (and the nctb is surely that), it should have been for the authorities to have such precautions in place.

the bnp -- and the politics of petulance
you watch the bangladesh nationalist party and you wonder where all the good people in it have gone. it is, of course, another matter that you may not consider the party a true representative of popular aspirations as they shaped up in the 1960s and during the entirety of the war of liberation. its coming into being was, as we have learned so sadly and so bitterly by now, fundamentally geared to putting our secularism under the rug or even cause it to crash headlong into the rocks below our perch of bengali nationalistic fervour. but that is a subject for another day. we will talk about it later, as we have talked about it in the past.

women and children
parliament is the highest law making body in the country, but subject to the provisions of the constitution. the continued primacy of personal laws in matters of marriage, divorce, maintenance and child custody and adoption discriminates against women in respect of rights within the family. citizenship laws also discriminate on their face against women. de facto discrimination in opportunities for education and employment as well as access to resources and to services, in particular healthcare, further imposes various barriers on women in exercising their rights. women face discrimination both in public and private spheres. violence continues to be a significant feature of the everyday experience of many bangladeshi women. the actual figures for sexual assault, rape and domestic violence are undoubtedly high, not least because a widespread culture of intimidation inhibits reporting. moreover, in cases involving the transgression of 'sexual honour,' the fear of social stigmatisation discourages making such incidents public.

meeting a govt official
whenever a person, particularly a person from a private company, or, from a private organisation or, even an individual who may at one time have held high position in the govt. now retired, wants to talk to any responsible govt. officer, the first thing the pa of that particular govt. officer asks for (not request, to humbly put it) is your identity. if the pa finds that you are nobody who can cause harm to him, or to his superior, without hesitation the reply will be, "sir is attending a meeting".
dst riddle
the cabinet has fixed the new office/school timing without fixing the date of implementation. according to media reports, electronic and print, no decision has been announced on the dst or when the clock would be put back to original time which is applicable to the whole country, irrespective of one living in dhaka or elsewhere.
rape and acid victims
the article 'rape is inevitable if not punished' by ripan kumar biswas of canada in your daily is something in bangladesh we know and have been enduring for a long time. it is not unusual for rapists here to get away scot-free, or with minor punishments. recently some rapists got away by simply paying a fine of only tk.10, 000 each and managed to escape the locals with the help of some ruling party leaders.
new exam
the primary & secondary education board has recently introduced a public exam-- 'somaponi' exam. the objective of this exam is to uniformly evaluate the students just as the ssc exams. however, some aspects of this exam should be reconsidered:
zoo animals
ever heard of the news “giraffe dies because of the sins of humans”. nope. i haven't heard anything like it before. sad but true, this bizarre phenomenon is taking place in your vicinity. yes, you got it--i'm talking of our country bangladesh. it's all happening here these days. no doubt we've got a country mired in widespread corruption in every bit of the body. but we are completely oblivious of the fact that we're passing on our miseries to naïve creatures of the 'non-human' category. yes, of course i'm referring to dhaka zoo. how appalling!
easing traffic jam
an attempt to introduce new office timings to ease traffic congestion is a praiseworthy move by the authorities. however, we can only look at it as a minor measure since we would still have the same number of cars on the road, perhaps at different times.
grade issue
recently we have been watching several incidents related to grade discrimination. students who passed ssc & hsc in 2001 & 2003 are now blocking roads and vandalizing vehicles. why do the general students have to take this kind of steps? why are they victmised? as a general student, i want this problem to be solved immediately. i would like to draw the authorities' attention in this regard and expect them to be more concerned about this matter.
dvm degree
it is very sad to see that that those who deal with the rules of the education sector do not know the elaboration of an international degree like dvm (doctor of veterinary medicine) and the value of this degree. if we want to make the rules of national education sector, we should know the exact meaning and the value of the degree. i have seen that the rule makers of national education sector elaborate the dvm degree as diploma in veterinary medicine. my point is that at first we should know the exact meaning of diploma and the difference between diploma and bachelor's degree.
saifur rahman's death
former finance minister and bnp leader saifur rahman died in a road accident on september 5, when he was returning to dhaka from his home district. he was welcomed or criticized for introducing the value added tax (vat) system in our economy. when he was dead our prime minister was abroad on an official tour. the prime minister didn't officially issue a condolence message to the media or his bereaved family.
irresponsible
