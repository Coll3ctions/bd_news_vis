a fossilized foot bone recovered from hadar, ethiopia, shows that by 3.2 million years ago human ancestors walked bipedally with a modern human-like foot, a report that appears feb. 11 in the journal science, concludes. the fossil, a fourth metatarsal, or midfoot bone, indicates that a permanently arched foot was present in the species australopithecus afarensis, according to the report authors, carol ward of the university of missouri, together with william kimbel and donald johanson, of arizona state university's institute of human origins.
habitable exoplanets
nasa's kepler spacecraft telescope (kst) which was launched on 06 march 2009 with the objective of discovering earth-like planets orbiting other suns in the constellations of cygnus and lyra. and on 02 february 2011, scientists from nasa announced that they have discovered with the aid of kst 54 new exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) where conditions are hospitable to extra-terrestrial life-forms! that means those 54 exoplanets are in the goldilocks zone, the region in a planetary system where the distance from a star and its orbiting planet is just right to maintain liquid water on its surface.
atomtronics or electronics?
forget about wires, silicon and electricity. physicists have developed a new type of circuit that is little more than a puff of gas dancing in laser beams. by choreographing the atoms of this ultracold gas to flow as a current that can be controlled and switched on and off, the scientists have taken a step toward building the world's first “atomtronic” device.
chemical that drives squid mad
a newfound chemical drives male squid berserk, and the molecule appears similar to ones seen in humans, scientists now say.
electricity's sister!
a team of physicists in england has created magnetic charges isolated north and south magnetic poles and induced them to flow in crystals no bigger than a centimeter across. these moving magnetic charges, which behave almost exactly like electrical charges flowing through batteries and biological systems, could one day be useful in developing “magnetronic” devices though what such devices would do is anybody's guess.
making of a dictator
famously sadistic dictators like saddam hussein and joseph stalin share a personality profile marked by narcissism and paranoia, political psychologists say. but what of authoritarian-style dictators like hosni mubarak? could an ordinary, well-meaning person turn into a repressive despot?
how can we foretell earthquake?
china has suffered some terrible earthquakes, and it isn't surprising that china's scientists want to find ways of forecasting them. in 1975, they were successful. they cleared the city of haicheng two hours before a devastating quake and saved the city's population. earthquake forecasting is, however, still inexact; the chinese have failed to predict several earthquakes since 1975, but they have advanced the science of earthquake prediction.
