taking the nrbs onboard
the phrase associating non-resident bangladeshis (nrbs) with national development process has been an archetype of a failed agenda. thanks to home remittances coming anyway from bangladeshi workers abroad we lost sight of the reservoir of knowledge, expertise, experience and money lying untapped with the wider bangladeshi diaspora. this tremendous possibility came into focus in the just-concluded three-day nrb conference. it saw 18 seminars held on different issues confronting the expatriate community in terms of their investment in the national development process. we appreciate the initiative of the organisers in arranging such bridge building between the expatriate community and bangladesh government. although many expatriate groups couldn't participate and bangladesh private sector could have played a hands-on role, the fact remains that the venture was a success. however flawed the meet goes down as a flagship marking a good start of the collaboration process. such conference should not be one-off , instead it ought to be held biennially, if not more frequently, of course with wider representation from four corners of the world.
question paper leakage
once again, another scam of despicable nature at the political science department of dhaka university has come to light. this time it is the allegation of leakage of question papers of the mss examination 2005, which found their way to the students who were getting ready to take the exam. what is most shameful is that the leaked questions were seen to be up for sale at various student halls on the campus. the vc of the university has reportedly verified the incident, and as usual, has ordered for the formation of an 'investigation committee to find out how the questions were leaked and who are responsible for it.' we find the incident condemnable.

'she has not laid on her children the expectations laid on her'

our health policy
i don't know on what criteria the who personnel determined that the health environment in bangladesh is now better. somebody coming from outside knows better than us, that's very interesting indeed. i want to draw a symbolic picture and part of the spectrum. distribution of health personnel in urban areas is not comparable to rural areas. so there is an information gap, which amounts to ''intentional lie''. mr. cs karim should notice that sending doctors or other health personnel to remote areas doesn't depend on good advice only. we worked in many poor and rich countries and analysed their health systems. the doctors who work in remote areas get much better financial and other benefits. health bureaucrats of bangladesh should not forget this fact. there is no referral system in bangladesh health administration. taxpayers didn't train professors for seeing 'common cold patients.

investment in sanchay patra
you are aware that the govt has imposed income tax deduction @10% at source on the interest income exceeding tk 1,50,000/= pa from the govt securities/sanchay patra from the fiscal year--2007-8. it is possibly for the first time in the history of bangladesh that the order has been made applicable on the interest income of sanchay patra purchased even in previous fiscal years (i.e. before 1-7-2007). while the nbr referred to the provisions of the income tax ordinance 1984, it seems to have meticulously suppressed the fact that the govt through sro no 178/law/89 dated the 4th june, 1989 exempted tax on the income from govt. securities/sanchay patra u/s 44(4)(b) of the ordinance with retrospective effect from 1976 which was in force till 30-06-2007. this decision of the govt has, therefore, frustrated the helpless investors, most of whom are retired persons, widows and similar others who have no alternative sources of income and are heavily dependent on such income.
loopholes of law
at the very outset, i apologise to the readers for my attempt to offer my opinion in this column on the captioned subject as a layman.
“churchillian” humour
the write up by syed badrul ahsan ( book review 15.12.07) is immensely enjoyable. however, i would like to add a couple of incidents for further sharing by your readers . once churchill (much perturbed due to his war office efforts) went for a haircut in a nearby barber's shop. the barber in his jovial manner asked him, "how would you like your haircut, sir?". "in silence please", was the curt reply.
exploitation!
recently, a government bank advertised to fill in vacancies seeking applications from under 30 years old graduates, no experience required. they would be put in probationary period for a year after which the proposed scale is monthly tk 5,200 increasing by tk 300 every year.
development of divisions
every place within the country is to be developed equally, so that people can receive better services provided by the government and other major financial and educational institutions. it is the responsibility of the government to ensure even development of the country, irrespective of their representation in the government from the constituency. but what we see in practice is that major public development works are mostly based on the decisions of the party-in-power without ensuring optimum distribution of the same. during the last bnp-led government many major development activities were undertaken either in bogra or in sylhet and these two districts had powerful ministers. on the other hand, many southern districts were mostly neglected and some development works of khulna city, approved by the past al-led government, were countermanded. the prime minister of the immediate past government always used to say that her government's goal was to ensure equal development all over the country. but in reality it has not happened and many development plans were executed in a biased manner without taking into consideration the collective interests of people.
right to information
a non-government organisation arranged a conference in dhaka, chaired by the chief adviser, regarding uninterrupted flow of information and this seems to be the last pledge of the caretaker government to fulfil. the general people do not long for an assurance or promise from the government side any longer, other than the effective implementation of the act. our law commission prepared a valid draft of this long awaited law but one has to feel sorry that successive governments did not make any endeavour to go forward with it. the draft was abandoned first in the ministry of law and it groaned in the information ministry for a pretty long hour. it had been a custom for the information ministry to assure and reassure the ballot power (the common people). ironically, due to the failure to fulfil the promise, the idea was left untouched.
aids prevention
bangladesh is said to be one of the very few countries in south east asia which is least affected by aids. as a very densely populated country, however, it is not unlikely that the curse of aids will spread here also quite fast and in an epidemic from unless effective steps are taken urgently to prevent the spread of the curse. may i suggest the following or similar steps that will go a long way to achieving the goal:
clearing sewerage lines
it is very frequently noticed in the urban areas of dhaka that some people are clearing clogged sewerage pits, pushing through long bamboo sticks and often removing night soils by pulling these up from the underground sewerage lines. the unfortunate, nasty and most threatening thing is that the people are leaving the liquid soils over on the road without bothering to clear the spots, while the city corporation sweepers are also not removing the waste. thus the leftovers are being carried in the wheels of the running vehicles and disappearing. what a good natural process!!
role of political leaders
the people have recently experienced the devastation of a demonic cyclone called sidr which has ruined the southern part of the country, leaving almost 4,000 dead. the catastrophe was deadly that could be ranked as one of the biggest natural disasters in bangladesh in several years. moreover, the aftermath of the disaster is heartbreaking. now they are in need of food and shelter. and they also need psychological assistance, especially from the rich. however, it is pleasing to see that many govt. and non-govt organisations are extending their helping hand to the sidr victims in order to minimise their immense sufferings. view the page international
