rmg sector must realise its full potential
the factors behind the rather sluggish trend in our rmg sector have been identified by experts but the real challenge before them is to suggest how we go about redressing them for the sake of utilising the sector's full potential. the us' cap on china's export growth at 7.5 percent till january 2008 is nearing its end with countries like bangladesh facing the prospect of increased competition from china. but we should be able to weather that storm like we did in the first phase of the post mfa era in 2005 provided we can utilise our strengths and overcome our weaknesses with some special efforts.
girl child day
national girl child day was observed on sunday with the slogan to promote and protect the rights of girl children in the country. in a message to mark the occasion, chief adviser fakhruddin ahmed hoped that observance of the day would help remove negative attitude towards girl children and help increase awareness in society about them. we believe the issue is important for a number of reasons, the most important one being that a girl of today is a mother tomorrow; hence she needs to be given full attention and care. but when we look around the country the prevailing scenario does not make us too happy. negative attributes like wide-scale illiteracy, poverty, malnutrition, child abuse, gender discrimination, child labour and child marriage are contributing to the woes of young girls in society. we feel, therefore, a lot has to be done to ensure their fundamental rights to education, health, shelter, security and work.
the crumbling of a monolith
only months ago it was inconceivable that a monolith like bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) would be crumbling the way it is now doing. with most of its leaders either incarcerated or on the run, the party -- like a rudderless ship -- has gone adrift. there is nothing to which it could be anchored, as the party was seldom endowed with even a rudiment of idealism.

political situation in myanmar

month of ramadan
ramadan is the month of self restraint and perseverance and these words have become clichés due to the improper use of this month by us.
rivers drying up
about thirty or forty years ago most of the rivers of bangladesh or bengal basin were in full stream and they never dried up even in the dry season. but what is happening now? except the rainy season, most of the rivers become dry or almost dry; some are spotted with many 'chars'. once upon a time the rivers which now are almost dry were flowing with big vessels, cargoes and even ships. will those days come again? we should reveal the causes behind this. when discussion takes place about this issue, most of our politicians blame the farakka barrage and lack of dredging activities. but the causes need further elaboration. yes, farakka is one of the main causes but it is not the whole truth. and another thing is lack of dredging. but dredging technology came to us not long ago. then how hundreds and thousand of rivers of our country flowed smoothly without dredging in the past? so it is totally foolish to identify lack of dredging as the main reason behind the rivers getting dried up.
twenty20 world cup

freedom of expression
freedom of expression is a fundamental right in a free and democratic society. but where do we draw the line? suppose i am traveling in a plane and the person sitting next to me has been behaving in a strange way and honestly i hate this kind of awkward behaviour. do i bluntly tell him i hate him for his way of behaving? or very politely request him to consider my presence next to him? we are all humans and sometimes we do not like a certain person or a group of persons, do we approach them and tell them that we hate them? a racist or an ethnic remark or joke is considered a criminal act in all civilised societies.
english as 2nd state language

unsolicited 'advice'
as usual the visiting dignitary from a western country finding no other issues “advised' the government to open outdoor politics without realising the significance and effect of any such move. while making the 'advice' he appears to have totally ignored the historical steps taken by the administration towards holding of a meaningful election for peaceful transfer of power to an elected government. he seems to be totally oblivious of the fact that the present administration is at the helm of affairs for a mission with popular support to get rid of a situation created by the corrupt and power hungry politicians who made a mess of the country in every aspect. i do not understand what amusement these western countries (particularly two) including a few of their paper organisations called 'european union' get by showering unnecessary and unsolicited advice on us as to how to run the government, how to do politics, how to behave with the corrupt and the criminals etc. we are no longer in a position to listen to the so 'called 'advice from the west and it is, therefore, high time for them to stop this evil practice.
why this anomaly?
we the students of the medicine faculty of dhaka university are in trouble. du is closed till 28th oct.07. but the faculty of medicine is holding examinations in different medical colleges such as, dhaka medical college, mymensingh medical college on behalf of the university of dhaka. due to this lack of coordination we are suffering a lot.
patience needed
nowadays we are almost forgetting the meaning of the holy month of ramadan and paying least attention to its significance. a few days ago, i was out in the paribag road, a terrific traffic jam was there. suddenly, i heard some disgusting slang in bengali and looked around. two rickshaw pullers and their passengers, who seemed to be educated , were exchanging words. people around them were just enjoying the matter, and no one bothered to stop them.
circuit house
during the british rule circuit houses were established as temporary abode of visiting government officials. private visitors were also allowed to stay paying rent when the rooms were available. executive engineers or his nominated officer maintained the house and administered the same as per rules. this practices are still there in india perhaps also in pakistan. as a foreigner i had the opportunity to use circuit house facility in india.

rejoinder by reaz rahman
this has reference to the letter of mr. reaz rahman published in your daily of 24 sept'07. mr. rahman's rejoinder to the observations made by mr. k.m. shehabuddin in his book " there and back again " and contained in the review by syed badrul ahsan is not at all convincing. many bengali diplomats imbued with the spirit of liberation declared their allegiance to the bangladesh government in exile even in much more hostile circumstances. being stationed in a country sympathetic to the liberation war, he could have easily flown to any place in the world, rather than joining the bandwagon for pakistan on the closure of the office of the high commissioner for pakistan in delhi.
an appeal
we are living at darus salam area which is located on the southern side of mirpur road in between kallyanpur and gabtali. we have only one 15 feet wide road in a place where at least twenty thousand people live. in 2002 i.e. after takeover by this present city corporation management, some house owners started to occupy this road by illegal construction, setting up vegetable shops, fish shops, fruit shops etc. lots of correspondences were made toward the pm office, dcc office, rajuk office, but things did not change.
airport issue
we are all concerned about the high-rise buildings built with lot of money. i wonder why we do not think of the present location of the airport itself and how long it will serve the national interest. small countries around are building more international airports to serve the national interests and we are doing all sorts of research with one airport. i understand there is plenty of low land on the northern side of the present airport.
pakistan scene
lawyers are confronting the powers to be? while hailing the decision of the legal fraternity to field justice (retd.) wajihuddin ahmad as presidential candidate, a judge of an impeccable character, the empower pakistan forum has termed it as a good omen for the country. today's decision to field justice (retd.) wajihuddin ahmad as presidential candidate is a very laudable one keeping in view that the forthcoming presidential election is going to be controversial, and with this move the civil society of pakistan headed by lawyers is taking responsible actions in order to counter a further deterioration in the law and order situation with threats to the very unity of the federation of pakistan. with this timely and bold decision the lawyers have added a new chapter in the history of lawyers' movement, which was started many years ago by malik mohammad qasim, a seasoned politician of his time. he was also a lawyer by profession. after the 1977 coup, general ziaul haq announced that he had put the 1973 constitution in abeyance by his extra constitutional act, while the senate was also dissolved with national assembly & provincial assemblies. this was enough for malik qasim to understand the zia game plan.
