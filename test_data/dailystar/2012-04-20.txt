investigation or farce?
investigation report in our country has become a ready tool to give respite to the criminals. if the criminals have the blessing of ruling party affiliation, they are not arrested forthwith because "it's not right to punish someone before the charges are proved against him," rightly said by our railway minister suranjit sengupta when he was asked about faruq and mridha from whose car seven million taka was recovered.
