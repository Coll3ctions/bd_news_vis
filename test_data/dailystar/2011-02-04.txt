taher's fate fixed before trial
us journalist and writer lawrence lifschultz in a statement to the high court yesterday said
a wise step back
we congratulate prime minister sheikh hasina for her wisdom of bowing to public demand in removing the new airport site from arial beel area. given our political culture, leaders often fall prey to their misplaced ego, and consider any criticism of their decision and change of course of any action taken by them to be insulting and a sign of weakness. in fact sycophants are known to feed on such ego-traps and advise their leaders not to bow to legitimate criticisms, saying that such a change of course will be interpreted as loss of power leading to all sorts of political repercussions. we had seen that happen too many times in the past and, frankly, we were afraid that the present pm would also fall into such a trap.

false promise before jinnah arrived

a sign of maturity
prime minister sheikh hasina's acknowledgement of popular sentiments regarding a new airport at arial beel is to be appreciated. coming as it does after an eruption of violence that left a policeman dead and scores of others injured, her statement should now help reduce the tension gripping the area. moreover, her view that there will be a feasibility study before a new site for the proposed airport is selected is proof that the government has taken cognizance of the realities. such a study should have been undertaken before the decision to build a new airport at arial beel was taken. the manner in which the arial beel issue was approached was flawed because of two basic reasons. in the first place, the airport-related decision took little note of the adverse impact a new airport would have on the environment of the area. in the second, no effort was made at all to ascertain the wishes of the local people.
hena tragedy outrageous
the way a rape victim in a remote village of shariatpur, far from being redressed for the abuse she was subjected to, was whipped leading to her death has left us reeling from utter shock and outrage. we have no word to condemn the crime committed by the so-called village arbitration body that gave the order to lash the girl based on a fatwa issued by a village imam. in the same breath, we cannot but express our dismay over how such a barbaric medieval drama could be enacted under the very nose of the local administration. how could they be unaware of the high court rule that declares fatwa illegal and unconstitutional? view the page sports

our participation at assam trade fair
our local financial daily reported on january 18th about our participation at the international trade fair at guwahati, assam; where bangladesh is a partner country. in the report it was stated that we will be having 50 stalls in the fair and that only our art and culture will be displayed! it was disappointing to note, that according to the report, nothing was mentioned about inclusion of the food, medicines, cosmetics and other consumer goods manufactured in bangladesh being exhibited and sold in the fair! this was an excellent opportunity to exhibit our range of products that can find ready market in assam, and help to expand our export trade to our neighbours. priority wise, in my opinion, this is more important than displaying only our art and culture.

how to destroy your enemy!!
