pedestrian rights and obligations
the pavements along the city streets are in a most chaotic state, unkempt, craggy, and worst of all, occupied by squatting vendors, shop-fronts, ticket counters, welding gears, bits and pieces of construction materials, fallen rubbish from house-tops, and sometimes, sewer spillage from manholes. add to this, the diminishing ledges or shoulders of thoroughfares, the pedestrians have nowhere to go. thousands of walking people are an integral part of city traffic but that being congested all around, the pedestrians look for elbow room on the pavements. but the pavements meant exclusively as walk-ways have lost their character, so the pedestrians get thrown back on to the streets.
jakarta diary
the drive from the airport to the santika hotel takes about 45 minutes, and, as with all other drives to the heart of a capital city, is a decent introduction to a new country. jakarta, i could not help but note, certainly seems closer to dhaka in terms of development and third world chaos than, say, a city like bangkok.
slaves of freedom
what has happened to the dissenting voices, people who disagree to agree and speak their minds in the face of mortal challenge? the whole world believed that the sun revolved around the earth until one nicolaus copernicus proposed his contrary hypothesis. people of ancient arabia indulged in idolatry and the prophet of islam proclaimed that allah was the one and only god. when one martin luther nailed his 95 theses on the church door, the catholic church proved critically flawed.

neglected tourism industry
when i heard that cox's bazar and sundarbans were nominated to be among the new seven natural wonders of the world, i felt great! i have already voted for the two spots. last year many people, including bangladeshi celebrities, walked more than 100 kilometers along the seashore from teknaf to cox's bazar. if i had been there at the time, i would have liked to join them. travel is my number one hobby. on many occasions i had the chance to travel to many countries, which i did in asia, europe, australia, and the middle east. tourism is a huge industry, many countries earn billions of dollars though this business and thousands of jobs are created. first of all, we have to understand the key ingredients of this business. nowadays nobody travels like ibne botuta, everybody is busy working. here in toronto, i have been working for a corporation for quite a few years. in my office every 7 or 8 weeks, people take a week off to reenergize and break free from their daily routine that they are tired of. although we work for 40 hours monday to friday and it's not hard manual work but i still get bored. sometimes i take my annual leave for the whole year, 6 weeks all together and go to bangladesh, they never think about doing it that way. in the summertime they go north to their cottage, down to a resort in the caribbean, or on a cruise for a week. they always make plans for their next vacation a month ahead. this is the western lifestyle, in europe, america, australia and japan, the lifestyle is very similar. travel agents provide us with brochures, so people will know which country costs how much and can choose their own affordable vacation.
traffic jam
i wish to share my thoughts with you on the problems of traffic jam in dhaka city. to be honest, the road network in dhaka is not scientifically designed. most of the junctions are responsible for heavy traffic jam. it will take a long time and a lot of money to take care of that problem. meanwhile, we have to make the best use of the roads we have by bringing some small changes and enforcing discipline on the road.

hoodlums at work
i read with a great deal of interest dr. ahmad islam's article entitled "hoodlums reign", published in the daily star on friday, august 22, 2008. this article has spoken the minds of millions of concerned citizens residing in dhaka as most of them have directly ort indirectly experienced horrific situations in the hands of criminals, similar to those narrated by dr. islam. this is a subject of great national concern for all peace-loving people. we hope that, as dr. islam urged, the government will address this situation on a priority basis. the development and progress of a nation cannot be measured just by the economic index or the technological advancement - - there has to be a certain level of peace, security and social stability for a nation to be considered progressive and to earn the trust and respect of the world community, especially the foreign governments and investors whom we need so badly as our development partners.

rpo

russian aggression
it is quite clear that the russian authorities were displaying their capacity to commit brutal acts against humanity through their invasion of georgia. their aggression not only questions diplomatic norms, but such behaviour is in essence against world peace and it reminds us of the german occupation of poland which resulted in world war ii. as a member of the global community,we must denounce such military aggression and as a human being i send my helpless condolences to the families of those who have lost their loved ones. we hope russia will withdraw its troops from the occupied georgian territory and respect the recent diplomatic negotiations. moreover, the world community must act so that such military aggression is prevented in future. if they fail to do so, then the sovereignty of many small democratic nations will be at stake and this will undermine the values nurturing freedom, democracy and humanity.
