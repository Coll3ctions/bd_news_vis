branding bangladesh
country branding means the earning of reputation for a country by utilising its inner resources and opportunities, which are original and inspiring to the outer world. the official brand name of our beloved country is “beautiful bangladesh”. the goal is to establish a positive image of our country and attract foreign tourists to visit its panoramic landscapes, seascapes and the natural beauties. there is a great opportunity to brand this country, which can be done through attracting foreigners to the tourist spots -- cox's bazar, the sundarbans, jaflong, kuakata, and historical sites like bagerhat, sonargaon, moynamoti, mahasthangar etc.
our postal service

republicans and barack obama
reuter's report from washington some days back, published in most of our dailies, dwelt upon the sour warning to us president obama, because of the reverse suffered by the democrats in the mid-term election. naturally it will make the president's task more difficult and laborious in an already depressing economic and employment situation, which was not of his making, but a legacy of the past administration.

bcs examination
bcs examination is considered to be the most competitive and prestigious examination in our country. but it is very sad that the process of the exam is old, backdated, complicated and unnecessarily lengthy. the exam system needs to be made modern and practical. another shocking thing is the quota system. because of various quotas, the real talented candidates are being neglected. i request the government to think seriously about the examination procedure and take appropriate measures to make it truly a competitive examination.
in response...
the government must consider the possibility of unrest that might follow khaleda zia's eviction.
justice must prevail
it was sad to read about mizanur rashid in the cover story of 'star insight.' it is a tragedy that a person who raises his voice against injustice puts himself in danger. an honest family man with a keen sense of right and wrong speaks up, and gets beaten so severely by two identified miscreants that he dies soon after. the follow up actions include the honourable pm offering mr. rashid's wife a government post and 1 lakh taka as compensation. the dutch bangla bank gave the family 10 lakh taka.
a corrupt nation
bangladesh is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. we have a bright history, colourful culture, and serene nature. many people sacrificed their lives to establish our right to speak our mother language in 1952. thirty million people sacrificed their lives during the liberation war in 1971.
law and order
law and order in our country is deteriorating day by day. every day some unidentified dead bodies are found beside the roads, in the canals, ditches, etc. during the last six months, 942 persons were, reportedly, killed in the country.
