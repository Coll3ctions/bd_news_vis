unequal war
last month's 22-day bombardment and artillery onslaught on unarmed gazans by the israeli army is the most vicious attack on the palestinians in such a small area. the attack destroyed their houses, offices, schools, mosques and so on and in the process killed more than 1350 people including over 350 children. but why? apparently all this mayhem was in retaliation for the so-called rocket attacks against israel which by the way a western journalist called ' tin pot rockets' practically causing no damage so as to warrant such a devastating response. now one may ask why did the hamas fire these useless rockets toward israel?

bangladesh is a fully democratic country now with no less a person than bangabandhu's illustrious daughter at the helm. we have every right to believe that bangabandhu's daughter with a totally democratic mind will never permit any ministry of hers to carry on secret activities without informing the people. but of late, we find that the tv channels (moviemagic) mm1, mm2 and bbc entertainment regularly go off the air at about 6:00am every morning. we enjoy some good movies telecast by these three channels. but it is really painful that right in the midst of these movies (sometimes in the beginning of some movies as well) the aforesaid channels (known as the e-16 service) are stopped every morning. a message is displayed on the screen : "insert e-04 card". it becomes obvious that due to some secret instructions from the top, the e-04 cards are withdrawn to disrupt the said channels at 6:00am everyday. it is strange that the channels resume services automatically at about 7-30am.
