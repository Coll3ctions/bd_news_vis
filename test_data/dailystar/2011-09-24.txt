postmodernism: intrusion or inevitability?
buzz word though it is, postmodernism is not bereft of epistemological substance. in literature it crept in on easy terms, in social science it has faced hurdles. the derridian onslaught on structuralism through the concept of de-centring, difference or deconstruction earned it linguistic acceptance in the early 1960s. in social science it took off in the 1970s. however, derrida's polemic in this regard cut across both literature and social science.

1965 indo-pak war: letter of condolence
forty six years ago this month, in september 1965, india and pakistan were locked in a war over kashmir. that war is largely forgotten in bangladesh, eclipsed by our war of liberation of 1971, although many brave sons of our soil, then serving in the pakistan armed forces, fought extremely well, won many gallantry awards, many made supreme sacrifices. in india and pakistan, however, the events of that war continue to be investigated and debated. air cdre (retd) kaiser tufail, paf, an aviation enthusiast, published a story in the april 2011 issue of "defence journal of pakistan" of shooting down of an indian government-owned civilian aircraft by a paf fighter during the 1965 war. the story, based on his interviews with a number of personalities, including the interceptor pilot flg off (retd) qais hussain, revealed that the aircraft was flying inside india, was probably lost, but was shot down on order from higher headquarters. the article gave full details of the turn of events, including the justification or otherwise, of the decision of shooting down a civilian aircraft during war.
israel in the changing geo-political situation
the arab region is riddled with volatile situation if we look at the political happenings such as the palestine-israel gordian knot, a highly unstable yemen, the situation in libya, the future of egypt, handsome possibility of the fall of assad in syria, lebanon with hezbollah as a major domestic player, algeria, jordan, bahrain, iraq, iran and morocco, have their own instabilities heightened by the possibility of religious extremism or the threat of al qaeda. it is already evident that after the arab spring, israel is in a precarious position with its muslim allies like egypt and turkey, which will be evident in the following discussion. even jordan's king abdullah ii, one of israel's few remaining close allies in the muslim world, strongly rejected the notion that his country should take in palestinians as a substitute for the creation of a state for them.

love's pain is indivisible
nobel prize winning novelist orhan pamuk's book the museum of innocence provides a vivid picture of the pain of love, or more accurately, the pain of losing a lover, and offers an interesting account of the narrator's efforts to get her back. in the meticulous reconstruction of a lover's anguish and despondency, pamuk's book also provides rich details of the pleasures of istanbul --- his home city --- its night life and restaurants, tourist attractions, the treasures hidden under the blue waters of the sea of bosphorus, and the cultural and social settings of this historic city. but the most captivating narrative of his latest novel is the amazingly nuanced moment by moment chronicle of a love affair: the magic of falling in love, the ecstasy of being in love, the insecurity of love and the fear of losing it, the agony and total destruction brought about by separation and the incredible journey of coping and recovery.
