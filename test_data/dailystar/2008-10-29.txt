we need to thrive globally
in this world of globalisation, the survivability of a nation is only possible if the commerce of that nation thrives well in other countries. a nation cannot expect to grow economically if it only thinks of its local market alone. a nation like bangladesh, for instance, must never think that the economy of the nation will grow if only it has a strong domestic economic system. our economy is thriving but in order to thrive beyond one's own imagination we must move on and thrive strongly in other nations.

ashraful's captaincy
since ashraful has become the captain of the bangladesh team, his batting performances has been deteriorating, with the exception of a few good innings. he rarely was able to lead the team from the front. in addition, i think, he lacks the urge to win the games. we need a captain who is a fighter, who fights till the last ball is played and who does not give up on any game. certainly, ashraful is not the man.

weekly holiday
i like to draw the attention of the chief adviser mr. fakhruddin ahmed regarding the above mentioned issue. recently it has been covered in different newspapers that the present government is considering to cancel present weekly holidays and reintroduce one day weekly holiday. it has been reported that the one-day weekly holiday would be observed on sundays, instead of fridays and saturdays, to be in touch with the western world. i like to inform the present government that those of us who are doing private service, two-day weekly holiday gives us an opportunity to get some relief and do some social and family activities. i believe one-day weekly holiday will definitely increase the productivity of some companies but the monetary impact will be enjoyed only by the owners of those companies and not by the common people.
road crisis
recently, the crisis that commuters face on the roads have risen to such an extent that even a standard trip from one place to another by any means of transport requires a war to be waged on anyone and everyone, anything and everything. i live in bonosree, rampura, and i travel daily to my workplace in dhanmondi. earlier, i would take an auto-rickshaw or taxi, and reach fairly on time. nowadays, it's getting tougher to get any kind of transport. not a single person (auto-rickshaw or taxi) agrees to go the length, and even if they do, they ask for a sky-high price, which at most times, is way beyond reasonable. they give excuses like too much traffic jam, lack of enough gas, malfunctioning engine (whereas if any agreeable passenger with a more agreeable destination comes along, all of a sudden, the engine sings sweetly enough to work!). my personal favourite excuse, which keeps recurring, is when the drivers whine about not getting any other passenger from dhanmondi. is that believable? in a place like dhanmondi, auto-rickshaw/taxi passengers are not available?! incredulous!
power wastage by the powerful
letters on a wide variety of subjects by the prolific mr s a mansoor have adorned the letters page of the ds for a long time. he has simultaneously hit the jackpot and the nail on the head in the concluding para of his last letter “temporary relief” in ds, 20 oct 08. this is well worth repeating:
i am a voter...
i am 21. therefore, definitely i did not see the 1971 liberation war, but i had felt the cruel nature of war through 1/11, the political upheaval in the history of bangladesh. so far we have seen many trends in political arena whereby 1/11 was the most remarkable one. the 1/11 has exhibited the sheer spectacle of all the major parties to become the rulers, divulging their avarice of grabbing the power. does democracy mean that country will be hampered in its many systems like in terms of education, in case of earning foreign currency through export, and running business smoothly without any interruption? in our country, democracy is not of the people, by the people, for the people; rather it's like democracy is of the politicians, by the politicians, for the politicians. other than the general citizens, politicians are earnestly concerned about bringing back the democracy even when many of their accomplices are languishing in jail, and others are at large.
the advantages of rickshaws
given the crowded conditions of dhaka's roads, when total trip time is considered, motorized transports have little advantage in speed over non-motorized. in addition, unlike motorized vehicles, when rickshaws are caught in traffic jams they emit no air pollution, waste no fuel, and make no noise.
dhaka-mymensingh highway
i would like to invite you to travel for a couple of hours towards mymensingh in the morning hours and return after three to four hours. please let me know which day you are free and what time. no i will not take you to muktagacha for monda or mymenshingh for malaikari of shudhir gosh. but i would like to show you the miserable condition of dhaka-mymensingh highway. this is a shame for the r&h or rather i should say it is a shame for the division of r&h concerned. do they have any (shame)? how are they continuing with their job and drawing salary from public money? this poor and devastating condition did not happen in one or two days or months but we are seeing this for years together with no end in sight.
roaming in dhaka city
few days ago my cousin came from europe with his parents and we decided to roam the dhaka city. my cousin was having some health problem he was not happy about staying in bangladesh. one day we took a cng taxi at farm gate where some buses and cars made a complete mess. the bus moved haphazardly and my cousin was totally afraid. he thought that the drivers were drunk and the sound, the pollution and the huge mass of people walking here and there aggravated the whole situation and finally after waiting in the traffic jam we reached the parliament building. then for the first time i heard something positive about bangladesh from him when he said that the parliament building is really beautiful. but he complained about the rubbish thrown here and there by the people. as we were returning home we did not get a taxi and my cousin got very angry. luckily we got one at double the usual fare but he was quite afraid because of the way it was running. when i arrived home he said he had experienced many thrilling, exciting and scary adventures in many places of the world but the one in dhaka was one of the most terrible ones. i tried to defend my pride by saying that we bengalis are braver than others so we don't fear these small things.
is homeopathy a science?
more or less two decades ago an essay was published in the "gonosastho" a monthly bangla publication from the gonosastho trust titled: "is homeopathy a science?" the writer in his research work was in doubt and expressed his opinion giving many examples. as it was the cover feature of that issue, it attracted people's attention at that time. but at present we see a homeopathy department in the gonosastho hospital. would the authority of the hospital admit now that homeopathy is a science? view the page international
