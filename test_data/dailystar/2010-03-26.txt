independence day
the observance of independence day this year as in any other year is an opportunity for the bengali nation to retrace its steps into that annus mirabilis of 1971, for the particular reason that the year remains symbolic of all our dreams about our future. thirty nine years after the formal declaration of bangladesh's independence, it is for us to recapitulate an era that was to push us into unmitigated tragedy caused by pakistan's initiation of genocide and eventually on to a sun-dappled dawn of freedom nine months later. this morning, we pay tribute to the people of bangladesh, to the mukti bahini and indeed to the leadership of the time for the steadfastness of purpose they demonstrated in the face of the terror typified by the pakistan occupation army. the three million bengalis who died in order for us to live and thrive in freedom will always have our undying gratitude. the two hundred thousand bengali women who went through unspeakable agony at the hands of the occupation forces will be the repository of our enduring respect.

wired to a fast-track world
the world is getting smaller by the day with information passing around at lightning speed. however, as more and more information is passed, the need for better telecommunication infrastructure to keep up with the increasing demand becomes an urgent necessity. installation of optical fibre networks are being stressed upon the world over as the currently most viable solution. installations in bangladesh have already begun and its appropriateness to bangladesh’s needs is being widely talked about. inspite of so much talk about fibre optics, many may have questions about the very basics of fibre optics. many of us must have already seen a fibre optic wire in our homes, but not identified it. sometime around the 90s, a particular type of showpiece had started becoming increasingly popular in homes of bangladesh. these showpieces had a mass of hair-like white plastic wires coming out of a golden coloured sphere and only the ends of these wires would light up when the showpiece was plugged in and switched on. why am i reminiscing about a showpiece in the star tech section? my point here is that each of these wires were actually a single strand of optical fibre.
