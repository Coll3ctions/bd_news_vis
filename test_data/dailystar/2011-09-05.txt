indian premier's visit
we look to the forthcoming visit of the indian premier to bangladesh as much more than just a visit by a leader of a big neighbour. it is a historic visit and has all the potentials of becoming a major turning point in the bilateral relations between bangladesh and india with wider implications for the region. for us there is every reason to look expectantly to the visit, and to what it might deliver for bangladesh.
the battle for libya
the gaddafi era is over. the bigger truth is that the national transitional council is yet to be in full control of the country. with battles still being fought, especially around places like gaddafi's birthplace sirte and the town of bani walid, one is not sure if there will be a peaceful end to the struggle for power soon. the deposed libyan leader has not been making things any easier by urging his loyalists to keep up their struggle against people he derisively refers to as rats. and the latest decision by the ntc to hold back on moving its interim government to tripoli for a week only confirms the continued volatility of the situation. view the page sports

nurturing good neighbourliness
bangladeshis are looking forward to the august visit of dr. manmohan singh. we have so much to learn, receive, exchange and share with india. this visit can usher in a big change in our economic and neighbourly relations, and pragmatic steps can follow, if we are sincere on both sides. let this be a visit of developing more meaningful economic relations. if economy is in the right footing, all other areas will follow suit automatically, including trust. as a huge economy, and a strong country in many ways, and since we have good relations, we can really benefit in a massive manner. areas we can take into account could include the following:
police commit robbery and extortion!
the recent arrest of eight police personnel in rajshahi paints the worst possible picture of the police. not that all are bad, but this glaring event has put police corruption and misdeeds in the limelight. let them be aware, and take strong corrective actions, so that they may become 'protectors,' not 'patrons of crime'. that would be a nightmare. but given the rising trend of lawlessness, this seems to be 'what is going on', in most places!
load-shedding on eid vacation
we were surprised when we suffered load-shedding the day after eid. we faced load shedding six times that day. the next day we could not sleep from midnight because of frequent load-shedding. and in the morning it was the worst. the electricity was gone for five hours, from 6 am to 11am. we never had such experience during eid vacation before. this means we can never get relief from load-shedding for a single day. we hope the authorities would look into the matter.
let peace be established in libya
on september 2, i read a news item in the daily arab news entitled “qaddafi wants libya engulfed in flames.” it appears from above news heading that he has no feeling for his own country and countrymen. in fact, he ruled his country for long 42 years as a stranger! if it was not true then how could he expect his own country to be engulfed in flames? we have witnessed enough of his charisma. now he should quit. thousands of innocent libyans have been killed due to qaddafi's whimsical decisions and autocratic attitude. let the common libyans design their own democratic institution for forming a fresh government of the people, for the people and by the people. let peace and good governance be established in libya.
health in jeopardy
we all know 'health is wealth,' but in our country the proverb gets more accurate when i say “wealth is health.” well, that is the motto of most of the shopkeepers. according to a report by the daily star, 90% food items contain adulterants. as a citizen i have the right to have fresh food but who cares? chocolate, kids' favourite, is also not free from textile dyes. we don't even get fresh vegetables to eat which is very important for our health. we, the kids, the future leaders of bangladesh, are hugely affected by food adulteration and so i think the government should take strong initiatives if they don't want the next generation to be a burden on the country! i urge all my fellow brothers and sisters, please plant vegetables on your rooftop because this is the best way to avoid adulterants.
the pm defended them!
when people were feeling a bit consoled by the awami league lawmakers' coming down heavily on the ministers who were responsible for the immense sufferings of the people, prime minister sheikh hasina ruined all those by asking them not to play into the hands of the enemies by pointing out a few failures of the government and concealing the success. we were deeply shocked at what she said. when the government portrays the opposition as enemy, the country is in real trouble.
bnp's denial
a few days earlier bnp leader moudud ahmed, in a talk show, compared bangabandhu with ziaur rahman giving bangabandhu's position before zia. and the acting secretary general of the bnp expressed his party position saying that joj miah was the mastermind behind 21st august grenade attack. the final probe report, based on confessional statements, has revealed the truth. but the bnp could not even maintain silence.
road accidents
every day we get news of horrific road accidents from the print and electronic media. many valuable lives are being lost in these road accidents. actually, the highways have become the death traps in our country. reckless driving, overtaking tendency, overloading, defective vehicles and dilapidated roads are mainly responsible for this. we all should raise our voice against this. the government should take pragmatic and effective measures to curb road accidents. traffic police as well as highway police can play a pivotal role here. people should not travel on the roof of the vehicles and they should not encourage the drivers to overtake other vehicles on the highway.
we need to return to the basics
in education, both the teacher and the taught feel that imparting of too much information and doing a lot of things determine the quality of education. most students in bangladesh write pages and pages of answers, containing just a mere reproduction of class notes or notes from guides without any kind of analysis, synthesis, knowledge integration and application to practical situations. our governance is ridden with heaps and heaps of paperwork, endless meetings and unimaginable formalities seldom found in progressive countries.
don't kill the goose
like the farmer in the aesop's fable, the government has become very greedy and so has decided to kill the goose, the country, to obtain all the eggs at a time. the decision to give india tax free transit facilities, the white elephant of $1billion high interest loan to facilitate transit facility for india, keeping mum about india's continuous withdrawal of water from rivers flowing into bangladesh and her atrocities across the border and maritime boundaries, and law enforcer's law of jungles, country's body covered with sores in the form of broken roads and highways- are squeezing the last breath from our beloved country. but i think the conscious and brave people of this country who fought so valiantly against the pakistani atrocities in 1971 will hold the killer hand before it slits the country dead. i urge the government to learn from history that if one kills the principles, principles will ultimately kill him. will you still kill the goose, our production capacity? will you not come to sense?
justice delayed, justice denied
the august 21 grenade attack shocked the whole nation. seven years have passed since then. but the progress, to establish justice, is going on at a snail's pace. the then government tried to stage a puppet show using joj miah who hardly had any involvement in that gruesome attack. the persons responsible for the crime had been behind the scene for a long time. just days ago fresh charges have been filed to ensure arresting the conspirators. 24 people were dead and hundreds were maimed in that attack. the traumatised people may get a little consolation and the departed souls may rest in peace if the culprits get the punishment they deserve. view the page international

graduating diplomacy and politics into the 21st century
it is quite remarkable, almost unbelievable, that the forthcoming indo-bangladesh summit on september 6-7, 2011, is the first such bilateral summit since the historic visit by indira gandhi for the dhaka for the first summit with bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman in march 1972. other indian prime ministers have since visited dhaka but not for a bilateral summit. over these years, indo-bangladesh relations have been caught in a time warp set sometime in the 1970s if not further back. this relationship needs to finally come of age by moving its discourse into the 21st century. diplomacy embedded in the past means we are solving problems which were put on the table 40 years ago. hopefully, the imminent summit between prime ministers sheikh hasina and manmohan singh promises to move this relationship forward and in the process, resolve a number of outstanding problems which have constrained indo-bangladesh relations over these many years.
