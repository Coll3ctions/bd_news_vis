nazrul . . . in the eyes of benoykumar
kazi nazrul islam, variously referred to as the rebel poet of bengal and the national poet of bangladesh, was born on 25 may 1899 (11 jaishtha by the bangla calendar). in his hugely productive, multi-faceted career, until it was cut short by a debilitating illness in the mid-1940s, nazrul composed thousands of songs, wrote innumerable plays and stories and penned articles on issues of grave public concern. he died in august 1976. star literature takes this opportunity to pay tribute to the literary giant whose hold on the bengali imagination has been nothing less than mesmerising.
--- literary editor
passions of the poet
nazrul takes you back to the valley of songs. you wander across the deserts of time, images of the beloved creating a festival of light in your mind; and you sing amar aponar cheye apon je jon / khunji tare aami aponae . that is where romance comes rushing back into your life. or you might well ask if the romantic soul in you had ever deserted you at any point in your life. nazrul, he who gave us bidrohi and electrified us with chol chol chol , does not quite forget to inform us that beyond politics, beyond that historically underpinned spirit of rebellion in the heart, comes tenderness bathed in melody. and melody is but another expression, at once simple and potent, for the calling of the heart.
nazrul's ghazals and angurbala
in the mid 1970s, our finals at chhayanaut music school had begun. among the panel of experts, music exponent laila arjumand banu was present. soon it was my turn to face the board where i was asked to present classical and nazrul songs. my last presentation at the exam was a ghazal by nazrul. view the page star health

a quick journey through time
the book is a journey through time, the past sixty years of bangladesh; a combination of pictorial presentation in harmony with written words to familiarize the curious reader with major aspects of the country's contemporary history. more accurately it is not '… history of the six eventful s per se; it is rather an objective account of the events that shape the destiny of a whole nation as precisely as possible.'
tales to be read and savoured
this beautiful assortment of short stories is like a box filled with gems, each to be read and savored. these stories are about accommodation and rebellion indian-born girls and women in america undergo as they balance old beliefs and new desires. and there are also stories that come with the male dominant families in the asian continent. this is a reflection of how people of one subcontinent settle down in their new homes in the land they have migrated to. in fact, this is also a reflection of the story of immigrants, people who have been migrating for social and economic reasons for ages.
neruda and metaphorical frames
pablo neruda, poet of human love and equality, wears the garb of a pedagogue, possessing command over figurative compositions during his exile on the island of capri in italy in michael radford's il postino: the postman (1994). gabriel gonzalez videla's oppressive rule compels the master of allegory to take refuge in a villa owned by italian historian edwin cerio in capri, fictionalized by antonio skarmeta in his 'ardent patience.' the film revolves around a postman who is assigned with the onus of delivering billets-doux of the passionately overwhelmed discoverers (mostly female) of metaphorical pronouncements to the intractable activist involved in coping with the human condition. his repeated interactions with the maestro take impersonal courses until one day the delivery man chances upon the biggest metaphor of his life in a literal damsel. the punctuated breaths of the lovelorn punctuate the new-found terrain of emotional exuberance before the commander of amorous poetics. neruda, the pseudonymous composer, despite initial hesitation embarks on a journey of winning troy for the beloved of his self-assured apprentice. he is at the helm, weaving strings of cloaked expressions for the sake of his disciples' amorous entanglements. the resemblance of smiles to the wings of the butterfly is brought forth as an initial demonstration of emotion in the postman's life.
