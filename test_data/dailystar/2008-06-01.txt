the sad plight of bangladesh railways
news from the railways sector, as a front-page report in yesterday's issue of this newspaper makes clear, is not encouraging. more than 2,000 kilometres of the 2,835 km railways network are in a dilapidated shape. add to that the 675 level crossings which have increased the risks to railway travel in the country. and then come the poor and often inefficient handling of the signalling system that only add to the sense of gloom about the railways in bangladesh. besides, there are the reports of the casualties arising out of railway accidents or plainly hazardous use of railway tracks by individuals.
disgraceful!
the incident in which a private medical college student was beaten fatally by some students at sm hall to which the former succumbed has been both disgraceful and appalling. it speaks of the moral degradation of a section of students who lose their calm at the slightest pretext and take the law in their own hands. we are not ready to hear whether the young student of bangladesh medical college was guilty of stealing a cell phone from the room where he was staying overnight as the guest of a friend. all we want to know is what right the students of that particular dormitory had to beat the life out of that young man. moreover, different reports point at elements of mystery in the way the young man was accused and how the execution took place. what was expected of the hall students was to hand over the alleged offender to the police with evidence, if any. but instead of doing that, they acted on their own and brutally like no one with student identity is expected to do. the tragedy makes us wonder whether the price of a cell phone is more than that of a human life!
relative calm
when a piece of good news is yearned for in the nation, at the time of difficult economic and political situation, the news that bangladesh ranks first among the states in the region in the ranking of peaceful nations in 2008, bears a special significance for all of us.
whither secularism?
i do not want to belittle the bhartiya janata party's victory in the karnataka state election, which has given it a foothold in the south for the first time since independence. my contention is that every such success lessens the space for secularism in india. when the chips are down, the bjp represents hindutva and all that goes with it. the congress may be opportunist in outlook, dynastic in attitude and authoritarian in approach, its ethos is secular. it represents pluralism, which was also the characteristic of the freedom struggle.

it's chennai v rajasthan
an inspired chennai super kings shrugged off the underdogs' tag with a comprehensive display to thrash kings xi punjab by nine wickets and join rajasthan royals in the indian premier league final. punjab's batting had been in superb form through most of the tournament, but they came completely unstuck in the face of some accurate and relentless seam bowling by chennai's three fast bowlers, folding for a paltry 112 in mumbai last night.
almost perfect
two moments encapsulated the rajasthan royals' overwhelming superiority in this semifinal. yusuf pathan had already clubbed glenn mcgrath for a straight four off the first ball of the penultimate over and, when he decided to throttle back for the final delivery, pathan's response was telling. picking the slower ball early, he smeared it flat over midwicket with the sort of violence that used to leave george foreman's opponents with autopsied faces.

research: pertinent thoughts
bangladesh has surged into the era of research. research has been going on in various ngos which are doing research on a regular basis as part of their projects. another group of researchers comprises students engaged in research needed for their thesis for various academic programmes. the question is: who regulates all this research which is going on haphazardly, the majority of which involves human subjects. after completion of this research some of the findings are not even disseminated for the benefit of the masses. many organisations prefer to publish the research findings selectively so as to maintain a politically correct image. the question is: is this ethically correct?

there was a news report in the daily star about the cu students who staged destructive protests over the death of a fellow student who was crushed under the wheels of the university shuttle train after he attempted to jump from a foot over-bridge on to the roof of the moving train. his jump turned into a nightmare as he failed to maintain balance and fell through the gap between two compartments. in reaction to his premature death, the students barricaded the station and torched its furniture, railway office, police rooms and train compartments. the students demanded tk 30 lakh compensation to the family of the ill-fated student, removal of the vc and exemplary punishment for the “guilty” railway employees.
serious concerns
a) the leaders of the al are only concerned about hasina. they are unable to work to protect the interests of the millions of bangladeshis without their leader hasina. the al fought to create bangladesh, and in 1971, we all fought even in the absence of our leader bangabhandhu. through the years, the al must have created many leaders with true vision and wisdom to run the country.
religious harmony?
once again, i am left shaking my head in disbelief as the daily star publishes the claim of the nation's leaders that bangladesh is a country of religious harmony when, bless it, it does not hesitate boldly to inform its readers again and again to the contrary!
old wine….
it was sometime towards the end of 1968. i was a student of dhaka university. once i was walking along the road near hotel sheraton. to my surprise, i found hundreds of school children were lining on both sides of the airport road. at some places young girls and ladies wearing colourful sarees were practising some kind of dancing with the national flags in their hands. they were waiting to give a civic reception to general ayub khan-the then president of pakistan. i felt so sad.
a prisoner of conscience
it is now an open secret that the executive chief of the pakistani daily 'frontier post' has been made victim of an engineered and cooked up case. thanks to the apex court of the country-- supreme court of pakistan-- which converted his death penalty into life imprisonment. otherwise, everything is possible in this country of ours!!!

in response....
i have read your editorial entitled 'monga victims to get overseas jobs' and i must salute you for writing on a very important but quite neglected matter. you have just written on a burning issue. the people of 'monga' affected areas are dying slowly and silently. instead of protesting, they are fighting with dignity, with courage but they are not doing well because they are very simple or even naïve.

of course anyone following world news would know the name barrack obama. he's the one making, or we can say forcing to make headlines by turning the us presidential campaign more and more interesting. he's not just famous. in israel, around 95% don't wish obama to be the president. nevertheless, an obama win can rather be beneficial, for most, the americans as well as even us!
dealing with population boom
in the seventies, the population of our country was around eight crore and now it is almost double. but the land mass has not increased even by an inch. on the contrary, a good part of our arable land has been usurped by human habitation, various industrial developments and also erosion of land by rivers during the monsoon. with the present growth rate of population, any sane person would shudder to think about the situation that shall befall the country after 20/25 years.
shocking news
i was a student of ideal school and college. this school is still regarded as the best educational institution of our country due to its strict discipline and academic performance. the teachers of ideal school are also very qualified and they teach us not only about the educational matters, but also how we can become good human beings.
separate pay scale for bb employees?
two news items published on 19-05-2008 in 'the ittefaq' and 'the daily star' have drawn my attention. first, the caretaker government (ctg) is planning to provide a separate pay scale for the employees of bangladesh bank (bb) and the second one is that educationists have emphasised the need for raising the salary of teachers at primary level to ensure quality education by attracting meritorious persons to this profession. it is astonishing to me that the ctg is taking steps to implement the first one ignoring the second. and if it finally happens, a few people will be benefited. but it will obviously create a discrepancy and dissatisfaction among the employees of other government organisations. because if bb proposed pay scale were implemented, then the salary of third class employees of bb like drivers, telephone operators etc. will be higher than that of a first class cadre service officer ( first class officers' initial salary scale is tk 6800--13090 and third class bb employees' proposed initial salary scale is tk 7000--12000). so finding no other option, the employees of other government organisations will also demand a separate pay scale like 'judiciary employees' pay scale', 'university teachers' pay scale', 'rab pay scale', 'administrative cadre service pay scale' and so on. as a result, the aim of the national pay scale will not be attained. but it is a matter of regret that the area the ctg should give much more attention to remains ignored.
achievements of ctg
i think the present caretaker government will be remembered for its bold steps against corruption, along with the noble effort of cleansing the mess as well as the separation of judiciary from the executive.
