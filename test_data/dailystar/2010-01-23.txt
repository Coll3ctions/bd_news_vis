caring for green: thai experience
last time, when i was in bangkok for a few days, my friend mr. siriraks and his daughter candy took me to a tree plantation project in thailand's samut prakarn province and i stayed there for about two days. this was a great experience for me. at the start, i was reluctant to go there but my friend was a very tenacious fellow. finally, i nodded to his request to pass a good amount of time there. when i reached there, i found the place to be a real greenery which will remain imprinted in my mind for many years to come. i had an amazing time. thanks to my friend and his daughter so much for giving me the opportunity to experience such a beautiful greenery.

narcissist
i am a narcissist. that is what glory told me while she was in the u.s. two months ago for thanksgiving holiday. i have always known that. after hearing it aloud felt very strange. well, i knew that her eyes are windows that could see deep into my soul. that is why i avoid seeing or talking to her. we keep in touch through emails. she writes to me more often than i do. i want our correspondence to be occasional but she pays no heed as to what i want. she kept on writing until recently. she doesn't write anymore after our last phone conversation which lasted only six minutes. that is when she said i was a narcissist. if i see her or talk to her then she says things that i do not want to face or think about myself. her voice haunts me. with emails, i can choose what to say and avoid answering things that are deep in nature. she once told me she believes we are soulmates. this was very early on. and i laughed since i do not believe in clichés. she looked hurt. and never mentioned it again after i laughed her off. no, we are not in love. how could we be? i am in love with myself. i do not take other people's feelings into consideration anymore. i am happy to be alone. that is what i tell myself.
syed shamsul haq speaks to gantha
gantha is a creative writers' group that meets regularly at bengal shilpalaya in dhanmondi. new year 2010 was a happy start. on 4 january, gantha welcomed syed shamsul haq, an iconic writer of bangladesh, to a discussion session on creative writing. he spoke to a rapt audience for an hour and ten minutes, sharing his experience of over a five-decade long career in writing. his works cover 27 volumes of poetry, 16 plays (including 7 verse plays), of which the most prominent is payar awaj paowa jaaye , 9 novels, 57 novellas, 6 collections of short stories, 5 books of essays and impressions and 6 books of poems and adventures for the young.
of declining reading and downsized bookshops
you wonder at times about the state of reading in the world you are part of. there is the sense that it is dying, that indeed these increasing levels of sophistication coming into technology are in essence putting holes into our old habits of reading. not many people read today, which is a pity. worse is the knowledge that bookstores are being downsized because business is not good. and what you have in place of these truncated, eventually murdered bookstores is storehouses of all those things that reflect the decline of intellect in our times. visit any bookshop in dhaka. chances are it will be empty or perhaps a visitor or two will be there. those of you who might be tempted to visit the bookstores at aziz market in shahbagh too cannot boast of high visitor numbers, though you have some of the best books, newly published, to be had in the shops there. the old shops in new market are yet there, but there is something about the arrangement of the books on the shelves, together with the narrow space in the shops, that is pretty disquieting. the stores that specialise in english language works, of course brought in from abroad, today offer hardly anything that shows light at the end of the tunnel. besides, there are the prohibitive prices to consider. omni at dhanmondi has seen its book section confined to an increasingly narrow space. et cetera started off well. it is only the past about it you recall now. words n' pages, in gulshan, is yet out there. will it stay that way? at the old airport in tejgaon, the bookworm remains a beacon of happiness. how much longer will the lights gleam?

terrorism and the fifth amendment
the agreements reached between bangladesh and india during prime minister sheikh hasina's state visit to new delhi to combat terrorism is a positive move. it should allay fears abroad that bangladesh could turn into “next afghanistan”, a view expressed by then us secretary of state condoleezza rice on a visit to new delhi in 2005. bangladesh is also not in the list of 14 countries whose nationals have been placed on special security checks recently by us security agencies following the failed attempt by a nigerian national to blow a delta airlines plane short of landing in detroit on last christmas day.
the missing fulltime defence minister
the political administration of bangladesh suffers from two major weaknesses. one is the concentration of all powers in one hand, rendering pluralism a farce; the other is the non-existence of a full-time defence minister that makes civilian control of the armed forces dysfunctional.
unfolding corridor consequences
our closest neighbour india has been trying to have multiple corridors crisscrossing bangladesh for a long time. a group of people views this as a threat to our national security. well, perception varies from individual to individual. as for india, it can always ask this favour from its neighbour as long as the level of confidence permits such a venture and there is a potential win-win situation for both parties. strategists of both countries need to sit with unveiled intent and committed candour. it is unfortunate that issues like bhutan, water sharing and border demarcation between the two countries depict an obscure scenario in bi-lateral relations. regular killing of bangladeshis by bsf only adds to the bruised confidence. we need to consider the 60 years of sub-continental history before venturing into such a major undertaking. view the page star books review
jaswant's jinnah and fault lines of indian history
breaking with tradition is a courageous act. in the social arena one is labeled either a rebel or a crank. in the political world one risks finding oneself on the wrong side of popular opinion. in academia one can face blazing guns unless equipped with solid arguments and references. breaking the stereotyped portrayal of jinnah as a villain in mainstream indian historiography, jaswant singh's recent assessment of him is one such act. he is candid without malice, a rare feat. he doesn't mince words when pinning due responsibility for partition on the leadership across all divides in general but gandhi, jinnah, nehru and mountbatten in particular. his wit and eloquence are superb, though a bit repetitive at times. nevertheless, since history is viewed through the prism of the present no matter how objective (a highly sensitive topic like partition more so), his appraisal of jinnah on the wide canvas of india's independence movement too is not free of its constraints. i will mention only two.
eyes of madmen, signs of torture
isabel allende, like so many of her compatriots, left her native chile long ago. unlike many of them, however, she has kept returning to her country, coming away every time with newer insights into the society and politics of the land. as a writer, indeed as a novelist, allende has known enough about chile, about herself, to convince herself of her identity. she knows, certainly, that her second marriage, to an american, was guided more by the temptation of making a home abroad than giving expression to romantic passion. for all that practical demonstration of reality at work, though, isabel allende has remained the chilean she has always been. for her, chile is something more than a patch of geography. it is an image, an idea she has constantly nurtured and shaped and reshaped in the mind. and that is how she has reinvented the old country.
the explosion of woman power
over the centuries, and in many different countries, women have spoken out for their sex, and articulated, in different ways, their complaints, needs and hopes. in england, right up until the 1960s, the word `feminist' was usually pejorative. writers like rebecca west and virginia woolf sharply attacked the word `feminism.' american feminist estelle freedman argues that right from its origins, the word has carried negative connotations. juliet mitchell and ann oakley, in their third collection of essays, who's afraid of feminism ?, argued that `attacks on feminism frequently merge into a wider misogyny.' who is a feminist actually? margaret walters has tried to answer the question in her book.
