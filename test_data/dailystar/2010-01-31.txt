student vandalism at trade fair and ruet
the vandalism which a group of students resorted to at the international trade fair in dhaka on friday puts all of us to shame. our embarrassment only gets deeper when we note that at the rajshahi university of engineering and technology, students engaged in running battles with the police and bus workers and damaged some administrative offices of ruet. indeed, incidents of students all too often and on the flimsiest of excuses taking the law in their hands appear to have become the norm, with the authorities clearly proving incapable of coming down on these unruly elements with a firm hand. such inaction has sent out a very wrong message to people within and outside the country, which is that the unruly young can and do get away with their acts. in the end, it is the image of the larger body of peace-loving, classroom-oriented students that suffers because of the riotous ones in their midst.

international markets
the international financial markets were rattled by news of us president barack obama's plan to reign in the risk taking behaviour of financial firms. this let to a sharp increase in risk aversion, with equity markets across the globe taking a hit. on thursday the higher yielding currencies clawed back most of those losses after us president barack obama did not announce any new measures to restrict the financial sector. this sparked a recovery in risk appetite, with the australian and new zealand dollar pushing up against the usd. the euro slipped on thursday, hovering near a 6 1/2-month low against the dollar as investors remained wary on concerns over heavily indebted smaller euro zone countries such as greece and portugal. the dollar gained support after kansas city fed president thomas hoenig dissented from the fed's pledge to keep rates low "for an extended period", bolstering the market's view that rates may start to rise later in the year. analysts warned the euro was heading for more losses as concerns rise about the grim fiscal conditions in the euro zone. greek government bond yields have shot up on concerns over how athens will pay its debts. as a result, the 10-year greek/bund spread blew out on thursday to its widest since greece joined the euro in 2001. analysts said markets were aware other countries' fiscal positions may also be vulnerable. view the page metropolitan

political culture
the political culture of bangladesh is termed by many as confrontational. this simply means such a form of political culture which is very much antagonistic and instigative. almost each and every political party of bangladesh is not railed in the right path of development, rather each of them is derailed from the genuine direction of democratic polity. this unexpected and abominable political practices not only deter development initiatives but also cause a number of problems. such a form of hostile and ill political motive seriously deprives the common people from the light of overall development. in our country, this sort of politics has been a crucial issue. because of the absence of an appropriate democratic polity we do not see proper co-ordination and co-operation among the political parties. for example, our leading opposition party, the bnp is hardly concerned to play a constructive role in terms of participation in parliament. on the other hand, the al-led grand alliance, current ruling party, is also a bit reluctant to listening to the grievances and demands of the bnp.

save democracy
general moyeen u ahmed is proved to be justified to take action against the allegedly corrupt politicians. it is strange to see that they have learnt nothing, even after such a shake-up. do they need a second and harder shake-up ? we are just fed up with the falsehoods and politics of terrorism like what happened at dhaka university a few days back. this is going to be the order of the day if the culprits are not identified and taken to task.
it and we
it is nice to see that the country moving quite fast in terms of information technology in recent years. the notion of "digital bangladesh" is now a concrete truth. the latest proof is the novel and bold step by nctb in publishing its e-textbooks on its website. with the advent of internet, like every other sphere of life, education has got momentum with never-ending wide range of learning materials and aid being just a click away, that too absolutely free. view the page international
