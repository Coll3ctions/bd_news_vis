al gs's remarks
the ruling party's general secretary has said that the opposition's latest hartal was in fact not called on the issue of the caretaker government system or the power crisis and price hike of essentials, but to hinder the process of the trial of war criminals and the proceedings of the corruption charges against bnp chairperson khaleda zia's sons.
handling of hartal
we are relieved to note that sunday's general strike called by the bnp went off relatively peacefully. but the inconvenience that people were put through during the period of hartal is highly regrettable, and we find it utterly reprehensible that private and public property should be made targets of attack by hartal supporters as we saw being done the day before hartal when as many as 12 vehicles were destroyed. view the page sports
