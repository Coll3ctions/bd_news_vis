the lengthening shadows of stalking
the murder of a mother in madhukhali upazila of faridpur for protesting the stalking of her twin daughters is once more a sign of the menace of sexual harassment of young women taking on uglier colours. worse, it is a powerful indication of how our law enforcers have been failing, consistently and embarrassingly, to take action against those who have been committing such nefarious deeds. only the other day, the prime minister spoke of tougher laws being enacted to deal with these culprits. she reassured the nation that no one caught stalking women would be spared. our question, which is also that of society as a whole, is pretty simple: do we need newer laws to handle such criminality or do we need some effective, deterrent action on the ground to see to it that the menace is put to an end? the statistics, as a report by ain-o-salish kendra makes clear, inform us that despite the growing public condemnation of stalking, incidents of such manifest criminality have steadily gone up. and they have gone up because of the gross failure of the authorities to bring to justice those who have been indulging in the crime.
toppled building and rajuk's role
buildings are supposed to last for generations. some of ours fall before they are finished. the latest such incident occurred in dhakkhin khan area of our city where a three-storied apartment complex just fell on its side as a toy house used by children. thankfully, there were no deaths, even in the neighbouring house on top of which the building fell. the photograph speaks volumes about the fragility of the structure and clearly shows, even to the untrained eye, that the foundation was far too weak for it to support the so-called apartment building. most basic norms of construction were not followed. the question arises as to how could any one start building a structure based on such an ill-conceived design in the first place? is there no monitoring body that keeps tab on construction in the city areas? can anybody just build any structure, however flawed, anywhere at any time. this speaks volumes about our whole system of governance -- how building permission is given, who are qualified to raise a structure, under what soil conditions and with what safeguards -- there is no way of knowing whether any authority has satisfied itself that the concerns have been at all met before laying of the first brick. view the page sports

dengue outbreak

private cars and cng
the government has decided to shut down the cng filling stations for six hours a day in dhaka city in order to meet the household demands. but i suggest the govt. stop the supply of cng to private vehicles totally. it should be provided to public transports only, which are used by the general mass of the people.

whitewash?
as a people, we bangladeshis are so used to bad tidings that we tend to go overboard at the mere hint of a silver lining in the dark clouds that envelope us most of the time. the “reward” of a plot of land (where?) and a car (suv?) to 20 members of the bangladesh cricket team is, to say the least, a knee-jerk action, that is not justified by their performance on the field. please consider the facts:
mugging in city
law and order has deteriorated severely in the capital. almost everyone i know living in the capital, has an experience of getting mugged. i was mugged twice this year in the city's college gate area. one of my friends was not only mugged but also physically attacked by the muggers as he refused to give in to their demands. he is still suffering from severe injuries. the incidents of mugging occur in daytime also. we are never safe while commuting in the city.
mega beggars
believe it or not, bangladesh might enter the guinness book of records as the mega beggars of the world, judging by the photo published in the daily star of 28/9/10 of a trained elephant begging for money at a dhaka street (a mother with a child in her lap offering a gc note to the extended trunk of the elephant). is begging going to be a mega business soon in bangladesh?
media's writing competency
your staff correspondent's report on the subject matter, published in your pages on 16th october, where it was stated that prof. abdullah abu sayeed of bishwa shahitya kendra talked about the journalists' capability in writing correctly, grammar and composition wise. i agree with his views based on my regular reading of four english dailies of dhaka, practically from the first to the last page, as well as their weekly magazines and other english weeklies.
over commercialisation of cricket
mahendra singh dhoni started his life as a ticket collector in the indian railways. now, after playing cricket for some years, he is rich beyond imagination. he lives in a palatial house in ranchi, owns many expensive sports cars, motorcycles and what not. thanks to the game of cricket, more aptly to over commercialisation of cricket. cricket sells and sells like crazy.
illogical
to the utter dismay of the investors, the sec (securities and exchange commission) is interfering very much in the share market in the name of preserving the interest of small shareholders, by restricting loans, right shares, company's dividend, and by asking unnecessary explanation from the companies or by forming committees to investigate companies' affairs. thereby, the share market is becoming volatile.
tax on cars
the present government has imposed tax on cars, as they did during their previous tenure. the bnp government led by khaleda zia did away with such a ridiculous tax when it returned to power. i wonder in how many countries of the world, this tax on cars is prevalent, at least i have not found it in houston, texas.
cng filling stations
let us have a look at the cng filling stations in dhaka city. what do we see? traffic jams and long queues of course. the government has ordered that all gas pumps must be closed by three in the afternoon. it has created nothing but traffic jams. my school journey in the morning is a nightmare. the roads are packed with cars and these create gridlocks everywhere. i am getting late for school almost every day. previously, when this rule wasn't there, everyone used to take gas whenever they needed it. i urge the govt. to withdraw this order.

food security: imperative for good governance
bangladesh's progress in poverty reduction and move towards food self-sufficiency has been noteworthy. but while numbers hint at a success story, a more nuanced look at the story behind the numbers may bring little comfort. over 40% of the population still lives below the food-consumption based poverty line and the overall incidence of poverty remains high. malnourished and highly vulnerable, they lack the income and assets to protect themselves against livelihood fluctuations, diseases, monga or natural disasters.
