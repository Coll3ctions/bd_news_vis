demystifying call centres
in the last couple of months i have faced a barrage of questions on call centres that range from 'what are they' to 'how do you set them up'. but interestingly nobody asked the obvious 'how do you make money at it', indicating that most people are convinced it's a money spinner and they are destined to claim a share of this cyber (read virtual) bounty in no time. well, whether call-centres can make you really rich or leave you with a bag of airy day-dreams really depends on your due diligence before you start one, but then again tell me for which business it is not true.

khulna university incident
i guess people who keep a cursory eye on current happenings have already come to know about the recent khulna university incident. how would you really define the event? a simple case of anarchy? an usual agitation? or something which carries an immense impact and does make you concerned? i don't know how you have considered the occurrence and it does not really matter in this country what someone thinks, wants to express etc. because this country is simply run by something which i define as 'black magic', and of course this black magic lies far away from the hands of common innocent people who have already deleted the word 'human rights' from their lexicon.

'aamar bhalobasha'
radio aamar fm 101.6 fm is airing a weekly special programme 'aamar bhalobahsa' on every thursday from 12:00am to 2:00am where people get the opportunity to share their untold love stories with the listeners. it is a unique programme, especially in bangladesh context since for the first time in our electronic media's history, people here are getting the chance to directly express their love related affair. sometimes people share their sweet love stories, while most of the times people share their bitter experiences. the host of the show, namely love guru gives valuable suggestions to his guests. this programme is helping a vast majority of our population about the true essence of love and how we should keep a relationship in an honest and proper way. these days quite a lot of teenagers of our society are involved in various sorts of crimes after getting rejected by the opposite sex. sometimes they are even committing suicide because of getting rejected. this programme is motivating those youths to live their life to the fullest. it is inspiring them to take the correct decision which will be beneficial for them and for society. thus this programme is helping our society a lot. there is no denying that this programme has gained enormous popularity within a short span of time and therefore some people are trying to stop it. they are reportedly putting pressure on the radio aamar authorities to stop broadcasting of the show since according to them, it is not the right kind of show for our country & culture. they feel that people here are talking directly about love which is still a taboo in our society. but i think if radio aamar stops broadcasting the show due to outside influence, than it will be a shame for all of us. our country is keeping pace with the modern world but that doesn't mean that we are not respecting our own culture and tradition.
commuter's rights
on may 12, 2008, i experienced some trouble as a commuter because of the privilege the so-called vips have. i was on the vip road and soon the road became standstill, because an adviser came from the wrong side of the road, to avoid traffic on the side his car was supposed to be on. i, along with many common people, had to make a path for the adviser's car, coming from the wrong side. this is something travellers face each day due to the vips. being a taxpayer of the country and more than that a citizen, i do not want to face these troubles on the road. why should i make way for a vip, that too coming from the wrong side of the road?

rickshaws
we fully support a rickshaw free capital. but why blind our eyes to other parts of the country where too we do not need rickshaws as a means of transport. we urge that rickshaws be withdrawn as a means of transport from the whole country as it involves immense rigor to the pullers and makes them physically and financially incapable. let's have alternative means of livelihood than pulling rickshaws. needless to mention that all rickshaw pullers live in slums and all these slum dwellers are used by our political parties as means for all illegal activities like drug peddling, observing hartals, and name what have you. we should certainly put an end to all these.
clashes in ku
i am writing this in response to the news regarding the clashes among workers, police and students in khulna. i am a student of khulna university, which is the only university that is session jam and politics free. our varsity was closed on thursday for a 4-week long summer vacation. we already had our vacation plan. we were leaving our campus one by one by buses and trains. but as it happens regularly, the workers of bus terminals behave roughly with us(not only students but all other people). but i saw it for the first time that students were beaten severely by the transport workers.

any discussion on kazi nazrul islam gets weighted down with superlatives. his incomparable writings, in a very short spell, established nazrul as a genius in the arena of bengali literature.
nazrul in sylhet
in 1926, the "rebel poet" visited sylhet for the first time. in his memoirs, dewan mohammad azraf narrates how the idea of bringing kazi nazrul islam to sylhet developed. while studying at the sylhet murari chand college (commonly known as mc college), azraf came up with the idea and one of his classmates named aziruddin inspired him in this regard. one fine morning, nazrul was spotted on a train at kulaura station. starting from gauhati via lamding, he was on his way to chandpur as part of his trip to calcutta. despite repeated requests from many, he could not make a stopover, as it was urgent for him to reach calcutta on time.
the legacy of nazrul sangeet
national poet kazi nazrul islam had contributed immensely to shape our culture and literature. his works remain popular and as esteemed as they were decades ago. on the occasion of nazrul's birth anniversary, the daily star spoke to a few renowned singers of the country, who shared their views on nazrul sangeet and steps that are necessary to preserve and continue the legacy of nazrul.
a hymn to life
i sing of them
who deliver to the earth
the message of harvest.
under whose hardened, blisterous palms
from merciless labour
the earth offers the gift
of baskets full of fruits and flowers.
under whose rule this earth
abounding in ferocious, wild beasts
and awful death and decrepitude
transforms into a beautiful,
blossoming garden!

time for embracing confrontation free-politics
regardless of what happened to the pro-liberation forces between 1975 and 2001, the nation was at least in some sort of comfort that the universally known war criminals had been kept at bay from grabbing power. but this was not going to last long.
when good turns to bad
in bangladesh, student activism dates back to the 1950s when some students died when police fired upon them. they were demanding the recognition of bengali as one of the state languages of pakistan. subsequently, with the pro-autonomy jukta front (united front) sweeping the polls in 1954, student activism subsided.
august 15, november 7, and post-january 11
the future does not seem to bode well for bangladesh. in a rapidly changing global economic scenario of soaring food and energy prices, and the uncertainty with climate change, our survival as a functioning sovereign state depends on unity. without unity, it will be impossible to manage our resources in respect to food and energy security amidst a political environment that is totally corrupt, divisive and dysfunctional.
huckleberry finn of the 21st century
i want to introduce readers to the huckleberry finn of the 21st century. most readers of this column will have read all or parts of mark twain's huckleberry finn, the story of a remarkable young man in revolt against his society. huck is a truly free person managing to escape such matters as going to bed when parents dictate, smoking if he wants, going any where at any time that crosses his mind, and avoiding school. view the page star city
