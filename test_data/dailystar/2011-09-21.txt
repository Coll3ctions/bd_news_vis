the violence on monday
the clashes between the police and workers of the jamaat-e-islami in the city on monday were a clear pointer to the increasing volatility coming into national politics. what is indeed surprising is that the jamaat was able to send its young members and followers into the streets in such ferociously organized form, enough to leave as many as 28 vehicles torched and hundreds of others damaged in various degrees. much more difficult to fathom is why the police found themselves in a position where they were overwhelmed by the protestors, who were demanding the release of their leaders now in prison. the jamaat had spelt out its programme days earlier and so the police ought to have had strategic measures in place to tackle the situation.

noise pollution

high price of food
“more poor people are suffering and more people could become poor because of volatility in the market and high food prices”, said world bank president robert b. zoellick. food price is increasing day by day. if this situation continues, then most of the people will not get sufficient food. as a result, people will suffer from malnutrition. and we will not be able to make an intelligent generation. they will not be qualified to lead a country. on the other hand, we are buying adulterated foods at high prices. as a result, we are having health problems. it is high time the government took steps to arrest price hike of all food items as well as stop food adulteration.
pharmacy business
people say pharmacy business is now a lucrative business. as a sincere citizen and an honest professional, i hereby take this opportunity to inform you that medicine-sellers should dispense medicines in the quantity as prescribed by the doctor or on the basis of the daily dose regimen. however, many pharmacies across dhaka have adopted the practice of selling medicines as per the bulk pack whether or not required by the patient.
a bewildered nation
we are bewildered by the actions and comments of our minister. it is very upsetting. we have learned that prime minister sheikh hasina has instructed the intelligence agencies to collect information about the leaders of the organisation who staged a rally at shaheed minar on eid day demanding safety on the road. it is a non-political organisation acting with the sole purpose of the welfare of the people but they are being treated like suspected criminals. how unfortunate it is!
9/11 tragedy
being a muslim, i condemn the attacks on 9/11 for many reasons. 9/11 marked the destruction of property, loss of lives, onslaught of islamophobia and intolerance, beginning of two costly wars, and gross violation of human rights in guantanamo bay. i was shocked when a few youths of bangladesh called 9/11 a “justice” on facebook. this is alarming because such minds are the breeding grounds for other destructive activities by terrorist organisations. this will also scare away non-muslim tourists and citizens from bangladesh. i would request the media to play an active role in promoting inter-faith dialogue. running away from religion-based discussion would only give rise to graver consequences. some universities offer a course on world religions, but do not actually conduct it. such a course is needed to teach the commonness among different faiths.
the child bride
for the last two weeks, i have been working as a kiosk associate at a shopping mall in one of the most posh areas of houston, texas. i must say, i am indeed very fortunate to have got this job at this time of high unemployment all over america. the west and its allies are against child marriage in the third world countries and more so in bangladesh, which is indeed praiseworthy.
india's suffering muslims
in recent times several militant attacks worried india. but innocent muslims are the victims of these cases. after the mumbai attack, a muslim boy named foyaj hossain was arrested, who was totally unaware about the blast, and killed in the custody after being tortured brutally. in 2007 during hyderabad mecca mosque attack, an innocent medical student was arrested, who endured inhuman tortures by the indian police. the police alleged that he was a militant without having any proof. there were also 60 innocent youths who were arrested around that time and 28 among them were sent to jail. but later it was found that the allegations made against them were totally false. in 2008, during gujarat ahmedabad bomb attack, 62 muslim youths were arrested. human rights organisations are silent and inactive in these cases. india is a democratic country but they are violating human rights in such a way!

i did not feel the earthquake at all! i live in niketon and work in banani. so every day, i have to traverse, by rickshaw along one of the three 'roads' that exit from gulshan-1 to mohakhali road.
let us be good
while travelling on buses and trains, i see the tattered poverty-ridden faces, naughty visages of the smugglers with bags of smuggled indian sarees aggravating the already trade imbalance with india. the rich, busy enjoying their easygoing lives in comfy cars and dwellings suffering no load-shedding, hardly understand the pains of the teeming millions. the 'proven honest' ministers are there but still the impassable roads continue to send vehicles on collision courses and kill us every day. and still, money meant for the poor fill the miscreants' pockets, still criminals are given a wide berth while the innocent get the heavy battering at the law-enforcers' hand. pervasive corruption is widening the chasm at the bottom and helping economic disparity to grow. cannot we leave our children a corruption-free bangladesh? is it too difficult for this proud nation to achieve? it is high time we set out to realise our dreams. from now on, let us be good, selfless, helping and noble, aiming a long-term benefit in the life here and hereafter.

gaddafi and the assassins
it was quite in order for sheikh hasina to remind us of a rather forgotten bit of our history some weeks ago. as she would have us know, when she first took office as bangladesh's prime minister in june 1996, colonel muammar gaddafi wrote to her to seek pardon for the assassins of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman. remember that at that point their trials had not got underway, though it was fairly obvious that the law would soon be applied in bringing them into the net. quite a few of them happened to be in the country, one of them being farook rahman. those who knew this arch conspirator in those days will testify to the arrogance he went on demonstrating even after the awami league had come back to power. he was convinced that sheikh hasina would not have the courage to touch him.
