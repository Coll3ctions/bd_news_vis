polybag back in business?
without perhaps realising it, we are losing our battle with polythene shopping bags. we had discarded it six years ago under a nationwide ban. we carved a good name among the developing countries by the move but now the reputation is wearing thin. the almost ubiquitous reappearance of the non-biodegradable material poses a great threat to environment, particularly by choking the already dysfunctional sewerage system, not to speak of its insidious effect on soil quality and public health.
making dhaka more liveable
a few days ago i met someone who had come to bangladesh on a brief consultancy assignment. he had been in dhaka for about a week and was on his way home the next day via bangkok. i asked him about his impressions about our capital. the question came after his query about the historical past of the city and the current efforts by some institutions to celebrate its 400th anniversary. being a european by origin, he hesitated at first and then asked me if i would mind some straight comments. i assured him that candour was not a virtue but nevertheless, was welcome as far as i was concerned.
politics and polemics: a south african parallel
do the current developments in the political scene look as though the country is moving ahead along a well-charted way towards reconciliation and a return to democracy? though some of the roadblocks seem to have been averted, internal strife in the parties and inter-party bickering to gain or retain power circumventing the political and electoral reforms once agreed to in principle, still seem to pose a threat. mere acquiescence to the adoption of forms of reform rather than its spirit and substance, more as measure of expediency than anything else, cannot help return to desired democracy. for this, a change of heart is required perhaps on the part of both the administration and the political parties.
liberties and limits of democracy
it's one thing to throw out a bad government it's another to install something better. the caretaker government's attempt to clean up a corrupt political system and adopt economic reforms to help rebuild a ramshackle economy may have failed to a certain extent, but when politicians offer only crowd-pleasing rhetoric instead of sound and proven ideas, the result is not a promise of hope. unsurprisingly, the caretaker government aroused public expectation of change, but couldn't achieve much. it is always difficult to defeat ghosts of the past. some sociologists jokingly commented that corruption has entered the dna of our national culture and has naturally reproduced itself there. political corruption is widespread throughout the country. unscrupulous politicians see their main job as to harvesting money. view the page sports

food security of bangladesh
bangladesh, our beloved motherland, is the abode of a brave nation. natural and man made calamities take away most of our belongings time and again and put us on the crossroads of life and death. still, our courageous people resort to struggle for their existence almost barehanded. they don't look for mercy nor do they care for any support. this struggle, which they definitely win, shapes their lives. these victorious people are our inspiration. we fought the liberation war and achieved independence with this motivation and inspiration. in the last 37 years since independence we at times were drowned in deep frustration and at times sparkled with the ray of hope. but our journey never ended. neither shall it end now. the promised election shall be held by the end of this year. like all other common people i also hope that the new, honest elected leadership will lead the country towards development through the desired path. bangladesh shall rise with new dreams, new realities, new thinking and new rhythms, the whole world shall admire a new bangladesh. but there are some crisis those need immediate attention and any delay in addressing those may retard progress. one such crisis is that of food security.

how bangladesh can avert the crisis?
after the us president george bush had refused to sign the “biodiversity” treaty in 1992, the last effort to save the planet from environmental disasters seemed to be on the verge of failure . for the affluent countries like the u.s. the chickens have come home to roost. the u.s. in the last one decade suffered several weather related catastrophes like severe flooding, hurricanes and prolonged hot summer days in some states. after hurricane katrina ravaged new orleans in 2005 and flooded the city for days, hurricane gustav with a surge as high as 14 ft accompanied by torrential rain is speeded up to hit louisiana forcing two million people to flee to safety the other day.
conservation engineering: saving marine turtles
marine turtles have been swimming the world's oceans since before the dinosaurs roamed the earth, more than 110 million years ago. turtles are an important component of the marine ecosystem and serve as indicators of the health of the environment in which they live. their aesthetic appeal draws conservationists and tourists from around the world to nesting beaches throughout the region, generating income for local communities. in many countries, marine turtles are used for their meat, egg and shell, representing a traditional source of food for human populations. however, these treasures of ancient times are now on the brink of extinction. all seven sea turtle species are globally endangered including the five species that swim in bangladesh territorial waters and are listed as "threatened" or "endangered" in the iucn red data book. the proposed revision of bangladesh wildlife preservation (amendment) act 1974 has also included the marine turtles in the list of protected species. the species are: dermochelys coraicea (leatherback), chelonia mydas (green turtle), lepidochelys olivacea (olive ridley), eretmochelys imbricata (hawksbill) and caretta caretta (loggerhead).

indian poets writing in english
poetry volumes--especially books and publications of single poets, of new poets--now have become hard to market outside of libraries and literature classes. as editor jeet thayil (60 indian poets, penguin india, 2008) observed ruefully in his introduction, “unlike indian novelists, poets receive no advances; their books are usually out of print; even the best known among them have trouble finding publishers and are virtually unknown outside india.” he could have been writing--excepting the very select few--about poets in general, anywhere. poetry published today therefore tend to be anthologies, collections which cover all bases and are geared towards appealing to as broad a range of readers as possible. so it's not surprising to see that this poetry volume by penguin india is an anthology: there are obviously market calculations that have been made. but let's not quibble: it's a welcome event to see a publisher put money and time into publishing a poetry volume.
marketing india
there are certain indians who make you feel good about being a bangladeshi, who give you a warm glow that despite all that razzmatazz and heavyweight tiffin boxes and big brains like amartya, they too produce and consume their quota of trash. shobhaa de is one of them. she is a writing phenomenon, whose books sell all over india, and in pakistan too (where all the good and high society people fell over each other to fete her when she did a tour there not so many months back), and bring in a hefty chunk of change for her publishers penguin india. since i have never read any of her books, i only had a vague idea that she wrote romance novels. that's going by the perhaps less than solid evidence of having seen her on zee tv a couple of times flaunting her cheekbones.

managing angina without surgery
there are several modern invasive tools cardiologists are using to treat angina (chest pain) including angioplasty (blowing up balloons to expand the artery at sites of block), stenting (insertion of cylindrical wire mesh tube prop open the blocked artery) and bypass surgery (increasingly through very small incisions). but drug therapy may be just as effective to restore blood flow as invasive surgery for stable angina, a new analysis published in the new england journal of medicine suggests.

does cancer have an answer?
does cancer have an answer? to many people, cancer is a terrifying disease, which they hope not to get, and prefer not to think or talk about. but in reality, cancer is neither uncommon nor is it untreatable. some types of cancer can be completely cured. with many other types, early diagnosis and proper treatment makes a big difference.

bangladesh at crossroads
bangladesh is at cross roads; lessons learnt since 1/11 could unite us towards a better future or a failed one if they are ignored. this government came at a time when the bnp and the al, in pursuing their respective self-interests, had set bangladesh on course to becoming a failed state. the bnp was scheming to return to power.

barely hundred days are left for the parliament election; the sheen of the ctg is fading as a reminder of its imminent departure. it is a defining moment: how would it like to be judged. the sword of emergency is dangling on our heads. suggesting the right course when the authority goes wrong is dangerous in an environment of suspended democracy. yet the country belongs to the people, in the spirit of '71 cowardice must not be cultivated in the face of fear or danger. we are on a cross road, the controversies might endanger the stability of bangladesh.

a demonic manifestation of political power
a thing may or may not be beautiful but it certainly is powerful when it speaks the truth. with a clear and loud voice of conscience, it transforms itself into a most reliable and, therefore, a valid document mirror imaging atrocities most barbaric and nefarious. and this exactly is recorded in marudyaney nandigram 2007 , by kabir sumon, formerly known as sumon chattopaddhaya. the book is a compilation of only nine not so elaborate write-ups that appeared in three different newspapers of west bengal over a period of roughly one year.
