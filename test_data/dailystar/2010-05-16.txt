cop atrocity on cab drivers
the police action on some of the taxicab drivers in farmgate area on thursday following requisitioning of their vehicles deserves to be condemned in the strongest of words. on the day, some policemen stopped taxicabs randomly on the road to requisition them, and beat the cab drivers when they resisted the move. what is most appalling is that the police personnel almost denuded one cab driver during the scuffle that followed. eight drivers were arrested and sent to tejgaon police station and the very act infuriated other cab drivers, who grew in number, and staged a demonstration before the police station on friday for their release. here again policemen used batons to disperse them when the cab drivers raised their voice against such 'illegal and whimsical' requisition, which caused them financial loss and harassment.
government's plans for free education
the government is planning to make education free for all, right from primary school and all the way up to the university. there is little doubt that the move is a good one and will resonate with public expectations. we appreciate the thought behind the policy which, we understand, is yet in the process of being shaped. however, we also feel that there are some practicalities which must be considered before such a policy is put in place. from such a perspective, we need to raise the question of why the necessity for free education must arise at all, especially at the public university level. more to the point, there should be a fundamental delineation of the education process that will enable the country to produce not only scholars but also experts and technical hands at the practical level of society. in today's world, where practicalities are as much significant as idealism, it is important that besides promoting university education steps also are taken for the provision of well-defined technical education to those who may not be drawn to higher education. view the page sports

weekly currency roundup
may 9 -13, 2010
international markets:
the attention this week was focused on the post election scenario in the uk and events in the europe. price action was extremely volatile in both currencies. the euro fell to a one-week low on thursday, as looming fiscal tightening requirements in the euro zone outweighed the benefits of an aid package aimed at shoring up euro zone bond markets. a $1 trillion rescue deal hammered out at the weekend by global policymakers had eased investor worries a greek sovereign debt crisis will spread. however, concerns about the ability of fiscally weaker states to make necessary budget cuts and about the impact on growth continue to weigh on the euro. passage of the rescue deal has boosted risk appetite this week, providing a temporary floor to the single currency. however later in the day, the euro had given back earlier gains to trade down 0.3 percent versus the dollar bringing last week's 14-month low back into focus. the dollar was up around 0.1 percent against the yen. versus a basket of currencies, the greenback was up 0.3 percent at 85.038. the index hit a 1-year high of 85.268 last week. the australian dollar trimmed gains to trade up 0.5 percent at $0.8980 versus the us dollar. australian employment data came in stronger than expected earlier, pushing the currency back above $0.9000. analysts said interest rate rises from the reserve bank of australia may be limited by external factors, potentially capping further aussie gains. sterling fell 0.3 percent versus the dollar, hit by a fall in risk appetite and as uk trade data showed the deficit widening more than expected in march. view the page metropolitan

river dredging
bangladesh is criss-crossed by rivers. the total waterways measure 24,000 km. two of world's large rivers the ganges-padma and the brahmaputra- jamuna flows through this country. these rivers carry 2.4 billion tonnes of silt annually. the navigable route has been reduced by 2000km in the last 25 years due to siltation. at present the navigable route stands at 3800km only. so the government of bangladesh decided to dredge rivers to increase navigability of the river at a cost of tk. 11,472 crore in two phases. in the first phase, 23 rivers will be dredged at a cost of tk 4201 crore in 3 years and in second phase 53 rivers will be dredged at a cost of tk. 7271 crore . the project work will be completed in 8 years starting from now. the government expects 89 % assistance from donors. but work will begin now with our own resources.

great personalities
throughout the country, tagore's 150th birth anniversary is being observed with great enthusiasm. he is the creator of many masterpieces of literature. i revere him for his immortal songs and short stories, especially chuti, shasti and kabuliwala. in chuti, he portrayed the life and tragedy of a restless teenager named phatik. in shasti, he raised his voice against the negative effect of feudalism and in kabuliwala, he depicted fatherhood.
money - black or white
there should not have been any controversy on the money the former prime minister legalised during the caretaker administration which allowed everyone to bring their hidden money in the light by paying some penalties or taxes. the former prime minister legalized a huge sum that meant she had some money which was not white. this money possessed by anyone is called "black money". i believe, the prime minister's charges against the former prime minister of "whitening black money" are not wholly unfounded.

trial of war criminals

mobile plants for desalination
the news published in your daily on april 26, 2010 stating that japan would provide five water purification mobile desalination plants is no doubt a welcome development. people living in the coastal belts have been suffering from drinking water crisis due to salinity and after any natural disaster this problem is compounded. only the sufferers can realize it. as i was upazila nirbahi officer of shyamnagar upazila under satkhira district about three years ago, i saw the untold sufferings, especially after two major disasters i.e. 'sidor' and 'aila'. after aila the water bodies of this upazila were submerged by saline water except a few ponds located around the headquarters. people had been screaming for drinking water. instantaneously we set up a plant for filtering water in our upazila headquarters and supplied it to different corners. the district administration also supplied water transported by lorries. satkhira jubo academy supplied water in the whole of upazila setting up plants in the headquarters. oxfam, gb ganoshastya, assistance eau et environment, a french ngo, established plants for supplying water.

dress code
i have no grudge against somebody's wearing a suit even when the temperature of the country runs between 33° to 34° celsius (figure obtained from the met office).
load shedding
at present load-shedding is a common thing in our country. it hampers our social and economic development greatly. misuse of electricity and insufficient production are the main causes of it. this problem is going out of control day by day. we cannot think of a happy and care-free life because of this problem. the govt should take necessary steps against it. new laws may be passed to tackle it. people should be made conscious of it. meetings and seminars may be arranged focusing on the bad effect of it. thus if we try honestly, this problem will disappear from our country one day.
