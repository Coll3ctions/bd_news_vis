dr. yunus' lone voice at davos reverberates
nobel laureate muhammad yunus, alone among all participants at the world economic forum in davos, has spoken of the need for a safety net for the world's poor. his remarks, made against the backdrop of the on-going global recession, drive the point home that for all the bailouts that governments have been planning for global corporate business not much can be expected if the plight of the poor is ignored. we are of the opinion that by focusing on the issue, yunus has in his own way drawn necessary attention to a crisis that just might be up ahead for the poor nations of the world. it should now be for the more prosperous, though gravely afflicted affluent societies, to refocus on the issue. with former us president bill clinton endorsing yunus' suggestions, the shaping of a concerted approach here ought not to be a problem.

after more than 30 years of politics of erection and uprooting of foundation stones of rangpur university, it finally came into being in november, 2008. it not only met the dream of the people of rangpur but also fulfilled a long cherished demand for higher education of this less developed region of northern bangladesh. within the shortest possible time, the university authority successfully completed the admission test, processed results and completed enrolment formalities with the help of college teachers hired for the purpose (as it had no teaching staff of its own). that is, the whole process took about a month, so that classes could start from 28 january as declared.
seating row
yes, the out going speaker has left behind his legacy while making the seating arrangements for the mps. thanks to the government party for accepting the situation peacefully and perhaps temporarily; otherwise, this could lead to a very unpleasant scene in the parliament. the thing which has drawn my attention is regarding the seating arrangement of sheikh selim. he has been allocated a seat in the same row of the pm keeping a number of senior members of the al behind. i guess the outgoing speaker did not intend to embarrass the pm by putting her relative in the front row. the minister for foreign affairs is a lady and at the same time holding one of the most important portfolios. i think injustice has been done to her including countless others. i think the outgoing speaker might feel shame for his action which betrays his attempt to spoil the atmosphere in the parliament from the very first session.
child welfare via 2009 calendar
the concept, the planning, the production, the distribution, the anticipated outcome and other aspects associated with 2009 unicef calendar, focusing on certain core aspects of child welfare, facilitated by a set of children's photographs can, among other things, be considered as a product of meaningful, intelligent and laudable effort on the part of unicef, bangladesh, towards promoting the relevant dimensions of child welfare in the country - predominantly against the backdrop of the organization's present day vision and mission - unite for children. congratulations!
a freedom fighter as the second deputy speaker
the ninth parliament has unanimously elected (awami league-led alliance nominee) two freedom fighters -advocate abdul hamid and colonel (retd) shawkat ali, as the speaker and deputy speaker respectively, in its first sitting. both are veteran parliamentarians. colonel (retd) shawkat ali - then a captain of pakistan army and an accused in the 'agartala conspiracy' case (officially called 'state vs. sheikh mujibur rahman and others' ) of 1968 - is a historical figure of bangladesh freedom struggle. advocate abdul hamid was the youngest ever member of pakistan national assembly in 1970, at the age of 25. in fact, freedom fighter heroes have presented bangladeshi people the right to vote and the parliament.
humongous bureaucracy
the bureaucracy that bangladesh has today was the brainchild of the british colonial masters. it was known as the “steel frame” of british raj. rightly so, because it served the real purpose of the british, which was to extract taxes from the natives and plunder their wealth by all coercive means. unfortunately, sixty years after their departure, this country is yet to get an efficient and effective civil service. the colonial footprint on the functioning of the administrative machinery is still very visible.
sadek hossain khoka sarak?
recently i noticed a plaque in gobibagh area mentioning "sadek hossain khoka sarak". the road is just behind the sonali bank quarters and near the ancestral house of our mayor. it is difficult to believe that it is a road. after 9am it becomes very difficult to cross the road as it turn into a workshop/garage. they repair different types of vehicles in the middle of the road forgetting the sufferings of the people. nobody dares protest.
diabetes
the number of diabetics in our country is rising day by day. but all of us are not aware of this disease. the term 'diabetes' refers to a medical condition caused by a lack of insulin, and insulin is a very essential chemical substance produced in the human body, which controls the amount of sugar in the blood. diabetes deteriorates the injured part of the body, causes serious kidney problems and affects the eyesight. the primary symptoms are: producing lots of urine, feeling very thirsty, hungry and weak. the most important thing is that, a person may get this disease at any age of his life. so, it is high time we went for a medical check-up and kept a good discipline in life, especially by taking a diabetic diet and doing enough exercise everyday.
slumdog millionaire
what a shocking experience! i just watched slumdog millionaire, the movie that won 4 golden globe awards this year and also got 10 academy award nominations. obviously my expectation was pretty high before i got in to the theatre. but after watching the movie i now doubt the nomination process of these hollywood awards.
missing mug shots
i have tried to get used to not seeing the photos of your esteemed journalists on top of their articles. i have reminded myself how much i respect the editorial board and sternly told myself that such authoritative figures must know best - but it is no good, i don't like it.
a young citizen's reaction
an article entitled 'what is at stake' written by sajeeb wazed was published in the forum, in its december' 08 issue. i'd gone over it once before 29 december general election, and thrice or more after it, with a view to getting an impression about national issues on which sajeeb wazed, as a rising politician, wanted to put emphasis. he tried his best in his article to establish two things, as i could find out. firstly as a political party, only bangladesh awami league is the party that can run the country in the right way, and secondly, for economic development, some special policies need to be adopted which awami league did in its last regime, that's why then the price-inflation was under control. view the page international

textbook crisis
it is a pity that the government has failed to provide most of the textbooks to the students of secondary schools. the education sector had not been given enough attention during the last 37 years, though it is a very sensitive sector. it is true that governments have gradually increased budget allocation to this sector. this has, however, been more helpful for the teachers and the management, but the students were not much benefited, particularly those of primary and secondary schools.
