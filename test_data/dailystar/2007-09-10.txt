wetlands
it is good news for our country and an achievement! ramsar convention on wetlands published our organisation's world wetlands day celebration photo as the theme photo of world wetlands day 2008.
balanced migration
the most recent policy announcement of the government is to compel the diversification of labour migration flows. this is to be achieved by requiring that the selection of migrant workers reflect a greater geographical diversity in the sourcing of the workers. areas that do not have a history of labour export or that are especially disadvantaged by poverty such as the north-west are to be privileged in the selection of workers for export. bmet is to be the lead agency in implementing this policy and the policy has been welcomed by local experts on labour migration. however, this quota system is to be achieved by disrupting the established migration chain and social networks. therefore any gains that might be made in achieving greater diversification will be made by weakening the support structures of the existing labour migration flow. the importance of social networks in supporting migration and establishing strong cumulative causation is recognised as one of the principle means by which sustainable migration flows can be ensured. the new policy will therefore work against one of the few support structures that bangladeshi labour migrants have in the destination countries which is their expanding social network. by compelling diversification at the expense of this support structure the government of bangladesh only creates another obstacle to the existing flow of migration. it can then be expected that the existing migration network will resort to irregular channels if necessary to enable their friends and relatives to overcome this new barrier to their migration.
police
i, as a concerned citizen, want to write about an incident that happened on september 03, 2007 at 6.30 pm, while i was passing through zindabazar (sylhet) by a cng vehicle. i saw a traffic constable insulting a car driver without any logical reason, some other traffic personnel also joined him. i was amazed. i did not find anything wrong with the car driver.
russian nuclear reactor
construction of the chernobyl power station began in the 1970s. the first of the four reactors was commissioned in 1977. reactor no. 4 began producing power in 1983 and it exploded on saturday, april 26, 1986, at 1:23:58am local time. this plant was built by russia. the chernobyl accident cost the former soviet union billions of dollars, and some observers believe it may have hastened the collapse of the soviet government. massive amounts of radioactive materials were released into the environment, resulting in a radioactive cloud that spread over much of europe. the greatest contamination occurred around the reactor in areas that are now part of belarus, russia, and ukraine. after the accident, the soviet authorities resettled more than 350,000 people outside the worst affected areas, including all 50,000 people from nearby pripyat, but millions of people continue to live in contaminated areas.
abortion policy
i wish to commend the vatican, and more recently catholic bishop michael evans of east anglia for condemning amnesty international's new pro-abortion policy. amnesty has fallen victim to a distorted rationale that tends to place a higher priority on human suffering than on life itself. contrary to amnesty's new position, human welfare depends upon a shared responsibility that involves moral limits. there are no "small" murders. the respect for every human life is an essential condition if a societal life worthy of the name is to be possible. when man's conscience loses respect for life as something sacred, he inevitably ends by losing his own identity.
muslims in west bengal
a recent study by bbc bengali service revealed the sorry state of affairs of muslims in the left -uled west bengal. with 26% population, muslims are employed in 2.1% government services and 1.98% private services. their representation in business and other gainful employment is even more negligible. interesting to note that these ratios were slightly better during the congress rule. their fate took a continuous downward trend during the so called progressive rule of the cpm-led left coalition for whom muslims voted en masse.
father of the nation
ask any indian, who is your father of the nation? they will say mahatma gandhi. ask any pakistani the same question and the answer will be muhammad ali jinnah. ask bangladeshis about their father of the nation, the answer to the question will be not that clear. many of us will hesitate to answer, some are confused, some will say bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and so on. it is tragic and unfortunate that we educated bangladeshis are confused and misguided.

arrested teachers
the other day i was watching a documentary on the role of us media leading up to the invasion of iraq by the us. the documentary, buying the war, was a brainchild of mr. bill moyer, a famous us journalist. the main thrust of it was how the media moguls and individual journalists who are known in the us for their professional integrity failed to stand against the wind of emotive national sentiment to avenge on anyone perceived to be related with the 9/11 attack.

discretion and law-enforcement
mr. huda's article on the subject (sept:01) attempts a rational analysis of the policing attitudes in law enforcing activity. however, in my opinion the very terminology "law enforcement" has a connotation of force and violence attached to it. a better term could be law implementation; which is realistic and rational. the subject matter in mr. huda's write-up should be applicable to all services concerned with implementing the law.
students overheating
while the mere incident could be handled without any violence, the whole country was strangled for a few days. i was really frustrated to see students taking to the street to protest, vandalising public and private property. there are other forms of protests which could easily avoid these incidents. the army left the campus as the students demanded. why did the students then go to the streets again? the government is suspecting that some groups influenced the students and took advantage of the situation. all the du students are adult enough and they are well educated. how could they be so easily influenced? view the page international
