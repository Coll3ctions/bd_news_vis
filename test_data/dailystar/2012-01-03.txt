chaos on campus
the recent unrest on university campuses caused by the ruling party's student wing bangladesh chhatra league (bcl) activists has a pattern to it which is worrying. in only the last two days, they beat up a student at buet, ultimately leading to a campus shutdown; created chaos at shahjalal university of science and technology (sust); and assaulted police personnel at rajshahi university. the first case arose from a “scuffle” between senior and junior students which later evolved into a physical altercation leaving one of the student's hand broken. the second incident occurred at a reception where bcl members presented a memorandum to the university grants commission (ugc) chairman against the current apparently “corrupt” administration. the third was allegedly provoked by derogatory remarks made against the prime minister by police personnel which led to one policeman being made to do sit ups holding his ears in public and physical injuries. the motives may have varied but the perpetrators were of the same wider group, though, as is the norm, in at least one of the cases, the bcl's official position was that the culprits are not associated with the organisation.

looking at us economy 2012
it may not be obvious, but the us economy has been getting better. after a fairly miserable first half of the year, the economy grew by 2% in the third quarter and is likely to accelerate to more than 3% growth in the final quarter of 2011. while there are a number of signs that recent momentum could carry into next year -- job openings are on the rise, the unemployment rate is trending down and corporate profits relative to gdp are at their highest level in over six decades -- the economy does not operate in isolation. there are two major risks to the us outlook: the expanding financial crisis in europe and fiscal restraint from capitol hill in washington. on both fronts, the risks have intensified in the last few months.

as the establishment celebrates the three-day police week 2012 from today, the imperative of updated police legislation after forty years of independent existence assumes special significance. since there is universal agreement that the purpose of police legislation is to establish an efficient and effective police service that gives top operational priority to servicing the needs of the public, the fitness of the police act, 1861 can certainly be called into question.
moving forward
the introduction of socialism as a pillar of the constitution was intended as a metaphor for social justice. the struggle for social justice was central to every democratic struggle which inspired the politics of the people of bangladesh from the peasant uprisings of titumir and nureldin, to the 6-point/11-point movement led by bangabandhu which drove the election campaign of 1970. the dispossessed peasantry of bengal, which constituted the numerical majority of the population, provided the support base of every major democratic struggle. it was this same class of peasants, now joined by a nascent working class and the students of bangladesh, who provided the vanguard for the liberation struggle. it was this class which gave the awami league its overwhelming electoral victory in 1970 and uncompromising support to the non-cooperation movement which culminated in the genocide unleashed by the pakistan army on march 26, 1971. it was again this same subaltern class which provided the foot-soldiers for the liberation war and bore the brunt of the casualties. it was their families which were the principal victims of the genocide, their wives and daughters who were raped and their homes which were burnt by the pakistani army.
pakistan's afghan role
the rupture in the broad security partnership between the united states and pakistan has significant implications in the fight against terrorism. a key casualty of the rift is the area of "af-pak", a term the obama administration uses for afghanistan and pakistan - and which it designates as a single theatre of operations where common policy approaches apply. what is worrying is that targets who operate with a fair degree of impunity on either side of the border of the two countries - the terrorist groups - will be tempted to step up their game even more now, and convert any space being vacated into their own strategic domain. last month's us air strike which killed 26 pakistani troops near the afghan border - which precipitated the current downturn in relations - was a dreadful accident for which the us concedes responsibility.

2011: year of the restless sun
after five years of surprising quiet, the sun roared to life in 2011. our star erupted with numerous strong flares and waves of charged particles. many researchers predict the surge will culminate in a peak in the sun's 11-year activity cycle in 2013.
the chandrasekhar limit
in the year 1928, an indian graduate student named subramanian chandrasekhar who went to cambridge university to study astronomy, stumbled upon a revolutionary idea about stars. the young indian scholar thought that it would be intriguing to know how big a star could get while still supporting itself against its very own gravity even after it has used up all of its fuel that illuminated itself at the first place. it is understood that, in its lifespan, when a star eventually becomes very small, the matter particles in it becomes very close to each other. and based on pauli exclusion principle, these particles have very different velocities which make them move away from each other which, in effect, make the appearance of the star as if it is expanding. and thus, a star, at that stage, maintains a steady radius given the balance that exists between the attractions of gravity and the repulsion that arises from that very exclusion principle. but chandrasekhar very soon realized that there's got to be a limit to the process of repulsion that the exclusion principle provides.
molecule in a complex knot
chemists have tangled themselves a complicated knot: a molecule whose 160 atoms loop over one another like a five-pointed star.
serving cancer patients better
diagnosis of cancer and delivering better services to patients can be ensured in the country, if doctors, radiotherapists and technicians work as a team. an attitudinal change of doctors towards patients can also go a long way in providing quality treatment. in this manner, local cancer patients can be de-motivated from travelling abroad in the hope of better treatment. .

pockets of life on the icy continent
thin shoots of moss taken from fuzzy clumps growing in antarctica contain evidence of how human activities are affecting life on the ice-covered continent, new research indicates.
how radioactive is coal ash?
the fly ash emitted by a power planta by-product from burning coal for electricitycarries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy. * [see editor's note at end of page 2]
