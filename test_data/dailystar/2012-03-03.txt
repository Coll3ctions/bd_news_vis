teaching history: lessons from europe
bangladesh has completed forty years. for many here, our history began in 1971 with the pakistan military crackdown on the sleeping population of the then east pakistan. in fact, our history is much older than this. as a people, our political roots go back to colonial times, but as a culture our origins are much older, going back to pala times and beyond to our buddhist, hindu and animist heritage. popular memory evokes the mughals and the earlier hussain shahi bengal, when literature and the arts flourished and islam spread more widely than heretofore. the partition memories focus on the religious divide between hindus and muslims and the role of an external power in dividing a population that had co-existed in relative harmony. the pakistan memories are of punjabi domination and bengali resistance. the independence memories are about valuing the spirit of the liberation war and what that means for bengali nationalism. our identity has traversed many routes. we are moulded as much by our political trajectories as by our historical consciousness. in fact, every civilization that aspires for greatness tries to do justice to both: in other words, make correct political decisions and nurture a sense of history, of time and place, in order to learn from the past and be prepared for the future.

yemen under new leadership: hopes and fears
abed rabu mansour hadi, the newly elected president of yemen, has stepped into a new chapter of yemen's history. through a peaceful election, he replaced the 33 years rule of president saleh. definitely it is a good sign towards a democratic transition of the country, but the country has to do a lot of hard works to realise people's dream for change. yemen is one of the poorest countries in the arab world as well as a haven for islamic jihadists; al-qaeda is very active in this country. so the yemeni administration has to leap over severe economic, humanitarian as well as security hurdles to build a stable and developed yemen. view the page star books review
quivering yeats and weeping ocampo
it is now consensus history that in the 1950s muzharul islam pioneered a bengali modernism in architecture. his institute of fine arts (1953) at shahbagh, for instance, exemplifies the beginning of a climate-responsive and site-sensitive modern architectural language in the then east pakistan. however, what is not widely known is that islam's work also provides an intriguing cultural foil against which his architectural experiments with modernist aesthetics could also be explored as part of a broader form of bengali nationalism, rooted in the enlightenment of raja rammohun roy and rabindranath tagore. the chicago-based architect stanley tigerman, islam's yale university colleague who collaborated with him in the creation of five polytechnic institutes during the 1960s, views islam's architecture as part of the same search for a bangali identity that helped define the ideological foundation on which the new nation of bangladesh was eventually built.
the company he kept . . .
american liberalism was what men like john kenneth galbraith personified, especially from the mid-1950s till the end of the 1960s. and of these liberals, one of the best known was galbraith himself. with his tall, lanky figure, his boundless erudition and his ease with words, galbraith came forth with ideas that endlessly tested the imaginations of men everywhere, but especially in america. the affluent society, the anatomy of power, annals of an abiding liberal and a theory of price control are some of the seminal works he remains noted for. his theories relating to the economy, his prognostications on how finance ought to be handled and his overall view of politics as a force for social good have generally been the themes that have inspired thinking among an entire generation of political philosophers. and, along the way, galbraith has been a diplomat, one of the foremost that liberal america produced in the 1960s. as ambassador to nehru's india, he did what no one else has been able to do since: he established a relationship of trust between delhi and washington.
stories with moral undertones
the ekushey book fair, indeed, comes as a blessing for emerging new voices. when it comes to getting one's work published, young writers now have easier access to publishers, which is obviously a change for the better. even a few decades ago when our leading authors had begun publishing, things were a lot different. finding a publisher was not as easy. now that gap between budding authors and publishers has largely been bridged thanks to the book fair. many fresh new voices, who would otherwise have remained unknown, can get their works published now. shanta nirupama is one such new name who has stepped into the literary scene with her first short story collection published in the fair.
