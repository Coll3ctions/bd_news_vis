jatiya sangsad goes into session
the jatiya sangsad went into its first session of this year yesterday. we as well as all citizens across the country would truly have been happy if the opposition bnp had chosen to end its boycott of the house and returned to it. despite the fact that the lawmakers of the party were absent yesterday and have so far given no indication of when they mean to go back to the law-making body, it is still our expectation that they will, in the larger interest of their constituents and democracy, reconsider the boycott and resume their participation in the js. of course, it is taken for granted that the bnp lawmakers will make it a point to go to the house if only to preserve their membership of the body. rather than being exposed as having been compelled by circumstances to return to the js, the bnp should not only appear to be seen to be in the house but actually be seen there as a matter of conviction. we feel that it is its sacred responsibility to go beyond partisan considerations and indeed involve itself in the business of parliament -- through staying in the house. view the page sports
