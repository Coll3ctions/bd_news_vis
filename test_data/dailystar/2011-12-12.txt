disappearances: a new concern for citizens
disappearances of people from their homes or other places are on the rise. the issue becomes a matter of grave security concern for citizens, if the relatives, friends or people, who watched the circumstances of such incidents, point their fingers at the members of law enforcing agencies as the cause of the disappearances. just to think that the security personnel of a state are involved in these kinds of incidents sends shivers down the spine of every citizen. that is more so because in case people so taken into custody, as sometimes alleged, by security personnel are neither produced in the court of law for drawing legal proceedings against them, if any, nor returned to their respective addresses after interrogation or for whatever reasons they were arrested.

it looks like a proxy war is being fought on two fronts. on december 7, canada's environment minister peter kent stunned the audience of the world climate summit in durban, south africa. even as the secretary general of the un was making strenuous efforts to save the kyoto protocol, kent publicly called on the international community to turn the page on the protocol, which he termed outdated. any binding agreement restricting canada's scope to expand its co2 emissions is seen as unacceptable.
no education, no development
currently, it is estimated that the number of illiterate people in the country would be about 120 million, which is nearly half of the us population. needless to mention, no country can move ahead with such a heavy burden of illiterate people. they are people who do not have the awareness to do their best to improve their economic condition on their own because all the governments have failed to do anything for improving their lifestyle. they lead a vegetative life, and are languishing in poverty and squalor. it is a shame that the governments have failed to improve their economic condition.
