climate talks collapse in copenhagen
tempers have flared. the mood has got darker. the future looks set, so to say, to be more like the past or even the present after everything that has not happened in copenhagen. much as he would like to call the deal the united states has reached with china, india, brazil and south africa on coping with climate change a breakthrough, president obama knows that the long-drawn negotiations in the danish capital have clearly failed to satisfy the world's more disadvantaged nations. of course, the developed world has promised to make available nearly $30 billion dollars to poor countries over the next ten years to help them handle the crisis on an immediate basis. of course, there is the promise of $100 billion more coming after that. and, of course, there is the target of not letting world temperatures rise above 2 degrees celsius in order to stabilise the planet.
inflation rate on the rise
the latest figures of bangladesh bureau of statistics (bbs) show that the rate of inflation for both food and nonfood items has registered a marked rise, although it is still safely below double digit. what is important to bear in mind is that inflation which had fallen to 2.25 percent in june has been slowly but steadily increasing since july. and in october it stood at 6.71 percent on point-to-point basis, principally because of the rising food price.
un climate summit yields precious little
what is the fallout of the two weeks long un climate talks held in the danish capital of copenhagen? what has been achieved so far is far short of a perfect deal as envisaged in the beginning.
need for a clearer post-copenhagen roadmap
after several rounds of discussion, filled with brinksmanship and 11th-hour negotiations on the concluding evening of the copenhagen summit conference (between the usa, the eu, china, india and brazil), president obama has claimed that there had been "an unprecedented breakthrough," and that a climate deal had been forged. the accord is significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming. some members of the g-20 have also stressed that the accord has provided a system (a compromise on an issue over which china bargained hard) for monitoring and reporting progress toward national pollution-reduction goals. it has also set a goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050, implying cuts in climate-altering emissions over the next four decades. attention has also been drawn to the fact that rich countries will provide $30 billion of climate aid over the next three years and $100 billion a year from 2020 to developing countries. the us has announced by far the lowest pledge. it will contribute $3.6 billion between 2010 and 2012, while japan will give $11 billion and the european union $10.6 billion. view the page sports

ms dhoni, india's captain, has been banned for two odis because india maintained slow over-rate during the second match against sri lanka in nagpur. the penalty is more severe than the usual monetary fines because india were found to be three overs short, which comes under the "serious over-rate offence" category. the ban is effective immediately, which means dhoni will be unavailable for the games in cuttack and kolkata, returning only for the final odi in delhi. virender sehwag will captain the side in his absence.

save madhupur forests
pursuance of wrong policies by successive governments coupled with corruption at different levels including the forest department contributed to the gradual disappearance of the legendary madhupur jungle in bangladesh. the present size of the forest is almost one sixth of the original jungle; less than 8,000 acres as against 45,000 acres a few decades ago. a large variety of wildlife, including tigers, black bears and pea fowls, has already disappeared from the jungle because of human encroachments. the traditional sal and medicinal plant forest has vanished. thousands of acres of the government protected (!) madhupur national park are now at the mercy of timber thieves who pay forest officials to fell trees. the forest is fading away very fast and what stands there now is a mere shadow of the original.
extra judicial killing
in the last 11 months a total of 141 people were killed by law enforcing agencies in the country. the news was published in your first page on 11 december.
climate change
bangladesh is tapped between the himalayas in the north & the encroaching bay of bengal to the south. bangladesh is most vulnerable to natural disaster due to the frequent extreme climate events & its high population density. in bangladesh, climate change will affect many sectors, including water resources, agriculture & food security, ecosystem & biodiversity. the world conservation union (iucn) bangladesh country representative dr ainun nishat told that a three to four degrees celsius rise in temperature will cut rice production by at least 30 percent. if there is an increase in temperature of 6 celsius the greater flow of water through bangladesh's three great rivers will lead to between 20& 40% more flooding. in my view, the government should take following steps to face the impact of climate change.
clogged drains in banani
i don't know whether my mail will cause any sort of difference or not, but i think i should be writing this. i am a resident of banani living here for the past 10 years. i have always been in love with banani as i feel it is one of the best places to live in the whole of dhaka city. but for the past few years, me including my family members have been facing the problem of new high-rise homes in the area, thus leading to a distressful state of sewerage lines. for the past one year or so, the drain of road # 7, block # f has been clogged up and water has been stagnant. it is very difficult for the people surrounding this area to move. pungent smells are always there.
politicians and bank management
an article on the matter was published in a local daily on 9 december, giving the pragmatic opinions of the hon. finance minister as well as an adviser of the last caretaker government. the opinion expressed by them against introducing politicians in bank management was very appropriate and realistic. they rightly pointed out that with politicians in the bank's board of directors; financial discipline and prudence will be sacrificed for expediency.

was it necessary?
the successful holding of bnp's fifth council after a long gap of 16 years is an indication that the second largest political party of bangladesh has been able to stand straight after its crushing defeat in the last general election. there was some doubt about a trouble free council as the party was almost divided during the rule of the last caretaker government centring the minus two formula and the much talked about call of reforms by the fakhruddin government. but the happy and successful ending of the council will work as a big relief for bnp workers, supporters as well as for overall political climate of the country.
increasing population
as it is the capital of bangladesh, population has been increasing very rapidly in this city and they are polluting its environment. air pollution in dhaka has gone higher than mexico city and traffic jam is crossing the levels of tolerance. between 1980 and 2009, the population of dhaka has swelled from 3 million to more than 10 million. moreover, the urban population has been growing very rapidly since liberation in 1971 and continues to do so at over 3.5 percent annually. the country will have an urban population approaching 50 million by 2015.this rapid growth has been due primarily to migration by the rural poor, particularly to large metropolitan areas. dhaka is now bursting with people of all categories looking for jobs.

launch disasters
on almost every eid horrible launch accidents bring about untold devastation to the people going home to meet their kith and kin. in fact deaths in launch mishaps have been on the rise. to get rid of these accidents strict rules and regulations should be enforced by the government. launches failing to go by the rules and regulations should not be allowed to operate. last, but not the least, passengers should be aware of the dangers and take precautionary steps.

nation lagging behind

our airports
at present our country has three international airports. international airports must be up to the standard of international level, but i am ashamed to say that our airports do not have that standard. the major and the biggest airport is zia international airport and it is in so bad shape that some airlines have warned to stop flights from that airport. our other two airports in chittagong and sylhet are also in poor condition.
