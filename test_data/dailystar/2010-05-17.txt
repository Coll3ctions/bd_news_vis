bcl and govt

article on islam
this is about the write-up published in the daily star (3/3/2010) named "bridging the academic gap" by mr. abdus sattar molla. in his article he gave some misinformation about islam, by which, i think, many can misunderstand islam. he mentioned the arabic word "jihad" as "religious war". actually this meaning, religious war is nowhere found in the holy quran or in the hadiths. jihad means "to strive/to struggle." in another place he said, the holy quran (2:256) speaks about secular mentality which is totally wrong. i request him to study the holy quran once again with understanding. in another place he said "compulsory religious education course should put more emphasis on interpersonal social relations than on religious beliefs and rituals." i want to inform him that in religious beliefs and rituals of islam interpersonal social relations are included. apart from it, he wrote about "hoqqullah and hoqqul i'bad" and gave some explanations. i cordially request him to know the factual explanation of these from an islamic scholar. in the fourth column he wrote, "compulsory religious education up to grade-10 has so far failed to raise the literate citizens' moral standards". if you want to increase moral standards of literate citizens you have to introduce more compulsory religious courses and it should be up to university level.
filling stations
once upon a time the petrol filling stations were maintained well. staff members were given new uniforms at regular intervals. senior company officials used to visit these f/stations at regular intervals. all "service equipments" were inspected/repaired regularly. visit reports are maintained carefully.
for better traffic
for restoring the traffic communication system across the capital city dhaka, the following measures must be undertaken:
an appeal
like a wave of fresh air and renewed hope and after tolerating years of inertia of the executive and the hot air of the legislative, it is the judiciary that has become alive to the problems that confound us all. their lordships in the supreme and high courts have rightly interceded in areas like illegal land grabbing, forest plundering, lake and river bank occupation, rivers and lakes pollution, removal of illegal bill-boards etc, where the rights of the people have been usurped by criminals due to the lax attitude and/or corruption of the relevant authorities.
dirty politics and students
students have got involved in this politics. regrettably, most of the students who are involved in dirty politics have taken arms in their hands. they ruin the academic atmosphere through in-fighting and shedding blood of one another; even they are killing each other by being influenced by godfathers of politics.
mr. jam
the curious diary of mr. jam, as its name implies, curious indeed and astute enough to find the jockey tone from nook and cranny, is certainly a breakthrough in writing articles. his dialogue-based articles and trenchantly witty write-ups enabled him to be one of the top columnists in asia. a satirical tone spiced with an excellent sense of humour and marked moderation is mr. jam's palette which kept him as an entirely distinguished humorist.
maintain silence
it is a matter of great regret that very often a congenial atmosphere in the exam hall is not well maintained. invigilators frequently get engaged in gossiping. this gossip creates a great deal of disturbance for the students. although the centre secretary is the only person supposed to use cell phone, invigilators use that device randomly breaking the complete silence. we the students sitting in the front bench are the worst sufferers in this context. when the cell phone rings our concentration is disturbed. it is high time the authorities found a solution to this problem.
blessings of nature
tree is one of the biggest blessings of nature for mankind. a tiny seed becomes a large tree, gives shed during summer and in winter all of the leaves of the trees fall downward to indirectly supply us further sunlight and the atmosphere becomes warmer.
khaleda's threat
the ds's questions to begum khaleda zia through its editorial of 11 may about reasons behind her threat to bring down the government are known to everyone. it is not the failure or success on the national issues. failure or success does not matter much to her. the prime reason is the court and the present government's continued pursuance of legal process in the cases against her and her two sons.
student politics in disarray
nowadays violence, terrorism, bloodshed, killing and robbery are attributed to the student wings of different political parties. all the campuses of the universities have become a stage of performing the drama of political clashes where the cops, teachers, intellectuals and the common students are the silent spectators. consequently, students, the hope and future of our country, are breaking the backbone of the nation and dumping the ray of hope into dust. so frustrating is it that seizing the hall, torturing the opponents, unscheduled closure of colleges and universities, session jams have struck firm roots in the seats of learning. how can they ignore their golden past?
poor pronunciation
like every other citizen, i regularly watch news in our private bangla channels. it is very embarrassing to hear that still some of the reporters cannot even pronounce some words properly. it's very common to hear some of the reporters saying 'sannel' instead of 'channel'. very embarrassing!!
ship breaking yards
most of the ship breaking yards of our country are located in chittagong, adjacent to the bay of bengal. these ship breaking yards provide us a major percentage of our need of iron. these also give us working opportunities for our unemployed people. in spite of these opportunities, these yards are so much harmful for our environment as well as our eco-system. every year these yards receive many ships for breaking which contains numerous harmful substances including oil, asbestos, toxic colours and various poisonous chemical substances.
reading habit
nowadays, our new generation is getting less interested in reading and they are more inclined, almost addicted, to computer games and tv. though, it is necessary to have a visual version of what we are acquiring from our visible world, reading habit is indispensable for comprehensive learning. reading of various books, newspapers, articles and journals bring us to a new level of sophistication.
“better power supply”
