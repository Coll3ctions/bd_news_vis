delay in repairing aila-affected embankments
the prime minister's displeasure over the delay in the repair of embankments damaged by cyclone aila ten months after the disaster is surely understandable. with all the time that has gone by and with the monsoon season approaching, it is only natural to ask, on the part of the head of government as indeed of any citizen, why a matter that ought to have been handled on a priority basis should have been tackled in such laid-back fashion. the officials entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the repair of the flood protection embankments in the aila-affected regions would have everyone know that the delay was caused by their 'scrupulous' compliance with the provisions of the public procurement regulations (ppr). that logic holds little water, for the reality is that the ppr was relaxed for the very reason of facilitating the rebuilding and repair of the embankments. it is extremely unfortunate that now all sorts of excuses are being put up to explain a failure which can only prolong and worsen the miseries of those affected by the cyclone.

stop wastage of power
of late, people's lives have become miserable due to frequent power outage. this menace is increasing day by day. the authorities seem to have turned a deaf ear to public sufferings. instead of mitigating the sufferings of city dwellers they boastfully announce more power cuts in near future. earlier, power was cut for one hour at a time at a certain place, but now that timing has been extended to two hours at a time-- to the great sufferings of all in this hot humid summer. earlier, the government took a suicidal step to increase power generation by suspending gas supply to the fertilizer factories and diverting the gas to the gas based power-generating plants. for sometime the government adopted the policy of daylight saving. this step did not last long as it brought more sufferings, especially to the tiny tots who were asleep in the transports while going to school one hour earlier in the morning.

rohingya dilemma
in the editorial piece “the rohingya dilemma” published on 28 march, the author recognises that rohingyas are in bangladesh due to “religious and political persecution”, who are “deliberately deprived of their citizenship rights” and who have “escape[d] from forced labour, rape, and religious persecution at the hands of the myanmar military.” and yet it is seen as acceptable to demand their repatriation into such a situation on the basis of a single, local newspaper report that demonstrates nothing more than mishandling of the issue by the bangladeshi embassy in saudi arabia. the allegation that there they are causing a law and order problem remains precisely that: an allegation. the author fails to provide a single source or piece of evidence to back up any claims of illegal activity, although his inventions do at least afford the rohingyas some common sense, for who would ever bother to traffic non-addictive drugs? it is wrong to align the situation of the rohingyas as sympathy cause (that of a bangladeshi or foreigner otherwise). it is a situation that appeals directly to the basic principles of one's humanity. the article you printed demonstrates short-sightedness and introspection that aims through disingenuous claims to demonise and blame others for the challenges that bangladesh is currently facing.
chaotic and confusing
it is very confusing to understand and express the political developments in bangladesh. we know the finance minister loves to talk humourously and forget the gravity of the situation. so far we have heard about 'food famine" now the finance minister is discovering ' biddut durvikkho" and has no clue how to address the issue in a better way. i won't be surprised if one day he puts off his gloves and rest in peace to join the cadre of his immediate predecessors now seen on tv screen.

home minister's job
we regularly listen to the hard voice of the honourable home minister in all media claiming improved and very normal law and order situation in the capital as well as the country. the home minister denies any incident of crossfire and terms the killing of a dhaka university student an isolated incident. but if she has the time to have a look into the news item entitled “criminals grip dhaka” in the daily star of 31st march-2010, then that may help to open her eyes to realize the extent of deterioration of law and order. the news reporter wrote, “from roadside tea-stall owners to members of parliament, successful entrepreneurs, and home and land owners --- none are spared by the killer gangs.”
our teachers
teachers are the torchbearers, mentors and leaders of a nation. frankly & honestly speaking, teachers are not well-treated in our country. the condition of private school, college teachers is really inexpressible. they have no stable remuneration system, although our present govt. ensures a fixed or standard package for the private school and college teachers.
marijuana
according to an american cancer society article, marijuana impairs the immune system. smoking marijuana regularly (a joint a day) can damage the cells in the bronchial passages which protect the body against inhaled microorganisms and decrease the ability of the immune cells in the lungs to fight off fungi, bacteria, and tumour cells. for patients with already weakened immune systems which often proves fatal in aids patients.

"digital bangladesh" by 2021. it is a philosophy for a modern poverty free country with equal opportunity for all. based on this the struggle to free bangladesh from economic and political domination of west pakistan began. here, for 'digital bangladesh," special emphasis is given on applying modern technology based on it sector development and its accessibility to broader population.
