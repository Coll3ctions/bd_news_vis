the inexplicable disappearances
incidents of citizens disappearing mysteriously are beginning to cause legitimate concern in the country. tushar islam titu went missing in july 2008 after he was accosted by four men and bundled into a vehicle. in june this year, dhaka city corporation ward councillor and bnp politician chowdhury alam vanished into thin air after he was kidnapped by some men, quite possibly the same group which had on an earlier occasion tried to abduct him. these two disappearances very justifiably raise the question of who abducted them and where they happen to be at present, assuming of course that they are still alive. our worries take a much more serious dimension, however, through ain-o-salish kendra informing us that as many as 22 individuals have disappeared since january this year. ask has reason to believe, though, that the figure could be much higher. add to the matter of the disappearances the allegations which have lately been levelled at the security agencies, particularly the rapid action battalion. for its part, rab has vehemently denied its complicity or involvement in the disappearances.

complaints must be investigated
we believe, the government and the law enforcing agencies are aware of the various specific complaints, lodged by the individuals or organizations, which were published or reported in the print or electronic media. people have the right to know what action the govt. or the relevant agencies have taken on those particular issues. otherwise, what's the use of publishing the complaints against various irregularities and corruption at different levels? sometimes, specific complaints are published against different persons'/organizations' irregularities and corruption, drawing the kind attention of the head of the government, which should be investigated on priority basis by the law enforcing agencies, and the steps taken by the authorities should be made public.

the great escape
the poorest 10% of the population lack the human and social assets to escape poverty. the drivers of growth have by-passed such groups over an extended period of time and households that remain in poverty today, suffered from poverty 20 years ago. a multitude of multilateral, bilateral, gos and ngos will praise the successes of bangladesh, to reduce income poverty from its zenith of 74% in 1973-74 to less than 40% in 2005. this is, to all intents and purposes, a significant achievement and one which should be lauded. not for the efforts of any one institution, or the placebo of policy prescription by global institutions, but as an evolving understanding on what will lift people from poverty.
