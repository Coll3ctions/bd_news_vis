window dressing in myanmar?
many in bangladesh would be surprised to know that myanmar had an election last november and its first parliament in twenty years was opened last monday in the new capital, naypyidaw.
obama's risky path in egypt
obama administration officials say they are not taking sides between president hosni mubarak, america's key ally in the arab world, and the street protesters who purportedly represent a path to democracy in authoritarian egypt. these officials might even believe what they're saying. but the very assertion of "not taking sides" is itself a tilt away from the all-out support traditionally given by washington to this egyptian strongman in recent decades.
the fear of loss
one of my earliest memories from childhood is of two of us, a classmate and me, walking back from school chattering away happily about this and that. he stops at a roadside paan shop to buy some sweets. we are talking nineteen-to-the-dozen when suddenly a young man at the shop tells us to stop; stop talking in bengali. we did.
sufi of suburbia: struggles of a muslim identity in bangladesh
brac development institute (bdi) at brac university organised a fascinating two-day long conference in december 2010 on "transcending binaries: islam and politics in south asia", bringing in the likes of saba mahmood and tariq ali (via video conference) and a wide range of academics globally. professor syed hashemi, professor firdous azim and samia haq with the support of colleagues and friends, pulled off one of the best gatherings of intellectuals on regional politics, social anthropology and history to engage with each other and the larger audience on the state of secularism in south asia within the global context of post 9/11 world order. along with international presenters and partners, the sessions were packed with government advisers, civil society members, academics and interested individuals.
negotiating two languages and the case for a pragmatic approach to english
talking about the place of english in our education and social life and how it influences the politics of representation would seem like a routine academic exercise, but to do so in the month of february might seem a bit odd and out of place, since we assume that the month is solely dedicated to bangla and a historical re-evaluation of its role in shaping our nationalistic aspirations. the perception though is not incorrect, as february does offer us forums and opportunities to revisit the historic language movement of 1952, and discuss every possible aspect of language issue including the threat that it is facing from the spread of globalisation. it is in this context that a discussion of how we might manage to contain, if not eliminate the threat, and how best we may use the benefits that english has to offer to our advantage may be in order. there is no denying the fact that english is assuming a disproportionate importance in our education, in the media and in our corporate dealings, and threatens to contest bangla in areas, such as social discourse, that were, even 20 years ago, seen to be bangla-only domains. but to manage the threat, one has to have a good understanding of not only the historical, cultural and ideological contexts in which english operates in this country, but also the questions of agency and representation that are strategically linked to its spread. indeed, the cultural luggage that english language brings with it and relocates in the bangladeshi context also needs to be investigated, if we have to be able to devise ways to counter its influence. we have to keep in mind however, that english has become a tool and a technology in this market-driven world, which we can hardly afford to shun, but we cannot allow it to replace bangla in any area of daily engagement. if it is a cultural force, we must accept the benefits it might offer us, but should not allow it to shape our cultural expressions. these are no easy tasks, but should not be postponed any longer.
asterix and the big fight
the deaf mute has no enemies in this city" -- this was the only advice to me, from the director of a dhaka art centre. i had returned to the city after a month break. in the interim, i had been hearing, on email and on blogs, all manner of chatter about a big conflagration between bangladesh and france. over art of all things, about a museum loan.
