prime minister's call to leader of the opposition
prime minister sheikh hasina's call to leader of the opposition khaleda zia makes sense. it was rather surprising for the nation to know from begum zia the other day that the killers of the bdr officers were foreign spies and hired from outside. sheikh hasina has responded by asking begum zia that if she has any evidence to back up her point of view she should provide it to the probe bodies now at work on the bdr tragedy. there can be no denying that the killing of the army officers on february 25 has left the nation traumatised and we will all remain in the dark for as long as we are unable to delve into the roots of the conspiracy behind it. the country now expects begum zia to respond to the prime minister's request and come forward in aiding the process of investigation in any way she can.
water crisis
water supply situation in the metropolis is beginning to look serious with the advent of summer. already we have seen angry demonstrations and blocking of roads by disgruntled residents in mirpur area where water supply has dwindled sharply since february. similar stories concerning shortage of water in other areas are also being reported in the media. with hot summer days ahead, when demand for water will rise further, it is likely that water supply and sewerage authority (wasa) might be in for similar demonstrations if the supply situation is not improved soon enough. although the crisis is seasonal, we seldom plan for it.

world cup favourites australia suffered a miserable start to their 2009 campaign when they were beaten by new zealand in sydney.
momentum with a magical touch
it generally comes with a stroll of a single to a safe area, say long-on or deep fine-leg. by the time sachin tendulkar reaches the non-striker's end, the crowd goes delirious. the helmet comes off, the head tilts up skywards, the back arches a little, the head comes down and looks at the crowd and team-mates in acknowledgment, the fists are pumped, bat in one hand and helmet in the other, and then the head tilts up again. and lo, tendulkar has reached another hundred. his is a smooth, well-oiled, economical, calculated celebration. the same can easily be said of his centuries. not the ones tendulkar the wunderkind used to score, but the ones the master assessor does.

rebuilding bangladesh

february 25 tragedy
the tragedy that struck on feb 25 is quite horrendous.

hundred plus officers and soldiers have been murdered in pilkhana. so many lives have been lost under most tragic circumstances. the conspirators have struck at the very root of national security. the highest level of discipline shown by the armed forces especially the army is praiseworthy. a national disaster has been averted. we salute the army for demonstrating the highest level of discipline. it will remain as an example to our future generation.
party politics and government
i am not a politician and not an expert either on poly-tricks to twist certain things in my favour as many of our politicians do or can do, to their advantage. it will not be out place to quote here the late bhutto of pakistan. to a question by some press people quoted as asking bhutto, "sir, it is said that you tell a bundle of lies, one thing in the morning and the other, just the opposite in the evening, what is your comment?", he was quoted to have replied "i am a politician and that is a great quality of a good politician."
anti-terrorism task force
combating or curbing terrorism is the desire of every peace-loving citizen, no matter where they live. since terrorism has spread everywhere, beyond all borders and boundaries, it is essential that cooperation among countries is strengthened with a view to making the anti-terrorism drives yield some positive results.
noise pollution
it has become extremely difficult to sleep in peace or concentrate on study or other work in and around sector 10 of uttara, dhaka. certain businesses are using loud speakers to advertise their restaurants throughout the day. the noise created by these speakers is resulting in suffering of the people living in this residential area. surely, the elderly and the sick are suffering the most.

decentralising administration
the new, 'popular' elected political government has some urgent and serious homework for the js. discard the “late latif” syndrome.
basic tasks
the 2009 parliament of bangladesh is unique in many ways. among its many uniqueness one that will top the list is its biggest number of fresh and young members. analysts across the board are full of praise and hope for this new phenomenon. while doing so they are too reluctant even to examine the risks that are associated with inexperience. such is the predicament of the so-called "brute" majority. people become hesitant to give free flowing opinions.
no room for hypocrisy
the other day i overheard a story which really upset me. a man was going to get married. all was fine. but after the marriage ceremony was over, the bridegroom found the bride to be squint-eyed. the bridegroom's family had gone to the bride's house twice to see the bride. but they didn't find anything wrong with her then. i couldn't find out actually who cheated whom. marriage is a divine bond between man and woman. but if it starts with such hypocrisy then what will happen in their lives? my honest request to everybody, if you have any disability please inform it to your to-be partner.
retirement age
i would like to draw the government's kind attention to the news report on the above subject published in the 'daily prothom alo' (page no. 24 & 23, dated 25 december '08) and would like to say for your kind consideration that if the proposal for enhancement of retirement age limit as recommended in the secretariat meeting is not acceptable due to any obvious reason, the problem in question can be easily solved by an alternative method without creating any further complications. in this regard, it may be mentioned that in accordance with the prevailing rules, the employees being appointed at the age of 18 are getting a total service period of (57-18)=39 years and the employees being appointed at the age of 30 are getting a total service period of (57-30)=27 years. thus the latecomers in service are being deprived of their required service duration. similarly, those in the freedom fighters' quota being employed in govt. services at the age of 32 are also deprived and they are being compelled to go on retirement before completion of their children's education. so, to remove this disparity including all dissimilarities as stated in the above recommendation, an alternative rule acceptable to all should be introduced by fixing up the total service period on average basis. view the page international
