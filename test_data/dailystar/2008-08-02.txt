saarc and security
that there should be more action than words is a common feeling of the people of the saarc countries, as they continue to face natural as well as man-made catastrophes of severe kinds. after twenty-three years of its existence, it is justifiable for the people to look up to the leaders to implement policies that would remove wide-scale poverty and ensure social, economic and food security of the present generation and that of the future ones. better disaster management by the respective governments in collaboration with member countries is another vital issue for the people of the saarc countries, who often lose lives and property in flash floods, cyclones, landslides and earthquakes.
the furore at ju
the students of jahangirnagar university (ju) must have been moved to a high point of desperation to have fallen back on an action that does not conform to the laid down standards of discipline in an educational institution -- but one must understand their frustration and the reasons for it. they were protesting the university authority's failure to protect them against harassment of the most abominable kind. it pains one to see a premier seat of learning in the country acquire a dubious distinction in terms of sexual harassment.

consolidating democracy in pakistan
for more than sixty years democracy has not always been the assured aspect in a pakistani's life. it has been like a zebra crossing -- now you see it and now you don't. it is also this aspect that continues to interest some of us who have had experience of pakistani governance in the past. we tend to follow any transition or evolution in the pakistani political landscape with care. consequently, the first few months after the recent elections in pakistan, the continuing terrorist acts within that country and the inability of the government to usher in a “new dawn” in pakistani politics have been a source of disappointment.

unclaimed corpse
jamshed choudhury said to his son, "tipu, go at a run to tarafdar and tell him to come over. tell him i sent you, and he is to come immediately." tipu asked, "if he asks me why, what do i tell him?" "tell him your head's cracked, you idiot," jamshed snarled at him. "tell him 'i don't know.'"
as soon as tipu left he called out to jhunu. "are you going to the academy today?" jhunu said, "today we have our examinations." "so what? what will you do by learning how to sing? all that nonsense stops today. i'm not going to stand for it anymore. all of you are getting out of hand any..."

"he's not going."

“one day everything becomes a story”…

it was 2:00 on the afternoon of 21 july when i got a phone call. it was dr. tapan baghchi from ekushey television. he told me that mahmudul haque had died, mentioning that the writer was on my website. later i made a text on the sad demise and began sending it. since the death had occurred around 2.30 in the morning newspapers were unable to cover the news that day. i received calls asking who this mahmudul haque was. while mentioning jibon amar bone was helpful to some, i kept wondering: how could people not know mahmudul haque, somebody who wrote novels such as onur pathshala, nirapod tondra, jibon amar bone, kalo borof, matir jahaj, khelaghar and oshoriri? since his death many of his writer-friends are writing in the nation's dailies about haque's popular presence among them. but was it really so? i do not know and never wanted to know.

maritime boundary dispute and oil and gas exploration in the bay of the bengal
the issue of maritime boundary and deep-sea exploration for oil and gas has added new dimension to our relationship with both of our neighbours. bangladesh, which has hardly any other natural resources besides gas, have no alternative than to maximize the resources of the sea. but in this effort, india and myanmar are laying unjustified claims on our exclusive economic zone (eez) and continental shelf (cs) without having an iota of regard for the spirit and tenets of international law. india and myanmar unilaterally ignored bangladesh's claim of maritime boundary and eez announced in 1974, and we continued to watch this grabbing of sea areas without doing anything mentionable.
rebuild iraq from the ruins
the world at large has just finished presiding over the killing of tens of thousands of innocent human beings in iraq with a mute disdain for its perpetrators. what a shame! one wonders how could we, the members of the so-called civil society, remain at a safe distance when the relics of civilization were being desecrated by the enemies of history. we have heard that when rome was burning, nero was playing his fiddle. the neo-neros of today have been seen on the tv protecting with precision the plunderers of evidences of history. one really shudders at the thought of finding answers to the charges that the progeny would level against us for depriving them of the proof of their 'proud' past. we may therefore have to garnish the leftover garbage to paint a picture that may somehow enable future generations to draw the cue about how their current life and culture came to be.
