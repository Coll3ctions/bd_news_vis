agitating bangladeshi workers in kuwait
bangladeshi workers, about 2,000 in all, have lately been agitating in kuwait over demands for pay and a proper working and living environment. it now appears that the matter has taken a serious turn, with these workers, employed by a kuwaiti firm, taking to the streets and getting into a situation where they have had to be brought under control by kuwaiti police. quite a good number of these workers have already been taken into custody. that is rather unfortunate, for a couple of reasons. the first is that the desperation of these bangladeshis has become serious enough to compel them to agitate in public in foreign land. and the second is that the problem turned so serious as to force kuwaiti police to club them back into order.

august 15, the high court verdict and our darkness . . .
the high court move to strike down the ill-advised decision by the bnp-led alliance government in 2002 to cancel august 15 as national mourning day will cheer all bengalis. and it will because of quite a few reasons. in the first place, it is a step toward reminding the nation as well as the world outside of the collective shame we went through when bangabandhu, along with his family, was murdered in a coup that would leave us deeply scarred as a nation. in the second, it is a clear sign that for all the darkness we have traversed in the years since the assassination, we yet have it in us to reassert the values that have consistently underscored bengali culture and heritage. finally, it is a pointer to the presence even now in this country of elements reluctant to accord the esteem which naturally is bangabandhu's. worse, these elements happen to be the remnants of a class which, for years on end, have thrived in bangladesh through a distortion of established political realities.

trial of war criminals
nowadays the demand for punishing war the criminals of 1971 is a burning issue. it has always been the demand of the people of this country. though 37 years have been passed, these collaborators are yet to be tried. and so these culprits are now showing the courage to kick the freedom fighters! not only that, these war criminals, the old razakars, al badrs and al shams, told journalists a few months ago that there were no war criminals in the country and also called bangladesh's war of independence a mere civil war.
food production
over two days, news about the subject mentioned above (21 & 22 july in the daily star) has created an idea in my mind. let me state my feelings here. our interim government is struggling with the issue heart and soul. but what may happen after election of a new government, i am not sure. our requirement is somehow getting to prevent any crisis.

if you could manage some time from your busy hectic city life to go on a vacation, you should go to the hill tracts of chittagong, where in the serenity of nature you will be able to wipe out all the troubles and tiredness from your agitating mind.
sau's location
this refers to m. zahidul's comments (ds, dt.21 july, 2008) on the above topic opposing the issue of shifting sher-e- bangla agricultural university (sau) to a countryside or to be merged with the bangabandhu agricultural university from this densely located central area of the capital city as proposed by me in an earlier letter to this column. the sau has been emerging as a new agricultural university established during 2001 from a previous agricultural college (institute) under academic management of the bangladesh agricultural university, mymensingh having only a land area of 85 acres which is certainly very inadequate for such an university. having a sprawling campus as noted by prof. zahidul would be a prohibitively expensive proposition and as the university is in its formative stage, it is the appropriate time to consider its shifting to a new agro-ecological zone in a countryside befitting its nature and type of education. alternatively, as i proposed, it could also be merged with bangabandhu agricultural university which has also been on the way to instituting undergraduate faculties (formerly ipsa, started with post graduate studies in agriculture) could be better fitted at this stage of opening to integrate the lone agriculture faculty of sau (it is trying to open new faculties also to justify as its university existence). may i urge, prof. zahidul not to direct any personal question at me like my college or university where i serve, i would agree its merging or dismantling. its not a sort debate of you versus me. my institution is not at all comparable to yours! it was established long before and established in a location that perfectly suits the nature and purpose of education it imparts. what my colleagues/ students think 'if at all' about merger or dismantling of their alma-mater, how can i answer to that, that you asked me? what i feel for the interest of sau, for better agricultural education, and the nation, this should be shifted to a new site.
inclusive education: a micro analysis
education is a multidimensional process by which our mind, soul and latent talent develop through formal, and even informal learning. it is indeed a life-long process. it is mental, psychological, intellectual and social training which provides opportunities to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles to national development and overall progress.
post-partition effect
about one and a half billion people in south asia (former british india subcontinent) are still suffering from the after-effects of partition in 1947. friendly relations amongst the neighbours have disappeared. the kashmir issue between india and pakistan still lingers, and indo-bangladesh relations are not as cordial as expected.
not a good practice
the incident of blockade by university teachers for promotion at shahjalal university of science and technology (sust) has surprised me. such practices are common nowadays by both teachers and students. surprisingly, the authority also calls emergency meeting to justify such activities. we don't expect this type of raw protest from teachers. their activities should be moral and ethical, so that everybody can follow that as examples.
bus fare hike
not taking into consideration the commuters' plight, the govt surrendered to owners' pressure and increased bus fares. many bus owners did not even think of consulting with the government in this regard. bus fare hike has provoked huge altercation between bus staff and commuters. earlier, a passenger was run over due to scuffle over bus fare.
traffic jam
very often there are tumultuous road traffic jams at different places in new and old parts of dhaka --- sadarghat, chawkbazar, nawabpur-english road square, farmgate, gpo, hotel sonargaon-karwanbazar square and so on and so forth. as a result, waste of time and energy and the sufferings of the people know no bounds.
private universities
we have to hear many undesirable comments for being students of private universities. wherever i go and people hear that i am a student of a private university, their attitude changes instantly. they think there is no syllabus in a private university and students got themselves admitted there to pass their time lazily. but the question is why we have to hear such comments? may be we do not have a large campus like the public universities do; we have no playgrounds; we didn't have to face a hard competition that the public varsity students faced to get admitted, but the teachers who are teaching us, needless to say, they all are highly qualified, experienced, competent and sincere. they are trying their best to teach us according to the ugc approved curriculum and syllabus. the ugc as well as the conscious and educated people should come forward to save the image of the private universities.
two sets of voters' list?
i am fully aware that the issue of the voter list is officially considered closed except for some formalities of corrections and new additions. thanks to the election commission for such a successful public relation arrangement in hotel radisson recently commemorating the theoretical success of registering more than 8 crores voters with photo. indeed a commendable work by those who are involved in the process.

i was stunned to learn that a poor farmer died at the emergency unit of dhaka medical college hospital without getting any treatment. the news was published on 10th july. i don't understand what kind of a public hospital is this. they are actually doing nothing but spreading the message that poor people cannot have proper treatment in bangladesh. where would these poor people go if they don't get treatment in these public hospitals? i firmly believe a lot has been written about the irregularities of dmch. now the time has come to change its terrible condition.
our education system
recently the ssc results have been published in the media. it has made a new record in our educational history. this year 52, 500 students got gpa 5. it is a great news for this nation. education is very important to take the country forward. but it is a matter of regret that most of the students give importance to book-based education and they always depend on memorizing. i think students are not solely responsible for this phenomenon. it is the outcome of our educational system. top ranking schools, colleges and universities of our country give importance only on good results during admission. so, with the dream of getting gpa 5 our guardians are sending their sons/daughters to coaching centres and having private tutor at home. most coaching centres provide them with notes, which student memorise without understanding and finally they write it on examination papers. they do good results but cannot go deep into the subject. we see the same situation at university level education. i think all university libraries are full of books, national and international journals, newspapers etc. but students don't prefer library work. they collect notes from the seniors students and memorise the content. as a result, they cannot acquire actual knowledge and accordingly the purpose of education gets lost. so we have to be aware of it. our guardians should also be aware. we should not depend only on private tutors, coaching centres or notes. we should increase our book reading habit. in this way we will acquire actual knowledge.

undoing the wrongdoings
it would possibly take years for any future government with noble intention to undo the wrongdoings committed by the past bnp-jamat government during its tenure from 2001 to 2006. its design was aimed primarily to keep the alliance's firm grip on all organs of the state in order to perpetuate its rule and to shield allied wrong-doers from any potential prosecution and subsequent conviction. two of the casualties of their arrogance of state power were the history of our liberation war, which otherwise could have been the rallying milestone of our nation, and the higher judiciary, the last refuge for citizens to seek justice.
