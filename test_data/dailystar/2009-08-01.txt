wind of change in al leadership is welcome

english barmaids and slaves in calcutta
mani sankar mukherji, popularly known in kolkata as simply 'sankar,' has written many a book, fiction and nonfiction alike, with some bestsellers among them. one of the more popular of bengali novelists, he hit it big from the very start when he started serializing a novel in desh magazine in the 1950s, and has continued to write through the '60s down to the present day. while he has been dismissed by critics as a writer practiced at producing potboilers, that may be a little bit of a facile generalization. sankar is of a generation of bengali writers who began writing at a time when the 19th century european realist novel had a great hold on their imagination, and one can see the marks of that both in the sweep and careful characterization in their works. not for that age the dessicated intellectualism that is our lot today - they liked zola and dickens. a novelist like sankar (which is how the ordinary bengali reader referred to him) took pride in the telling of a tale, following the dictates of plotting, characters and suspense, and in being responsive to readers' demands. perhaps it tells something about his qualities in the above departments that two of his novels, seemabaddha and jana aranya, were turned into movies by no less than satyajit ray, as 'company limited' and 'the middleman' respectively. no doubt it was his sharp observation and intimate knowledge of calcutta life at all levels that drew the legendary film director's attention. it was a knowledge gained first-hand by sankar, who when he first came to calcutta from bongaon village (near the present indo-bangladesh border) before the second world war, worked variously as a street hawker, a typewriter cleaner, a part-time school teacher and a clerk in a jute and gunny broking firm to earn a living - jobs that provided the material for the beginning pages of chowringhee.
