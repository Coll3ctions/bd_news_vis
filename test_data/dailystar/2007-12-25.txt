missing artefacts
there is an element of the bizarre mixed with the ridiculous in the case of the missing artefacts that were bound for france. it cannot but raise our eyebrows to find that objects of great historical value were stolen from what should have been flawless security arrangements and from our very doorstep, and not in any foreign land. given that the government's plan to send these items for display at a paris museum had raised concerns about their safety from a section in the country, more caution should have been taken to say the least, to ensure the protection of these very valuable relics of our history and culture.
merry christmas
a brilliant star in the sky over bethlehem more than two thousand years ago pointed to the birth of jesus christ and hinted at the colossal impact he would have on the fate of mankind. for jesus brought to men and women all across the globe, at a time when imperial rome was in decline, the message that faith in god was all, that morality was the essence of the creed that ultimately mattered. like every other prophet before him, he was ridiculed by men of lesser intelligence and little wisdom. persecuted in all forms and in all manner, jesus christ nevertheless persisted in spreading the message that god loved all his creations, that indeed he, jesus, was the chosen one to disseminate his message to all men and women.

big chiefs
the results of the gujarat elections appear on december 23, and politics resumes in delhi on the 24th. judging by the tension on the faces of politicians, no one really believes either the polls or the exit polls. even the bookies, who were certain the bjp would get a majority, began to cover their bets just before results were due. the miracle of a genuine election is the secrecy of public opinion. a friend who met narendra modi after the last ballot had been cast found him a bit withdrawn, a little less than his ebullient sarcastic self. if modi cannot be sure of what is lying in those electronic machines, you can bet that no one else is certain.
oda decline marks japan's dwindling influence
there was a time not long ago when japanese investors were roving restlessly around the world with pockets-full of money, and many in japan believed that the inflated purse the country was holding would allow them to get hold of everything they desired. while corporate japan was busy buying all it could, ranging from landmark buildings to movie distribution companies, top executives of many japanese companies were pondering upon art and culture with the hope of getting hold of everything they thought rare and valuable. the result was a skyrocketing of price in art auctions being held regularly in major cities around the world. view the page sports

the son of man came to serve, not to be served
christmas, the festival of all christian festivals is back one more time! i, myself, celebrated it as many as 56 times! but how much of the true significance of this special occasion i have internalised and put into practice is perhaps a different question! we celebrate the birth of the messiah with joy and gladness in our hearts. we decorate our houses, our bodies and our church buildings, eat and feast, and exchange traditional greetings and clichés. also, we fulfill our liturgies and try to understand the inner meaning of the christ-event manifested by all those externalities.

mahbub bhai : the gentlest radical
mahbub bhai, the gentlest and most gentlemanly of radicals that many of us ever met has passed on. the photograph of his dead face awakens us to memories of the warmth and love he had for so many. perhaps the last of the aristocrat revolutionaries is no more, leaving behind not so much his literary creations as the entire example of a life that he led with determination, style and flair that few could match. we hope that jowshan apa, his cherished and fellow traveler in life and work, will find the strength to carry on without him.
as time passes
as time passes,
wounds will heal,
memories blur
and kisses seal.
a prayer
a few weeks back when hell was let loose
the ghosts of destruction blew out every fuse
they howled and they scowled the dismal
night through
and battered our dear land black and blue.
