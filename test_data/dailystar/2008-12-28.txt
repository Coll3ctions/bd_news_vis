as the nation prepares for elections . . .
the nation is now poised to exercise its right of franchise. on december 29, more than two years after the last elected government handed over power to a caretaker government, voters will choose for the next five years a new parliament and therefore a new administration that they expect will fulfill their most basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education. in these past couple of months, especially since the lifting of the many curbs on political activities, the parties have come forth with their manifestos outlining the programmes they will undertake and implement if they are elected to power.
first-time and women voters
as the countdown to the parliamentary election gets into the final moments, the cumulative impressions drawn from the contents of party manifestos and electioneering trends make for two conclusions: first, the two major parties have not quite focused on the new voters comprising 32 per cent of the electorate as much as they really should have. secondly, the women voters who constitute slightly more than 50 percent of the electoral roll have not received adequate attention.
right time to vote rightly
counting down, december 29 is just a few hours away. other things remaining the same, the nation will have a newly elected government to run the country for the next five years. no doubt, this is a much-awaited general election for reasons already known. an elected government is not necessarily a democratic government, but election is a sufficient condition for democracy.
a real con called conspiracy theory
if you forgot the source of a quotation in our parents' generation, you could safely attribute it to winston churchill. churchill smoked cuban cigars, drank champagne for breakfast, painted for pleasure, and won wars for a living. he was the authentic hero of the age of imperialism in the english-speaking people. if you cannot recall a source now, the safest thing to do is to attribute it to warren buffett, who eats hamburgers, plays bridge, thinks up witticisms for a hobby, and makes money for a living. he is the authentic hero of the age of capitalism in the dollar-speaking world.
restoring democracy
a sense of trepidation prevails among bangladeshis as the date of election nears. because of the overwhelming desire for a qualitative change from the past, particularly from the misrule of the bnp-jamaat alliance government (2001-2006), in the character and behavioural pattern of the elected representatives, one can only hope that the next elected government will not be corrupt and will be accountable to the people for its actions. view the page sports
murali blasts batsmen
"bangladesh hasn't learnt much in their batting but bowling-wise they have improved a lot". the speaker was none other than champion off-spinner muttiah muralidaran who has every right to say this after the tigers' batting performance on the second day of the first test at the sher-e-bangla national stadium in mirpur yesterday.
motto look forward
muttiah muralidaran doesn't dwell on the past. he takes bagful of wickets, terrorises batsmen, takes the accolades, breaks record after record and moves on and looks forward to the next day.
siddle sizzles
australia were winning the battle of the fast men but it wasn't brett lee who surged the home team back into the series. after dale steyn, the form bowler of 2008, stormed to five wickets in the opening session on the second of the second test at mcg saturday, south africa's top-order was knocked over by peter siddle, a 24-year-old victorian who is growing as a test quick in front of his home crowd.
aus tail wags arthur
wagging tails are a good sign for dog owners but not for bowling sides. there are few things more frustrating for a fielding captain than failing to rattle through the lower-order after the batsmen have been silenced, and it is a trend that has left the south africans annoyed several times this series.
ponting bucks up hayden

those hapless children
it has been observed many times in many ways that every nation, whether it is civilized or not, treats its children as the most precious and gifted wealth bestowed on it, not because of the fact that they cause the population to rise but because the new faces with vitality and integrity will not only lead the nation but also show us the infinite possibility in them.
war criminals and election
there is a proverb that "those who forget history are doomed to repeat it". i was not born when this country achieved its independence. but i could not ignore the history of our liberation war as history never lies. history admits how the brave sons of this soil sacrificed their lives for our independence, how they fought for us, how mothers lost sons, how sisters lost brothers to gave us freedom. history also reveals that a few people, those known as rajakars ( and members of al-badr), were against the independence of bangladesh. these war criminals not only tried to defeat our freedom fighters but also killed so many innocent people. it makes me cry when i read the story of genocide, 1971. now it makes me frustrated when i see that war criminals are competing in our national parliamentary election and some of us are actively working for them.
role of media
we know it's an era of information technology. unquestionably, it is a great thing that in an under-developed country like bangladesh, we are enjoying the free flow of information.
obama and future of us
'change has come to america', were the words of the first ever african-american president-elect of usa, barack obama on the election night after his victory. when obama was elected as president many people around the globe, in asia, africa, europe and latin america, celebrated his victory. the reason-- they were hopeful to see a change in america's policy after an eight year-long rule by the warmonger bush administration. as time for obama to take charge of his office draws nearer, some people have become sceptical about seeing real change and have valid reasons to be so. yet, i will tell more of this later. before that, let us take a look at some words of obama before the election.
fbcci
i think it is high time to evaluate the nation building performance of the fbcci group compared to the daily performance of our rural farmers we watch every day on channel-i "krishi sangbad". the fbbci is misusing its economic power by interfering in the politics openly and sometimes from behind the scene.

for the first-time voters
a documentary film recently produced by jagoree, a non-partisan political youth group, summed up many of the frustrations of today's youth -- many feeling that they are too insignificant a factor for change. in a prothom alo organised discussion with the first-time voters in chittagong, the biggest frustration that came out of the 50 discussants was the fact that they felt that this election presented no substantial difference in the quality of candidates.
manifestos and foreign policy
a study of the election manifestos of the two mainstream parties on foreign policy is not encouraging. foreign policy figures separately in both documents, but not foreign policy issues. al's manifesto says that bangladesh's foreign policy goal is "friendship with all and malice towards none." it also speaks of developing friendly relations with all countries. view the page star city
