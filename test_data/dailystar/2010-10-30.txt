hegemonic brinkmanship and security torn asunder
the whole world is sick with security fever. the etiology of the ailment has multi-faceted strings of comprehension. ever since human beings started their roller-coaster of existence on this planet they have been concerned with it for their proliferation, perpetuation and further extension of lives. at first this war was against the inhospitable nature, when this was tamed a bit and rudimentary specialization emerged and competition for the available resources intensified along with the accompanying increase in population, the question of security was redirected against human beings. mutual collaboration of homo sapiens got circumscribed within a narrower field of amiability. in course of time one human group was subjected to abject condition by another i.e. the blacks by the whites usurping their rights of humane existence. the system of literal slavery gave aristotle, plato and other philosophers the security and comfort of leading a rarefied life and pontificating on anything including the slaves on whose blood they were celebrating their knowledge and argumentation. the security of the privileged class was guaranteed snatching the rights of the people who were treated as mere chattels. the feudal system of attached slavery of the peasants to land was deposed through the inauguration of reign of terror during french revolution. guillotine worked as the judge of restoring security for the exploited millions. dickens' 'a tale of two cities' recounts the mass-frenzy partially with powerful imagery of description and profound analysis of plot. it is always the so-called powerful interest-groups who exploit the teeming millions and devise and design the security system to safeguard their accumulated wealth through policing mechanism.

plunging into melody's waves
namita devidayal addressed her gentle, nurturing brahmin music teacher dhondutai as 'baiji,' whose whisper sounded like, 'you will be my little goddess… my bhairavi,' an early morning raga, the wife of cosmic dance destroyer shiva. she is like the moody mythical goddess, sometimes a pining lover, and a seductress---always the mysterious female force which overpowers evil. this work, devidayal's first, is dedicated to dhondutai kulkarni, whose ancestors were from kolhapur. the music teacher moved to bombay in 1978-79, lived in a small apartment with ayi, her mother, in the neighborhood of kennedy bridge which was only ten minutes away from namita's home in cumballa hills. reading this autobiographical reportage, that it 'was a lifetime of learning---and not just of music,' tracing the legacy of the jaipur gharana, an intellectual school, and one of the pillars of indian classical music, is sheer delight. the cover design by rachana, photo by ishika represents dhondutai 50, five feet tall, 'remarkably youthful… attributed to never having married' protégé of the jaipur gharana, at a concert. kesarbai recalls, '… you were in a white silk nine yard sari with a gold border, and wore your hair in a long plait… walked onto the stage with great confidence… started with a perfect sa… you sang raga bhoop…'
