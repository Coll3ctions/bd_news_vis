pakistan's presidency
hopes for a strengthening of democracy in pakistan have not exactly taken a quantum leap through the adoption of the 18th amendment to the country's constitution. but they are to be regarded as a significant step considering the political legacy pakistanis have, to their great discomfiture, regularly been heir to. with as many as four military rulers upsetting the chances for democracy since its creation in 1947, pakistan has been caught in a vicious cycle of political despair brought on by the depredations of its non-elected leaders. now that president asif ali zardari has signed away his vast powers, powers he has had no hand in the making of, and has thus reassured pakistanis that parliamentary democracy may be finally back on track, there is reason to feel somewhat confident about pakistan's future. view the page sports

jhum and environment
jhum farming is generally called slash and burn agricultural practice. it is an old and special cultivation system practiced by the indigenous people of chittagang hill tracts. it is the primary source of food, shelter and clothing of local people. in this practice, mixed seeds of cotton, chilli, cowpea, cucumber, gourd, rice, melon, pumpkin, maize, yams, sweet potatoes are sown in each pocket in the hilly areas. in three hill districts of chittagong the indigenous people traditionally grow cotton following this indigenous technology. in jhum cultivation cotton seeds are sown along with other crop seeds like- rice, chilli, maize, peanuts in the same pit/hill horizontally on the hill slope. the hill people harvest different crops in different times sequentially. but the practice of jhum firming is not environment friendly. it is harmful for the biodiversity of the hilly areas of cht.
water logging
water logging has emerged as the major environmental problem in the metropolitan cities of dhaka and chittagong due to unplanned urbanization and filling up of low lying land, lakes, river banks. closure of dholai khal, begun bari khal in dhaka and chaktai khal in chittagong which used to serve as major outlets for rainwater and drainage system have created major logging problems in these cities. it is a basic tenet of city planning to preserve open spaces, and protect lakes, wetland areas and canal encroachment in order to maintain natural and environmental characteristics of the city. but the powerful land grabbers and real estate developers taking advantage of the housing boom illegally filled up natural wetland, retention ponds, lakes and main canals for construction of buildings and housing estates. rajuk or cda or department of environment have failed to preserve the topographical features and protect the cities from the uncontrolled rainwater flooding. rain is inevitable in monsoon- fed bangladesh but now an hour of heavy rain creates temporary flooding and long periods of water logging in the low lying suburban areas. expansion of metropolitan cities are a part of inevitable process of economic growth but urban expansion is occurring without any control, supervision or future plan due to the incompetence, corruption and indifference of the city development authorities and the city corporation. the government must take up a comprehensive plan to improve the drainage system, reclaim and recover the flow of blocked and close major 'khals' and protect the wetlands and retention ponds to save our citizens from water logging.

child abuse
the recent newspaper report that a two year old girl was raped shows how vulnerable our children are. almost all the children are abused this way or that way. in most cases children are sexually fondled and in extreme cases the fondling crosses the limit and cause a permanent mental and physical damage to the child. the sexually abused children carry with them the hang-ups of the bitter experience which sometimes mentally retard them. and as the abusers are usually the near relatives, it causes a debilitating damage to the normal relationship. the abuser and the abused can never behave normally throughout life.

taxpayers' money
i am shocked and dismayed to hear people calling it the government's money. are people living in a fool's paradise? or are they ignorant? it is not government's money, it is taxpayers' money. what is government? it is a body of elected representatives of the people. like any other person the elected representatives who constitute the government also require to fulfil their needs. for fulfilling their requirements they cash on the taxpayers' money, which is wrongly termed as government money since colonial times. this has to change in order to make the government accountable for their deeds to the people.
