nazmul huda's expulsion
nazmul huda, an eminent lawyer and a long time bnp leader and two-time cabinet minister, has been expelled from his party for “breaking organisational discipline” and doing things “against the interest of the party”. in our view the expulsion speaks far more of the bnp as a party and its constitution than it does about nazmul huda who, either as a politician or as an individual, is not the focus of our comment. what interests us is the core question whether or not there is any place for dissenting views within the bnp, or for that matter any of our political parties.

his voice's master
thought for the week: if accent-fraud were a criminal offence, how many serving members of the ruling establishment would be guilty? to speak english well in a country which has inherited it as a service-language is commendable. to speak it badly is perfectly understandable, since it is a foreign tongue. but to speak it in a pseudo-imitation of a style that even an abashed bbc has quietly abandoned is unforgiveable. you could not have got solicitor-general gopal subramaniam's haw-haw syllables from central casting, but that may be only a minor sin in his latest curriculum vitae.

the space-time cloak
recently, physicists from the imperial college london (icl) conducted a study on manipulating the nature of space and time and concluded that it was possible to hide actual events from the plain sight of the viewer. in other words, an event could take place; say a journey from one location to the other, however, the “journey” in-between, from the point of start to the destined location would remain entirely invisible to the naked eye. scientists believe this wondrous scientific scheme, which is being referred to as “space-time cloak” can be the ultimate hiding place, like a hole carved right out of space and time. and the very nature of physics, in this particular case, would manipulate light to such an extent that the actual events in real life would be “cut off”, just as an editor cuts off scenes from the reel of film that s/he does not want public to watch. this means that this space-time cloak theory is actually based on censoring the flow of events that we generally perceive as a stream of light particles, which are also known as photons that strike the retina of ours and allows us to see the events as they take place.

florida in new light

why does a bull react violently to the colour red?
it is the movement of the cloth that makes the bull react violently as like most mammals, the bull too is colour blind and cannot be affected by the colour of the cloth. when a matador moves a cloth (irrespective of the colour) in front of the bull, it perceives the movement as a threat and is angered, and as a result, reacts violently.
