weekly currency roundup
may 29 -june 2, 2011
international markets:
the euro rose to a one-month high against the weak dollar, boosted by expectations of a quick-fix solution to the green debt crisis, although gains could be checked by investors selling into the bounce. the euro clawed back ground even after moody's cut its credit rating for greece deep into junk territory. traders said a major asian sovereign account was a seller around the highs with further stops highlighted on a break of $1.4500, while option barriers rolling off this month are layered up to $1.4700. the us dollar was under pressure against the safe-haven swiss franc hitting record low of 0.8383 on wednesday. the dollar fell after data on wednesday showed us companies hired far fewer workers than expected in may and that output in the manufacturing sector slowed to its lowest since 2009. analysts said a poor us non-farm payrolls number on friday could trigger more dollar losses and fuel speculation about the need for more monetary stimulus measures after a second round of quantitative easing by the federal reserve ends this month. view the page metropolitan

shrimp farming and salinity
hossain's important front page report published in your daily on may 26th is a subject, which i believe a very few know about; more so the ignorant farmers, who made their farmland into saline ponds for shrimp breeding and farming. the recent storm and heavy waves destroyed the fish farms, and all the shrimps were lost to the tidal wave. as an option, the farmers went back to growing paddy and other food crops; little knowing that their soil is now saturated in saline, and no green crops can be grown! in this case not only have they lost the shrimps; which were financially rewarding; but now no cash crops can be grown, which before farming of shrimps in saline water, used to provide cash crop! not only they, but possibly the agricultural officials were unaware of this. otherwise they would have stopped the farmers in wasting money, scarce resources and their labor in trying to plant farm food crops in the saline contaminated soil! agriculture department should now take necessary steps, so that all farmers become aware of this problem of soil salinity; so that the farmers know the pros and cons; before opting for fish farming in their farmland.

water salinity and maternal health
bangladesh stands at the forefront of climate change, with its coastal region witnessing dramatic sea-level rise over the last three decades. the resultant sea-water intrusion is increasing salinity in coastal drinking water with severe health consequences to surrounding populations. our research team at imperial college london and bangladesh center for advanced studies (bcas) has found expecting mothers in particular, becoming acutely susceptible to the diseases of hypertension and (pre)eclampsia from this salinity exposure. this suggests that climate change is not only breaching our coasts, but is approaching the very shores of motherhood in the womb.
refresh our air
today, june 5, is "world environment day." this day is very important for us to express our anxiety about the environment due to climate change. our air, water, earth -- everything is polluted, and we are increasing the pollution everyday in new ways.
let's not 'sweat the small stuff'
it was one of those days when problems cascade and nothing seems to go right. i was jolted out of my sleep at 6:30 in the morning by the shrill ring of the phone. living far away from family and friends, i am perpetually terrified that a call at any unearthly hour might herald bad news. thankfully, in this case it was our neighbour joan calling to alert me that our car's parking lights had been left on all night.

greening bangladesh
this year's world environment day titled "forests: nature at your service" is not just a call for one day of awareness, but can usher the beginning of an determined move towards the conservation of bangladesh's remaining forest cover. it underscores the intrinsic link between quality of life and the health of forests and forest ecosystems, and supports this year's un international year of forests. this is therefore a call to strengthen our resolve towards afforestation and other necessary measures for a truly “green” bangladesh.
