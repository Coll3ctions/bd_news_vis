adp implementation at snail's pace
in truth, those who are aware, as most people are, of the sluggish historical trend of adp implementation in the first quarter of a financial year would hardly be surprised by the news. that only ten percent of the adp got implemented between july and september, 2009 does, however, make us sit up and take note. if only because of (a) the fanfare and aplomb with which the al government had announced an all-time ambitious adp for fiscal 2009-10 amounting to tk 30,000 crore; and (b) the news of under-performance coming from those who are perceived to have had a role in implementing the adp such as the finance ministry and the nbr.
prime minister's visit to bhutan
in a world confronted with newer crises nearly every day, the importance of regional cooperation, be it at bilateral or multilateral level, cannot be denied. which brings us to the role saarc has been playing in south asia since the mid-1980s. perhaps the potential that was once noted about the organization has not quite been realised to the extent one would have expected, but the fact remains that the body has brought the countries of this region together in remarkable ways. the recent visit of prime minister sheikh hasina to bhutan underscores this reality. the three-day trip has now thrown up certain new opportunities for dhaka and thimphu to explore.
overseas trips, towels and tables
prime minister sheikh hasina is, like many of us, worried about the frequent trips civil servants periodically make abroad. on the face of it, we should not be overly worried about these trips. for if civil servants, or people in other areas of life for that matter, are invited to seminars and conferences abroad, who are we to grumble? obviously, there must be some very real, some very good reasons why all these men at the centre of administrative authority are provided with the opportunity of going abroad to speak for the country.
prime minister's visit to bhutan
bhutan (druk yul -- the land of the thunder dragon) is a land-locked country located between india and china. it shares 470 km border with china and 605 km with india, out of its total border of 1,075 km. since the mountains are very high on the north, its connectivity on land with the external world lies in the south through india.
tackling labour unrest in rmg sector
the rmg sector is our second largest foreign exchange earner. virtually with no past experience our private sector has been able to prove its dynamism by becoming the fourth largest supplier of readymade garments in the world, even though bangladesh is heavily dependent on imported fabrics and yarn from other countries. the success it has gained is mainly due to its competitive price, which is due to low wages of garment workers. view the page sports
sacking was inevitable
the bangladesh football federation (bff) yesterday announced a fresh list of 31 players for the saff championship camp keeping sacked brazilian coach edson silva dido's choice of 23.
where did dido go wrong?
it is the metaphorical equivalent of being ejected from the casino even before the roulette wheel has stopped turning. you never even had the chance to find out whether you betting the house on 13 had paid off. in football terms it would equate to giving fabio capello the boot for having the gall to not pick steven gerrard and frank lampard in the same team. in slightly more specific terms, it would be similar to showing bff (bangladesh football federation) president kazi salahuddin the door because of his non-linear approach towards football development. no youth structure but already talking professional league? out you go.

development

two beautiful spots
last week i visited cox's bazar and saint martin's. as we are busy with our city life, after making some effort we got the chance to visit the longest beach of the world. we planned to go there to have some refreshing experience but after reaching the place i was really disappointed. the beach was full of hawkers.
smoking banned in open space?
i would like to draw the attention of the ministry concerned or any person who has read the anti-smoking law. i have read in the newspaper and personally seen that people are being fined or harassed for smoking in the street or open space. is this the correct interpretation of the law?
some observations
during the last couple of weeks a few incidents have drawn my attention which might have political ramifications in my judgment. these are:
a resolute man
if anybody with common sense listens to the suggestions of the former chairman of regulatory reforms commission dr. akbar ali khan, he will surely agree with me that he is not only a great patriot but also a very efficient government servant with a strong commitment to the nation.
defying logic
daylight saving time in the western hemisphere countries has a definite purpose and period which extends from april till end of october. setting the clock right in tune with sunrise and sunset in winter time is the most logical thing to do. if this is not done, we will be wasting power in lighting up our houses in the morning. moreover, as the days get shorter, it will become even more difficult to get up when it is will remain pitch dark even at 6.30 am, since our biological clocks are naturally tuned to sunlight.
power vehicles
motor vehicles are wasteful in terms of energy and fuel used to transport only two or three persons at most! every time the car engine runs, four fifths of the energy supplied goes to overcome the frictional resistance of the car engine, transmission and the bodyworks and their weights which accounts for the high fuel consumption! the electric car however goes a long way toward reducing wasted energy by replacing the internal-combustion engine with batteries. even so, electric cars lose about 60 percent of the energy because heavy mechanical parts are still used to deliver energy from the batteries to the car wheels through air box and mechanical transmission system. lately, though, engineers have come up with a far more efficient way to accomplish the same task: by using magnets in the wheels; in place of traction motor and mechanical power transmission gears.
new office timing
i am working in an ngo. showing respect to the government's new timing for office, our new office time is now 10:00 am 6:00pm. the government decided the timing of private offices, as if there are no women working in private offices, they don't have children!
plane crash
i was shocked to see the news item that a baf training plane crashed in bogra, while on a training flight. the type and condition of the plane does not seem to suit training for the two trainees of the rank of squadron leader! the enquiry must show whether it was training and who among the two was the trainee.
why dst?
the words of energy adviser dr. tawfiq e elahi chowdhury on not reverting back to the old timing in an interview with bbc bangla service on october 25, 2009, have baffled us, because the adviser himself admitted that the length of day and night are quite different in countries where dst is being used for a long time but in tropical countries like bangladesh the difference is not much.
technical education
bangladesh has been expanding its industrial base in the last two decades. mentionable development has been achieved in industries like garment, cement, textile, steel, sugar, paper, pharmaceutical, shipbreaking, shrimp culture etc. manpower export has already been proved a significant financial positive factor for bangladesh economy. in addition to the garments industry, information technology and shipbuilding have tremendous potential. to operate the existing industrial ventures, to expand the industrial sector and to export technical manpower abroad, bangladesh needs a huge technically educated manpower. without proper manpower, no industry can be developed. but if we evaluate the scenario of bangladesh for expanding and for modernizing technical education a poor picture is observed.
funding political parties
a difficult question of funding political parties from the state coffer has been launched by tib, backed by its research, and perhaps seconded by our election commission, for discussion. actually, it's a dilemma that goes beyond bangladesh. in the absence of mass membership contribution, many political parties, or politicians, rely on private donations to support their activities. but private donations, mostly corporate, are often determined by influence-peddling. so, making a case for public funding of political parties to keep them honest is an option, but isn't easy. it could be a doubled-edged sword, while public money goes to the parties, they can't be made accountable.
role of rab
the continuing saga of extra judicial killing and torture by law enforcing agencies such as rab is extremely disturbing, to say the least. the recent killing of an actor and torture of a new age journalist by rab prompted the constitution of departmental enquiries, the outcome of which is anybody's guess. while condemning such illegal acts committed by the very organ of the government which is supposed to protect the innocent and punish the culprit within legal boundaries, i think everyone also needs to ponder who is the beneficiary of such extra judicial killings and why this saga is going on unabated for such a long time. the summary disposal of alleged criminals before giving them an opportunity to speak out and expose the masterminds and godfathers is advantageous to those very people who create and nurture top criminals. view the page international
