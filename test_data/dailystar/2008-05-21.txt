satkhira incident
the manner in which a group of bangladesh rifles (bdr) personnel assaulted and injured a municipal commissioner, some 50 common people and members of the press in satkhira on sunday evokes condemnation. they allegedly went out in a body with the mood for vendetta when the local commissioner handed over a bdr man to the police for his questionable behaviour. instead of allowing law to take its own course, the bdr men purportedly picked up the commissioner and beat him up for his initiative. it is further deplorable that they did not even spare women inside shops or households while venting out their rage. and the assault on the members of the press was reprehensible as they were only performing their duty. it was a gross violation of professional norms as we understand and therefore the persons responsible should be held accountable after thorough investigation as per law.

chuadanga jail incident
i really don't know what to say about the chuadanga jail incident. i think lack of sense of responsibility is killing our nation completely in every sector. four top outlaws were kept in a cell which was not at all fortified. how silly! i have read that the quality of the substances (like cement, sands etc) with which the cell was built was very low. what's wrong with our engineers and contractors? they are constructing prisoner cells and making money here too! they should realise that they are not only putting our lives in danger but also inviting trouble for themselves. the prison guards are certainly responsible for this incident.
myanmar rulers
one fails to understand the illogical and irrational behaviour of mynamar's military junta. in this hour of grave humanitarian crisis, they should have allowed unfettered inflow of foreign aid as the un estimates that “rudimentary” aid so far has only managed to reach just 270,000 people. with the death toll, according to un assistant secretary general catherine bragg, at 100,000 and with 2 million cyclone victims suffering from lack of access to food, shelter, clean drinking water, diseases (such as cholera, fever and other illnesses), the military regime must act in a much more responsive manner. they cannot afford to reject visas to disaster management experts and aid agency officials; they cannot rely on inefficient local aid distribution of their military workers and they cannot afford to store the aid in their airports for days and not distribute it.
our football
our national football coach's detailed clinical analysis was published in a local english daily (may 13). his description of our team's deplorable performance in kyrgyz stan was masterful! if our team could have played even at a quarter of the quality level of the coach's in-depth analysis, we would have cut a better figure in the tournament.
greenhouse effect
greenhouse gases are the components of the atmosphere that contribute to the greenhouse effect. the major greenhouse gases are the- carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons etc. generally, the earth is heated by the sunlight and some of the heat that is absorbed by the earth is radiated back into the space. the important feature of greenhouse gases is that they absorb certain infrared wavelengths. thus, they trap heat in the troposphere and stop it from escaping to the space. the net result of the heating of the earth's surface by this type of phenomenon is the greenhouse effect.
ashraful's leadership
i would like to ask mohammad ashraful why he is hanging on to the captaincy, even after performing so poorly in recent times. i know he might point his finger towards his lone century that he could manage to get out of 115+ odis. even after maintaining an average of 20 odd runs per match, he might claim to be the best player of the country. but sound reasoning is missing in our assessment of not only the players, but also our performance in the international arena.
doctors indeed
i was praying for lakshmi as she was undergoing operation in a bangalore hospital. this beautiful girl was born with four hands and four legs. she was regarded as goddess in bihar. but her poor father had no intention to use her as a source of money-making. he decided to give her a chance to live a normal life by undergoing an operation. i appreciate and thank very much all those doctors in sparsh hospital in bangalore for their patience, sincerity and humanity that they showed during the 17-hour operation.
call centre business
nowadays we are talking about the call centre business prospects, but are we really ready to welcome and develop this business? in the past, we missed many good opportunities in this sector due to lack of government patronisation.
chief adviser's address
my expectation has come true. there is nothing new except the possible time of election in december 2008, and he bailed out the confined "ghoroa rajniti" to local level with nine undemocratic restrictions. there is no political statesmanship in the address. nothing was said about the present economic hardship of the people. freedom of expression, press freedom and free information flow are still restricted. the survival of democracy is put to more tests as the government is keeping the trump card in hand. the big political parties have been discouraged to join the dialogue with the government through imposition of well-articulated conditions in disguise. the political parties, except a few minor ones, are not satisfied.
political dialogue
dialogue is the most popular buzzword of dhaka today.
elimination of rickshaws
only in bangladesh perhaps does one come across such blatant disregard for one's fellow citizens. i don't believe that any child or its parents wake up one fine day and declare that his future lies in rickshaw-pulling. it appears that ever since the british colonial rulers imported this mode of transport from china, unskilled men and boys from poor families have had to drift to this awful and demeaning occupation.
politicians' job
the ca in his address to the nation declared a tentative national election time frame. and to pave the roadmap, among others, he has declared his government's withdrawal of restrictions on indoor politics nationwide, unconditional dialogue with all political parties to frame a national charter to hold a free, fair and credible election. the address has cleared the clouds of doubts among the public about the present government's intentions. we profusely thank him. we are also happy to note that unlike other times, all the politicians have expressed cautious but positive reaction to his speech.
donors' view
the media carried a news item that the donors are satisfied with the address of the ca. they also expressed their full confidence that the election preparations were progressing well and the voter list would be ready in time for the election. our respected guests from abroad are well informed about our ground realities. they are financing the voter list preparations. there is every reason to defend their funding which has accountability. but they have never explained to us what makes them so sure about all those episodes when bangladeshis themselves are not yet sure, despite a timeline for general election being declared by the ca.
ds online version
i am an expatriate who reads your newspaper everyday to keep up with what is happening there on a day to day basis. i have been away from dhaka for over 25 years and living mostly in the us since i left bangladesh.
varied experience
i travelled from north america to the middle east to south asia. i went from very cold zones to very hot ones and finally to bangladesh where the winter is very mild. i was surprised that in malaysia, singapore and thailand there is no winter. to me winter is a natural terrorist in northern countries like canada or in north europe. but for people of these countries this is normal. the cost of living is higher due to higher heating costs, but there are more financial opportunities to help deal with this particular problem. view the page international
