it appears that russia is determined to demonstrate its power to the west. during the regime of boris yeltsin, russia was taken for a ride by the west, especially by the us. while russia was reducing its arsenal of arms, the us was making new lethal weapons.
bullets vs. ballots: foreign policy decision-making in china and india
the recent statement by a prominent politician, that prime minister manmohan singh would have been shot with a single bullet for "bluffing" the nation over the indo-us nuclear deal had he been the premier of china, has added a new dimension to the hotly-debated nuclear deal. keeping aside the appropriateness of such a statement coming from a seasoned politician, it draws attention to the arbitrariness and the absence of accountability in the chinese foreign policy decision-making.

history, from one who helped shape it
the war that was fought for bangladesh on the diplomatic front was as intense as that on the fields of battle. while at home and in the refugee camps it was political mobilisation of a people toward the establishment of a free state that took centre stage, in the hamlets and villages it was a focused armed resistance to pakistan that underpinned the goal. but all of that happened, in the true sense, after the emergence of the provisional bangladesh government with tajuddin ahmed as prime minister. what has not been much remarked upon, in all this celebration of the contributions of individuals and groups to the rise of bangladesh is the concerted movement on the part of bengali diplomats, wherever they happened to be in 1971, in favour of the national struggle. k.m. shehabuddin carries out a necessary responsibility in recording the story of the uphill struggle he and his colleagues, then in the pakistan foreign service and yet mortified by what the state of pakistan was doing to their fellow bengalis, shaped and carried to a successful culmination.
just a bit of language
a book on linguistics -- the scientific study of language, as it is commonly defined -- should not put you off. it may be intriguing and claim your attention in its own right. it can make you aware of your own existence. after sometime, you feel you are a human being because you can speak. that is, in your most prominent identity you are 'homo loquens' -- speaking man, not simply 'homo sapiens' -- wise man. many other animals have intelligence, albeit to a lesser degree, but it is only humans that have language to its fullest potential. humans are uniquely distinguished from other animals with the language they use. stripped of your language, you are nothing but an animal, mere flesh without thought and meaning. you talk in words, think in words and even dream in words. human life is composed of words. human history is accumulated in words. human civilisation has been built upon language, the symbols we meet in books and tongues.
a rich diversity of development perspectives
although there has been a burgeoning of literature on the bangladesh environment in recent times, a comprehensive treatment covering the complex nexus of environment, poverty and development has been strikingly rare. the principal worth of the publication under review lies in the fact that it attempts to fill in the above caveat in the contemporary literature, and moves beyond a mere techno-centric explanation of environmental problems in favour of a more humanistic and down-to-earth 'people's account'. the report makes the case in the following manner:
of private passions
a triumphant novel of love and devotion, passion and fulfillment, irving stone's adversary in the house captures the reader's imagination with the opening of the first page. it is about eugene v. debs, the pioneer labour leader whose life is a tug of war between his dedication to helping his fellow men and his love for two women. his private life is as violent and impassioned as the dedication that raises him to the heights of greatness and drives him to the depths of public scorn. growing up in chicago, eugene learns about the inter-dependence of men on one another from his own family. his parents have shown him how compassion and kindness can open the way to a greater world. they are a happy family, loving each other and living in perfect harmony.
