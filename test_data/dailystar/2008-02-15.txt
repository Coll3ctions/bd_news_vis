indigenous peoples need dignity and space
cultural diversity is one of the major ideas that underpin societies in our times. there is a growing acknowledgement worldwide of the traditional rights of indigenous communities, a point that has engaged the attention of such global bodies as the united nations. the latest instance of how ethnic diversity constitutes a crucial component of national culture as well as global realities comes through the formal apology offered by the new australian government of prime minister kevin rudd to australia's ethnic minority. without question, the step takes australia to a new path in politics because it formally endorses the idea of an inclusive society that will be the priority from here on.

how can one govern bangladesh?
how can one govern bangladesh when we find:
sound pollution at ditf
a few days ago i visited ditf with my mother. the fair covers a big area. moving from stall to stall is actually difficult for the aged. young people also get tired if they want to visit every stall of the fair. the overall arrangement for the fair was satisfactory but the objectionable and disturbing thing was the sound pollution created through the mikes and big speakers for advertisement of commodities inside the fair. even i was facing difficulty to talk to the sellers as i had to shout to bargain with them.
police reform
police reform is indeed a very good idea of the present caretaker government. police have lost their image. the police law was enacted during the british period in 1861. it is not befitting for the present time. so, the police law must be modernised for developing a fully-fledged service oriented institution.
obama's background
what prompted me to write this letter is the report i found in internet about the muslim background of obama, the democratic presidential candidate.
rodent attack in cht
the chittagong hill tracts (cht) is the home to many ethnic communities having rich cultural heritage. sadly, people of the cht have never been given due opportunities to develop and have consistently been victims of discrimination in many sectors. to make their lives even worse this year, rodent attack has deprived them of the expected harvest.
age limit of 28th bcs
i was very happy to see the 28th bcs circular but when i saw the age limit i was shocked. this circular has been declared after two and a half years. the circular of 27th bcs was published in 2005.owing to reforms in the psc and the exam procedure, the circular has come late. and for this reason, almost 50 thousand candidates won't be able to appear in this exam this year.
we salute the teachers!
whatever i may have achieved as a physician in terms of education, finances, service to humanity, i have always felt that, sum total of all that is credited in my account, will never be equivalent to that of a university teacher. i have pursued studies to earn degrees, i have been reading occasionally to overcome certain professional problems, i have been attending (at times speaking in),seminars, workshops and conferences, to meet requirements for continued professional registration, but, a university teacher produces people like me, earning and disbursing knowledge is their day to day work, so are the seminars and conferences. i have seen wherever i have gone and worked, the middle east, africa, europe and north america they, the university teachers, are at the top most strata of admiration.
dhaka metro
i look forward to the days when metro train will be running in dhaka city and we will be freed, even if partially, from the agonising and punishing traffic jam.
graffiti and posters
this is in reference to a news item appearing in your daily recently regarding the proposed ban on graffiti and posters. i would like to extend my heartiest congrats to the caretaker govt. for the bold decision. i had been very vocal on this issue and feel elated that my concerns received due attention. the lgrd has drafted an ordinance proposing a ban on graffiti and pasting of posters on the walls of houses and establishments across the country. in order to keep the cities and roads clean and beautiful, the decision is very timely and has no alternatives. it would be appreciated if the proposed ordinance is extended to cover all the banners, arches and billboards. it would be interesting to observe the implementation of the law through stringent punishment to the violators.
ekushey padak
it is good that every year some people get ekushey padak for their outstanding achievements and service to the country or humanity, but it pains me when i see that some padaks are awarded posthumously. why the govt waits for their death, or is it given as a solace to the bereaved family? why the award was not given during their lifetime is still a puzzle to me.
smoking and heart disease
nowadays there are many health related programmes on satellite television channels, which are very encouraging. many physicians come on tv and answers questions of the viewers. however, it is sad to get the wrong information from them. i was watching one such programme and one of the doctors was saying that there was no relationship between heart attack and smoking. this is not true.
bcs recruitment
people are posted in government service through bcs (bangladesh civil service) exams. it is an old recruiting system of this subcontinent.
aamir khan's masterpiece
aamir khan is the most talented and respected actor of his generation. may be his popularity is less than other two khans, shahrukh khan and salman khan but aamir khan is a superstar in his own right. and he has proved it yet again. his directorial debut “taare zameen par” was the only movie last year, which brought tears in my eyes. audience became a part of the film while watching it. many of them felt, it was their story or the story of their children. it educated us. after watching the movie, we do feel there needs to be a change in the education system of our country as well.
torture in custody
an editorial on the subject (jan:26) in a local english daily was very timely, pertinent and necessary. while one appreciates the ctg's actions against corruption, under the same criteria action against alleged torture of victims on detention and remand also needs to be speedily taken. this is a far worse crime than any form of corruption, be it for monitory gain, influence peddling or misuse of power and authority for personal gain; none of which physically harms anyone!
a tribute to justice sobhan
i had the privilege of being introduced with justice sobhan. the last time i came in contact with him was in the human rights summer school organised by elcop on 10 december 2007 in proshika centre, manikgonj. justice sobhan went there to preside over the moot court session. when i met him he inquired of my well being addressing me by name. i was astounded a little bit. because i thought that he might have identified my face but recalling the name would be a remote possibility. i informed him that i was thinking to opt for judicial service. he discouraged me and said, “you are quite perfect for an academic discipline.” i told, “you are always campaigning for improving the judicial system, then do you not think that i would be of use for that purpose?” “good academicians are also not out of the ambit of anti-generic lawyering”- he retorted. such was justice k. m. sobhan. i did not contemplate then that we, as a last bite of 2007 (31 december 2007), would lose the star of progressive movement, a relentless campaigner of human rights and a loud voice for trial of the war criminals and their aides of 1971.
preventing cancer
we can prevent cancer epidemic in many ways but at least three things we can do:
indo european origin
this is indeed a most interesting subject and i congratulate you on publishing the review of the book, "the quest for the origins of vedic culture" by edwin bryant (19 jan 08). another authoritative book by the archaeologist john v. day entitled, " indo european origin: the anthropological evidence" published by the institute for the study of man, washington d.c discusses in scholarly detail with full references this topic and considers various scientific techniques like genetic and anthropological study of modern humans as well as remains found in various ancient gravesites in europe and asia, archaeological and linguistic evidences etc and is a gold mine for researchers.

more and more, we see the rise of two opposing political camps in bangladesh. one is the old that wants to revive politics through immediate parliamentary polls. the other is the new that emerged after january 2007, and wishes never to return to old political dominance by dynasties, lawlessness, and the inability or reluctance of elected governments to bring reforms. view the page environment
increased co2 level threatens coral reefs
a coral reef is made up of thin layers of calcium carbonate (limestone) secreted over thousands of years by billions of tiny soft bodied animals called coral polyps. coral reefs are the world's most miscellaneous marine ecosystems and are home to twenty-five percent of identified marine species, including 4,000 species of fish, 700 species of coral and thousands of other plants and animals. coral reefs occupy less than one quarter of one percent of the earth's marine environment, yet they are home to more than a quarter of all known fish species.
impacts of climate change: global to local
the un climate advisory body intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) has warned that global environmental change will entail increasing climate variability and increased occurrence of extreme weather events. since 1750s onwards overall accelerated human-societal development led to activities like burning of fossil fuel, land use change and extensive agricultural practices which have ensued irreversible loss to the bio-capacity of present earth. best estimation shows about sixty percent of the ecosystems are being degraded or exploited unsustainably across the globe; and these sorts of pressures increase the risk of trade-offs in ecosystem functions.
