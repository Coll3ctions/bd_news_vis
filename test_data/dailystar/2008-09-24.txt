towards a new era for people's right to know
we welcome the council of advisers' giving final approval to the right to information ordinance 2008 and commend the government for this action. now, we believe, it is important that as soon as the ordinance is promulgated through presidential assent, instructions must go out to all ministries, directorates, departments, corporations and outlying offices for getting ready and set to provide information to the public on demand. to this end, government offices must be prepared, equipped and trained to cater to demands for information that are bound to arise in consequence of the law. no gaps should be allowed to develop around the links to the chain of information. it is also crucially important that a level of receptivity to requests for information be built into the system by undertaking motivational activities aimed at changing the mindset of government functionaries.

fast-tracking saarc trade
the challenge for customs nowadays is to offer the best possible service to traders and citizens in a planet characterised by economic globalisation, by rapidly increasing trade flows and by worldwide security concerns. despite having enormous potential, south asia is in an economically disadvantageous position, compared to other regional blocs. this is further aggravated by related bottlenecks that exist within the public administration, particularly the customs. lack of adequate infrastructure at ports, complex rules and regulations concerning international trade, ambiguities related to customs valuation and tariff classification, pervasiveness of corruption among a section of customs personnel, inefficiency of government bureaucracy, and lack of cooperation among the various government agencies pose serious threat to the region's external sector performance. raising effectiveness of trade facilitation measures within the saarc region is crucial to supporting global integration of saarc countries and promote their trade and commerce. such an endeavour will largely depend on adopting and implementing a number of measures including the following. the saarc secretariat could play a key role in it.

i am once more prompted to write this letter (refer to my letter of september 5, 2008 on the same subject) after reading the news item captioned “sexual harassment at ju: make probe report public”, published in your daily on september 17, 2008. this also has got to do with ms. nasrin pervin's letter published on september 12, 2008 on sexual harassment in educational institutions. what is remarkable about the letter is, she specifically cited the name of a department and claimed that one of her close friends was the victim of her teacher's constant insistence to get into such a relationship. thus the authenticity of her narrative cannot be disregarded.

to tell the truth…

admission tests
the education ministry is planning to draft a resolution regarding admission into higher seats of learning, it's considering cancellation of admission tests and introducing admission based on students' gpas achieved in hsc & ssc exams. already admission into colleges is gpa based. and we know what a mess it has created! in this case it can somehow be tolerated but in case of admission into universities, medical colleges it should better be aborted for the sake of quality education. getting good grades, especially in public exams, is not that difficult now, given the present system.
