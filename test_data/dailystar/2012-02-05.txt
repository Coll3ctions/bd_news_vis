the principles of the prophet
the life of prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) remains a defining principle of existence for muslims everywhere. that is so because of the values which the founder of islam enunciated and then inculcated in his followers between his attainment of prophethood and his passing, values which through the generations have come to embody a code of life for millions around the world. when, therefore, we recall muhammad (pbuh) today, it is essentially a journeying back to his ideals that we undertake, the better to ask ourselves whether we as followers of islam have adhered to those ideals or whether we have let some of those ideals get overshadowed by more mundane concerns. truly, religion is a matter of unquestioning faith. and when faith wavers, it is our religiosity that gets to be undermined.
