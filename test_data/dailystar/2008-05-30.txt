bahrain's ban on bangladeshi workers
the manner in which the bahrain authorities have imposed a ban on any further recruitment of manpower from bangladesh is cause for extreme concern. at the same time, it is for us a genuine reason to feel outraged. coming on the heels of the sufferings bangladeshi workers have been going through in malaysia and saudi arabia, this new move can only add to our growing disquiet about the future of our manpower export sector. what makes the bahrain move extremely shocking is that it was recommended by a group of lawmakers in that country following the alleged perpetration of a crime by a bangladeshi.
nepal becomes a republic
the abolition of the monarchy in nepal by an overwhelming parliamentary vote on wednesday heralds a new beginning for the country. with as many as 560 lawmakers in the newly elected 601-member constitutional assembly voting to declare the country a republic, it is clear where the sentiments of the population lie. while it can be argued that the struggle against the monarchy was spearheaded by the maoists, who now dominate nepalese politics, it is also true that nepalese in general have been yearning to see the back of the royal family for quite sometime. former king gyanendra made matters worse not only for himself but for his people as well when a few years ago he tried to impose his arbitrary authority by pushing politicians aside. he has now paid the price for that miscalculation.
cards on the table
game on. it is a testament to the circular nature of politics in bangladesh that i used the same heading and same introduction to a column almost three years ago. the more things change, the more they stay the same. the dynamics are different now, of course, with both al and bnp in the opposition, so to speak, but once again the issue is elections and whether or not to participate.
the new conversation
every time you talk about corruption, others throw back aphorisms like revelations. they tell you that corruption is a fact of life. that everyone has a price. that character is nothing but lack of opportunity to do mischief. that even the holiest man will have the urge to clean up an unprotected house. that pure gold doesn't make ornaments. so, if you give one reason why we should fight corruption, others give more reasons why we shouldn't. in our bid to fight the virus, the virus has contaminated our souls.

power generation
construction of the chernobyl power station began in the 1970s. the first of the four reactors was commissioned in 1977. reactor no. 4 began producing power in 1983 and within three years it exploded on saturday, april 26, 1986, at 1:23:58 a.m. local time. this plant was built by russia. the chernobyl accident cost the former soviet union hundreds of billions of dollars, and some observers believe it may have hastened the collapse of the soviet government. massive amounts of radioactive materials were released into the environment resulting in a radioactive cloud that spread over much of europe. the greatest contamination occurred around the reactor in areas that are now part of belarus, russia, and ukraine. after the accident, the soviet authorities resettled more than 350,000 people outside the worst affected areas, including all 50,000 people from nearby pripyat, but millions of people continue to live in contaminated areas.

bush and bias
the write-up from mr. harun-ur-rashid regarding the bush visit to israel on its 60th anniversary is an enlightened summary of the israeli occupation. mr rashid's conclusion that, “if the bush administration initiates a policy of inclusion and impartiality on the israeli-palestinian conflict, it may see the light in resolving one of the most intractable disputes in the world.” this sense of fairness will never happen from the west.
regional cooperation
the other day i came across an interesting article on international gas pipeline. i am talking about iran-pakistan-india (ipi) 2775 kilometre gas line which was mooted back in 1993 involving an expected cost of $3.3 billion which has now jumped to the haggard figure of $7.6 billion. this was stalled due to the laxity of india since the us nuclear deal was under consideration of indian parliament. as we see everywhere in the world, america was pulling the strings here too. american hostility towards iran stood in the way of this project. as a result of american pressure india sidelined this issue and did not attend the three meetings between iranian and pakistani officials during the last nine months. it may be mentioned here that it was also due to american pressure that india voted against iran at the iaea (international atomic energy agency). however, the pressure of the indian opposition outweighed the american pressure. there was another factor working simultaneously, i mean, pakistan's invitation to china to join the ipi project. all these together hastened indian oil minister's visit to islamabad to clinch this deal as both pakistan and india announced in a press conference in islamabad on april 25 that a final agreement would be signed within weeks if not days. in this perspective the forthcoming visit of iranian president to islamabad and new delhi will be of great significance. there was another development in the shape of turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-india 1680 kilometre gas pipeline project with the backing of america and its henchman asian development bank just to put ipi in limbo. unfortunately for bush this tapi project fizzled out first because doubts persisted about turkmenistan's actual gas reserve and secondly because whether those gas reserves are under turkmenistan's control or were pledged to russia. on the other hand, iran assured abundant gas supply from iran's south pars gas fields. the ipi gas line is expected to be complete by 2012 and will carry 2.4 billion cubic feet of gas per day to be equally shared by india and pakistan. the fees will be worked out when pakistan completes its portion of the pipeline. it is expected that pakistan will earn about $ 148 million per year as transit fee at the rate of 40 cent per million british thermal unit of gas.

our gas and coal prospects
khan's front-page news item (may18) is a comprehensive viewpoint of some energy sector officials on what could and should be done to free ourselves from the noose of prolonged expensive energy imports. if these steps are not taken promptly, then our financial and economic collapse is not far away. unfortunately, our ctg seems to have washed its hand off any forward going move in the energy sector. similarly, the immediate past government (bnp) also ignored the sector and cancelled an already signed mou when they took up the reins. their whole period of government was wasted away in trying to maximise their own larder from energy investment! the ctg's attitude on new energy investment is simple: do nothing! is this not shirking a critical national issue? but who are we to question why?
dialogue and the big two
it didn't come as a surprise that the two large political parties were contemplating whether they would join the government-political parties dialogue. these parties have reason to be worried about the dialogue session as well as the upcoming elections. as concerned citizens of the country we also feel that the speech of the honourable chief adviser was far below our expectation. i personally was expecting the chief adviser to chalk out extensive plans so that the doubts regarding the elections were dispelled. the government should make efforts to bring the two large parties, the awami league and the bnp, to the dialogue and also ensure their participation in the upcoming elections. an election without the participation of these two major parties will not ensure its credibility.
park needed
the residents of shaheenbag, nakhalpara, teskonipara and arjotpara under tejgaon police station have very little scope to find some open space for a morning or evening walk. children are the most deprived group. so, the majority have to spend their afternoon at home. their rooftops are the only place to meet the requirement. but, regular exercise through sports is important for mental and physical growth of children. we think it is their civic right as well. besides, the incidence of diabetes and hypertension is alarming in the city. so, walking is a must for everyone as suggested by the physicians.
fdi
one news item has drawn my attention, that the government held talks with delegates of tata regarding the proposed $3 billion investment in steel, fertiliser and power. the conglomerate revealed their interest to use the uninterrupted gas supply after four years, not right now. despite having huge potentiality of this sector, unfortunately bangladesh could not be a gainer from it since many fdi proposals were not assessed properly over the years by our respective government authorities.

fear of a muslim planet: hip-hop's hidden history
journalist harry allen once called islam "hip-hop's unofficial religion." this theme is echoed by adisa banjoko, unofficial ambassador of muslim hip-hop, who says: "muslim influence was at the ground floor of hip hop. hip hop came from the streets, from the toughest neighborhoods, and that's always where the muslims were."
women warriors
i could hardly contain my excitement when i first discovered, far away from dhaka, in a little village in sharupkathi, that a group of young girls had taken up arms to protect themselves and their village from the enemy during the war of liberation. long before the mukti bahini entered the village, or even before sector 9 was formed, bastokathi had already built an organised resistance, led by bithika and her brother shamiron.
the maobaadi triumph
for thirty years, modern nepal was ruled by a royal autocracy. then, starting in 1990, the people began to experience inefficient, perhaps, but real democracy, through the medium of political parties. in 1996, one of these went underground to engage in maoist revolution, picking up the gun against the multiparty system of the day. though gaining momentum, and spread over the first seven-odd years, by 2005 the insurgency had achieved a stalemate with the state security. the rebels then decided to relinquish the "people's war" and, along with the other parties, helped generate the people's movement of april 2006 against the king, gyanendra -- who had in the meantime taken over. two years later, on 10 april 2008, the communist party of nepal (maoist) made a leap into the government, winning an astounding 50 percent of elected seats in the constituent assembly, and nearly 30 percent of the proportional-representation votes. in so doing, they trounced the two main forces of yesteryear, the nepali congress and the communist party of nepal (unified marxist-leninist), and gained a definitive mandate from the people.
going underground
the recent decision to build a metro (underground rail) system in dhaka has met with a range of responses. on one side is the "hallelujah" response -- at last, the government is taking public transit seriously, with plans to invest serious funds (at least $3.2 billion) into making life easier for the masses.
where is the conscience of our nation?
why speak up about things that don't seem to affect you? silence is, after all, protection. in recent definitions of "patriotism" where demanding accountability and seeking dignity is slandered as "anti-state activity," it is better to save one's skin by not raising one's voice.
can you tell me how to get to sisimpur?
somewhere, sometime in bangladesh there's a fairy tale land. if you're lucky enough to reach this magical place, you'll find the classrooms have no walls. the sky is the limit and the earth is the floor. halum, tuktuki, shiku, ikree mikree and friends wait on their chariot to take you on a "magical mystery tour" to places beyond your wildest imagination. yes, imagination is the key word to enter and travel in this magical land -- a land where all entrants are treated equally. the way it should be.
