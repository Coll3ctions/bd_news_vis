architectural visions to save dhaka's heritage sites
old dhaka is usually looked at as a part of the city that is nothing but an intricately woven labyrinth of dingy streets, massive piles of junk, dead-end alleys and cramped, dilapidated buildings. what is often missed by most is that the “old town”, as it is commonly known, has immense historical value and it bears the legacy from the mughal and colonial period. considering all that, one may wonder what might have caused these areas that evolved over centuries to be reduced to a kind of inner city ghettos with chocking problems at every turn. a sheer disregard for the preservation of our cultural heritage on the successive governments' part is responsible for the situation, asserts a voluntary organisation of architects called urban study group (usg).
