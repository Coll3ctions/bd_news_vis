market behaviour needs self-correction
despite the government's taking to the field early in the day and holding series of meetings with business community leaders and the latter's assurances galore, the prices of essentials instead of stabilising keep soaring, much to the consumers' chagrin. as a result, these sounded like a public relations exercise, for even though the intent might have been positive, it is the growing lack of coordination between the market players that keep hindering price stabilisation efforts .
filling in academic positions at public universities
over the past many years, it has become something of a bad rule for many university teachers to go abroad for higher studies and then choose to stay back rather than return to their academic institutions. what emerges here is the spectacle of academics committing not only an act that is less than moral but also plainly beyond the bounds of rules and regulations. when these teachers go abroad, they do so on behalf of the universities with which they are affiliated full time. in a number of instances, the public universities expend a lot of resources, in terms of finance and time, in sending teachers for higher studies at foreign universities. the normal expectation is that once their stay at those universities is over under the terms of their residence and study, they will return home. unfortunately, not many of them do. a few years ago, under pressure from such authorities as dhaka university to return home or compensate the universities for their unauthorized stay abroad, some teachers sent in their resignations.

slum dwellers
this is a matter of shame that the government is again planning to evict slum dwellers of dhaka city. i admit that they do not own the land in which they live. at the same time i must ask who made them homeless? on many occasions rural godfathers and developers made them homeless either by force or by cheating them. moreover, the government acquired many lands in rural areas through acquisition as part of the decision to provide opportunity to the people of dhaka city for housing that resulted in rendering many land owners homeless and they were forced to take shelter in the vacant lands of the government. on the other hand, due to river erosion, floods and other natural calamities in bangladesh, the unfortunate people who became homeless and having no profession, and no provisions for food and shelter, migrated to urban areas and started living in the government vacant lands.

masters not friends!

paracetamol syrup
when the manufacturers of medicines use such toxic elements which ultimately take away the lives of innocent children, we cannot take the matter so easily. reports disclose that a pharmaceutical company has used “diethylene” in their paracetamol syrup. we have been taken aback and horrified to know the news as this very element is used in tannery and battery industries. as a result, a good many babies have died. some children also died in 1992. as the owners of the medicine companies are well- off people they cannot be given exemplary punishment.
anti-indianism
a write-up on above caption on the 24th july by prof habibul is absolutely disappointing. it shows neither academic depth nor it contains facts and essence. the concluding sentence is sarcastic. as a result, a serious matter became too simplistic in presentation.
governance--the myopic view

dams and earthquakes
asia is a land of extreme natural disasters like earthquake, cyclone, flood drought, tsunami etc.). south asia (indian subcontinent) is more disaster prone. and bangladesh is at a higher risk of natural disaster.

a complete code of life
the arabic word islam is derived from the word 'salam' which means 'peace'. as a religion it stands for complete submission and obedience to allah. it is a universal religion and its objective is to create and cultivate in man the quality and attitude of 'silm' i.e. submission to divine will. 'islam' is, indeed, an attributive title. whoever possesses this attribute, may s/he belong to any race, community, country or clan, is a muslim. islam is a state of mind, a way of thinking and a mode of life. it is a complete code of life. human beings are hungry for peace and happiness. but they cannot enjoy peace and happiness unless their physical needs, psychological needs and intellectual needs are satisfied. the world is full of material resources. at the same time, we find lots of people are immersed in a miserable plight. they get only a scanty portion of the vast material resources spread all over the world. it proves that mere abundant availability of resources does not alleviate human sufferings. unless resources are justly distributed among people at large, poverty continues to pinch the people and they are bound to be deprived of peace and happiness.
