tiger of bengal a.k. fazlul huq
in my stormy and chequered life, chance has played more than her fair part. the fault has been my own. never at any time have i tried to be the complete master of my own fate. the strongest impulse of the moment has governed all my actions. when chance has raised me to dazzling heights, i have received her gifts with outstretched hands. when she has cast me down from my high pinnacle, i have accepted her buffets without complaint. i have my hours of penance and regret. disappointments have not cured me of an ineradicable romanticism. if at times i am sorry for something i have done, remorse assails me only the about things i have left undone."
