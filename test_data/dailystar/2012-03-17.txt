where have all our vultures gone?
three species of vultures endemic to south asia including bangladesh, oriental white-backed vulture (gyps bengalensis), long-billed vulture (g. indicus) and slender-billed vulture (g. tenuirostris), are listed as being threatened with extinction after rapid population declines in this region. populations of three gyps vulture species in parts of their ranges in south asia fell by more than 95 percent in the 1990s, and all are now classified as critically endangered. unless major steps are taken, all three species could soon be facing extinction. the white-rumped vulture -- once the most populous large bird of prey -- is under particular threat, having declined by 99.9 per cent. during the 1980s the oriental white-backed vulture was so abundant in this region that it was probably the most common large bird of prey in the world. more than 97 per cent of vultures have disappeared from this region's skies in the past 15 years -- the fastest decline ever recorded in a bird population anywhere in the world. only about 10,000 still exist in the wild in the sub-continent, down from tens of millions in the 1980s.

a meal at a chinese restaurant
nirmal-babu has been a problem ever since he has retired from the college and came to live in dhaka. he lived in boro-digha quite contently. the few occasions krishna visited him were of dire necessity when she stayed in her paternal house nearby. avita and ovi stayed with him once and were looked after well by other residents of his quarter. they were students of the college who lived there free of board and lodging and had the common characteristics of being poor and meritorious distant relations. kobita, avita and ovi saw more of him in the earlier part of their lives when he would come to dhaka during the vacations. then the visits became less frequent, krishna got promoted and moved to a larger quarter. ovi's hair and dress styles took turns that were increasingly and startlingly bizarre in nirmal-babu's eyes and avita permanently became avita chatterjee through registration in her secondary school certificate form. only close few kept the secret that she was previously known as sobita chattopadhay. only nirmal-babu had no reason to believe otherwise that she was sobita chattopadhay.
waiting for snow
this year winter has not been very generous to us living in boston. i, a grown up, look forward to snow, just as children do, because snow days are often declared as holidays: no school, no work, no classes and no appointments. you stay at home, drink tea or coffee, watch tv or go on the internet, listen to music, or do whatever you please. snow days are unscheduled holidays, and are always welcome, at least to me. view the page star health
successful strategies to safeguard medications
over several decades, powerful medicines have been developed to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, aids, influenza and many bacterial infections; all medicines used to treat these infections are likely become ineffective because of resistance at some point. antimicrobial resistance (amr) has evolved to become a worldwide health threat. of critical importance, every antibiotic ever developed is at risk. with a dearth of new antibiotics coming to market, the need for action to avert a developing global crisis in health care is increasingly urgent.

1848: history's shadow over the middle east
1848 in europe was the year that wasn't. in the spring and summer of that year, bourgeois intellectuals and working-class radicals staged upheavals from france to the balkans, shaking ancient regimes and vowing to create new liberal democratic orders. the arab spring has periodically been compared to the stirrings of 1848. but with the exception of the toppling of the orleans monarchy in france, the 1848 revolutions ultimately failed. dynastic governments reasserted themselves. they did so for a reason that has troubling implications for the middle east: conservative regimes in mid-19th century europe had not only the institutional advantage over their liberal and socialist adversaries but also the moral advantage.

rainbows out of the past. . .
mahboob alam, after all the years he spent in promoting bangladesh's diplomacy abroad, could have lapsed into quiet superannuation. or he could have followed in the footsteps of some of his colleagues in government who, after retirement, opted for a second life as columnists or television talk show guests. alam chose to do neither. and one is happy that he made a different sort of choice, that of exploring the many unknown facets of history. you could well argue that in alam there is a historian whose preoccupation happens to be a study of the history behind the curtain, history that has often gone into the making of history as we know it.
. . .words that redefined history
oratory has since the beginning of civilised existence kept people in thrall. shakespeare provided a clue to the riveting nature of speeches in his plays. you think here of brutus and mark antony in julius caesar , of the many ways in which they played with words to convince the audience of the justness of the causes they held dear. but that was literature. in life lived from day to day, through the vagaries of politics, oratory has often been raised to the level of art. in bangladesh's case, the speeches of sheikh mujibur rahman were ammunition, over the years, in the defence of liberty. gandhi was not a rousing speaker, but the calm religiosity he brought into his words drove the point home. and then there was syed badrudduja, whose command of bengali, urdu and english was demonstrated to huge effect in his speeches, particularly in pre-partition india.
reviewing the review page
to review something is an intellectual pursuit which presupposes the idea that there is a complete work, be it a book, a film, a play, radio, tv or any other programme that is to be viewed again. thus reviewing something is set in the context of an already expressed opinion or viewpoint of someone who produces the work. this brings the reviewer face to face with the writer. reviewing definitely is a job that involves a critical process of thinking that need not necessarily be for the purpose of expressing disagreement or disapproval unless and until the book in question entails it. for example, the recently published book, dead reckoning: memories of the 1971 bangladesh war by sarmila bose, caused much furore among sensible people both at home and abroad, for obvious reasons.
