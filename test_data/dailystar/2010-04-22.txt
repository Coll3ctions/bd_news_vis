loyalty in the ranks
reportedly, the parliamentary standing committee on defence has recommended "consolidating the armed forces" loyalty to the country's constitution to prevent military takeovers in future."
a costly hesitancy
as one sees developments in pakistan and iran today, it is sad to note the inability of pakistan to get out of its mindset and attitude relating to iran formulated in the recent past, despite a highly altered environment that came into being post-9/11. the result is that pakistan is unable or unwilling to take advantage of the new outreach by iran towards pakistan -- be it the offer to supply electricity on to the national grid or the ipi pipeline project which may have been inked but still awaits operationalisation. and there are other potential projects that are being ignored, even though iran, like china, offers viable alternatives of cooperation to the rather costly us relationship. in order to overcome the psychological barriers and hesitancy to act, we need to understand our decision-makers mindsets on this vital issue.
a day of celebration
the first earth day, organised in 1970 in the united states, launched the modern environmental movement. some 20 million americans took to the streets, parks, and auditoriums to decry trends toward increased pollution and deterioration, and to demonstrate for a healthy, sustainable environment. rising environmental awareness during that period led the us government to establish the environmental protection agency in late 1970, and to enact ground-breaking legislation, the clean air act of 1970 and clean water act of 1972.
unnecessary confrontation

rhetoric and reality
the prime minister has claimed that during the 15-month tenure of her government, 80 percent of the decisions have been implemented and the remainder were under consideration for implementation. furthermore, the cabinet approved 106 bills during this period, of which 90 have been passed in the parliament. such rhetoric only begs the question -- are you deluding yourself madam? view the page star chittagong
