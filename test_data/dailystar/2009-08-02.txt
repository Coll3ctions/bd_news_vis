weekly currency roundup
july 26th-july 30th, 2009
international markets
the currency markets continued to remain highly volatile this week. early in the week , driven by earnings optimism and good readings from eurozone pmi and german ifo data the higher yielding currencies posted significant gains versus the usd. the sterling however stumbled on weak uk gdp figures. stock markets continued to rally strongly and this further buoyed the so called riskier currencies. the dollar suffered broadly and hit 8 week lows versus the euro. however from wednesday, the reversal started as the risk rally stalled. the dollar and the yen gained as investors took profit on risky assets. china's benchmark shanghai composite index had ended 5% lower on fears, that their central bank would tighten credit as inflation fears loomed. however the next day after clarification from the chinese central bank, the market retraced back 1.7 % and this contributed to an increase in risk sentiment. us, japanese and european shares all closed up on thursday. the improved risk sentiment helped the higher yielding currencies to claw back some of the losses from the previous day against the us dollar. the dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance against six other major currencies, fell 0.3 percent to 79.317.

waste management
clean dhaka depends to a great extent on better domestic waste management. domestic waste is mainly of two types-- kitchen waste, other wastes. kitchen waste is the major component of the domestic waste. culturally and habitually we are used to non-frozen kitchen foods. non-frozen foods are dressed and prepared in the house resulting in big volume of kitchen waste. in case of frozen foods, wastes are left in the factory. due to culture and habit we are producing more domestic waste, raw in nature producing bad smell and polluting the nearby environment. big volume of raw domestic waste causes dcc to maintain big fleet of vehicles and equipment, manpower with huge involvement of money. in the months of june-august the situation becomes difficult with the addition of leftovers of mangoes and jackfruits. we cannot change the habits overnight but we can follow some rules to help waste management.
redirect the railways
what i understand is that the then pakistani government did nothing to modernize the railways, except building the kamlapur station which is probably still incomplete according to many.
tajuddin ahmed
while writing on “the life and principles of tajuddin ahmed” mr. syed badrul ahsan writes:
living on the rivers' edge!
in kathmandu, every morning, on way to office, i cross river bagmati. for people of kathmandu valley, its akin to our buriganga. in so many ways, bagmati defines their daily life. elders say, bagmati is not only a river, “its our living civilization”. kathmandu's history is intricately linked with 'bagmati civilization'. it's just two decades back when bagmati water was just pure and clean as one could imagine! thanks to mindless civil works, dumping of sewage (municipal and industrial), for most part of the year, passing through kathmandu valley, bagmati is today reduced to a narrow drain, with its blackish and stinking liquid called 'water'. for months between october through may, hardly one can pass by bagmati avoiding its stinking, heavy air!
news and ethics
i was again shocked to see a major bangladeshi television channel reporting a microbus accident in gazipur on 23 july. i don't understand why the television channels in bangladesh keep on failing to care for the sensitive and weak-hearted or even for the children who might be watching the television. it was appalling to see the news camera covering the half-charred and half burnt body of one of the victims. i was also surprised that no one had the least sense of decency in showing respect to the unknown victim who was once someone's loved one. it appeared no one even bothered to put off the smouldering fire which was very much ablaze on the dead-man's body. instead of being active in bringing the dead-man's burning body on our television screen, the television crew should have rather initiated the humane effort to put off the blaze from the body and that would have been more civilised.
in response...
ref: why are some bangladeshis anti-indian? by professor, habibul haque khondker (july 24, 2009).
madrasa education
education and learning are of paramount importance in islam. the very first word of the holy qur'an revealed to the holy prophet (pbuh) is 'iqra' which literally means 'read' in arabic, and unlike other holy books, about half of the holy qur'an narrates about nature, space, weather, geography, biology etc. which are 'non-religious' subjects. similarly, the holy prophet (pbuh) asked his followers to even 'go to china' to acquire knowledge and during the prophet's lifetime a war captive was freed if he could educate at least ten muslims. many such examples indicate the importance of 'secular' education in islam. there was no (concept of present day) madrasa ( meaning 'school' in arabic) during the times of holy prophet (pbuh) and the caliphs (ra) and mosques were the centre of social and religious activities. early madrasas were founded in around 10th century in iran, west africa, spain and then spread all over the muslim world to provide islamic education as well as education on science, philosophy, public administration, governance etc. later, the ottoman rulers constructed a mosque with an adjoining madrasa but did not change much of the primitive madrasa education system and syllabus.
abandon dst
day light saving time (dst) was introduced by the govt. with the intention of saving electricity. but it could not bring the expected improvement. dst is an old concept that many countries abandoned long ago. the reason for introducing dst by our policymakers was dubious and not based on facts. in some western countries dst is practised not because of scarcity of electricity. dst facilitated citizens to have more time for outdoor recreation during summer days. because during the winter, due to early dusk, people spend less time outdoor for entertainment and recreation.
substandard drugs
illegal drug promotion and marketing of substandard and unnecessary drugs in bangladesh were very common before 1982. instead of producing essential drugs, most drug manufacturers manufactured nonessentials such as vitamins, tonics, enzymes, gripe waters and cough mixtures.
anti-indian attitude
i read with interest the op-ed piece by mr. habibul who tried to explain the anti-indian attitude in 'some' of us. one needs to rationally look at the economic, cultural, political strategy employed by our neighbour to understand that the sentiment can reasonably be explained. bangladesh has kept its part of the bargain with regard to farraka, land corridors while india does not negotiate or want international arbitration - rather insists on bilateral discussions only. bangladesh's trade, commerce and industry have become captive to indian influence.
withdraw filthy notes
by letting an overwhelmingly large number of nauseatingly filthy ( also indescribably ugly) banknotes to go on circulating for so many years, the bangladesh bank has been contributing generously to the spread of disease in the country and committing an unforgivable offence against the people. how could the bangladesh bank be so blind and callous? is it not time for our health minister, a physician himself, to take notice of this intolerable and unacceptable situation and use his influence and power to remove this grave health hazard for the people?
life and religion
nowadays it's becoming more difficult to have spare time from our robotic working life and focus on spiritual side of life. we are forgetting to think! we earn but barely have time to spend that in an enjoyable way. no time for family either. but whenever we get some time to contemplate it seems time is fleeting so fast, we are getting older, hairs turning grey. our one wish becomes fulfilled, another replaces it. and it goes on and on…
administration and police
it is an unwanted situation that in district and upazila level, the conflict between the administration and the police aggravates the law and order situation.
