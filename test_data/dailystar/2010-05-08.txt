a sparkle that never fades
“rabindranath was one among the nearly seven hundred occupants at the jorashanko thakur bari, and grew up with thirteen siblings: it was not that easy to be the shining star in an environment such as that,” says tagore enthusiast and educationist dr. a.b.m nurul anwar.
looking through a new window
it would not be an exaggeration to say that rabindranath tagore was one of the greatest bengali playwrights. apart from his poems, songs, novels and short stories, tagore's mastery as a playwright is equally admired. nearly 40 short and full-length plays by tagore initiated a new era of indian theatre.
readership waning?
tagore's “gitanjali” celebrates its centenary this year. there is confusion here, however. noted writer, columnist and chittagong bureau chief of the daily prothom alo, abul momen cleared the air.
the poet at close quarters
“i have never seen a more kind-hearted man than our jomidar (landlord) rabindranath tagore,” said mohammed jhoru pramanik. over 106 years old, pramanik is only living person in patisar village (naongaon district) who had seen the noble laureate poet at close quarters during his last visit to the area in 1937.

storm in a tea (party) cup!

take it or leave it

combating climate change: agenda for bangladesh
climate change issues in bangladesh are generally viewed as the way issues are perceived at global scales. the activities and action plans those are currently in progress in bangladesh are deeply influenced by the estimates and model predictions produced by ipcc. the most recent ipcc fourth assessment report (ipcc ar4, 2007) states that climate is indeed changing and mentioned that this change took place over the decades as a result of human activities.
alien invasive species disrupting native biodiversity
lantana is a native evergreen shrub to tropical america. it is now a major weed in many regions of the palaeotropics where it invades natural and agricultural ecosystems. the plants can grow individually in clumps or as dense thickets, crowding out more desirable species. it may grow up to 6 ft high and may spread to 8 ft as a climber with the help of a support. leaves and stems are rough, hairy and secrete an unpleasant odour like cat pee when crushed. in the tropics lantana is a non-stop bloomer. flower colour ranges from white to yellow, orange to red, pink to rose in unlimited combinations. in addition, the flower colour usually changes with the change of age.

in the recently concluded saarc (the south asian association for regional cooperation) summit in thimphu, the saarc leaders called for focus to be laid upon water management and conservation and development of cooperative projects at regional level in terms of exchange of best practices and knowledge, capacity building and transfer of eco-friendly technologies. also the convention on cooperation on environment aims at promoting regional cooperation in preserving the environment and mitigating the impacts of the climate change (the daily star, april 30). this is a promising start and i am focusing my attention on how “saarc can play an important role in reducing vulnerability to water-related disasters”. view the page literature
rabindranath---timeless echoes
standing at the foot of the snow-capped mountains of the himalayas, rabi felt an overpowering sense of freedom. this was the first time in his young life that he had ventured outside the protected confines of his princely home and was amidst the natural surroundings he loved. he was only eleven then. strangely enough, this would also be one of those treasured periods of time he would get to spend with his father maharshi devendranath. rabi, in his later life, would call his childhood a period of 'servocracy' since he had grown up more under the tutelage of family servants than his parents. this trip to shantiniketan and the himalayas with his father was, therefore, all the more special to him.
moving power of figurative language
a presentation speech was delivered by harald hjärne, chairman of the nobel committee of the swedish academy, on december 10, 1913, on the occasion of rabindranath tagore's receiving the nobel prize for literature. we carry excerpts from the address ---

. . . from rabindranath
my song this song of mine will wind its music around you,
my child, like the fond arms of love.

help your child to take control over asthma
with the rapid urbanisation and increase in atmospheric pollution, there has been a striking rise of the number of people with asthma in recent years. an estimated 300 million people are currently living with asthma and another 100 million will be added by 2025. majority of these numbers are attributed to children as asthma likely to develop in childhood. knowing information and simple procedures can make a big difference to such children’s life. as a parent, caregiver, brother, sister, relative, we should help these children to lead a healthy life by controlling asthma.
addressing thalassaemia in the national health policy
thalassaemia is a common genetic disorder in bangladesh which requires lifelong regular blood transfusion at 2-4 weeks interval. repeated blood transfusion results in toxic iron accumulation in the body, which in turn damages vital organs like heart, liver and pancreas. therefore these patients require regular treatment with expensive iron chelating drugs. the overall treatment is burdensome, painful and destroys the economic prospect of an affected family.

surreptitious liquidation of sovereignty
history taught us that through the passage of time hard earned sovereignty of a nation, state, empire, colony, union or even a republic could eventually crumble. we are not a union like the former ussr or a republic like the usa. we are a sovereign state with maximum homogeneity in terms of ethnicity and culture. however, it still remains vulnerable like all others, barely surviving or crawling towards maturity. to retain its sovereignty, a nation must possess a strong, tangible and intangible ideological platform. this is the area where feeble states perform poorly and eventually succumb. enlightened leadership with sound civil and military bureaucracy and a professional and patriotic intelligence apparatus can strengthen the foundation and help keep a nation go forward.

dhaka university and the bengali ethos . . .
the growth of bengali nationalism in pre-1971 pakistan had a whole lot to do with the various struggles put up by students and teachers of dhaka university. and that was clearly a reason why during the war of liberation the university would be made the target of the pakistan army's particular wrath. that, of course, is an obvious truth. but what rangalal sen, dulal bhowmik and tuhin roy have come forth with in this work is a comprehensive study of the role dhaka university has played in the shaping of bengali nationalistic aspirations, beginning especially with the language movement of 1952. that is quite a departure from the title of the work. at the same time, for all the stress on the role played by dhaka university and calcutta university during bangladesh's war for liberty in 1971, information on the contributions of the latter does not much go beyond an enumeration of the efforts its academics and students made towards assisting the bengali movement. but, to be sure, it is invaluable information, a necessary reminder to bengalis inhabiting the people's republic of the powerful wave of support that had come their way in clearly the darkest moment of their collective life.
divided loyalties, betrayed love
kartography is a book about karachi, the spider plant city where you might find, according to the narrator, fossilized footprints of alexander the great. it is a heartbreaking love story, depicts the ethnic conflict which pervades pakistani society and yet at the same time the resilience of its people. the story revolves around four friends and their lives in karachi during 1971, which they call the 'civil war'. the couples zafar and maheen, yasmin and ali swap their partners. while they handle the situation somehow, it is their children who can't accept the fact that one of their parents had betrayed the other.
