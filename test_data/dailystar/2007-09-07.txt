fighting corruption
corruption is an age-old phenomenon which needs to be addressed in a practical way. during the caliphate of hazrat umar (r) one tax collector brought two bags and placed them in front of him saying one is for the baitul mal (govt. treasury) and the other for him. when asked how he obtained the bags for himself, the tax collector replied that the people donated the money willingly. the caliph dismissed the man and asked him to go to the people now for donation (after losing the job) and deposited both the bags to the treasury. so corruption was there in every age in different forms and shape but it is the duty of the head of the govt. to see that his administration remains free of corrupt people.

du incident
forty eminent citizens on sunday issued a statement regarding the recent incident at dhaka university. below is a direct quote, as published in a dhaka daily, from the statement:
students of du
they look in retrospect to the tumultuous past of the country and say with pride that the students of du led from the front in all the movements. the other day one prominent professor of dhaka university told a television journalist that the du does not teach students to become cowards. i get confused as to what for students go to du, to pursue higher studies or to wield sticks? are they taught how to set vehicles on fire, vandalise shops and destroy public property? even if the whole issue is taken in right perspective, what do we find is a very minor violation, a moment of slackness on the part of a soldier and his superior. the superior should have better advised him not to transgress.
impression of our country!
i am writing this in response to the letter (a foreigner's experience) that was published in your daily on 22/08/2007.
political dialogue
most of the non-resident bangladeshis remain very much concerned about the rapidly shifting twists and turns in the political arena of the country. however, there is a consensus that the advisers in the current caretaker government and the team in the reconstituted election commission are quite well-meaning personalities, who have the background, commitment and foresight to steer the country out of the crisis.
government's job
the following should be the government's priorities at the moment.
follow the rules
i do not know why the dhaka university students were targeted. the students were caught and mercilessly beaten. this happened in aziz super market, shahbag, shaheed minar and in different stations and places. i am scared about everything. if anyone is found guilty he should face the due legal process.
icl versus bcci
the word of war between indian cricket league(icl) and the indian cricket board (bcci) is getting intense. the recent interim order passed by the delhi high court on the suit filed by icl boosted the latter's morale. the court has ordered both the federal government and bcci to come up with their replies against the suit. bcci has warned its players that any player found aligned with icl will be barred from playing cricket for india. no doubt, this is a harsh order issued by bcci to its players. the delhi high court, on the other hand, has delivered its observation that the bcci has no right to issue such statement that a player may lose his job if he is found to be aligned with icl. meanwhile, bcci has sacked kapil dev, the legendary indian cricketer, from the honourary post of chairman of the national cricket academy because of his joining icl. madan lal, another veteran of indian cricket, who is now holding the post of cricket coach of icl termed the ruling as relief for icl.
electricity from municipal wastes
electric power generation from solid urban municipal wastes is a proven technology, already such power plants are operating in eu. this available and easily exploitable fuel source is sufficiently present in our cities of dhaka and chittagong. the quantity of such waste is adequate in these two cities for utilisation as fuel for power generation. some times back in '05 or '06, a private sector waste collecting and composting company gave a proposal to this effect to the dhaka city corporation, where the proposal possibly died its natural death, maybe for lack of sufficient incentive to the right place!

global spending on health totalled about $2.3 trillion in 1994, or about 9 percent of total global income. high-income countries, those with per capita income above $8,500 in 1994 spent just over $2 trillion, amounting to 89 per cent of total health expenditure, while their populations accounted for 16 per cent of the global population. in usa, for every $7 spent, $1 goes for financing the health sector. developing countries, with 84 per cent o the world's population, accounted for only 11 per cent of all health spending (health affair, 1999). view the page environment
minimising flood risk and damage
like on many occasions in the past, bangladesh suffered colossal loss and damages, particularly in terms of assets, due to flood this year too. unless some specific and effective measures are adopted the situation is likely to continue posing a permanent threat to our economy. bangladesh, the largest deltaic region in the world, is located at the downstream end of two of the world's largest rivers, the ganges and the brahmaputra (jamuna), both originating in the great mountain range of the himalayas. the origin of the third longest river of the country, the meghna, is also outside bangladesh. about 93 percent of the catchment area of these rivers lies outside of the country's boundary, mainly in india. during the rainy season waters from a zone with an area equivalent to eleven times of the total area of bangladesh flows into the bay of bengal through our territories making the country permanently prone to floods.
why must the poor suffer for the fault of the rich?
global warming refers to a rise in the average land temperature around the earth. the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) concludes, "most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic green house gas concentration" which leads to warming of the surface and lower atmosphere by increasing the green house effect. ipcc predicts that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4ºc (2.0 to 11.5ºf) between 1990-2100.
war over water!
the next world war, so goes the saying, will be fought over waters. imagine the huge glaciers in the himalayan mountains melting under the impact of global warming, leading to fall in water levels of the mighty ganges, brahmaputra and other rivers, drought and severe water scarcity for millions in india, china, pakistan and bangladesh.
concern over aircrafts' carbon footprint
recently, the tourism industry has drawn the attention of world environment leaders regarding tourism and climate change. this has been echoed in aviation, a part of the tourism industry. aviation experts around the world believe there is just one way to reduce aircraft's carbon footprint: stop flying. it has been logical that, people cannot live without luxurious aviation and at the same time the industry is booming, swelling greenhouse gases just as the climate-change urgency starts to crunch. time is due, it has to be balanced right back.
