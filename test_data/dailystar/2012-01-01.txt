hope and expectations in 2012
the ringing in of a new year is always an occasion for an expression of hope and a time to look back at what has been and could have been. as we welcome the advent of the year 2012, it is poignant hope and profound expectations which today form the core of thoughts among individuals across the globe. for us in bangladesh, the hope is simply one of life taking a more progressive turn through a turning away from everything negative that held us back in the year just ended.
fuel price hike is not the answer

a peep inside north korea
if you ever happen to meet a north korean government official and ask him about the size of his country and the population, do not be surprised if he gives the land area of the two koreas combined and quotes the population that inhabits both north and south korea. this is because he thinks that the division of the korean peninsula into two countries is a temporary phenomenon and the two territories will return to be one country again.
the year of ludicre
what precisely is the difference between ridiculous and ludicrous? with their inter-changeable syllables they even sound like each other. philology is not very helpful. one word has a root, ridicule; but there is no "ludicre" in english. why? since language does not have a pope whose word is law, we will never get an answer. my own view, that ridiculous is pathos and ludicrous is bathos, is probably no more than a literary conceit dredged up to justify the inexplicable.
it's still a beautiful world
it's that time again: time to reflect on the year that has gone by. to hold on to the good things that life offered, to fondly remember the people we lost and take stock of missed opportunities.
nationalism
nationalism was identified as a pillar of our nationhood because our founding fathers recognised that liberation was tied up with our struggle to establish our national identity as distinct from pakistan. our founders were also conscious about asserting our identity vis a vis india, our friend and neighbour, who had played such a critical role through their support of our liberation struggle. however, in the day to day affairs of nation building the issue of nationalism is more concerned with the need to recapture autonomy over our political as well as policy choices. our founders were aware that their pakistani rulers had surrendered autonomy over policymaking, in large measure, to international development partners on whom we had become heavily dependent for both military and economic aid. however, in a fast globalising world policy choices available to a least developed country such as bangladesh are severely constrained. regrettably, successive regimes in bangladesh have made little effort to design our policies and restructure our economy so as to enhance our flexibility in coping with the challenges of globalisation.
