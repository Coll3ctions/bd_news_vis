automation at chittagong customs house
with the inauguration of the automation project of the chittagong custom house the forwarding and clearing operation of the port has potentially come at par with that of other international ports. all concerned agencies and institutions must be complimented for their role in completing this project within a very short span of time. this new addition comes as a part of the larger context of the port operation, which would have remained incomplete without this technology. the changeover is also heartening because it is a product of public-private partnership.

roman chariots and modern train!
the distance between the parallel railway tracks is known as the gauge of the railway. most commercial railways, except for those running in fairs or exhibitions, are covered by one of the following gauges. these are designated either as broad gauge or standard gauge or meter gauge railways. mountain railways are generally of narrow gauge. broad gauge, which is the widest, measures a distance of 5feet 3inches between the two parallel rails. it was pioneered by the british, and laid in england and it's colonial railways subsequently. the meter gauge measures one meter between the tracks, and was pioneered by the french in europe. the narrow gauge is usually set at track width of 2 feet.

upazila polls
firstly, i would like to express my opinion that the current election commission has done a lot of improvement upon its work, the electoral laws and preparation of voter list and national id card. you may or may not agree with me but that is not the issue here. today, i am raising the issue of upazila polls. i only read what the political parties and the ec want. what about your view points ? why is your political correspondent not doing any investigative reporting on it?

"sexual harassment by teacher"
the daily star has published a number of letters from concerned citizens regarding sexual harassment by teachers. no doubt, if such heinous activities are actually taking place in our educational institutions, then those should be properly handled by the administration. however, after reading a letter on the topic, which was published on september 25, i actually had to wonder if some letter writers were confusing 'failed relationship with teacher' with 'sexual harassment'. unfortunately, that's the impression i got after reading nasrin pervin's letter published on september 12, 2008. according to the writer, her friend was having a long relationship with her teacher and when the teacher backed out (for whatever reason it might be), then it automatically became a 'sexual harassment by the teacher', just because the guy who was flirting with her friend was a teacher by profession.
bnp and jamaat
i was amazed to watch tv where bnp leader mr. delwar was demanding a level playing field without specifying what that meant. however, from another channel i understood that he wanted the rpo to be repealed and rejected the idea of registration of political parties, etc. it appears that the jamaat is riding on the bnp.
shouldering responsibility
taking responsibility for the actions, especially the wrong ones, of the followers and subordinates is one of the most important qualities of any leader in any profession. one may quote a number of incidents from recent history wherein ministers in other countries, including our neighbour india, resigned for the failures and lapses committed by the junior members of their respective departments. for example, a railway minister resigned for two trains colliding face to face on the same track. a civil aviation minister resigned because two airplanes collided in the air. a defence minister resigned because his soldiers failed to fight efficiently. ceos of many multinational companies resigned because their respective companies failed to make profits. on the other hand, in bangladesh no leader takes responsibility and never resigns for the failures and lapses committed by their followers. they rather encourage such wrong doers to commit bigger crimes. we are yet to hear any word of regret or remorse from the two women leaders of these convicted persons, let alone their resignation. the nation was shocked to hear that the standing committee of a political party recently decided to make one such leader the chairperson of the party for life. like master like servants!
rpo and bnp
the nation must have been shocked when begum zia and her party, soon after her release from the sub-jail, stubbornly rejected all the 12 provisions of the rpo without assigning any reason, while the al accepted nearly all the provisions. what does she hope for- to take us back to those dreadful days prior to 1/11? view the page international
