graft-ridden service sector
the picture provided by the survey titled, “service sector corruption: national households survey 2010,” conducted by transparency international bangladesh (tib), is stunning, to say the least. the households surveyed shared their experience of 13 service sectors and the period covered was between june 2009 and may of this year. what is even more disconcerting is that this is only the tip of the iceberg. to paraphrase the comments of the chairman of the anti-corruption commission, this was not the full picture of corruption in the country but only a part, and that prevalence of corruption was more than this survey has revealed.

challenges to police professionalism
law enforcement and order maintenance, the two prime regulatory functions shall, for all time to come, occupy our thoughts and actions. the important question, however, in bangladesh is, will the so-called public order maintenance and political intelligence collection take up most of the time of our police with little left for crime prevention, crime detection and service provision. in other words, how shall we venture to meaningfully contribute to organisational renewal and revitalisation and the nurturing of professional skills?

the eternal giving meaning to the temporal
jesus christ is the incarnation of the eternal word, the mind and the personality of god. the new testament book of hebrews testifies that christ is the radiance of invisible god, and the exact representation of his being. he has supremely revealed god's truth, grace and holiness. in his incarnation, life, teaching, death, resurrection and ascension jesus fully brings the eternal to the temporal, the divine to the mundane.
the star of nativity
stars occupy a very important place in the history of homo sapiens. although whitman claims, “i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars”, people in various ages have always believed in the maxim : “the stars rule men, but god rules the stars”. stars indeed have haunted the imagination of saints and seers from time immemorial. to many, stars have been symbols of high ideals and great hopes. poets have eulogized stars in their poems, patriots have depicted starts on their flags, stars in songs have provided inspiration to the tormented souls of the lovers and the imprisoned.

exotic plantation forest: a green desert?
plantations are done for several reasons including timber and fire wood production, soil and water conservation, and carbon sequestration. the role of plantations for biodiversity acceleration varies considerably depending on whether the original land cover is grassland, shrubland, primary forest, secondary forest, or degraded or exotic pasture, and whether native or exotic tree species are planted. the plantations can support biodiversity when they are established on degraded lands rather than replacing natural ecosystems like forests, grasslands, and shrublands, and when indigenous tree species are used rather than exotic species.

cosmetic heart surgery for more compliance
with the advance in modern science healthcare technology has also improved a lot. a few decades ago medicine was the only remedy of heart diseases of any kind while surgery has been successfully practiced for heart diseases in the last decades. conventionally heart surgery was being done cutting through the breast bone in the middle of the chest. this used to cause complications like infections, bleeding, long lasting pain, long hospital stay and slow recovery to resume job. for most of the patients, especially the young ladies feel really embarrassed with the long cut mark right in the middle of the chest following heart surgery. to mitigate these problems of conventional approach for heart surgery, the cardiac surgeons invented new minimally invasive approach, which is more familiar as cosmetic surgery for most of the cardiac diseases presently.

when media is weapon, perception is target
for the last few decades, iran has been making headlines in global media for its defiant standing against western powers on a number of issues. it is suspected by western powers that iran is running its clandestine nuclear program for military purpose but the us officials are yet to find any solution. they have tried bullying the current conservative regime, spent million dollars to bring about a moderate government, but all these steps brought anything but success. many thought that the issue of imposing sanctions can be discussed in un security council in coming months, but still, iran can sleep well on its expensive and lucrative 'energy' pillow as security council members like china and russia are becoming more dependent on iranian energy. the last resort, military attack on iran, can be too costly for the usa. if you know iran and its unique persian culture, you should better prepare for a united iranian population before launching any kind of attack on their soil. whether it is surgical or otherwise, an air strike will inflame the iranian nationalism and people will rally around the green flag and placards with ahmadinejad's smiling picture. and you can bet, the us generals don't want to see that.

terrorism and how we tackle it
it is heartening to see think tanks in bangladesh examining the issue of terrorism in the country in earnest. much as we consider it unpalatable, we have been caught up in the phenomenon, manifestly, from the day when nearly five hundred ieds were set off almost simultaneously in all but one upazilla of the country in aug 2005. since then the strategic and scholastic community in the country have been engaged in delving into various aspects of the issue. however, very little by way of scholarly work has come off the discourses and discussions.
how do you plan a coup d'etat?
the answer could come in either of two forms. a coup just happens or meticulous planning goes into it. and then, of course, there are the many kinds of coups which have, especially in modern times, put paid to politics proper across the globe. by that you could mean asia, africa and latin america. indeed, there was a time when coups were quite the fashionable thing, with some country or the other going through it through the week or the month. think of 1958 or of 1960. in the former, two coups made noises around the world. there was, in july, the violent overthrow of the monarchy in iraq, with the coup makers led by abdel karim kassem murdering king faisal and his prime minister and humiliating their corpses through having those dragged through the streets. in october, iskandar mirza and ayub khan placed a wobbly pakistan under martial law. not a shot was fired, no one was killed and twenty days after the coup, ayub packed mirza off to exile. but what happened in turkey in 1960 was truly blood-curdling. general kemal gursel, taking a leaf out of kassem's book, overthrew the civilian government and had the top leaders of it murdered.
failure is acceptable, often essential
this book reminds me of kahlil gibran's saying, “if you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.”
divided loyalties, betrayed love
kartography is a book about karachi, the spider plant city where you might find, according to the narrator, fossilized footprints of alexander the great. it is a heartbreaking love story, depicts the ethnic conflict which pervades pakistani society and yet at the same time the resilience of its people. the story revolves around four friends and their lives in karachi during 1971, which they call the 'civil war'. the couples zafar and maheen, yasmin and ali swap their partners. while they handle the situation somehow, it is their children who can't accept the fact that one of their parents had betrayed the other.
