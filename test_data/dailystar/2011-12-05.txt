today's youths are spending their leisure time watching tv, browsing internet, and talking on mobile phones. they have no scope of having some physical exercise. i think the government can build community gyms for the youths, charging a small amount of money from them. private gyms are expensive for many. students cannot afford it. if the government takes the initiative, i am sure many youths will develop the healthy habit of exercising, instead of wasting their time idly. the community gym will encourage many to leave their lethargic life style and become active. in old dhaka, there are a few community gyms and i have witnessed many youths of the locality are using the gym facilities with enthusiasm. the community gyms can create awareness among the youth about the benefits of staying active and it will also help the youth fight against drug addiction.
