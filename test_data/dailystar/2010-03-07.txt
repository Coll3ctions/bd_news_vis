remembering march 7, 1971
when bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman rose to address the huge mass of humanity at the race course on march 7, 1971, he knew full well that what he said there would reverberate around the world, that its ramifications would be greater and wider than one could imagine. there was the simple truth he needed to expound before his people and before the world at large. it was that the pakistani military junta, in cahoots with its political allies, was engaged in trying to repudiate the resounding victory the people had given him and the awami league at the general elections of december 1970. and in light of that conspiracy to deprive the bengali nation of its fair share in the administration of the country, it fell to bangabandhu to define the course the bengali nation would take in the days to come. part of that course had already been indicated by the non-violent non-cooperation movement he had launched earlier in the month to drive home the bengali response to the gathering crisis.
when we crossed the threshold
on march 7, 1971 bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and with him the bengali nation crossed a threshold. if there is any particular point to be cited as a defining moment in the gathering surge for our freedom, it was the oratory that came our way from the undisputed leader who would soon be the founding father of a free bangladesh.
service @ your doorstep
i would like to start by relating a remarkable personal experience in jhenidah. there, for the last two months, farmers have been receiving purchase orders for sugarcane through text messages. i found that 80 percent of them could not read the english message, and 20 percent of them were totally illiterate -- they could not read even bangla. and yet 100 percent of them are able to act on the message since there is the concept of "indirect literacy" in bangladesh. the reason i have brought this up is to respond to a comment that the digital bangladesh vision is quite meaningless when 50 percent of the people can't use a keyboard. i congratulate the principal secretary for explaining the vision where most of the people will not have to use a keyboard. view the page sports

weekly currency roundup
international markets
the euro eased against the dollar on thursday ahead of a european central bank meeting but retained some support as investors encouraged by greece's latest austerity measures cut some of their record short positions in the single currency. the euro was dragged down by its fall against the yen as short-term players sold higher-yielding currencies after asian stocks faltered and prompted investors to trim riskier positions, traders said. that move also pushed the dollar to a three-month low against the yen. the ecb is expected to hold interest rates at a record low of 1.0 percent and outline the next steps in its gradual withdrawal from emergency lending measures. the market focus will be on whether it announces any change to the extra liquidity it has provided for the banking system, and traders will also be listening to ecb president jean-claude trichet's remarks on greece. greece announced plans for a further $6.5 billion in pay cuts and tax hikes on wednesday to reduce its deficit easing worries about its debt crisis and helping the 10-year greece-germany debt spread narrow to its lowest since mid-february. but sentiment remains fragile as investors are unsure if the package will be enough to generate additional support from bigger european union members such as germany and france. the boe is expected to keep rates unchanged, but there have been indications it is leaving the door open to more quantitative easing. any move to expand its asset purchases could lead to the pound tumbling again, traders said. the dollar has come under pressure versus the yen on the back of comments from federal reserve officials that interest rates in the us will stay low for a long time.

dismal picture
i get shocked every time i hear something unpleasant about my country. dhaka has been identified as the worst liveable city in the world by “the economist”.
student politics
the most inspired and dynamic segment of the country's population is the student community of bangladeshi universities. the formative period of a student's life should be utilized for an all round balanced development of his/her personality. political experience constitutes an essential part of this learning process. this period prepares one to face the challenges better and enables one to succeed in life. the much hyped cloudy and aggressive nature of students who are directly involved in politics has the potential to instil qualities like general awareness, knowing and learning the current events and occurrences etc. therefore, political education or training during student life is important for success in life.
us policy on iran
the us administration is in a new wave of diplomatic effort to isolate iran internationally to impose “crippling” sanction. the reason - not conforming to us demand and proceed with uranium enrichment.
leaders in parliament
the behaviour of our leaders in parliament is a testament to how far removed from reality they are. their tit-for-tat mentality and unbelievably nauseating conduct has reduced parliament to functioning as a playground where an oblivious group of sickening demagogues exchange vulgar spats in an attempt to satisfy their bloated egos, all in the name of “din badaler rajniti”. how, ultimately, are the people going to bed on an empty stomach most days of the week going to benefit from the name-change of zia? how is their fatigue going to be diminished by speaker's abdul hamid's cheerful reminder to minister shafique ahmed to place a bill raising mps' perks? how did the 600 percent increase of lawmakers' perks in 2003 help the impoverished people of our country in any way?
naming an institution
most dailies on february 9 reported about renaming of our only international airport at dhaka. we should calmly and logically look at the issue, and in the fitness of things, analyse the background and history, and the hidden implications of the matter dispassionately. using names of military and political leaders for any place should be avoided. if they are worth their salt; their names will naturally come into the history of the country automatically, after proper interval, two or three decades hence by virtue of their thoughts, words and deeds.
talk shows
the first question is, we are watching talk show after talk show on the recent events of students' deaths in three major universities. the participants are mostly political leaders, ex-student leaders, academics, so called members of the civil society. now my question is: why are the members of the ordinary student community not related to "lezur britty' student politics not invited to the talk shows ? the girl students who are a most vulnerable group affected by the university student politics can be invited in the talk shows. similarly, the guardians and parents should be invited to tell their side of the story.
food adulteration
food and drink poisoning is a foremost problem of modern age. it is related to dirty kitchen appliances, adulterated food, unhygienic and unsafe drink etc. the mobile court ordinance 2007 under section 5(1) was enforced all over the country but it mission started about six years ago. the inspection result is a grave signal for us. almost every inspected product was found to be impure.
commenting on the dead
the almighty has verily declared in the holy quran that all living beings shall have the taste of death.
after one year…
after one year of democracy, we believed that both the ruling party and the opposition would play a vital role to further strengthen it. but now both the parties are playing a foul game to demolish the country's image. already, foreign donors are frustrated, that is obviously bad for a nation which depends on foreign help. we know that this trend will increase terrorism, instability etc.
foreign direct investment
foreign direct investment (fdi) is very important for economic development of a country. it denotes the features of trade and investment in the globalised world. it denotes the connectivity and trade relation in the global arena. in the recent past, the trend of fdi was upward. the volume of fdi is comparatively low and not satisfactory. it is unknown why it is going down.
ban on student politics
in the last few weeks students politics has shown it's ugliest face. now it is an urgent need to ban student politics. a teacher of dhaka university wrote on reshaping it. but i think that it will be no more a solution. it will only create new dilemmas.
name game
the government renamed the zia int'l airport. issues related with naming and renaming are hardly apparent round the globe. unfortunately, we have been watching these sorts of phenomena since the very beginning.
ban on religion-based parties
recently, the high court has scrapped the fifth amendment in our constitution, and because of this, it is likely that religion-based parties will be banned from politics. the 14-party grand alliance is also planning to launch a campaign to ban religion-based parties.
advisers
a few days back, i read about some bangladeshi adviser, apparently an adviser to prime minister, sheikh hasina, speaking about huge returns that bangladeshis can reap investing in bangladesh. unfortunately, based on my experience, these advisers cannot be relied on. people would trust them and invest in some savings in bangladesh. when their funds get mature and they want to get their return, all hell breaks loose.
abed conferred knighthood
almost all bangladeshis in the uk i have recently spoken to are happy and proud of the news of brac world's largest ngo) founder and chairperson fazle hasan abed's knighthood.
committing the same mistake!
according to the article 11 of the constitution, all power of the state belongs to the people. it certainly does. that's why we elect them as parliament members to represent us. what do they do? everyone is watching them quarrelling with each other in parliament. it is not their fault to act like that.
priorities of grand alliance government
