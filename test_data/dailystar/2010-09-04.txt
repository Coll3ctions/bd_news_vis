is there a risk of judicial over-reach?
the court's decisions to nullify the 5th and 7th amendments have been received with understandable celebratory enthusiasm in the country. i wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments of the court, and personally believe that the military has absolutely no right to usurp political power and impose its arbitrary rule on the people. the court's stern admonishment to previous military regimes, and its acknowledgement that some of the decisions and undertakings of those governments may be liable to criminal prosecution, should send a clear cautionary warning to future military authorities who may covet state power. in this regard, the intentions of the court are commendable, and its posture laudatory. but, the situation becomes a bit problematic if one considers its implications. it may be entirely possible to argue that these judgments, by blurring the distinction between the political and the constitutional, indicate a judicial over-reach of rather spectacular proportions that may, ultimately, jeopardize the very democratic and constitutional principles it seeks to protect.

tiger conservation in bangladesh
tiger, symbol of the beast and beauty, is a threatened species worldwide. recent estimate shows that tigers only occupy 7% of their historic asian range and about 4000 are left in the wild (dinerstein et al. 2007). aside from this alarming tiger status worldwide, bangladesh possesses a relatively good number of them, mostly concentrated in the sundarbans. joint india and bangladesh tiger census-2004 (using pugmark counting) estimated that there are 419 (121 male and 298 female) tigers in bangladesh sundarbans. the number may vary, as many scientists are sceptical about the accuracy of pugmark counting. however, it is beyond doubt that the size of the tiger population in the bangladesh sundarbans would be between 300-500. being the biggest member of the cat family the bengal tiger is popularly known as royal bengal tiger (panthera tigris tigris) for its unique hunting behaviour and spectacular physical appearance.

of lights going out, of cherry trees . . .
a friend writes about mozart. it is his birthday, she tells me. yes, i remember. i remember too the chaos in which this pre-eminent of composers was buried by his friends. he died young and poor, almost bereft of everything beautiful that life could offer him. having spent a lifetime, albeit a brief one, showering happiness on the world through his music, it was his fate to be thrown hastily into his grave because a storm threatened to disrupt the last rites. you could say his remains were swiftly deposited in the grave, in unseemly manner. and then his friends moved off.
the desire to hear . . .
looking at the azure-whitish canvas of the skies heralding the season of autumn, one feels crispness in the air subduing the wetness of monsoon, sunlight staying young more or less for the whole day. then there appears, rather unconsciously in her, an assemblage of emotions evoking the past, relating to the present and looking forward to the future. not that they all appear at one and the same time, but in the cubicles of her heart they take their turn, oftentimes overlapping. as she ponders, one thing becomes obvious to her --- that in this mental state of hers, she feels a strong desire to hear some sounds, some voices, some music emanating from nature, some others from human voices. she is afraid that since her auditory sense is deprived of much of its yearnings, those in the passage of time could be obliterated.

myanmar - shifting to military democracy?
the military leaders of myanmar through a brief radio broadcast have announced elections to the parliament on november 7th. political parties have been given time till the end of the month to submit their list of candidates. earlier, the military regime had tactfully ensured that nobel laureate aung saan suu kyi was kept out of the contest by extending her house arrest till november 2010. to the regime's satisfaction, the extension led aung's national democratic league (nld) to decide against registering for the elections that resulted in the party being banned. the nld opted against registering to give the international community the clear message that the next elections would be anything but a new strategy to entrench the power of the military.

principles, grit and communism
for much of his journalistic career, edgar snow was shunned by mainstream america. the reason was simple. he had befriended the chinese communists long before mao and his men made their way to power in peking and had indeed afterward continued his association with them. this was the era of the cold war; and with joseph mccarthy in mad pursuit of what he called communists and communist sympathisers in the united states, it was only natural that snow would come under suspicion. the writer could not, of course, be nailed. but the hostility prevailed, all the way up to his death in february 1972. in one of the great ironies of history, the very communists snow had eulogised over the years in works such as the one under review were now the same communists richard nixon was meeting in peking.
extraordinary, like zorba the greek
in mehrdad baladi's disturbing novel, houri, there's a brief moment at the beginning that is emblematic of much of the subsequent story. as the narrator returns to his native iran and the airplane enters iranian airspace, “flight attendants hurried to remove wine and whisky from trays. men rushed to rinse the stink of alcohol from their breath. women donned dark hejabs to hide their hair and curves, scrubbed makeup from their faces. passengers were bracing for an inquisition, or something worse. even from thousands of feet above, and an hour before the plane landed, i caught a sense of the intolerant terrain waiting below.”
