extra-judicial killings
the chairman of the national human rights commission makes a valid point. if indeed the security forces have had to act to defend themselves in crossfires and in the process shoot alleged criminals dead, there must be ways of validating such claims. professor mizanur rahman has suggested --- and one cannot but agree with him --- that only the judiciary can determine if the principle of self-defence is a cause for law enforcers to kill their would-be assailants in extra-judicial manner. no one argues that in a skirmish where the rapid action battalion and the police must defend themselves from criminal elements, they will do all they can to save themselves.
unstable edible oil market
the skyrocketing cooking oil price has dealt another blow to the consumer public. faced with losses as they are bound by the government-fixed price tag on the bottled cooking oil, refiners have slashed their supply substantially, thereby leaving the market at the mercy of the middlemen, who have taken full advantage of the situation to charge the customers unfairly. on this score, the refiners' point that the upward trend of oil price in the international market is behind their quandary cannot be dismissed out of hand. but what fails our understanding is why the government has been simply looking on while the crisis in the cooking oil market was going from bad to worse? and if the refiners' contention is grounded in fact, why hasn't it taken apt measures to offset the instability in the market or even revise the price of bottled oil in keeping with the international market as well as with the consumers' and the refiners' interests? view the page sports

control environment pollution
this refers to your correspondent's report, published on january 26th. example. we hope such actions are taken by the department of environment on a regular basis. the fine imposed on ehsan steel mills at charpatherghata, in chittagong is a good example! however the time frame of only 25 days, given for installing proper pollution prevention equipment is too little and unrealistic.
it's a great sight!
the 5 column photograph of cattle egrets (a dash of white in a concrete city) published in the front page of the daily star were quite interesting. i live by the side of gulshan-banani lake on its southern side in south gulshan. i have been watching with lot of interests that a big flock of the white birds flying up and down the length of the longish lake for the last couple of weeks. sometimes they descend on the thick carpet of green hyacinths for food. the lake is terribly polluted, particularly during winter when the water-table falls. good that the birds don't mind the pollution and search for food in the water hyacinths! it is a beautiful sight when the flock of white cattle egrets flies along the lake. even in this bustling and overpopulated city with its myriads of problems it is a wonder and we are lucky to get a glimpse of nature! one good thing- when the birds descend children don't throw stones but quietly watch.
my votes for musa and sir frank

pay salam properly, please!
in the islamic culture when two muslims, either known or total strangers to each other meet, they offer greetings by saying “assalamu alaikum” which in english means “peace be with you”. the one who pay salam first is said to be in a better position. answering the salam by the one who receive it is obligatory. the answer is “wa alaikum assalam” (and upon you be peace). i have noticed with regrets that some of us while paying or answering one's salam do not maintain the proper norm, simply say “wa alaikum”. but this should not be done. salam should be offered and answered in the way as has been asked by the almighty. allah orders in the holy qur'an: “when a greeting is offered to you, answer it with an even better greeting, or (at least) with its like. allah keeps count of all things.” [surah an-nur: 4:86]
press is powerful in bangladesh
people are the ultimate judge to give verdict about success or failures of a government. although a third world country, bangladesh is far better than many developing countries in case of free access of information. here the newspapers, private tv, periodicals, weeklies are abundant. the writers of those print media are freely writing their views in those papers without any fear. this situation is good for establishing democracy. as a citizen i am proud of my country. in fact print media in bangladesh is very powerful. i believe the first pre-requisite of democracy is "free press”. the free press has more responsibilities to deliver correct information to the people. confusing news from media create unnecessary rifts among the friends living abroad and to people at home. so they should play major role in bringing democracy in the country.

governments' double standards
are we ready for a major earthquake mentally and logistically? i'm sure most of the people will die a sinner, if earthquake strike them off guard. the moment a man visits an erotic site, give full play of his libido and become all engrossed in the rat race of materialism, he negates the omnipresence of god. today's earthquake that i felt while sitting with my friends in the drawing room will remain the reminder of the almighty allah from whom comes everything. i was wondering what will happen to those who wants to destroy a huge bread basket to make room for a huge unnecessary high cost airport at a time when the black clouds of price hike is looming in the horizon. what will happen to those who feel no compunction about indicting a person like sirajuzul islam chowdhury for the unrest on arial beel. when it is the government that should be indicted for a stupid airport plan on arial beel and the resultant unrest and deaths, now it is the government itself that is playing the role of a double villain by victimizing the victims.
