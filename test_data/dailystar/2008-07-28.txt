floods around the corner
we believe, given the latest information, the flood situation seems to be unfolding rather rapidly in the country. we should face the facts squarely that large areas under netrakona, pabna, rangpur, faridpur and khulna districts are getting inundated as water level of the padma, the jamuna and the teesta is rising steadily. already 10,000 people have been affected in faridpur and hundreds of acres of cropland have gone under water. in khulna district a number of embankments have been washed away by floodwater thereby rendering hundreds of people homeless.
a useful scheme at risk
the grim prospect of seeing the community schools closing down entirely is becoming a reality. already such schools in 10 districts have been unofficially closed. and the reason is that the teachers are no longer able to make both ends meet with the paltry sum that they get as pay. one is at a loss to understand how such a meagre amount of tk1200 was determined as their monthly pay in the first place? the pattern would appear even more ridiculous when one considers that tk. 500 was the pay of these teachers almost a decade ago, and increased to the current level of 1200 from tk 750 in 2007.

the headmaster of a school for scandal

price hike and poor management
the majority of people of our country are very poor. their living standards and lifestyles are of very poor quality due to low income, under employment and unemployment. the ever increasing price hike of commodities has affected the lower, middle and fixed income groups, severely aggravated their condition and prolonged their indescribable sufferings and pangs from starvation. the prices of foods and other essentials have more than doubled in a year and gone beyond the purchasing capacity and affordability of the majority of the people. the people are to spend more than 70 percent of their daily income only for food purchase. the sky-rocketing prices of essentials have pushed about 60 percent people of the country under the poverty line. eight lakh school teachers have demanded food rationing. the school-going children are seen standing in the long queues of bdr run shops during school time. we cannot forget the mad rush of the poor people to the bdr run shops from the early morning to buy rice at reasonable price. the exorbitant increase in prices of commodities has resulted in reduction of daily calorie intake and of baby food consumption, ingestion of sub-standard foods and starvation in the extremely poor families are causing serious malnutrition and ill-health. the bulk of the people are struggling to enhance their purchasing capacity and affordability to cope with the prices of foods and other essentials.

car owners' predicament
recently, i went for my car fitness certificate renewal (previously done by others). while the present government is trying to simplify the service sector, the brtc is unreasonably complicating the process. first, i filled up three pages of brtc deposit book of tk.445 (45 for label sticker) for depositing to local gulshan p.o. after about half an hour in queue, i deposited tk.445 and the man at the counter wrote another set of receipts and returned one copy of this receipt + 2 copies of brtc book. then i went to the brtc office in mirpur at about 11-30am, again after half an hour they gave an application form (why?) to fill in and told me to give the photocopies of current tax token and the previous year's chalan deposit (both are already in their file) + tin certificate. (i had). finally, the car was inspected in 5 minutes and i got the certificate without a sticker label (but a rubber stamping- no label was issued though tk 45 had been deposited) at about 2-30pm i.e. after 3 hours.
