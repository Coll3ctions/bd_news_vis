the world that yunus would build
in a world which often bemoans the paucity of visionaries in our times, muhammad yunus comes across as one who can and does peer into the future. in his recent address to the indian parliament, which has demonstrated its unqualified respect for him by inviting him to speak before it, the nobel laureate has spelt out his vision of the future in what is clearly a bold and unambiguous manner. the boldness stems from his projection of a south asian union by 2030. on the face of it, and given the trend toward political unity in such regions as europe and south east asia, there is little that could be considered new in yunus' suggestions. and yet for a region which remains stymied by crises of a multifaceted sort (think of all the bilateral and other issues which have held up regional cooperation for years), yunus' vision of a single, purposeful south asia is an expression of the courage one expects men of vision to demonstrate before the multitudes.

dealing with traffic
i am sure we all have heard a lot on this topic and many of us are constantly thinking and coming up with ways to improve our traffic system. surely, we as individuals can only do our part in terms of changing our behaviours and always by obeying traffic laws. meanwhile i feel that we must utilize our roads in the best possible manner. we can in the short term: 1. make marked lanes on every main road and punish vigorously those who disobey traffic laws with very high fines. 2. make turn lanes at every intersection. 3. absolutely ensure that busses do not stop anywhere on the road except at bus stops and surely make specific bus stops first. 3. let the main roads run by automatic signal lights except in times of emergency when a traffic police officer can guide the traffic. 4. make sure that no traffic officer ever encourages any vehicle to “go” on red and “stop” on green. this practice is systematically ruining our habits even those of us who are willing to obey the laws. 5. make sidewalks free of illegal occupation and available for pedestrians. (this one step can reduce the traffic jams significantly throughout the city) 6. punish, severely those who do not use the foot over bridge (where available) 7. build fences around all major roads to separate the road and the sidewalk. there should be designated crossings where people will be allowed to cross the roads. 8. the dividers of the main roads must be high enough so that people cannot jump over it. 9. buses must be made to move mostly on the left most lanes whenever possible. 10. the immediate step: take rickshaws off the main roads.

politics
everything happening around us has something to do with politics. in consideration of this, it is essential to set up different age-levels of curriculum in political education during the course of compulsory education. likewise in life-long education, it is important to provide adults with some opportunities to learn the rules of democracy, for it is not desirable in an educational setting that democratic rights might recede for the next generation to come. it will be difficult to achieve equality between women and men as long as politicians and bureaucrats without gender sensitivity perspectives occupy influential positions.

immigrant women workers
a joint research report of undp & a private organisation portrays that the women workers abroad find themselves in a very miserable and pathetic condition. according to that research report, approximately 1,00000 immigrant female workers are working in foreign countries mostly in the middle east to support their families. they work there as domestic helper. but it is an issue of great concern that most of them, to be exact 85% of domestic workers, are the victims of physical torture & oppression by their employers. moreover, 20% of them are being harassed sexually. as they are unaware of the labour law they are being tormented by the employers. they do not get any legal protection there. therefore, they are compelled to bear with the oppression. apart from this, the recruiting agency or the brokers through whom they go abroad as 'domestic helper' are not sending them under any written contract.

dst scheme
