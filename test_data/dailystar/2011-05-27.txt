unutilised aid money
slow pace of project implementation and return of the unutilised fund to its source is a very familiar feature of the annual development programme (adp) every year. the scenario is not different even in the case of foreign aid. and as a result, billions of dollar worth of scarce as well as precious foreign aid has created a pipeline bulge. this is not just a sad commentary on the project implementation agency's capacity to absorb foreign aid, it does also give a rather negative image of the government.
post-aila conditions

decentralization is a must
traffic congestion has become a common issue in the city life especially in dhaka. government is planning to construct more flyovers throughout the city but i just wonder why decentralization remains out of discussion? from all parts of the country people are coming to dhaka for survival, as most of the important offices, institutes, universities, and garment industries are still getting built here. dhaka city suffers from pervading water pollution, air pollution, accommodation crisis, electricity crisis and what not, but who cares about decentralizing people or institutions? without the eradication of the source of all these problems, how long can you protect this city?
industrial pollution-why should i care?
industries and factories have been polluting the water bodies in and around dhaka city for the longest time. it is clear that protecting the environment is not one of the top priorities. i am not even surprised. we, even me, pollute our cities with trashes. so how will the owners of these factories, with hardly any education be conscious about the environment, feel the need to protect the environment? the long term benefits are invisible, but short term gain in cash is not. it is up to us, maybe the government, to make sure that people with money and power realize the need for a cleaner bangladesh. after the digital bangladesh plan, we should initiate a clean bangladesh plan.

houses for the poor
every year due to cyclone, heavy rain, tornado and flood millions of huts, bamboo/tin shed houses get damaged, blown off, and destroyed; thus the poor become poorer. our land and housing developers are constructing hundreds of flats/buildings one after another for the rich people. the present cost of a house/flat in dhaka ranges from taka 75 lakh to 1 crore and above. do the middle class and poor people afford to purchase a house/flat in dhaka? why don't our public and private sectors come forward to build low cost houses/flats for the middle class and lower class people? why doesn't our government seek financial help/loan from saudi arabia, kuwait, adp and world bank to mitigate the sufferings of our poor people?
portable gen-set as dowry!
this interesting news item from patna in india was published in the pages of a local english daily on may 18th. it adds a new twist to the saga of dowry demands; common in india! usually these demands are for cash, land, furniture and often bi-cycle, motor-cycles or may be even a car depending on the wealth of the prospective bride's household! portable gen-sets are a new item in the menu of dower demands claimed by the groom's parents, in power starved state of bihar in india!
who can go to the court?
i am really surprised to read the news in the daily star dated may 6, under the heading "yunus removal upheld by sc" that "dr kamal said they still don't know on which grounds yunus' petition was rejected." he also said, “any citizen has the right to move to the independent judiciary for remedy, if his basic rights are violated. but the high court in its judgment said prof muhammad yunus has no right to come to the court,” i would like to ask our honourable judges what are the qualifications needed to enter the court?what are the disqualifications of prof. yunus? is it because he is not a sycophant of hasina or he has not looted money from the share market or is it because he is a nobel laureate who has lifted the image of bangladesh? please note that these are my questions and do not put me in jail (considering these queries as contempt of court), because as a citizen of the country i need to know whether i have the sufficient qualifications to go to the court.
using the riches of sylhet
the limited natural resources that bangladesh is endowed with, lies mostly in the sylhet region. such as natural gas, tea garden, woods of rain forests, and abundant sweet water in beels and haors that we hardly get together in any part of bangladesh. also a large number of people who have migrated to the u .k. and the u.s.a are contributing greatly to our economy by sending remittances. even the newly elected bangladeshi origin british mp rosnara ali and us congressman hashem clarke are from sylhet. but the rate of illiteracy, the growth rate of population is very high here. the gap between poor and rich is extremely wide. the madrassas are more in numbers which produce youths incapable of doing anything except religious rituals. the expatriates built houses which remain empty all the year. the govt. with the help of expatriates should take massive development plans for overall development of the region.
ignoring facts for beauty!
i remember that about a month ago in star lifestyle, an article stated five reasons why people shouldn't use botox. i read that article and the reasons seemed very appropriate and convincing. but to my surprise, despite the facts of the article i noticed all sorts of media doing eye-catching and influencing advertisements on the same beauty cream, giving reasons why it should be used. now my question is that why this cream is not discontinued even after the solid proof that it is not suitable for use? and why is the media helping this product to increase sales, risking the results on the customers after using this cream?
diplomatic immunity
the arrest of the erstwhile imf chief in new york for criminal charges shows that there is no diplomatic immunity in western countries for institutions like wb, imf or un bodies. this brings to mind various demands (a few years back) by such bodies for diplomatic immunity in developing countries including bangladesh. no matter how much carrot is dangled before us in the name of development aid, we should give no diplomatic immunity to such organisations unless it is accepted worldwide as under the geneva convention.
fact check
misinformation has been a primary tool to mislead people by many. when it is used for political gains, i believe it is the duty of the media to point it out in the form of 'fact check'. it is routinely done in the media of western countries. i urge the media in bangladesh both print and electronic to do the same.
the right expression
''i love you more than my soul''-- the line is presently used at random. instead, we may use ''i love you more than i can say'' for our beloved ones. but the sentence 'i love you more than my soul' can be used only for allah, the creator, as well as his dearest rasul (sm).once hazrat omar faruk (r), the second caliph of islam, said to our dearest rasul (sm), ''ya rasulallah! i love you very much, but not more than my soul.'' then our dearest rasul (sm) said, ''omar, you are yet to be a perfect 'mumin' (faithful).'' then hazrat omar (r) said, ''ya rasulallah! now i love you more than my soul.''and our dearest rasul (sm) declared, ''o omar! you are now a perfect 'mumin'." all of us should realise this.

ban the use of brick crushing machine
almost about 4 years ago, when the apartment building where we live in was being built by a developer, i as one of the owners of the land insisted not to use the brick crushing machine, as it not only creates sound pollution but environmental pollution as well, to which the developer obliged even after bearing additional expenses for the job.
kahns departure - a loss
the arrest of imf chief dominique strauss-kahn on attempted rape and assault charges in new york on saturday had the effect of a bombshell in france. kahn was widely expected to resign from his post at the imf and run for the french presidential poll in 2012. his arrest put an end to a brilliant career as an economist and a politician. mr. strauss-kahn's downfall comes at an opportune time for the french right and extreme right. never has president sarkozy been so low in the polls. kahn was the politician who would have been acceptable to france's centre-right.
