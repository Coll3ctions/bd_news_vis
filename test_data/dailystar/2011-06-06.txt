unauthorised sawmills
the observance of world environment day in bangladesh yesterday could not have been a cheering exercise. with the country now home to only 10 per cent of forests where the global required standard is 25 per cent, it is time to ask why we have consistently failed to roll back the damage systematically being done to our environment. part of the answer comes from reports of a blatant, illegal felling of trees in what is officially known as the sakhipur reserve forests in the madhupur region. over the last two and a half years, no fewer than 52 sawmills have been set up illegally, and with the full knowledge of the authorities, in the area. that is a shame. the bigger shame, though, is that the department of forests seems powerless to do anything about it since ruling party people are allegedly involved in the illegal business. view the page sports

health policy 2011 and role of media
i am happy to see the present government's ambitious health policy. the headline news (the daily star; 31-05-2011) indicated that the government's emphasis is to serve our poor; satisfactorily! this is ambitious because several new agenda have been included. these are: i) stopping private practice of gob employed doctors, ii) inclusion of homeopathy, ayurbedi & unani medicines among gob health service providers, & iii) inclusion of health insurance in both public & private sectors. as it has been approved without the consensus of major service providers, meaning mbbs doctors' organizations as well as the corporate committees who will have to spend money for their employees, in the form of insurance; government should be aware of possible hindrance.
resolve the limon crisis
the prime minister's defense adviser tarique ahmed siddique recently told that he was 100% sure that rab shot limon as he attempted to run away at the time of operation to arrest jamadder, a local accused. he also said limon and his father are members of a criminal gang and a conspiracy was being hatched to disband rab. then sahara khatun, the state minister, confirmed that he (tarique siddique) expressed the government's position. it is worthwhile to note that the state minister a few days ago said that she had nothing to do with limon. finally, rab's director general opined, “limon is a young boy, not a notorious criminal. he just became a victim of the incident.” according to the newspapers, two cases were filed against limon. he was accused of illegally possessing arms and of obstructing law enforcement agencies in discharging their duties. he was also recorded as being 25-year-old, but actually he was 16. the probe committee had not been able to find any evidence that indicates limon as a criminal.we hope that the pm will personally handle the issue and give directives to the concerned to resolve the crisis.
anniversary of nimtoli tragedy
one year has just passed on june 3, 2011 since the devastating inferno that caused colossal damages to property and loss of innumerable human lives. it was detected that the warehouses that stored inflammable chemicals were solely responsible for this tragedy, and the govt. assured that those storage facilities will be shifted immediately to elsewhere so that these kinds of gruesome incidents never occur again. but it is sad to notice that despite the prime minister's interventions, promises of the concerned minister and other authorities, the chemical stores still remain in the same place. i wonder why nothing materializes in our country despite instructions, promises made by the superior authorities.
bnp's hartal
