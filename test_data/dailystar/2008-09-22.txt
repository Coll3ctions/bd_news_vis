chaotic traffic
who would want to sit inside a vehicle stuck in the middle of the road for 2-3 hours in the burning hot sun with the noise and pollution everywhere?
food and water
irrigation, which consumes far more water than any other activity, has generated enormous benefits. by helping to raise farmers' yields and stabilising food production and prices, irrigation has been key to achieving food security in many parts of the world. about 250 million hectares are irrigated worldwide today. yet, inappropriate water and agricultural policies and poor irrigation management have lowered groundwater tables, damaged soils, and reduced water quality. moreover, growing populations with rising incomes will further increase the demand for irrigation water to meet food needs. although the domestic and industrial sectors use far less water than agriculture, water consumption in these sectors is also growing rapidly. and the importance of reserving water for environmental purposes has only recently been recognised: during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands were lost. even as demand for water by all users grows, groundwater is being depleted, other water ecosystems are becoming polluted and degraded, and developing new sources of water is getting more costly. many people are concerned that water will be the main obstacle to growing enough food in the coming decades. the strategies for national governments, international donors, and water users for the ensuring food production through proper use of water are-
the icl controversy
on september 14, 2008, the report showing the controversy regarding some of the players from the bangladesh cricket team and the icl caught my attention. “selfish, and ungrateful…”- these were the only words that came to my mind when i first heard the news of the so-called talented and promising bangladeshi cricketers joining the icl.
population boom
i refer to the excellent pcp article by gen moeen u ahmed on food security in the country where he touched on the issue of population boom and consequent problems. he has also emphasised that this is really the key issue because if the population cannot be held in check, no attempt to improve the lot of the nation will produce any results, rather the situation will get worse and worse. he mentioned that population of 70 million in 1971 has now increased to 150 million and is likely to reach 210 million in a few years with consequent loss of cultivable land for food.

a national election would lead our country back to the dark era for three major reasons:
rights of women
over a single incident at baufal, reported in the daily star of 13th august, 2008, bangladesh mahila parishad has demanded of the government to introduce another new law to punish the husbands, though such laws have already been enacted for our justice dispensation system. even then we welcome their proposals, but should it be again another one-sided law like that of the law for prevention of repression against women and children? a law has to be just, equitable and must be applicable to both sexes in equal terms. are all the women angels and do they not commit crimes against men, other women and in particular their husbands?
errors in hsc english textbook
there are many questions about the appropriateness of the methodology used in writing the textbook prescribed by the national curriculum & textbook board (nctb) for class-11. it's not been possible to carry out the objectives of the book due to the lack of an empirical approach to the problem of language teaching and learning in the perspective of our country. the textbook intended for the intermediate first year students contains some inadvertent irregularities, which need to be corrected immediately:
poisoned milk
the current milk scandal in china is not only a dangerous problem for that country, as thousands of children are suffering and three of them have already died, this is a problem for us also in bangladesh. the trouble started when the manufacturers began to use the banned chemical, normally used in plastics, to water down milk to make it appear richer in protein.
army chief's article
it is interesting to read the article on comprehensive plan for food security by a man who is definitely busy with many other preoccupations. in the recent past we have seen him participating in some agri-related programmes where with the assistance of army units farmers have done commendable jobs. this shows his interest in this sector. gen. moin u ahmed's article dealt in detail with the problems and prospects of food security in the country.
bnp's structure
the decision by bnp standing committee to make khaleda president for life was a blow to democracy. it also undermined the efforts of the current government to end the dictatorial culture within the political parties in bangladesh.
