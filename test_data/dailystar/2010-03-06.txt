enemies of democracy, especially of the parliamentary form, must have had their biggest laugh last wednesday. if they wanted to stage something extremely insulting to the highest law making body and the supreme symbol of the people's power and the nation's sovereignty, they could not have done anything better than what a section of lawmakers did three days ago.

80,000 unfit cars?
it defies logic as to how nearly 80,000 cars continue to ply city roads with expired fitness certificates contributing immensely to the perennial traffic congestions. the statistics have been collected by the communications minister syed abul hossain from the bangladesh road transport authorities (brta) and placed before parliament on wednesday. the minister has revealed that brta has two mobile courts led by two executive magistrates taking action against vehicles running without fitness certificates. but the reality is that there is clear lack of coordination between brta and the authorities responsible for traffic management. therefore, if the relevant government agencies cannot rise above their petty differences and vested interests, and if magisterial actions are not effectively supported by strict imposition of rules, no qualitative change can come about on the roads.

climate refugees: the bangladesh case
concern over anticipated sea-level rise (slr) associated with global climate change has received wide attention of bangladeshi climate specialists and related scientists, concerned citizens, politicians, and the print and electronic media. it is now widely accepted in the country that bangladesh faces grave challenges from impacts associated with climate change. according to the world development report 2010, about 18% of bangladesh's land will be submerged if the sea level rises by one meter. should this occur, it will result in the displacement of almost 30 million people. bangladesh government has few available resources to deal with this huge number of displaced people, or the so-called climate refugees. not surprisingly the government has been seeking the cooperation of wealthy nations in relocation planning for those likely to be displaced.
coal-fired thermal power plants: some questions
of course energy deficiency is one of the biggest problems and challenges for bangladesh. about 90% of our power plants are natural gas fueled. as we have limited natural resources to generate electricity in conventional ways, we have to look for the alternatives. it will not be a wise decision to plan and install any more natural gas based thermal unit at this stage. so a few other alternatives that come in view are coal or oil based plants, nuclear power plants, hydro units and renewable energy sources i.e. solar, wind, biomass, etc.

the enchanted baroque
ayat stood motionless on the balcony to feel the time and space of a fresh day. the quiet dawn still held on to the remnants of night. the cool air caressed her face, the pleasure made her shiver slightly. she closed her eyes while listening to the azan; one note but unsynchronized, the timing was a bit off for each call, yet together it formed a single whole - one message. that is what she loved about this city too, always chaotic, yet life fell in a rhythm. today she heard another tune, raag bhairav. somewhere close someone was greeting the god of dawn on a different note! however much she tried to separate the two she could not. it was an amazing blend. she opened her eyes. the mist over the lake just hung there.
an unforgettable boat ride
1955 was a memorable year. it was the year of the great flood. our home was one of the few dwellings in the entire village which did not go under water. our 'bangla-bari' --- an outer house detached from the main complex and used for a variety of purposes, including accommodation of a live-in school teacher --- was brimming with people who were given refuge. the temporary residents were villagers whose association with our family was forged over several generations. the communal camaraderie helped to alleviate their suffering. they waited patiently for nature to run its course; their homes lay submerged under water, with perhaps just the rooftops sticking out their heads in a show of determined defiance.

bangladesh perspective
bangladesh, lying between the himalayas in the north and the bay of bengal in the south, offers the only land route connecting south and southeast asia. any invasion into south asia from the east must pass through bangladesh; the japanese tried to do just that in the world war ii. the british colonization of india also started from bengal when the bay of bengal became the point of ingress. bangladesh's close proximity to both india and china, two rising power in the 21st century, adds to its geographic importance.

good soldier, better politician, charming lover
julius caesar disregarded warnings about the ides of march. he believed, as shakespeare would have us know, that he was more dangerous than danger itself. that precisely is what he told his wife calpurnia when she tried to dissuade him from going to the senate because of the nightmares she had gone through during the preceding night. as he approached the senate, he came across the man who had warned him of the ides of march. 'the ides of march are come', said caesar, almost in a triumphant vein. 'aye, caesar, but not gone', replied the soothsayer. on his way to the senate, caesar was handed a scroll by the scholar artemidorus, who apparently had some inkling of the plot against him. the dictator did not deign to read it. moments later, he was dead at the foot of pompey's statue inside the senate building. there were twenty three stab marks on his body. the last one, made by brutus, was in his groin.
