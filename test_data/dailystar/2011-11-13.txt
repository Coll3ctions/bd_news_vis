addu summit reinforces saarc idea
the just concluded saarc summit in the maldives acquires a degree of significance for what the organisation plans on doing in the immediate future. the public perception that saarc may have lost some of its steam, owing to reasons both internal and external, has been there for quite a while. in an important sense, events in south asia have largely seemed to pass it by, with the result that member-states have all too often fallen back on bilateral links to develop their ties. even so, the fact that saarc has been instrumental in forging closer links among the states of the region can hardly be denied. with afghanistan taking its place in the body sometime ago and with talk of turkey being given observer status, it is obvious that saarc retains the potential to play a vital role in the region.
