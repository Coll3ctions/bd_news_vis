sirajganj is one of the natural disaster prone areas in bangladesh which is affected by flood every year. the greater parts of this district are dominated by alluvial plains with numerous stream channels. the main rivers are the jamuna and the karatoa. during the monsoon heavy rainfall occurs in the upstream area. rainfall run- off from this vast area coupled with snowmelt brings a huge inflow of water with higher percentage of sediment. during the receding monsoon period, between september to october, heavy siltation takes place in the beds of the jamuna and its tributaries. in this region the main cause of siltation is the jamuna multipurpose bridge. the pillars of the bridge act as a barrier against the main flow of the river and create silt in the upstream near sirajganj. and the flood flow capacity of jamuna decreases. now flood causes every year.

good governance?
on 15 april 2008, i was in kuala lumpur international airport (klia) waiting for my return flight to dhaka- mh 196.1 was standing in line to check in where the people in front of me were bangladesh government officials which i got to learn from their conversation after standing beside them for about 30 minutes. they came to malaysia for a weeklong trip to know about different measures of good governance. the person in front of me who was also a government official was halted in the security check due to his cabin baggage. the security personnel asked him politely to open his bag. i could see bed sheet, cups and an electronic kettle and other things with hilton kuala lampur written on them. when the security personnel pointed out that it was prohibited to carry an electronic item on board and, secondly, the things the passenger was carrying belonged to a hotel in malaysia, our government official had a reason which was valid to him, that he paid usd 150 per night and he could take away all the things in the hotel room. this scuffle went for about 20- 25 minutes, until he finally surrendered reluctantly the items collected from the hotel. i was thinking while boarding the plane that a responsible government official should have the common sense to understand that you cannot walk away with towels, bed sheets, etc from your hotel room. the bangladesh government can always verify this matter with the malaysian customs authorities as i am sure they keep record of all such events. view the page international
