global warming
as we all know global warming is the most discussed topic in the present day context. which is in fact a great threat for mankind, literally global warming is progressive and gradual rise of earth temperature (especially a sustained increase that causes the climate change) is thought to be caused by irrational exploitation and imbalanced surge of greedy human nature. our mother earth is heating further each and every day. it has been noticed that rapid unplanned industrial growth with the capitalistic motive of quick and easy money making has led to this tragedy.

south asians
migration of south asians to distant countries to seek livelihoods, or in search of acquaintance, skills, training and professional opportunities, is an undeniable fact. with the lack of economic as well as educational opportunities in south asia, the trend of emigration out of south asia will continue in the foreseeable future. thousands of south asians leave south asia on a daily basis to seek employment abroad with official permission. millions of south asians have settled in the usa, canada, western europe, australia, new zealand and other developed countries. acquiring citizenship of the adopted country becomes almost a necessity for various practical considerations like enjoying privileges of employment, education with ease, participation in various activities etc. the south asians who acquire citizenship of their adopted countries nonetheless always wish to maintain strong emotional ties with their country of origin which they usually consider their motherland. the south asians stay in regular touch with their families back home, travel to south asia frequently and support the country to the best of their ability. which is better for us?
indiscreet comments

chinese restaurants
“chinese restaurant” is supposed to mean a place where chinese foods are prepared and served. i also had the same idea. the other day while i was going to take my lunch, i was offered to have it in a chinese restaurant by one of my friends. yes, i went to a so-called renowned chinese restaurant in my city accompanied by him. it was the first time i was visiting such a place. so, i was totally unaware of the inside of the restaurant, but i heard a lot of negative things about such kind of restaurants. when i entered the restaurant, i saw nothing but darkness. after a while, i hardly saw the inside of the room and we took the seats covered by some curtains. actually each and every couple of seats was covered by curtain so that no one could see the people who sat there. after that we ordered some foods. but it took around 45 minutes to serve the foods and while i made a complaint to the manager he smiled at me mysteriously. it seemed to be negligence. he also said that no one comes there to eat and smiled again. really, i saw none to leave the room but enter and not singly but accompanied by opposite…. however, when i went to pay the bill, i was astonished to know that a bottle of mineral water of tk 10 would cost tk 50 and everything had exorbitant prices. another interesting thing i noticed is that the waiter showed least interest to serve us and i discovered the reason later that we both were males. however, while we were eating, i heard some rough sounds from the surroundings inside the restaurant made by girls and boys. it was an embarrassing situation for me. moreover, the environment of the room was not suitable to eat in any sense.
poor primary education
chunks of plaster raining down on class one students of a primary school injuring seven of them are illustrative of dilapidated condition of both primary education and school buildings. my wife, a primary school teacher, told me that because of corruption on the part of contractors who are usually ruling party cadres school buildings are constructed with so much less amount of cement that walls cannot withstand a gentle touch on them. the state of teaching there is poor, thanks to lack of devotion on the part of teachers and corruption on the part of local education officers.

why abroad?

great going for mps!
in our country the elected public representatives traditionally use their authority to build and secure their own future forgetting their pledges & promises to the general people who elected them. but the matter seems to get further momentum with the mps of the present national parliament. although nothing tangible has yet been done for the common people, we learn every day of new measures to reinforce the rights and benefits of the mps. they have been made kings of upazilas rendering upazila chairmen just figureheads, mps will have huge authority over implementing local development projects in their constituencies through the lgrd ministry, they have been assured of rise in their remuneration and allowances, each mp will get separate office on the js premises, they will also get free cars, drivers with fuel and shall own the vehicles against a symbolic price at end of their tenure.

govt losing direction
i am appalled at the state of the country after the awami league swept to power in the last election. i was hoping that the country would be managed more efficiently and was looking forward to coming to bangladesh and investing in the country of my birth. the reasons why i have changed my mind are:
medical education
the present government is committed to providing medical service to people in rural areas, especially in every union area. the commitment is appreciable. modern medical service is a far cry for the majority people who live in rural bangladesh. four decades have passed but the governments who administered the country could not arrange medical service to villages, though the villages are the vital units of bangladesh. to provide medical services three basic factors are to be arranged, namely, service of professional medical manpower, pharmaceutical medicine and medical equipment and instrument. view the page international
