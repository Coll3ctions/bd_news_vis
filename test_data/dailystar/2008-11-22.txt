we welcome bnp's new position on elections
finally, the bangladesh nationalist party has made a concrete announcement regarding its participation in the general elections. its readiness to take part in the general elections if they are held on december 28 is a move we at this newspaper are heartened by. we had stated in our editorial yesterday that room was still there for all parties to the issue to arrive at a solution to the crisis. such a solution now appears to be at hand. the bnp's decision, announced by party chairperson khaleda zia on thursday evening, lifts much of the sense of apprehension that has been there of late. the nation can now surely breathe easier. even though the decision by the party to go for elections is a belated one and indeed should have come earlier, we feel that the ground has now been smoothened for the polls to be held and for all political parties to make the elections a meaningful exercise aimed at a restoration of government by popular consent. it is in the interest of the country that the elections should now be held in a free, transparent and credible atmosphere.

a pakistani urdu writer
opening this volume of hasan manzar's urdu short stories in translation triggered in me that old reflex of turning away from anything labeled 'urdu writing.' the words 'urdu literature', or 'urdu poetry' or 'urdu fiction' instantly evokes school textbooks, where its best poets and writers, as in every language, lie embalmed. to be picked at, prodded, and learnt by rote, and very seldom to be enjoyed. for successive years from class six onwards, as sunshine outside classroom windows called out for a jail-break, as beyond iftekhar dyer's filmi hairdo we would see the hockey field and beside it the church, up whose steps for sunday evening mass dirndled native christian girls ran the gauntlet of preening male ducktails, it was with furious incomprehension that we turned back to the marsiya and qasida , to the arabesque laments of mir and dard. ghalib was the sole exception, not his ghazals (which are difficult in urdu, gleaming with such high persian polish that it takes years of knowing the ghazal form inside out to see what ghalib had achieved), but his letters, which i encountered in class ten, where lived and chattered an older version of the karachi around me: burly punjabis in charpoys, hot loo nights, the white chadars of mushairas , pigeon flights, mosques, the bohra mothers of our friends knitting in embroidered swings slung from bedroom ceilings, the old courtesies of adab and lehaz trailing their ragged hems. but oh, the others! even now, even after reading manto and chugtai and others, many others--modern urdu literature is a vastly different beast than what was in my old schoolbook texts--i have to force down that first reflex of turning away, to then turn back with an adult gaze. so i opened manzar's book thinking for a second, jesus! no, not creaky men with fez-es trapped in qafelas of bulbul-in-moonlight tropes...
