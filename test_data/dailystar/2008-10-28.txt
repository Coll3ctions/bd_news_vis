fall in fuel prices welcome
rare have been the instances where fuel prices have gone down in bangladesh. but now that fuel prices have been slashed by anywhere between 10 and 13 per cent, we certainly appreciate the move. we do realise, of course, that such a reduction in the prices of fuel, having consistently gone up in the last few years, has come about owing to a decline in fuel prices worldwide. it can certainly be argued that the decrease in fuel prices here does not quite match the fall in prices at the international level. even so, the decision to reduce fuel prices is appreciable and we hope it will set a precedent for the future.

'mishra unlikely'
