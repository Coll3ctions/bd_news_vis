the advent of the bangla new year is once again an opportunity for us to celebrate the cultural heritage we as a nation are heir to. baishakh is thus a season when we recall the spirit that has over a thousand years gone into the making of our identity as a people. be it politics, be it culture, be it overall society, baishakh has had a tremendous bearing on our consciousness as a people. as a free nation today, we remain fully aware of the import of the occasion and indeed rekindle in ourselves the feeling that every new year is for us also a chance to branch out to the wider world outside our politico-cultural domain.
power shutdown too frequent
even for a people accustomed to living with reduced power supply, especially in summer, the latest frequency of electricity outages in the country comes as something of a rude shock. that is because, for more than a year now, we had got used to fairly an even supply of electricity through what we understand to have been better load management. but quite obviously, the gap between power generation and distribution has yawned so much that there is little room for manoeuvering.

good potato harvest
when the country is facing a shortage of staple food items, the bumper production of potatoes is a blessing from the almighty.
city in distress
if my recollection is not wrong, recently one of the government officials remarked that dhaka might have to be abandoned if necessary steps could not be taken in time to arrest decay and deterioration of civic amnesties. the fact is that dhaka could no longer be termed a modern city. it is already in its death throes. the monsoon will set in soon. while the city floods will cause havoc, the city fathers will be making tall promises without finding and/or doing what is actually necessary to come out of this situation.
hidden hunger or silent famine?
dr. akbar ali khan calls it silent famine; the food adviser calls it hidden hunger. statistics coming out of bangladesh says that over 50% of pregnant women are suffering from anaemia, and a similar percentage (50%)of under 5 years old children are under weight (every one can understand the long term effect). who reports on these health fundamentals. bangladesh was one of the model states among the developing countries. we do not know, when and how our nation will come out of this terrible situation, but this time we must not fail to identify the culprits that created this situation. this calamity is no less serious than what the pakis and their dalals brought on us in 1971,because this torture, this atrocity is silent. it has touched millions and millions of our homes across the country.
barack obama and martin luther king
obama's recent speech on racial equality, though superficially powerful and rousing, was hypocritical and dishonest for it failed to recognise and fully appreciate the bedrock principle of human rights which guarantees racial equality. i refer to the principle enshrined in the united nations' universal declaration of human rights which states "everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person." that same principle is found in the us declaration of independence which clearly states "... all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
nsc
since the present caretaker government took office, a big segment of civil society and some factions of political parties hailed them. with the massive support from national media under the state of emergency, this unusual form of government, leaped for over-ambitious policies with great confidence. just within two months of stay in power, this government put national security council (nsc) on their agenda. unlike other issues, drive against corruption, voter id, national id, human rights commission, election commission reform, the idea of nsc did not get overwhelming support, rather it was viewed with suspicion, though some politicians supported it. whatever the ends and objectives of the planners, nsc cannot have a strong basis without constitutional arrangement and constitutional arrangement is not plausible without a democratically elected government.
no overbridge
as citizens we have to get five basic things from the government: food, cloth, education, health, and shelter. but if we can't defend ourselves from the hazards like road accident we will fail to achieve any one of the basic needs. i am a resident of west hazipara and also a student of leading university. this road (malibagh rail-gate to gulshan) is one of the busiest in dhaka city. it is the most densely populated area too. it is a matter of regret that we don't have any overbridge or subway in these localities (rampura, badda, chowdhury para) to cross the road. there is even no speed-breaker in these areas. we have only one overbridge at the notun bazar which is so far away from the malibagh rail-gate. can you imagine how people are crossing the road in these areas? how much risk we have to take to cross the road? there are many schools, colleges, garment factories, banks, markets, shopping malls etc situated on both sides of the road. i would appeal to the authorities concerned to build at least two overbridges and three or four speed-breakers in these areas to prevent road accidents.
mugabe story
just read a report that mugabe is willing to quit as long as he doesn't face prosecution. well, the best thing to do would be to promise him the immunity that he is so desperately asking for. but once the power is transferred, when his plane is on its way to his safe heaven (possibly a mid-east country), bring his plane down, arrest him, and then put him on trial. he shouldn't get death penalty; give him hard-labour for the rest of his life so that he can understand the real value of a slice of bread.
gas import
the recent initiative of bangladesh to import gas from myanmar has not been materialized due to the latter's negative attitude. actually, china and india contacted myanmar for importing gas long before bangladesh's initiative. at present bangladesh is thinking about importing gas but during the past bnp and al regimes our politicians spoke of the benefits of exporting gas, obviously as per foreign prescription. had we exported gas at that time, we would have faced acute shortage of it by this time.
anti-drug drive
the drive against drugs, especially 'yaba', lacking in persistency and follow-up, only stays as a symbolic action of the law enforcers. what we should assume is that there is no 'yaba' on the streets of the city or the drugs dealers and peddlers both managed to go into hiding and are still running their trade. we want to know whether any system has been developed to trace the effect of that massive drive. for example, are the vulnerable groups safer than before or the 'drive' only boomeranged?
gen. moeen's suggestion
army chief general moeen u ahmed recently suggested that people develop a habit of eating potatoes with rice to reduce pressure on our staple food. he made this suggestion after visiting a farmers' market set up under the supervision of bangladesh army in bogra town.
famine and hunger
our hon. food adviser has advised us (published on 5th.april) not to call the nationwide hunger in bangladesh a famine. he defines it as "hidden hunger"; his newly coined phrase! the adviser has great command over language! would he kindly(of course if he has the time to spare for the citizens) illustrate to us with reference to the context in bangladesh what is actually the food shortage leading to? is it "silent hunger" or "unknown hunger" or just an expanded temporary aberration; harped upon by newsmen and women! also what is the difference between "hidden" and "visible" hunger? a newspaper article on the subject from his capable pen would be most welcome.
liberation war history
i would like to request you to write an article or arrange a roundtable meeting in dhaka or all over bangladesh with the help of all freedom fighters, teachers, intellectuals and those who were in the real battlefield during the time of liberation. nowadays when we see the history of our liberation being distorted, we feel sad.
patient confidentiality
one of the pillars of medical practice in the west is patient confidentiality. a medical practitioner does not disclose his patient's medical history or problems to anyone other than the next of kin, and that also with the consent of the patient. i am therefore astonished at the callous manner in which the medical problems of the high profile prisoners are being disclosed to the public. prisoners also have the right to privacy.
women's rights
march 8 was 'international women's day' & the theme was 'investing in women & girls'. from the primitive days, women are oppressed in society. but now they are fighting back to get their rights established. society should show due sensitivity to all such rights.
dream shattered
a government becomes successful when it establishes the fundamental, civil and political rights of the people of the land. after the liberation war, we had a dream, a dream to make society free from exploitation. the constitution we framed after independence fully reflects our political will and dreams. but in the years to follow successive governments failed to live up to the spirit of our constitution.
role of dcs

cng price hike?
this is a request to all those people who can make some difference in society or at least give it a try. though our country suffered a lot of setbacks in the past but there are a few silent positive developments we can rejoice about. availability of hand tube-wells for clean water, clean sanitary latrines in the remote areas, telephone/mobile network are among these achievements. one of the silent revolutions which took place in the recent years is compressed natural gas (cng). thousands of transport vehicles are presently running on this pollution-free national resource.
political dialogue
a broken dialogue has just begun with the al. the party is not necessarily united, one can feel from the media reports that the attitude of the government is not serious enough to achieve any positive results from the dialogue. the broken bnp(s) will eventually come to their rescue as its basic policy does not differ from the politics of the present government. the jammat is their safety net.
obama and ds
given the alacrity and enthusiasm with which the daily star prints every piece of positive article on obama and highlights every negative article on hillary clinton, one can obviously see the lack of journalistic objectivity. question is, why is the daily star so enamoured of barack obama? but then again if you are an obama fan you believe in words and do not care for deeds. view the page international

aspirations in the bangla new year
bengali new year in its absolute sense is the new year for bengalis which bears the essence of their innate cultural heritage and values that they have nurtured and cultivated from the ages immemorial. on this day we all yearn for something new and want to observe the occasion with enthusiasm and gaiety, irrespective of our material existence as rich or poor and dwelling either in the urban or rural areas. as a nation we were successful in our movement to secure our language in 1952, and then in 1971, our struggle for liberation saw reality. in 1991, through a mass public uprising, the political scenario changed and in 2006, we turned against the tide that was misdirecting the nation. but even after all this there is a marked discrepancy between what we achieved and what we still want to have. why so? like everybody, this question also haunts me. what is it that we do not have in our possession? we have a golden land endowed with marvelous fertility; we have very simple hearted but laborious people. the only thing lacking is an honest desire and an honest execution.
music and sports play a role in diplomacy
music and sports could play an important role in the international political arena in improving the image of a country to a great extent. the performance by the new york philharmonic orchestra in the last part of february this year in pyongyang, north korea, is a glowing case in point. north korea has diplomatically been isolated by the western countries because of violation of human rights, and for enriching uranium. this iron- curtain communist country in asia remains isolated as a result of its hard-core policy of ignoring the well-being of the people of the country. view the page star city
