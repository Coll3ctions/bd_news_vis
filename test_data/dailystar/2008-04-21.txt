it is disconcerting that the number of diarrhoea cases is increasing in the city with the admission of 416 patients on saturday at icddr,b hospital at mahakhali, dhaka. and the alarming news is, hospital doctors think the number would further increase in the month of may. reportedly, most patients belong to the lower income groups who are in the habit of drinking water from the roadside food stalls to beat the extreme hot and humid weather. health experts believe the water is highly contaminated and remains the major source of the disease. stale and uncovered food on the roadside is another possible source that also needs to be taken into cognizance by the health authorities. in this context, we believe drastic measures should be taken to first, treat the patients and second, identify all the sources from where the bacteria find their way to human food and water chain and seal them permanently to avoid further contamination.

report on du incident
hats off to the judicial enquiry commission members for their highly constructive and rational recommendations following the unfortunate incidents that occurred in du in august last year. there is no second opinion in the country regarding the commission's recommendation for banning political activities by the teachers and students on the campus. i believe if a national referendum is sought, the entire nation will overwhelmingly support banning of political activities within the educational institutions. unfortunately, open involvement in politics of the teachers joining political wings of the student organisations by wearing black-badges, attending political meetings and signing a joint petition for release of an under-trial political prisoner, came as a shock to the conscious citizens in general. the teachers should pursue their noble profession of teaching only. involvement in party politics not only brings disgrace to their profession but also ruins the academic atmosphere on the campus as the students, encouraged by their teachers, indulge more in political activities, rather than concentrating on their studies. no wonder, the standard of education in du has gone down drastically.
power failure
with the advent of summer power failure has become a common phenomenon in the cities. people are suffering immensely as electricity is snapped frequently. candles, chargers, handmade fans--these items have become essential to tackle sudden disruption of power supply. however, it is the students, especially the ssc examinees, who are hit badly by the recurrent power failures. the sufferings of children and the elderly people can also be imagined.
observing the world around
every person has a world of imagination and thoughts. i observed keenly from my experiences that the views and thoughts of two minds are never the same. two mentalities may be similar but not the same. have you ever thought how logical your views and thoughts are? how much honest you are to yourself? usually when a person does a work he does it because it's right to him. but every work of a man is not always praised but is sometimes criticized. sometimes you will notice that your work which is criticized by some people is very fair to you. why? it's because of the differences in views. the other problem of ours is that we do not try to understand that a person may have logic behind a work

no power crisis!
your manikganj correspondent's report published on 16 august mentions the deplorable condition of power supply there. the view is shared by all of us. invariably, we have darkness when we need light; while electricity is drastically rationed in the form of "load-shedding"! be it in bagerhat,
decentralization
there has been a lot of debate about different forms of decentralization and their implications for developing countries. particularly in unitary states, decentralization is considered as a key element of governance. the organs of unitary states are governed constitutionally as one single unit, with one constitutionally created legislature. while political power of government in such states may be transferred to regional or locally elected assemblies, the central government retains the right to control and abolish the delegated power.
bnp's problems
most democracy-loving people of bangladesh living in the country or abroad may have concern over the present divided bnp. this concern emanates from the fact that we appreciate the necessity of a functional, bipartisan political system in the country, not so much because a substantial portion might support a united bnp.
politics
political parties are enthusiastic about elections. it is good to know that the government is determined to hold the elections within this year. we are hopeful that the coming elections will be free, fair and credible all the way. but i think before elections, we need to discuss some political issues. political parties should redefine the politics that they were practising before. we, the general people, won't like to experience any destructive politics in our country anymore. “no more violence” should be the slogan of all the parties. view the page international
