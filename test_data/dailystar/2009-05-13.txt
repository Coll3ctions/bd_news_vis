tcb role in import of essential items
the move by the government to relax rules for the trading corporation of bangladesh (tcb) to import six essential items is a measure of the priority being given to consumers' needs. finance minister a.m.a. muhith clearly puts matters in perspective when he notes that a quick import of the items --- pulses, edible oil, sugar, grams, onions and powdered milk --- means that the government wants to be ready for ramadan, obviously a time when consumers are generally put to great difficulties owing to an unnatural hike in prices. the fact that the tcb is once again being brought into the picture indicates a proactive role for the body after a long interval. that the government has embraced the idea of the tcb getting robustly involved in the task of ensuring market stabilisation speaks of the seriousness with which the authorities view the existing market conditions.

fees, students and private universities
something must be going wrong with our private universities. if you have had cause to follow events, you just might recall the various incidents in which students of one private university have engaged in skirmishes with those of another. the reasons have been pretty petty and certainly peculiar. a young woman, pursuing studies at one university, is harassed by a bunch of young men putatively coming by education at another. the brother of the young woman protests such behaviour, justifiably. soon after that, you run into these unsettling images of running street battles between large bodies of young men emerging furiously from the confines of their classrooms. it is not until those truncheon-wielding policemen swoop on them that matters somewhat get under control.

root cause of extremism
bangladesh is facing the threat of extremism. extremists are getting themselves heavily armed. their capability of producing fatal weapons came to light after the law enforcing agencies unearthed a madrasa cum ordinance factory in bhola. in the name of religion they are planning to carry out lethal attacks on the civilians. in order to extirpate extremism, the govt. is leaving no stone unturned. even foreign help has been sought. rumours of probable attack by the extremists are also afloat in the country. has our govt. achieved any real success in extirpating those headstrong elements from our country?

patriotism & loyalty

a tribute to dr. wazed miah
his presence was seldom felt but he was there. in bangladesh any person distantly related to any power, radiates so much that some time he or she supersedes the source. dr. wazed miah perhaps was the only exception. being the husband of the chief executive of the government, he lived the life of the most ordinary person. but he was not an ordinary soul, rather a meritorious student, an eminent scientist, a responsible husband and a caring father. he steered the whole family most efficiently when crisis loomed over. again when the family came to limelight he took shelter behind the wings. such selfless persons are rare not only in our country but also all over the world.
