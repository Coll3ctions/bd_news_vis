the passing of saifur rahman
the death of m. saifur rahman in a road crash brings to an end a life that was spent largely in public service from the late 1970s onward. in the years after he joined the government of general ziaur rahman as commerce and then finance minister, rahman played a pivotal role in the way bangladesh's economy was to shape itself. he remains --- and this is to his credit --- the man who has presented the highest number of national budgets, to the country. that is testimony, in a broad sense, of his indispensability to the party and government he was part of almost to the end of his days. saifur rahman found himself on the national political canvas under zia and then went on to expand his role in the two governments headed by khaleda zia. the economy, in a sense, came to be what he conceived it to be.
powerless in power!
he fought until his blood was extinguished
only then was he worth of his people.
-- pablo neruda
the wisdom of dharma
wisdom has a great advantage over philosophy. it is simple. philosophy is so often tortured by the human mind that its meditations become a maze. we become so enraptured by the complexities of the maze, so fascinated by its labyrinths that we forget that we once had a destination. wisdom is a straight line; it is the shortest distance between question and answer. view the page sports
