ngos
ngo or non-government organisation is the most discussed issue these days. although this concept is highly concerned with the third world countries, it has come from the first world.
the link road
really the veracity of the old saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” was proved right by the realistic picture on pg 16 of ds, 21 april. the situation shown is pitiable. no heed was apparently paid by the authorities to the daily star's warning some years ago that having a 60 ft funnel at the end of a 120 ft road, would further exacerbate an already serious situation. and so it has proved to be, just a few moments after being declared opened by the prime minister herself.
think sensibly
human civilization survived & flourished for the last 5,000 years, since the era of babylonia and egyptian faros, however, we started destroying our mother nature since the era of industrialization in less than 100 years! global warming, widespread pollution and depleted fossil fuel threats are looming large. the human race never faced so many challenges since their existence on earth.
magic of tolerance
we are all the products of our own individual upbringing and experiences so it is completely natural that we will all have differences in opinions, outlooks and beliefs. the world would be a very dull place if we were all the same and it's the incredible diversity amongst people throughout the world that makes it such a fascinating place. to feel comfortable about people whom we encounter, we must understand that people with their differences are part of one human race.
ruling party men
we are appalled by the news that awami league men attacked a bnp rally in dhaka on april 21, 2010, which left 10 people injured. the bnp organized the rally in demand of power, gas, and water, the scarcity of these has made lives of people miserable. so, this demand is not only of the bnp, it is the demand of the whole nation.
bcs quotas
among all public and private jobs, bcs is considered to be the most prestigious. hard labour and endeavour are needed to pass in each step of the bcs exams. only a student having outstanding merit deserves to be a bcs cadre. since bcs cadres are concerned with important activities of the government, it goes without saying that they ought to be meritorious.
disparate education system
education, a basic human right, has yet remained as a privilege mainly to the well-off city dwellers and not the far-off villagers.
campus violence
campus violence not only ruins the academic atmosphere but also claims the lives of many promising students. students should, therefore, always stay away from any type of violence. they also need to avoid bad companions.
local government
the idea of local government is old enough. even in the indian sub-continent, the idea was introduced long ago. there are four stages of evolution of local government in bangladesh such as--( 1 ) pre-british period (2 ) british period ( 3 ) pakistan period ( 4 ) bangladesh period.
blind praise
the contradiction could not have been starker. a former vice-chancellor of dhaka university, in a signature campaign programme held for the unconditional release of the son of a former prime minister, urged the people present there to avoid “blind praise and sycophancy.” the contradiction was that he himself in the same programme said that the former pm's son “is one of the shining stars of the young generation and that he is the symbol of the country's independence.” (bdnews24.com; april 21, 2010).
unemployment
unemployment is a major concern in bangladesh. every year hundreds of thousands of students are graduating from colleges and universities. at present the unemployment rate of bangladesh is 2.5 percent. though it is one of the major responsibilities of the government to provide jobs to the young generation but the government has failed to meet the job demand of the large population.
peace procedure
religious fundamentalism mutually with ethnic conflicts and terrorism has appeared on the worldwide ground with extraordinary vigor, and commonness. the customary thought of the expression safety has turned out to be out-of-date.
teacher recruitment
the government has decided to recruit as many as 1968 assistant teachers in the secondary level for the double-shift schools. a circular has already been published in different dailies in this regard. regrettably, there is no post for recruiting agriculture teacher in that circular. in 1995, the then government appointed an agriculture teacher in each government school. recently, the government has ordered opening double-shift classes in 80 schools at the district level. now, if the agriculture teacher is not appointed in these schools, there will be an imbalanced stuffing pattern between day and morning shifts.
bnp's tears
nowadays the bnp is trying to wage a movement against scarcity of electricity, water and gas. they are shamelessly tying to cash on people's plight which they themselves have created. we fail to understand under what moral authority they want to launch this movement. in their last tenure, the bnp commissioned only one 75 megawatt power generation plant which tripped more than 100 times. the bnp hardly improved the water and gas situation in the country while they were in power. they were busy in looting and plundering. they are more than 100 percent responsible for all our problems in electricity, gas and water sectors. our memory is not that short. we remember all their misrule and plunder of state wealth.
