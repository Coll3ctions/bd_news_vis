dhaka-moscow nuclear cooperation
the agreement between bangladesh and the russian federation on cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is certainly a milestone in the history of dhaka-moscow relations. the five-year deal comes at a time when bangladesh happens to be going through a severe crisis in the power sector. obviously, this deal will go a considerable way in reducing our critical dependence on gas-fuelled electricity. considering the difficulties bangladesh has been passing through in the power sector for years together, the deal is a bold and feasible step that promises dividends in our energy sector. given that nuclear cooperation with moscow is not a new phenomenon in our part of the world (one recalls the deal reached by the former soviet union and the then pakistan in 1960), the dhaka-moscow agreement surely introduces a new dimension to bilateral cooperation in our part of the world. for dhaka, it signifies a new direction in energy policy prioritization and diversification.
parliamentary committee reprimands btv
this is a long overdue piece of admonishment that had to be sounded to the government-controlled electronic media the btv which is financed by public money to serve public interest. and that it has come from none other than chief of the parliamentary standing committee on information ministry obaidul quader makes the censure authentic and appropriate on the interpretation of the information ministry's role as well as that of btv authorities which have been rightly put under the legislative microscope. btv newscasts are for the most part made up of longwinded speeches of government party leaders in a monotonous and predictable refrain. view the page sports

weekly currency roundup
may 9-13, 2010
international markets
this week marked another tumultuous week for the major currencies especially the eur. the euro fell in volatile trade on thursday, staying vulnerable on concerns other european countries may announce regulations similar to germany's ban on naked short selling of some assets. higher-yielding currencies such as the australian dollar were under heavy selling pressure as concern over policymakers' response to the euro zone debt crisis fueled risk aversion, leading to liquidation of long positions. the dollar got a safe haven bid against most currencies but extended losses against the yen after data showed the number of us workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance unexpectedly rose last week for the first time since early april. the euro stayed above a four-year low hit on wednesday in response to the german ban, but traders remained nervous similar moves may follow, while broader concerns about euro zone debt problems further weighed on sentiment. traders also said fears other european countries may follow germany's lead and implement short selling bans pushed european shares into negative territory and exacerbated the falls in the euro and perceived riskier currencies. the euro recovered from four-year lows on wednesday as traders covered short positions on speculation european monetary officials might act to check its rapid fall, though for now market players see intervention unlikely. eurogroup chairman jean-claude juncker said on thursday he did not see a need to take immediate action to halt the euro's decline. this was echoed by european union competition commissioner joaquin almunia who said there was no need to intervene.

our flora and fauna
the environment of bangladesh includes flora and fauna and their natural habitats. the greater part of the human inhabitants lives in or around big cities and this has helped to limit deforestation slightly. nevertheless, the growth rate continues to amplify at an alarming rate and this has created huge demands on the environment and leads to destruction of several natural habitats. despite the fact that quite a lot of areas are sheltered under law, a great segment of bangladeshi wildlife is in jeopardy by this expansion.
disaster management
with the mounting global warming and climate change, intensity of natural calamities in bangladesh as well as other parts of the world is increasing. a number of strikes, in dissimilar form of cataclysm, are swiftly escalating each year. earlier, after ten to fifteen years, we would face a large-scale flood or cyclone. but in recent years, both in quality and quantity, it has increased in our region. the preparation to cope with such calamities, right this year, should start with allocating a reasonable amount of money in the proposed national budget.
education for all
education is always important for every nation in this world for development and peace; education enables a human-being to be a worthy citizen. also, education makes a person more 'aware'.
thailand scene
i moved to bangkok a couple of weeks ago when the pro-thaksin red shirts and the current thai government seemed to be on the brink of reaching accord. in fact, i walked around amongst the protesters in their make-shift campsite in the centre of bangkok's financial and shopping districts near the national stadium. the scene was tame; some of the tents had children playing computer games, women lounging around and men folk chatting amongst themselves. they had their own medical check-up stations, water supplies and a myriad of food stalls. the whole place had loudspeakers blaring live speakers from the centre stage only a few blocks away. the exit and entry points were barricaded with stack of tires, bamboo sticks, barbed wires and red cloths.
mps
politicians in our country expect everyone to act as per the law and ethics but think these do not apply to them. how can the nation tolerate mps when they waste precious working hours by raising petty issues? there is urgent need to uphold the dignity and ethics of public life. just as we have provisions for punishing erring employees, necessary rules should be framed to enable presiding officers to summarily dismiss members who misbehave and disturb the house. people should also have the right to recall their representative if they feel that he disturbs the functioning of the house unnecessarily. when workers strike work, the principle of "no work, no pay" is enforced. will the jatiya sangsad embrace that policy and cut off the perks and other benefits extended to the mps for their walkouts and abstention from the house?

congratulations!
i congratulate rooshnara ali for winning the bethnal green and bow constituency seat for labour. her muslim and bengali background are irrelevant in this context as all the rival major contestants that she beat in this election were all bengali muslims. she won by 21784 votes against mr masroor of liberal democrat who got 10210 votes. the other major contestants were mr a miah of respect who got 8532 votes and mr z khan of conservative who got 7071 votes.
contain inflation
inflation refers to a rise in prices that causes the purchasing power of a nation to fall. it has, no doubt, become a great concern in our country. it has affected our economy to a great extent as well. our economy is no longer so dynamic as it was in the past. due to inflation, our economy is now going through a transitional period.
eve teasing
eve teasing is a crime and it has attacked us like an octopus. in the last couple of months, a number of girls have sacrificed their lives due to intolerable teasing and they made us understand how helpless we are. don't we feel that the situation is getting worse? really, we have nothing to do about it. but i think, we have something to do. i do believe if we stand together, we can stop this.
government's 'conspiracy theories'
the awami league is immersed in conspiracy theory, whenever anything goes wrong they smell conspiracy in it. when in educational institutions untoward incidents happen, the awami league declares that activists of the bnp have infiltrated the bcl and they are responsible for it. we have become tired of this sort of irresponsible remarks from the government.
licence to drink!
the whole exercise of issuing 'liquor permit', by the excise department, is structured on lies, fraud and deceit! it seems that we officially issue the licences to prospective social and 'addicted' drinkers; largely muslims, usually of the so-called 'high society' who indulge in this illegal vice to drink intoxicating liquor which is disallowed and prohibited in islam! in a lighter vein, these licences can be compared to the fictitious james bond the 007's, "licence to kill" issued by the mi5, of course it was un-written!
crime against humanity
thanks to the rtv for showing the video footage of a meeting attended by a cross section of people who strongly believe in the early trial of the war criminals. it is perhaps necessary to immediately form a small follow-up committee to keep watch on the progress of the trial that began on march 26 2010, and to keep the people informed of the progress. this committee should also identify the barriers including the role of the individuals and the political party publicly opposing the trial, on one pretext or the other.
mobile phone
there is no denying that mobile has become an indispensable tool in this age of technology. mobile has reached a major portion of the populace. but what is a matter of concern is that it has reached some people who should not have access to it. it is a self-destroying tool for the teen-agers who can't rein in its misuse.
what is going on?
serenity is lost in this world of urbanisation. this planet is heading toward a severe catastrophe, as the climate is changing rapidly. where are the friends of humans in this planet of machines and vehicles? aren't we losing them gradually? where are the trees? they're being cut down, as if the earth never needed them anyway.
to the pm..
once upon a time i was very proud of being a member of the chhatra league. i can still recall the day when i became a member of the cl in 1964. i was a student of class 5 in dacca collegiate school. i passed the golden days of my life at dacca college as the cultural secretary of cl during the post liberation period. we had a motto and a vision, instead of tender manipulation and making money.
ship breaking industry
a strong move is on against the ship breaking industry to remove this market from bangladesh to other countries. some ngos are trying to protect the rights of workers and save the environment from bad effects of ship breaking. we support them. but we can not lose the huge prospect in the name of serving workers and the environment. we have to be more flexible for this industry. more than 250,000 people are engaged in this sector directly or indirectly. every year the government earns a good income from it. it saves a huge amount of foreign currency by reducing import of steel and raw material. it provides 80% of the iron used by the steel factories.
disowning bcl
the bcl is the oldest student organisation in this sub-continent. it has a long and glorious history that gives this organisation an exclusivity. the bcl emerged in 1948 before the emergence of bangladesh awami league. in fact, most of the prominent politicians in the al had a long involvement with the bcl. their political school was bcl. it is so painful to hear that they feel shy with the present activities of the bcl. some of them even said that the government was not responsible for its offensive activities. after the al's coming to power, the bcl is becoming desperate.
government's performance
the present govt got a huge mandate in the last general election on the theme of "digitalisation". they have been working hard for the last one year. but they failed in the power sector, that is the prerequisite of digitalisation.
stalking and sexual harassment
the increase in stalking and sexual harassment in our society is a threat to education and empowerment of women. the school-going girls in the rural areas are the worst victims of these heinous activities in our male-dominated society which can hardly be tolerated. thousands of brilliant girls, being compelled, leave schools and colleges in the fear of stalking criminals who are used to teasing them on their way to school and college. needless to mention, these types of news reports remain unpublished in the mass media except a few. these make poor parents anxious about their daughters. sometimes they lose mental balance and even commit suicide. who are responsible for their demise? can we ignore our duty and responsibility? i strongly believe that lack of moral lesson and impact of satellite channels are mainly responsible for this. moreover, teenage boys guided by animalism, the darkest side of human being, ignore the norms and other social values of society. view the page international
