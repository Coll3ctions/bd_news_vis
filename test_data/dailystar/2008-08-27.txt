unwarranted violence
the rapid-fire eruption of violence engulfing dhaka university, dhaka college and buet campuses following news about tareq's injury evokes instant condemnation. it has not only caused death, injuries and smashing of vehicles but the manner in which violence has been wreaked has had a sinister ring about it.
pakistan's coalition collapse
the deepening political crisis in pakistan threatens to mar its newly found democracy. the withdrawal of nawaz sharif's muslim league from its coalition with the pakistan people's party, because mr. sharif thinks mr. zardari has reneged on a promise to restore to their positions the judges sacked by former president pervez musharraf, is a development that disappoints not only pakistanis in general but also people who are worried about the growing power of the taleban and al-qaeda along the country's western frontier. indeed, asif ali zardari, who aspires to pakistan's presidency following the resignation of general pervez musharraf, has let it be known that the taliban are winning the war in pakistan. that statement, in light of the uncertainties now confronting the country, seems aimed more at gaining political mileage than an exposition of hard realities. it can only make things even harder for the government zardari's party leads.

climate change
bangladesh has experienced some of the worst climatic changes, bringing sufferings to millions of people. the media continue to report on the aftermath of the cyclone sidr which razed human settlements and infrastructure to the ground along the coastal districts, leaving a trail of destruction along its path.
dhaka's traffic system
the good news is that the government has decided to introduce a modern traffic control room in the capital. to reduce traffic jams, the timetables of schools' morning classes will be adjusted to accommodate the extra pressure on the roads. the education ministry would fix a schedule and send letters to the schools. the ministry will also monitor whether the decisions are being followed. this certainly looks like a good decision and shows that the government is trying its best to bring the dhaka traffic to a tolerable level.
do we have a choice?
why does everybody including the ca urge people to choose an honest and efficient candidate in the forthcoming national election? do the people really have a choice wide enough? aren't they more or less confined with an 'yes' or 'no' option like various surveys made by the media? nobody seems to be prepared to urge or request the political parties to nominate honest and efficient candidates for the people!
location of schools
the mushroom growth of english medium schools has reached menacing levels. the residents of dhanmondi and gulshan are the worst hit people. the government -- particularly the education ministry-- must come up with short term and long-term plans to cope with the situation. the recent government circular to start the morning shift at 7.30am is a positive move forward and is only a short term arrangement.
bus service
every day people waste their valuable time remaining stuck in the vehicles. as small vehicles occupy more space compared to the number of passengers, we should impose restrictions on private cars, rickshaws, baby taxies etc. and therefore we are in favour of more bus services in this capital city. but our buses are very old and most of them are not big enough. side by side, there are spacious and more comfortable buses. the government should inspire people to invest in this type of buses which will certainly mitigate the sufferings of the commuters.
rationalise "quota system"
bangladesh, a poor country plagued by myriad problems and numerous constraints, apparently and indispensably requires an effective, pragmatic and efficient leadership provided by the bangladesh civil service that should have the most brilliant, prudent and talented persons competent enough to address the public affairs, national issues and problems. hence, the recruitment, selection and appointment of the people to the civil service should unconditionally be on the basis of merit to uphold the national interests. regrettably, merely 45 percent candidates are recruited on merit and the rest 55 percent on quotas; 30 percent from freedom fighters' children, 10 percent from women, 10 percent from district quotas and 5 percent from tribal people. the quota system was introduced in bangladesh by an executive order on 5 september, 1972 during a constitutional interregnum in the wake of a destructive war of independence. the constitution that came into effect on 16 december 1972 enshrined the principles of non-discrimination in the public service. the articles 27 and 28 of the constitution stipulate that there shall be no discrimination in the recruitment of the people to the public service irrespective of caste, religion and sex. though, later, the quota system was constitutionally validated showing the reason of advancement of the backward sections of society. but the provisional measures for proportional representation can not continue for an indefinite period. the long term bad impact of the quota system is being felt now. the quota system has paved the way for rampant corruption. through the quota system, a large group of relatively poor calibre officials get entry into the civil service and ultimately weaken the entire service.
same story?
the way things are now going on and the way the things we really want to be are opposed to each other. with the release of most of the accused of graft/corruption cases now under trial and/or punishment, the people are confused. so far so good was our instant reaction to the 1/11 initiations. we then heaved a sigh of a great relief. but looking into what is going on now, we are really afraid to see that we are about to meet the same old fate as we had experienced with our past political governments.
set up more universities
this refers to dr. sakina khanam's letter. i support her view of turning eden college into a university for women, and establishing an agricultural university by using the facilities of agricultural training institute (ati) and veterinary training institute (vti) in gaibandah. i think it is a very good proposal in the country's context.
exporting brain!
every year, thousands of students get admitted into public and private universities for higher education.they have a dreamafter finishing their studies they will get a good job. like them, i had also a dream as a student of chittagong university. we felt proud when we got a good subject. but now we feel that the reality is different. getting a good job is not easy!
a holiday?
it is a sad occurrence that we as a developing nation fail to acknowledge the core values of our people even at the best of our educational institutions. the 24th of august 2008 was nationally declared as a public holiday for “janmashtami”, a religious event of the hindu community in our country. but in certain institutions i have noticed that they do not acknowledge this day as a national holiday and therefore remain open for business as usual. students are expected to attend classes, regardless of their obligations and expectations.
attention: ctg
considering the recent events in educational institutions, labour unrest and local governmental matters, one can easily predict that the nation is going to watch more and more recurrence of trouble and instability in these areas. the ministry of education and the ministry of commerce are definitely not compatible.
learning english
your news feature yesterday had an article on learning english. indeed, ability to read, write and express oneself in english is indispensable. it is estimated that over 80% of the internet and scientific literatures are expressed in english. this means that one deprives oneself of 80% of the knowledge of the modern world by not having english skills. fortunately, one does not need to preach bangladeshi population about the importance of english, by now almost everyone is convinced of its importance. the question is how to acquire this essential skill. in bangladesh, there is an acute shortage of teachers with english skills; as a result, most of institutions including some of the prestigious ones are not able to deliver this skill to the students. it is encouraging to see that many private centres have come forward to fill in the gap although; the standards of most of these institutions are being questioned.
prices of rice
we take a lot of interest in your articles. however, it is not right to say that the prices of rice are still high. you are aware that road communications have improved. people are using mobile phones to know the price of rice all over the world. they also know the prices of fertilisers in the world market. the prices of fertilisers are now 10 to 5 times more than what they were in 2007.

understanding nazrul
mafizul islam has a right to feel disgruntled whenever discussions about the state of nazrul sangeet come up. although not a household name, islam has been a lifelong follower and practitioner of nazrul sangeet, more intent on maintaining its pristine quality in his rendition of the songs than seeking limelight. trained under the most reputed artistes of his generation, islam has recorded some of nazrul's most brilliant and little known compositions. his renditions are marked with minute intricacies.
bridging home and the world
compared to rabindranath or other pioneering poets/lyricists/ writers of his time, kazi nazrul islam's travel credentials would not be considered that impressive. the furthest he went was karachi, where he was posted after joining the 49 bengal regiment in 1917. this experience however, provided him with an exposure to other cultures and languages -- an exposure that would have a major impact on his poetic style. during his stay in the army, nazrul learnt farsi (persian). son of an imam, nazrul's introduction to arabic happened at an early age. as an adolescent he joined a leto group and developed a skill in composing poems and songs at short notice. through his association with the leto group, he also began learning about the hindu puranas .
drawing the young to nazrul sangeet
a frequent scenario today is the young generation attending rock and pop concerts. one often wonders why they are not captivated by the vivacious tunes of nazrul. going over this issue, the daily star talked to some young artistes who have a sound foundation in nazrul sangeet.
a lifetime of preserving nazrul's music
nazrul sangeet exponent and artiste sudhin das needs no introduction; his contribution in identifying and publishing the accurate notations of nazrul sangeet helps a lot to ensure the originality of melody of the genre. his wife, neelima das, has never enjoyed mass media exposure but is considered one of the most talented radio artistes of the '50s (television was yet to come) and has been effectively assisting her husband in the research. in an interview with the daily star , this artiste duo talked about their passion for nazrul sangeet, life and more.
tracing the track of the comet

usain bolt, not michael phelps, is the star of beijing olympics
i have always admired michael phelps's swimming prowess, and along with the rest of my family have rooted vociferously and celebrated his stupendous successes. his unprecedented exploits in the swimming pool, both in athens in 2004 where he was the superstar, and in beijing in 2008 where he was also a superstar, left me speechless.
finally, the clock has turned back
the gods in greek mythology condemned sisyphus to ceaselessly roll a rock to the top of a mountain only to see it roll back where it lay at the beginning, and to roll it back to the top and see it roll back, and so on and so forth ad infinitum. and what better way to mete out a dreadful punishment than this futile and hopeless labour.
youth culture and our future
when a few years ago i wrote about the importance of an english education in our lives, i ignorantly expressed my views from a narrow english medium mindset. incidentally, after four years of an american education and once again returning home, i have started realising the importance of all three kinds of education in a bangladeshis life -- bengali medium, english medium, and the madrassah system.
