rising costs and the mentally ill
one does not require much wisdom to know that the issue of mental health is rather low on the list of national priorities. it has been that way for years together. in all the discussions on health policy and the like, little, if any, focus has been placed on the pretty large number of mentally challenged people in the country. and now it appears that whatever degree of care there has been for such individuals is under threat of hitting a new low owing primarily to the costs of treatment involved. as a report in this newspaper makes it clear, the rising costs in treatment has compelled patients to leave the national institute of mental health in recent months. obviously, most patients at the institute and at similar institutes come from not very well-to-do families. add to that the rise in treatment charges imposed by the government in september last year, which were without question a damper on health care.

“better is expected”
probably you, the captain of the bangladesh cricket team, have taken his asking as “rebuke” but it was a “cry” from the bottom of the heart of the board president which echoes millions of bangladeshis and he has the right to do so. late maj. khaled mosharaf and maj haider, the legendary sector commanders, would always asked for more even if the “boys” gave their best. it does not mean that they “humiliated” their boys by asking for more, they just wanted their boys to give their best. it is how boys used to be inspired. how a leader of a group could stand in front of those sector commanders and defend after losing more then 100 boys [read runs] in an attack where there seemed to be a wining situation, just because of lacking in attitude [clearly there was along with the body language ] to win the war. when the boys could do it after nine months why it could not be done after more then 150 months [read tests]. just saying “doing better” is definitely not enough.
controlling traffic
the editorial on dhaka traffic (ds, jan 19, 2010), was very appropriate and timely, but hardly adequate. it was like blowing a puff of air to remove a mountain. as media personnel, you have to do something more substantive to make the government declare the traffic situation an 'emergency' and get various ministries to put their heads together to solve the problem.
nigeria riots
most of these riots are politically motivated. during such riots anti-social elements got the full advantage, thereby furthering animosity.
save migratory birds
with the arrival of winter every year we see the mass-migration of birds of different species from ice-covered regions of the world to our country. hence they are our guests. these birds play a vital role for the eco-system of bangladesh. but we do not make our land a haven to them, rather we give a cruel treatment to these dumb guests.
murderous student politics
there is a wise saying, ''today's students will lead the nation tomorrow.'' but if they are misguided and involve themselves in vicious and heinous activities, how will they become our future leaders? in the educational institutions we often see some so-called students under the shadow of political groups or in the name of student politics they create campus violence.
standard of education
we feel worried, shocked and concerned about the standard of education, general knowledge, learning of english and mathematics of our secondary school boys and girls.
rootless people
the other night i was made to stop by an uproar and a pathetic wailing of some young children outside my residential hall. when i went to the spot, i found the little possessions of some homeless people who were living on the footpath around dhaka university and buet campus lying scattered while a few women were shouting at the top of their voice and a couple of young panic-stricken shivering children letting out heart-rendering cry which made air heavy on that chilly night. i saw a micro-bus parked beside with a line “proctorial team, university of dhaka” stuck to its back and came to know that it was a drive meant to eradicate the rootless people occupying the university footpath making the place look dirty. some people were justifying the drive saying that those footpath-dwellers were involved in illicit activities and responsible for making the area untidy. i knew that the accusation of the people was not baseless and the university authorities had the right to do what they did in terms of law. but from a human viewpoint how and who can justify an action that threw a number of poor creatures including a couple of innocent kids out of 'their home' on that biting and bone-shivering cold midnight? the two children were too panic-stricken and cold-beaten to cry normally. the sight was pathetic enough to make even an iron-hearted to have sympathy for those children.
anatomy of 1/11
it is well known that a democratic system is a self contained and self sustained foolproof system. solution to any problem in a democratic system is contained within the system itself and one should look for solution within the system, not outside. if solution has to be brought from outside then the system is incomplete and weak.
prime minister and imams
learnt from the ds report dated 21 jan 2010 that while addressing the national conference of trained imams at the city's bangabandhu international conference centre you said the following:
test cricket
test cricket is the real test for a cricketer. only very good players can survive here. in this sense bangladesh cricket team is really an ordinary one. after spending nine years in test arena it's pathetic to see the miserable performance of the cricket team. they could not learn anything all these years. our batsmen go to the crease and do some 'gung-ho' style batting. and it costs us dearly. we could easily draw the chittagong test, which was shortened by bad weather, if our batsmen showed some patience.
introduce train to cox's bazar
we all know that bangladesh has been independent for the last 40 years. but only a few kilometres of railway track have been added to our vulnerable railways.
sell-outs and secrets
the well written article, printed in your pages on 21st. january, by your defense & strategic affairs editor is a polite though sarcastic and indirect criticism of the hon. leader of the opposition! hopefully, someone reads it out and explain it to her. one barb, and i quote, states, "much is to be said in favour of modern journalism. by giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community"!
khaleda's predictable reaction
the daily star in its editorial of 19 jan under the above caption has expressed surprise over begum khaleda's reaction. what the paper predicted has proved to be right and the paper should not have expected anything else. begum zia has said what she was expected to say and the people were not surprised.
justice
although progress has been made in the judiciary of our country bangladesh, strange loopholes exist in our legal systems that take away our rights.
traffic jam and solution
traffic jams are the biggest problem in dhaka city. day by day the number of vehicles is increasing. no alternative roads are being made. therefore, the vehicles get stuck in a few roads. it is also true that it is difficult to construct alternative roads around dhaka. but we could build more flyovers to reduce traffic jams.
decentralisation
in the process of decentralisation, upazila parishad has been a focal point of administration. as per the recommendation of carr (committee for administrative reform and reorganization), formed in 1982, under the chairmanship of martial law administrator m. a. khan, during the regime of h. m. ershad, upazila parishad was entrusted with a broad range of functions. the activities included formulation of development plans, proper implementation of these plans, discharge of criminal and civilian cases, collection of revenue and maintenance of law and order. as an outcome of this initiative, we distinctively prioritise the flow of participation of local people in administration and development. the upazila chairman was provided with the authority to oversee and monitor the activities of civil servants in collaboration with the upazila parishad members. he was also authorised to write the acr (annual confidential report) of the officers concerned. but, now the acr is usually written by uno (upazila nirbahi officer). though the first upazila election was held in 1985, it was abolished in 1991 during the then bnp government. later, almost nineteen years, in 2008, the military backed caretaker government wanted to revive the upazila parishad through holding "upazila election -2008." but our lawmakers intended to emerge as advisers to the upazila chairman. the intention and intervention of the lawmakers have almost kept the upazila parishad dysfunctional. again the ruling party also pledged that they would strengthen local government to ensure good governance. in order to ensure decentralization of power, local development and people's participation, it is a must to empower upazila chairman.
