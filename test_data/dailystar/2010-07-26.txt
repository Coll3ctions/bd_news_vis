making sense of poverty
poverty remains a big stumbling block to progress in bangladesh and by extension the south asian region. that fact has been confirmed once more by the undp's multidimensional poverty index (mpi) prepared to assess the factors related to poor living conditions in south asia. there is, surely, good reason for bangladeshis to feel happy about the findings, which place them slightly before neighbouring india in the index. of the 104 countries assessed in the mpi, bangladesh has been ranked 73, with india close at 74. nepal, pakistan and sri lanka have been placed at 82, 70 and 32 respectively. of course, these figures do not convey much clarity by themselves, which is why it is important that we take a look at the breakdown that allows such mathematics to be arrived at.

saline tolerant paddy!
this encouraging bss news report was published in all dailies on 18 july, but unfortunately not in the front page, that it deserved! this is a very important development for bangladesh, given the ever-increasing encroachment of saline waters in our rivers and shores, decreasing land available for paddy plantation. it is a great achievement for the brri scientists. over the decades to come, it will help increase paddy plantation acres and increase our production of paddy to feed our ever-growing population! it is a very commendable achievement and it deserves public national recognition!
tigers perform poorly
our national team lost in most of the matches in asia cup and played miserably in five day matches with england, i feel the reasons for which our young players fail to win are as follows:-
traffic management
with great reluctance i had to make two trips to uttara recently from my sanctuary in niketon between 1:00pm and 10.30pm. on both occasions it took more than an hour to reach my destinations while the general comment of the driver was “we are lucky today, there is practically no traffic!!” all motor vehicles were weaving about in all lanes and overtaking from all sides. no traffic discipline was seen. perhaps the on-going mobile courts were busy elsewhere.
school inspection
regarding the primary school inspections, i am reminded of a story, which my grandfather narrated to me, some seven decades ago.
savings, instruments
a press release quoting hon. finance minister about tax deduction on savings certificates, appearing in the daily star on july 9, 2010, attracted my attention.
great message
our dearest rasul hazrat muhammad (pbuh) said, ''if you can afford to do good to anyone, you do so; but do not try to do any harm to him or her. moreover, if you think that people will suffer owing to your misbehaviour, you should go to the hill (that is, s/he should be far away from people).''
energy saving?
the government is distributing energy saving bulbs among the people in rajshahi. on the other hand, road lights of rajshahi city corporation have not been replaced with the energy saving bulbs yet. not only that, road lights are switched on at least one hour before dusk and put off two hours after dawn!!
suicidal tendency
i refer to the increasing incidence of suicide among school & college students. when a student commits suicide, everyone is affected. students are a vulnerable group. age, competition and relations in the family are all contributing to the growing cases of suicide among school goers. experts, doctors and even the world health organization (who) believe that a multi-pronged strategy needs to be put in place to tackle problems ranging from anxiety, depression, stress and finally suicidal tendencies.
justice delayed
"dirgho-din rayer copy na-pawaya bichar-prarthider charom voganti" meaning "sufferings of justice seekers for non-receiving of copies of verdicts" was a news headline of a bangla daily on 19 july 2010. we remember, immediately after assuming office, the present chief justice vowed to deliver justice to all. he especially emphasized the poor whom he promised voluntary services from lawyers to deliver justice to their doors. the above headline is contrary to what we heard from him. now the justice seekers have taken to the streets not for justice but for copies of pronouncements of verdicts which they might have heard on the concluding day of a case. these pronouncements might have come to them, may be after several years of ordeal in lower courts and then to the high court.
age limit
in british-india the maximum age limit was fixed for entry level of a government job. at the beginning, 18 years was the maximum limit. in pakistan time this limit was changed on several occasions. after independence, in bangladesh also the limit was changed. the present maximum age limit is 30 years at the entry level for all citizens except freedom fighters. there is no scientific rationale for the existing maximum age limit of 30 years. we can have some logic but that is, of course, not beyond controversy.
agri university at rajshahi
while addressing a reception to the meritorious students, the mayor of rajshahi a h m khairuzzaman liton disclosed that an agricultural university and a girls cadet college would be established in rajshahi to meet the long-cherished demand of the local people.
the veil issue
your 18 july issue holds special interest for me. firstly for the bold and enlightened article by engr a.b.m. nurul islam and secondly the letter from md. nazrul islam , both have similar topics on veil, niqab/burka in islamic society.
sanchay patra
as we have seen in the newspapers, the govt. has recently reduced the rate of interest on three-month interest basis sanchay patra.
transfer system
one of the secrets of good administration during the british raj era was the regular transfer system of employees in the public offices. the change in the environment kept the management healthy; and it discouraged the building up of powerful clichés by the subordinate groups.
moral education
the minister in charge of education had the courage to introduce the new education policy as one could learn from the media. as a humble bangladeshi, i feel that moral education including family budget comprising income and expenditure should be incorporated from eighth class and onwards so that children know the real state of parents' behaviour. as a citizen, i am to pay bribe to income tax, wasa officials, electricity authorities, city corporation people, land revenue officials etc for survival. should the education minister conceive the reality as none can escape dealing with those officials, i believe. thus moral education, practising honesty in day to day life relating to income and expenditure need be imparted, i believe. let something really happen in our society.
corporal punishment
on behalf of the millions of abused bangladeshi children who suffered the horrors of corporal punishment in school, i would like to thank sir frank peters, lawyer sarah hossein and the bangladesh high court for the roles they each played in abolishing the inhumane practice. view the page international
