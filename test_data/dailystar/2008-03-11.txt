us' support for our democracy roadmap
we take note of the us charge d'affaires (cda) geeta pasi's sunday meetings with the senior leaders of al and a faction of the bnp. this along with her plans to meet few other political leaders is likely to give an impression of her evincing more than normal diplomatic interest in our internal politics. we welcome some aspects of the us' interest, but unambiguously state that it is our people who will ultimately protect and determine the future course of our democracy, not foreign powers.
local government bodies
the government move to revoke the powers of the members of parliament over upazila parishads is quite in keeping with the generally accepted plan of ensuring more functional autonomy for the local government bodies, of which the upazila parishad is an important tier. in fact, the local government system is the corner stone of participatory democracy and the more it enjoys operational freedom, the greater will be the decentralization of power.

benazir bhutto
in his write-up, “the legacy of benazir” (ds, march 4), mr. moinuddin chisti, after commenting on benazir and her pakistan, finally asks a few questions which are:
jamuna bridge
the daily star must be applauded for bringing the authority's attention to the need for the immediate repair of the jamuna bridge (editorial, jamuna bridge in jeopardy? tuesday, february 26, 2008). this bridge is indeed a national treasure and can be considered the most important economic lifeline for bangladesh. to save the bridge, and possibly many lives, and to avoid the nightmare of a closed bridge or even the cost of a more extensive repair or replacement in the case of a collapse, the authorities must repair the bridge immediately. in the past, at the request of the residents of california, the california department of transportation (caltrans) sent teams of in-house expert bridge design and maintenance engineers to other countries to investigate the causes of bridge damage and to provide repair recommendations.
east timor and we
the shooting of east timor president jose ramos horta and father of the nation and prime minister xanana gusmao brings back memories of the conspiracies that bangladesh went through in its childhood. there are amazing similarities between these two nations in terms of events in the pre-independence, independence and post-independence eras. consider the following:
niketon -gulshan walkway
the walkway constructed from niketon bridge to mohakhali road on the gulshan-1 side is one of the more laudatory projects of dhaka city corporation. its picture really deserved its pride of place in the star city section of ds some days ago. however, like most such projects of dcc it has been left incomplete. here is why:
al gore?
according to many observers, in the democratic convention in august, “al gore, the former vice-president, could emerge as a compromise candidate.” it may be recalled that al gore, already a nobel laureate, has since become a grand ecologist and he appears more a benefactor of the mother earth than just a politician of the united states. he has been lecturing on the topic of global warming, which he labels as "the climate crisis." despite all these, the public speculation is already there in the united states as also in the rest of the world over the 2008 democratic presidential nomination. however, gore frequently stated that "i have no plans to run". at this stage, no one can say for sure as to who is going to be the next president of the united states although a very few can gainsay that al gore, if nominated by the democrats, could prove to be one of the best presidents the united states ever had.

age limit of 28th bcs
i would request you to write a befitting column and urge the psc to reconsider the age limit of the 28th bcs exams. you know that almost after 30 month the psc has recently issued the circular of the 28th bcs exams. already, a good number of candidates have crossed the age limit.
save the trees
during a recent visit to a relative in gulshan 2, i was surprised to see that half the road was dug up and the otherwise quiet, pleasant area was a complete mess. i enquired about what was going on and was told that they wanted to expand the road from building to building. first of all, i would like to know where the pavement will be for the pedestrians. secondly, this is a residential area and doesn't need more expansion of the roads. thirdly, with half of gulshan lake being taken by encroachers all the time, shouldn't the dcc have other priorities rather than to break up an already nicely kept area? i then realised that the government bodies don't normally take action unless they are forced to by higher powers or there is some profit in it. i looked carefully at the tree lined roads and therein lies the clue! this is obviously a pretence to cut down all the beautiful trees of gulshan-2 and make some timber money. this will not be the first time people would wake up to see all the trees gone overnight; this happened during the bnp government.
