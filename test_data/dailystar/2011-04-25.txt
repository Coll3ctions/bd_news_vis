deaths in damascus
the regime of president bashar al-assad has clearly opted for a violent suppression of anti-government demonstrations in syria. that is rather ironic given that only days ago the syrian strongman was busy giving every indication of heeding the people's voice and even went to the extent of lifting the decades-old emergency. with as many as a hundred people dead over two days as a result of deadly government attacks on protesters, assad's overtures now have been rendered hollow. the lifting of the emergency has turned out to be a sham, with the regime not at all embarrassed about the severe measures it has taken to cling to power. view the page sports

stop persecution
'child and women' is become an often victims of harassment that result in permanent physical and psychological damage and profoundly alter the course of a girl's life. the harassment manifests itself in different ways, ranging from verbal abuse and sexual innuendo to abduction, acid-throwing and rape. the law enforcing agencies, women associations and other awareness societies of our country should give sincere effort to change the tradition of bangladesh. every child is influenced by parents. if father will oppress the mother mentally or physically it will affect the child. children in bangladesh are affected. so we should be aware of child rights and women's rights which have been declared by united nations.
be fair to rickshawpullers
most of the people in our country do not have car but the policymakers make law for the rich people who have car and they have already banned rickshaws in several roads and are going to ban in other roads. but a rickshaw occupies very less space and usually carries two or three persons (including rickshaw puller). whereas a private car occupies 2 to 5 times space than that of a rickshaw and on many occasions car carries only the driver. if a car enters a narrow road the whole road is blocked. but our policymakers never tried to ban and restrict the entrance of car in the narrow lanes because they have cars.
oms corruption
through the oms programme government is selling rice to the poor people for tk 10 to 12 per kg. several newspapers published that, there is widespread corruption going on like black marketing and hoarding of rice meant for oms. last sunday rab recovered 3000 sacks of rice and wheat from nine warehouses at kawran bazaar. after getting information from sources, rab personnel raided different warehouses of kawran bazaar who were hoarding oms rice and wheat. people are eagerly waiting to see what action will be taken against those culprits who are involved in oms rice and wheat corruption. otherwise, the programme will not meet up poor peoples expectations.
empower consumers
consumers are supposed to enjoy the right to get quality products at fair prices. but very few of us, regardless of our literacy or illiteracy are concerned about our rights. all of us are silent consumer and do not raise our voice against the unethical businessmen. taking the opportunity of our unconsciousness regarding our rights, the unethical businessmen are kicking our rights. but consumers have legitimate rights to protest the unlawful activities of the businessmen such as unconditional price hike, selling low quality products, keeping expired products in store etc. i also request our commerce ministry to take initiative to empower the consumers through educating them about their rights and responsibilities before taking other meaningless steps.
save the archaeological sites
our country has great archaeological sites. age old buildings, monuments, temples, sculptures are the golden components of our diversified culture and tradition. it is matter of great panic that, of late, in the name of 'construction', some of such archaeological sites are being demolished. a series of reports depicting the scenario of archaeological sites has been recently published in ds. though in some instances, govt. tries to save these sites from destruction but sometimes govt. takes the role of audience! moreover, it must be said that, such kinds of sites play a major role in our economy as thousands of tourists come every year for visiting these. the govt. must play a major role in saving our tradition!
good governance
good governance in bangladesh is far from the actual consonance of the term. there are several factors and issues that are constraining the very process of good governance. the major factors are corruption, inefficiency of bureaucracy, politicization of administration, non-observance of the rule of law etc. the main issues and problems for ensuring good governance in bangladesh are, corruption, inefficiency of bureaucracy, and political interference in administration, nepotism, improper and non-observance of the rule of law, improper use of resources. separate treatment for each problem should be meted out.
publish the report
the much vaunted probe report on share debacle whose excerpts being published by few leading dailies branding some big wigs with their pictures as most corrupt manipulators who gobbled up thousand of crores of investors money remained defiant due to government's inaction to put the report public and punish the offenders. it is also strange to notice that our chatty finance minister has all of a sudden become tight lipped and kept him aloof from giving any briefings concerning the report. his behaviour seems mysterious as well as the sincerity of the government towards publishing the report becomes questionable. we therefore, urge the government to publish the report immediately and punish the culprits.
rule with justice
ibrahim khaled's suggestion that only martial law can ensure trial of alleged stocks offenders is substantiated by the government's denial to publish the report immediately. i think he spoke his mind throwing away caution. it is natural that it ruffles a few feathers at the helm. it is usual that the rich and the unjust will always oppose the justice. why don't you debunk khaled's suggestion by punishing the culprit immediately without terming his suggestion seditious? corruption in all sectors has taken away people's prestige and protection. i think the government should follow hazrat ali's suggestion of good governance-'one's administration will succeed only if he governs with concern for justice, equity, probity and the prosperity of all.' only then we will be out of a quagmire of being a banana republic.
humiliating bauls
your editorial page write-up on the matter, on 13th.april as the outcome of some half-baked (or raw, for that matter) and definitely illiterate cleric of pangsha, needs to be trimmed to size, and slowly baked in solitary confinement (if possible, perpetually) in a prison for his criminal instigation that led to the humiliation of bauls. these ignorant and illiterate clerics are ignoring the fundamental teachings of islam. which insists on tolerance and acceptance of all people of all faith. these clerics are criminals according to the norms of islam. they are public enemies to society and religion and its free practices. they deserve harsh punishment for encouraging such criminal acts. we the readers will appreciate if you kindly follow up on the matter to report on what action has been taken on the cleric (raw or half-baked) and his followers for their unlawful activities.
du students on rampage
student vandalism on the panthopath reported in all bangladeshi dailies over violation of traffic rules by the bus driver which was carrying the du students, is a case of serious disregard to traffic law by the students. disregard to law of the land by the students and taking law in their hands are totally unacceptable in all norms. our future leaders should not learn making and breaking laws of their own whatever situation may be on the ground. we ask remedies of all social problems from the government. teachers, parents and leaders should come forward to remove this social disease together. teachers and parents should implant family values to their wards and the government should handle the vandalism with iron hand.

the other day the director of the film rubaiyat hussain while speaking on bbc tv about this film said that the story of a love affair between a pakistani soldier and a bengali girl shown in the film was her perspective as a woman of the terrible times that the bengalis were going through then.
rab and liton
the maiming of liton by rab, which is a manifestation of brutality in a civil society! first they called liton as a violent member of an armed gang; and now they say that he is an incidental victim of their free for all shooting; allegedly in self defence! surprisingly, liton never came in the lime of fire of the 'criminals' who were shooting at rab, but the highly trained (?) shooters of rab got liton in their line of indiscriminate, inaccurate and senseless fire! this reflects on the standard of training and professional shooting skills of the rab! full compensation should be paid to liton from the salary of the team involved in shooting liton; and if and when he is fit for life, he must be employed in rab, as their office support desk staff; in all justice and fair play!
bill clinton dedicates boyhood home
it is heartening to learn that former us president bill clinton has recently dedicated his boyhood home in hope, arkansas as part of the national park service. i fully endorse his feelings as he said ' my grandfather taught me to see people without regard for the colour of their skin” i sincerely wish that this feeling of bill clinton spread to all over united states and get into practical act. barack obama, in my view, has a great responsibility to work towards dissolving black and white differences and bridging the gap created between the americans practicing different religions. equal treatment for all has to be ensured.
bangladeshi scientists
the world has known us for many reasons, for our culture, our history and our bravery! but still the world doesn't know that we are not very far from science and technology! some great bangladeshis have invented some useful things like, dr. anis rahman- received the nasa nanotech brief's nano-50 innovator award for 2008. this reward recognizes the top 50 technologies, products, and innovators that have significantly impacted.

gadaffi in september 1969 led a coup d'etat which had countrywide support and adroitly unified the nation's 150 odd tribes which the turkish and italian colonial rule failed to unite.by retaining libya's oil wealth for the benefit of its people, gadaffi created a socialist glory that has the highest gdp in africa, less than 5% of the population classified as poor and poverty level below that of holland. with no unemployment life expectancy of 75 years was the highest in africa. gadaffi's little green book reveals how thoughtful and enlightened a leader he is, but foreign intelligence agencies have been stoking up dissent in the east of the country for almost 30 years and nowadays terming him as a “mad dictator," "bloody tyrant" and accusing him of committing crime against his own people where hardly any crime takes place and only rebels and traitors are dealt with harshly.
