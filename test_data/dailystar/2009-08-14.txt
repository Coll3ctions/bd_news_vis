city traffic in chaos
there is absolutely no question that the city's traffic system is today on the verge of collapse. if one goes through the mess of the last few days on the roads, one will have a fairly vivid idea of the travails citizens are being put through. dhaka now has a population of no fewer than 14 million people. in contrast, the road network that should have been available for the daily movements of such a vast population is simply not there. where a modern city should have 25 per cent of its area marked off for roads, bangladesh's capital has only seven per cent. that is indeed a shame. where the road network is severely limited in nature, the number of vehicles on the roads is not. altogether 200,000 vehicles (and among them are buses, trucks and cars) hit the road every day. if now you add the 20,000 vehicles which are introduced on the roads every year, you get a clearer picture of the confusion.

only rickshaws responsible?
recently i saw a very thought-provoking cartoon depicting the usual scene of flashy, stretched-out, gas guzzling monstrosities (ggms) stuck bumper-to-bumper on the city road. no other mode of public transport was visible - no buses, minibuses, haulers, cngs, rickshaws etc. what was revealing were the thoughts of every driver and occupant of the cars. each was saying the same thing “if all these idiots had taken the bus, i would be home by now.”

look into it
i would like to draw the kind attention of the dmp authorities which are managing transport to and fro from shamoli crossing to adabar. every morning around 8:00am, i used to face a serious jam at shamoli crossing while coming out from adabar area by car due to huge influx of cars, microbuses, mini buses, large buses plus rickshaws. this is pick hour. so, all the people in and around shamoli crossing need to go to offices, schools and to their respective destinations. it is very surprising that there is a useless road connecting adabar ring road to mirpur road near the bus counter of hanif, super bus and other bus counters, the road is blocked by some pillars at the end approaching mirpur road. so, no vehicle could go through it. why is this road not usable? if this road is opened to public transport, then all the transports taking left turn coming from adabar ring road do not have to come to shamoli crossing. all the transports going towards gabtoli/technical can use that connecting road from adabar ring road to mirpur road.

a day on the beach
cigarette butts, poly bags don't fall from sky, they fall from our hands. the elements that pollute our beaches are the things that we dump in the shorelines; these elements are the things we use regularly. each year, ocean conservancy -- in partnership with a network of volunteer organizations and individuals -- provides a compelling global snapshot of marine and inland waterway debris all over the world. in this year's ocean conservancy's 23rd annual international coastal cleanup, nearly 400,000 volunteers will participate in 104 countries and locations. locally represented by kewkradong bangladesh, this year's initiative in our country will include over 400 volunteers from prominent universities, colleges and different organizations from dhaka, chittagong and cox's bazaar.
marine litter
problems
-marine litter (ml) is found in all oceans and seas
lifecycle model for marine litter
a key challenge in developing guidelines for the assessment of marine litter is to identify the major processes that control the entry and / or removal of litter from the oceans and also the transformations that occur during the lifecycle of any given litter item (e.g. when floating litter sinks to become benthic litter or is cast onto a beach to become beach cast litter). in developing any sampling strategy it is necessary to establish a model of the system being investigated which makes explicit the various assumptions about how the system works. here following we provide a systems model that describes the dynamics of marine litter from source to sink. this model can be used to visualise the “lifecycle” of marine litter by tracking the various pathways that litter can take from the point of discard and through the system until it is eventually removed or decomposed. the model, represented schematically in figure 1, provides a simplified view of the key parameters and processes that can be measured or inferred from an appropriately configured marine litter sampling strategy. in summary, the model identifies a set of key state variables (rectangular boxes) that represent “pools” of material that are in dynamic flux within the system. these pools include floating litter, benthic litter and beach cast litter. the size of the litter pools are defined in terms of quantities of material (e.g. tonnes of floating litter or the numbers of particular items) and thereby represent the sum total of material within the system under consideration. dynamical processes (indicated in figure 1 by arrows) illustrate the flux rates or movement of litter from one pool to another. these values are measured and reported as rate functions (e.g. tonnes of litter discarded per year or tonnes of litter being cast onto beaches per year). in general terms these flux rates can be measured either directly, by observation of amounts of material being transported, or indirectly through inferences based on changes in the amounts of litter in each pool over time. the model can be used to illustrate some simple truths about the longterm options for the management of marine litter including:
