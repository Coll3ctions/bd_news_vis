high court's tough stand on deaths in police custody
the tough approach taken by the high court on the issue of custodial deaths is welcome and encouraging. the hard stance it has adopted toward the police, through warning them that not only must such deaths not recur but also that earlier deaths be investigated in full should go a long way in ensuring the rule of law. the tragedy, indeed the irony for us has been that those responsible for ensuring the security of citizens' lives are today themselves putting an end to some of those lives with impunity. we have said repeatedly, and so have others, that the death of any individual in rab or police or any other custody is not only a violation of human rights but also plain murder on the part of the security and law and order forces. the most unfortunate aspect of it all is that neither the police nor rab have taken such truths into consideration. worse, their actions have been defended in various semantic ways by successive governments since the middle of the decade. in the end, it is the country which has been shamed before its own citizens and before global conscience.

development budget
preparation of budget is a significant phenomenon for the country. effective implementation is equally significant. when a budget is prepared the utopian way it does not help the nation. on the other hand, when a pragmatic budget is implemented inefficiently it does not bring desired well-being to the nation. a few renowned economists assessed the development budget 2010-11 as not achievable after observing the presentation in parliament by finance minister ama muhith. they did not make any significant comment on fiscal measures as well as on different allocations. they thought from their experience that the present administrative structure and procedure is not suitable for implementing such a large allocation in adp. i would like to echo them. if the government does keep the existing procedure of project approval and project implementation as it is, the budgetary allocations cannot be utilized properly.
drug addiction
every now and then we find news in the electronic and print media that drug addiction has become widespread across the country. statistics show drug addiction is predominant in the least developed countries like bangladesh where the people, especially the young, are involved in it. drugs, being a curse, snatch away valuable lives of young people. many innocents are victimised by it in the early days of their lives. all hopes and aspirations of their parents are lost. recently, our country turned into a regular route of drugs where the number of drug addicted people is more than 50 lakh. according to police reports, more than two thousand people are very much active in this business. they are making money countrywide selling drugs. sometimes they are caught red handed but afterwards they are freed. i want to draw the attention of the home ministry to the following points:
interpreting hartal
the ""sho-fol"" hartal of bnp and ""be-fol"" hartal in the view of al and ""nis-fol & ku-fol"" hartal for the public just passed away. mr jainul abedin faruqe rushed to meet the speaker with the demand that mr. annie be sent abroad for higher treatment, otherwise they won't attend js. moreover, public interest notice to evacuate the cantonment residence of opposition leader must not be served to her anymore.
selection of candidate
selection of candidate is always crucial and the result in chittagong city election has proved it again. mr. monzur alam who is best known as a sober and gentle person has beaten mr. mohiuddin chowdhury handsomely. the people of ctg wanted a change in the mayoral race as they were utterly disgusted with the ctg city management. perhaps so do the dhaka city people. dhaka city corporation has miserably failed to take care of the city under the leadership of sadek hossain khoka.
police excesses
i refer to the news on the captioned subject published in your daily on 28. 6.2010. from the news it appeared that on the day of hartal on 27.6.2010, rab men entered into the house of mr. mirza abbas, ransacked and even beat up inmates.
jamaat leaders
on june 30, the daily star published a pictorial news item mentioning that the top brass of the jamaat -- motiur rahman nizami, ali ahsan mohammad mojahid, and delwar hossain sayedee -- were arrested as they had failed to comply with earlier summons for court appearances in a case filed on charges of hurting religious sentiments of the muslims.
rickshaws banned
may i kindly ask the local administration under whose instructions the one and only passenger carrier of the middle and lower middle class groups which is rickshaw has been banned from plying the many connecting roads of uttara to the main roads. one such road is kazi jashimuddin road. as i was heading to my office from my home located at the jashimuddin road of uttara, my rickshaw was stopped on the road by the baton wielding police officer. after inquiring the officer told me that this road had been made off limits to rickshaws. i said who made it off limits he said i don't know. i said then how will i go to the office? he gave me a blank look as if i asked him a very weird question. i again said, “it is raining, please allow me to go.” but all my pleas fell into the deaf ears of the officer. is dhaka slowly becoming a city for the car owners only?. because the cars are allowed on all roads, irrespective of whether it is wide or narrow. this treatment is totally uncivilized. it is the duty of the traffic department to maintain the transport movement system efficiently. it is really not a fair way to ban the most sought after transport of the mass people.
whose baby is it?
i read in the newspapers, more than once, the latest was the statement by mr. ashraful islam, the honourable minister, that "chhatra league" is not their baby; so they (i.e. parental party) cannot take the blame or responsibility for their misdeeds. then who are they? how dare the boys, abandoned in the mid-way, could create terror on the street and fought battles with the opposition activists during their hartal day! i also fail to realize how so much of beating and wounding pickets including senior leaders and parliament members take place without orders from the authorities?
justice system and media
when we have faith in the judiciary which we believe is independent, why should the media and some sections indulge in campaigns against the judgment? justice cannot be influenced by signature campaigns and demonstrations. the media outlets are reacting now more than they reacted when the crimes were committed. the common man is tired. s/he wants the media to find everlasting solutions to prevent the recurrence of such crimes so that they can be hailed as a true pillar of democracy. all successful newspapers are ceaselessly querulous and bellicose. they never defend anyone or anything if they can help it; if the job is forced on them, they tackle it by denouncing someone or something else.
population boom
yesterday our daughter drove us through the vast expanses of houston, texas. it seemed to me that we travelled like from teknaf to tetulia in bangladesh. interestingly except for cars on the road and cattle's grazing on the fields, we did not come across a single person during this journey. imagine, no people in an area as big as bangladesh, whereas bangladesh has a population of about 160 million or so. perhaps there are many more places like houston on this planet earth where we live in.
teachers' status
the teachers of govt. high schools have been demanding first class status for a long time. in the past, no govt. took any initiative in this regard. the present govt. has decided to give second-class status to the teachers. i think it won't solve the problem at all. attracting and keeping talented and capable young people in the teaching profession is only possible when they are provided with attractive remuneration and status. to produce a competent generation by imparting quality education, i would like to make some points.
hartal and a citizen
i must congratulate opposition parties which called hartal after 1370 days because it came to me as a heavy down-pour after a continuum of unabated drought. though i don't support it, i enjoyed the day to my heart's content. my activities included finishing a 'complex' job involving a national bank and rajuk. as it was a hartal-day, my sunrise was late in the morning followed by late breakfast.
walkway in dhanmondi
the walkway on the dhanmondi lake parallel to road no. 10 ends along the mirpur road as the lake ends there. the fence, separating the walkway from the footpath, along mirpur road makes it useless. people coming into dhanmondi r.a. from the east end of the lake cannot use the path and vice versa. the pathway staring from the bridge (road # 8 bridge) on the lake at the juncture of roads 8, 10 and 7 after an interruption by panshi begins again from just beside eastern wall of panshi restaurant and continues to the east end. since the pathway between panshi and mirpur road is artificially separated from the pathway scheme on the lake, fitness lovers do not use this portion of the pathway and people coming into dhanmondi cannot use this because of the fence. however, it has been observed that the fence is repeatedly trampled and broken by passers-by that seek and need an access through this pathway. disuse encourages undesirable elements to occupy the space and dirt piles up making it further unusable. the artificially divided pathway can be integrated into the pathway scheme easily by a few yards of connecting path through behind panshi making it useable.
