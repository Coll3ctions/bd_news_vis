emphasis on mobile banking
thanks to star business and mr. sajjadur rahman for a detailed report on mobile banking titled "mobile banking rattles banks". since this writer has been working on mobile banking and other related banking products to integrate bangladesh market and monetary practices with the rest of the world, thought it to be imperative to put in humble explanations to the concerns raised by other banking service entities and colleagues. concern against anything new being launched is a phenomenon that is quite natural as human beings. however, having the benefit of being able to refer to the rich history of economic development, we have learnt - `change is the only constant thing in this world'. we did try to obstruct nation's subscription to submarine cable network with the plea that it will cause a leakage of national secrecy and readers are possibly aware, how we had to repair the dent of being indifferent to accepting changes for better communication to get into the information super way. however, to the best of my knowledge most of the concerns mentioned in the article raised by some banks have already been addressed by the initial proposal submitted by the mobile operators. view the page metropolitan

sustainable development
bangladesh faces great challenges in coping with the infrastructure and service requirements of its growing population. access to food, sanitation, pure drinking water, healthcare, education and social security are obviously inadequate in both urban and rural areas of our country. poverty still remains a major environmental concern. poverty means a lack of income, a permanent state of vulnerability and lack of access to resources. over 40% of the population of our country live in abject poverty. poverty, population growth and environment have strong linkages in our country. it is critical to check population growth to achieve sustainable development. because the growing numbers of the poor are forced by the few powerful rich to over utilize the environmental resources and put strain on their carrying capacity while the environmental degradation further limits access to resources for the poor. poverty has devastating effects on people's lives.

america's dwindling firepower
with the united states bogged down in two wars in iraq and afghanistan and facing terrorist threats around the world and a hostile iran, it can no longer fight multiple wars. despite its massive nuclear arsenals, the united states lacks manpower and political will to fight such many-sided wars. the soviet union was a formidable superpower with far larger number of nuclear warheads than the united states and yet it could not continue the war in afghanistan and eventually collapsed when it could not sustain the burden of war.
back to square one?
our politics is suffering from a sort of sidr effect, thanks to our past political culture, based on utter indiscipline, external and internal. today the political leadership is without a sense of direction. the entrenched effect has to be erased. inside the parties [especially the two major ones], there are chaos and disintegration and terrible splits. it is too late for the released top leaders to create seamless internal bonds. the effects of the fallouts would linger for a long time. the voters feel unsure of the near future, not to speak of the long-term view.
set up more universities
this refers to lutfor rahman's letter under the above title on 27 august 2008. i would like to add some more points to the letter. i can hardly support the opinion that increasing the number of universities in the country's context is important. undoubtedly, the number of certified students is increasing every year. it is also true that we have an acceptable number of government and private universities(govt. approved) in the country, though the number of high standard universities is very few. the undeniable fact is that we need some quality universities in our country. every year these universities, especially private universities, are admitting a large number of students and producing some so called "graduates and undergraduates" , whatever their merit might be.
