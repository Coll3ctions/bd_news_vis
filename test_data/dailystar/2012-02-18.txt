when on the morning of february 12 newspapers ran the news of the gruesome killing of a journalist couple sagar sarowar and his wife meherun runi in their rajabazar apartment in the city, people went numb with shock, horror and panic. once in a while death becomes a matter of more than personal grief to the bereaved family. it comes as a cruel reminder of the social disruption in the country. in a media-driven environment, private distress is often catapulted into public arena. most ominously, when media people are killed, then all hopes for recovery of the society from the quagmire of politics and social conflicts are lost.

terror changes its spots
the terror strike targeting an israeli diplomat in new delhi in february 13 2012 has suddenly raised the concerns to higher levels both for the police and intelligence agencies - the primary instruments of defence against terrorism in any country. this is not the first strike against a soft target. july 13, 2011 witnessed bomb blasts in mumbai's dadar, opera house and zaveri bazaar area, leaving 26 dead and 131 injured. on september 7, 2011, the delhi high court was shaken by a briefcase bomb, which killed 12 people and injured 76. however, the choice of israel's diplomatic corps as the target of the strike raises both the pitch and the implications.

the sounds of silence
“the deep silence of this immense forest is what first strikes the unwary visitor who comes prepared to be intimidated by the world's largest natural mangrove forest tract. instead one is mesmerized by its unbelievable tranquility” are the opening words in the moveable feast that is enayetullah khan's book, the bangladesh sundarbans . elsewhere, he writes in lyrical language: “in the sheer elemental wilderness characteristic of the sundarbans, it is not difficult to imagine that there is something mystical in the deep and ancient silence that encompasses the land. the silence resides like a great echo that haunts every rustle of a leaf and every snap of a twig under the unwary tourist's foot. whether forager, tourist, or hunter armed with rifles, intruders in the forest experience a humbling awe in this silence that punctuates the dangers of the forest.”
indians against democracy
growing up in india in the 1970s and 80s, i often heard people in upper-caste middle class circles say that parliamentary democracy was ill-suited to the country. recoiling from populist politicians who pandered to the poor, many indians solemnly invoked the example of singapore's leader lee kuan yew. here was an oxbridge-educated and suitably enlightened autocrat, who suffered no nonsense about democracy, and, furthermore, believed firmly in the efficacy of publicly caning even minor breakers of the law. devising his wise policies with the help of experts and technocrats, he simply imposed them on the population. lee kuan yew's success in transforming a city-state into a major economic power was apparent to all: clean, shiny, efficient, and prosperous singapore, the very antithesis of corrupt and squalor-prone india.
dreams of a better world
ambiguity is a typical feature of modem poetry. it is so because readers always find it difficult to understand the state of mind of a poet that was really at work while writing a poem. a poem usually appears different to different readers. it also depends on their age, attitude and mentality. what interests you today may not do so tomorrow. the way you interpret a poem today may appear way different tomorrow.
