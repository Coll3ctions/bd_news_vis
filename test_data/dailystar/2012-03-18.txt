the future of asian banking
this week was my first visit to bangkok since the floods in december. the city seems to have recovered and the economy is on the mend. after an estimated 0.1 percent growth in real gdp in 2011, the international institute of finance (iif) is forecasting a robust 7 percent growth recovery in 2012, helped by a multi-year fiscal stimulus that would bring the fiscal deficit to an estimated 5.5 percent of gdp for the fiscal year 2011-2012. the package of fiscal stimulus included a 40 percent hike in minimum wages from april and an aggressive cut in corporate income tax rate from current 30 percent to 23 percent and a further cut to 20 percent for 2013. this would put thai corporate tax rate closer to those of its neighbours. the combination of increase in minimum wage rates and generous price support programme for rice mean that the government is serious about tackling income gaps and pushing consumption.
