the issue of cross-border crimes
our attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed about border-related issues in an internal security report on the post-bdr mutiny conditions. like everyone else apprehensive about such conditions, we too are worried and for obvious reasons. we note, though, that the new director general of the bdr has been sounding upbeat about matters being under control in the border regions. he states that cross border crimes have been declining, even though the security report does not appear to substantiate his claims. we hope, however, that his optimism is well placed. overall, though, there are very plausible reasons why the country's borders today arouse our collective concern.

trees
trees present us flowers, the most beautiful thing on earth. they keep the atmosphere cool and bring down rain. yet some people are so ungrateful that they recklessly cut down trees to draw quick profit. the little forests in chittagong, khulna, dinajpur, and tangail areas are shrinking day by day owing to increase in population. as a result, our forests cannot meet our timber requirement. to make our country prosperous and to check air pollution and to save our earth from greenhouse effects, we should plant more and more trees. trees make the earth beautiful.
the metropolis
the main problems of dhaka city are traffic congestions, scarcity of water, load shedding and lack of accommodation, since there are too many people in dhaka.
no electricity!
much has been said about load shedding. many initiatives have been taken so far, but no remedy is in sight. it is intolerable for us as the frequency of load shedding is growing higher day by day. we all know that power is indispensable for the overall development of a country, but we have done nothing in this sector. consequently, our country is facing acute power shortage.
consider our views
honourable prime minister and her cabinet members give answers to the questions asked by members of parliament. i think it is one kind of accountability and transparency of the democratic government to the nation.
load shedding and electricity bill
within 24 hours we suffer 6-10 times from load shedding and there is no electricity supply for 4-8 hours daily.
power crisis
the generating capacity of power as assured by the present government will be increased up to 5,000mw within three years from the date of their taking office to run the government. but the honourable finance minister's statement that it is not possible within three years because of financial as well as various other reasons has disappointed the whole nation.
grading system
it is alarming to see that those students having a+ both in ssc and hsc don't get admission in a public university. the quality of teaching is falling day by day. the method of giving extra numbers in exams sheet should be changed. the number should be given according to the students' merit.
may corruption live long!
honestly (!) we are very happy. we have won the battle against the toughest enemy of our beloved (!) corruption. the government should declare a one-week vacation to celebrate it as we are proceeding well to win back our lost place in world corruption championship!
empowerment of executive magistrate
a bill of criminal procedure code titled 'code of criminal procedure (amendment) act 2009' is now on table of the present session of parliament to empower the executive magistrates. that creates great suspicion and confusion, whether the present government really wants to separate the judiciary from the executive. it is our ill-luck that in the year 1972 our heroic people framed a constitution where it was clearly stated that the judiciary must be separated from the executive and our political leaders including the father of the nation bangabandu sheikh mujibur rahman said in parliament, “judiciary shall be separated from the administration to ensure justice for people.” people of this country are still waiting after long 38 years for real justice and effective separation of judiciary from the executive. one of the framers of our constitution, mr. suranjit sen gupta mp, is now also the chairman of the present parliamentary committee and the daughter of bangabandhu is now the leader of the house. it is very much clear that some vested quarter is working for undermining the spirit of the historic supreme court verdict on separation of judiciary on a lame argument, that without the magistracy power administration cannot run effectively, which is not true.

digital bangladesh

three projects
i saw a report a few days back in most of the national dailies that the government is planning to have metro rail or subway at dhaka city. indeed this is very good news for 125 million city dwellers. but if i am not wrong the then 4 party government also initiated this mega project to save the commuters of dhaka city from the trouble of long traffic congestion. lots of studies have been carried out in the last five years to ease the traffic jam & a strategic transport plan has been chalked out to get rid of this acute problem. experts observed that metro rail or subway would be the best solution for the huge population. i would like to draw a few points on a recent statement made by our communications minister in parliament on this mega project. he has informed the jatiya sansad that the government is planning to implement this project, which must be appreciated. in bangladesh, this is a completely new concept & i am afraid whether proper feasibility study has been carried out or not. to the best of my knowledge, this subway train requires uninterrupted power supply to run to & from. on the other hand, a local firm has put forward a proposal for letter of intent to the government. it is not clear whether this local company has any previous experience of this sort of job. our honourable communications minister has also informed parliament that they are going to start another mega project "padma multipurpose bridge project" by next year which will cost around tk 11, 000 crore approx. so far i have seen that the government has by this time got commitment of about tk 7,000 crore from donors like world bank, adb, jica & kuwait fund for development , the rest 4,000 crore is yet to be collected from other sources. as we all know that global recession is persisting & the effect of it has already been felt in the usa, europe and south east asia. "padma multipurpose bridge project" is also an election pledge of this government & we hope that this government will try to implement this project as 75 % of funds has already been committed by major donors. but the subway or metro rail would require another approx tk 7,000 to 9,000 crore to complete the whole project.
