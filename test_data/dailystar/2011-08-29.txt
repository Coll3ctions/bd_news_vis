with eid-ul-fitr fast approaching, we are witnessing a rush on the part of large masses of people for their homes in various parts of the country. in fact, the rush commenced days ago, with families streaming out to their villages by train, launches, buses and all other available means of transport. the usual sight of trains being packed to capacity and beyond on such occasions, with hundreds of people precariously riding on the roof, has been there again. a similar picture is to be seen with buses and river vessels. the idea of going home is one that has generally outweighed thoughts of safety.

an opportunity, don’t mess it up
it is now largely accepted that bangladesh should utilise its unique geographical location to be the lynchpin of (sub)regional transport and energy connectivity so as to accelerate its economic growth performance. the recent global economic crises have once again alerted us to the need to access regional demand to counteract recession in the developed economies. thankfully, the present government through a bold political initiative has unleashed a new frontier of economic cooperation among bangladesh, india and other regional countries. however, the current challenge is to give shape to this development opportunity on the ground, remaining mindful of our core national interests.

a citizen's plea to the prime minister
madam prime minister
for dignity and freedom
the people of libya are showing that the universal pursuit of dignity and freedom is far stronger than the iron fist of a dictator. libya is a resource-rich country with a relatively well-educated citizenry that has demonstrated courage under fire. the country lacks institutions and political experience, but not talent and commitment. the international community should prepare to support libyan efforts to take charge of the country's destiny once gaddafi leaves the scene. rebel fighters danced under fireworks in the heart of tripoli as they celebrated a stunning advance into the capital, meeting weak resistance from forces loyal to colonel gaddafi and claiming that his regime is finished.
fixing amount of fitra
it is customary to fix fitra in terms of staple food of one country. bangladesh has been created on the basis of our own culture. our staple food is rice. every year we see a committee, set for this purpose, fix the rate of fitra in terms of wheat, kismis, khurma, etc., which is not our staple food. and the people whom we usually give fitra are the poorest people of our country. so, i request the people of bangladesh to give fitra in terms of the price of rice, not in terms of atta or kismis or khurma.
poor joj miah!
manik and laskar's informative report in detail, headlined in your front page on august 25th, lets the cat out of the bag! poor joj miah! words fail to describe his misery. however, he is lucky to be alive. the criminal tendencies of bnp are evident in this gruesome public attack on its opposing political party! their great mastermind, now absconding from the law, must be buzzing the internet, advising mummy on how joj miah can be liquidated! the top cid official mentioned in the first line of your report, and the others in the know, and all others, who used their power and official position in masking the real criminals involved in the mass bombing including the then home minister needs to be criminally tried and given maximum punishment, to set an example, the sooner the better!
is it ethical?
the shipping minister shahjahan khan is annoyed with the media because he thinks media is not representing him correctly about the driving license issue. but he did not deny completely the recommendations made by the transport labour unions to give thousands of people driving licenses without following the proper procedures. if he is the president of the transport union federation, then can he avoid his responsibility with this proposal? is it ethical for a minister to hold this position of labour union? the prime minister has asked all the ministers to submit their property statements. i think she should also ask them to publicly announce if any of them has any connection with any private business or unions, and if yes, then the government should remove them from the ministerial posts. when will we have ministers who have some self dignity to resign whenever there is a public outcry about some misdeeds or inefficiencies concerning their ministries?
bring life to the garden
god gave us a land of plenty. its green luscious landscape is so soothing for our eyes and souls. it is full of beautiful flora and fauna. it is a garden full of birds chirping happily and the children playing joyously. we need not fight the famine as it is seen in the horn of africa or the harsh cold of the arctic. its fertile land grows food and fruits all the year round. but from that time when an ogre came and behaved possessively prohibiting the innocent children to play in that garden and built a wall around the garden to prevent them from entering it, a perpetual winter of death set in. it began with pilkhana that broke county's defense system, and then the marauding hordes of death attacked the whole body of the country from every direction stabbing our sea and land, bleeding us unconscious so that the monster can rule supreme. i think when this ogre will find his garden barren for long with no flowers blooming and no birds singing, it will relent and bring back the just and the innocent into the garden to bring back life in it. all the ice of deaths and torture then vanish from roads, planes, hills, forests and glades of the garden. life will then jump up everywhere with air clear of envy, hunger and fear.

bnp should go to parliament

dear minister, please give it a thought!
the condition of the highways throughout the country is in the worst form at present.dear minister, why don't you do something awesome now which will be hailed by the commuters of the whole country? did you happen to have a 100/200 km road journey recently to any district? if no, please have a drive to tangail, my district, only 100 km from dhaka, and experience the harrowing road journey. while travelling to tangail, you have to go past epz (if you take savar road) where a number of foreign companies are situated and hundreds of foreigners are plying this dilapidated road risking their lives every day.
hats off to veterans
on 16th august 2011, what we saw in the parliament would simply remain memorable for a longer period of time to us and which clearly shows democracy is still there in this country. the whole nation is upset with some ministers and questioning their commitment towards the country. those ministers not only made the pm upset but also created a big public dissatisfaction. in that session two veterans, tofael ahmed and suranjit sengupta blasted their ministers in front of the pm which showed us that still some care about people. we found the communications minister baffled with this sudden outburst, and luckily the finance minister was not present that day, otherwise he would have gone through heavy criticism. what really upset me were the opposition leaders' comments, stating that awami league had internal conflicts and they must resign, and they also asked for early election. they should have appreciated these unprecedented activities in that parliament where ministers were rebuked, which people watched live on tv, for not performing their duties properly. please respect democracy and appreciate things that deserve respect.
we need modern highways
i would like to draw your attention regarding the publication featuring road accidents dated 16/08/2011. no doubt it is high time that we should have road dividers separating our single/ dual carriageways. however, concrete/ steel railing dividers are not sufficient, there should be central reservations or medians in between the dividers with sufficient width (usually less than the width of a lane) for reduction of head-on accidents and dissipating force of impact. if philippines can have modern highways like the developed nations, why can't we have them?
irresponsible remarks of the ministers
at present the government is in trouble for the remarks of different ministers. irresponsible statements from key ministers are regrettable. advice like “eat less” and “education is not must for drivers” disgusted the general people. they are now expecting appropriate steps from the prime minister to resolve the public sufferings. people are also expecting qualified persons as key ministries who will ensure public interest because this government came to power with strong commitments to ensure public welfare.
