al's extended meet decision for movement
the decision taken at an extended meeting of the awami league, based on the sentiment of its grassroots leaders and workers, not to participate in the on-going dialogue and general elections unless party chief sheikh hasina is freed introduces a worrying new element into the political dynamics of the moment. the concern is fundamentally that if the al sticks to its decision to boycott the voting, a situation will likely arise that can only complicate an already fraught political atmosphere. we at this newspaper have stated earlier that our politicians and our political parties must put the national interest above any other considerations. it is especially at a time like the present that such maturity is called for.

against the backdrop of intermittent food crises in the country, the government decision to allocate funds to the tune of tk. 622 crore to carry out agricultural research is a timely step. the research endeavours will be directed towards finding ways and means to increase production of essential agricultural commodities to meet the need for food. the burgeoning population and growing demand for food make such research all the more pressing at the moment. reportedly, the fund under the project titled national agricultural technology project (natp) will be distributed in two phases, one for research and another for extension services. it has also been said that a sizeable portion of the fund will be spent for building an effective marketing system for farm products, project preparation and coordination. according to the government, the implementation of natp would raise production of crops, fish and livestock by 10 percent and increase farmers' income by 20 percent.
history can reclaim territory it has lost
the reformists, if they are really that, in the bangladesh nationalist party have clearly fallen on bad days. saifur rahman has made a safe exit out of the country. how he managed to do that and who let him go remains a mystery. mannan bhuiyan is in jail. both men have now seen fit to acknowledge once more the primacy of khaleda zia in the party. that has left major hafizuddin ahmed in the soup. the army officer-turned-footballer-turned-politician now tells us that the caretaker government has taken the country back by a decade. really? if that is an expression of wisdom, we the people will be content to confine ourselves to the kingdom of naivete.

medical ethics and advertisement
recently a letter was published in the daily star drawing the attention of all with comments on the ethical aspects of the medical profession. he is right that medical profession is different from others as a human service within the framework of strong ethical guidelines. it is not a mere provider of service commodities in exchange of money or price, rather beyond that. advertisements on medical practice and service that are common today are more reflective of general trading. there is dire lack of agreed consensus based moral code of conduct or guidelines in any arena where human interactions take place. moreover, the little which is there is fast evaporating. medical practice is one of them. it has been expected that a government should be the prime mover of this matter. but the government of bangladesh has endorsed the present commercialisation process of the medical practice by imposing vat on specialized medical practice.
democracy

politics of unfinished bridges
the respected senior assistant editor of ds in the above titled piece mentioned that the pwd, rhd and wdb carry out the task of construction of bridges, in places not necessary, due to political desire of the local mps. there are factual errors in it. first, the pwd is not concerned with construction of bridges, it is mainly the job of rhd and sometimes wdb. both the organisations are not in the good books of the mps as they conduct comprehensive feasibility study requiring much time before taking up any project, especially projects like construction of bridges which generally involve high costs. lged, however, is the eye candy of the mps as it is famous for its quick implementation with no or little feasibility study and donors also like it as it can spend funds very fast.the finance ministry and the line ministry of the engineering department concerned is responsible for timely disbursement of allocated funds in the four quarters of a financial year. sometimes progress of work may get hampered as funds are not released in time.

nargis
it was the responsibility of this government to warn the myanmar authorities that hurricane nargis was going to hit them. it was very odd to witness the government being relieved to watch that nargis was heading towards myanmar. this is not the way to develop good neighbourly relations. but couldn't this government warn the myanmar authorities? maybe such a high cost in life could have been avoided. cooperation in weather forecasting was necessary.

obviously dhaka is choking due to its size. pressure must be taken off this monster.
biofuel or food?
in recent decades, economics studies have gotten us used to seeing our shared property - the atmosphere, the water, natural resources, fauna and flora - as something to be taken for granted. land and water used in the past to grow food have been allocated for crops used to produce different types of biofuels, and the result has been an increase in food prices that today threatens quite a few countries. feasibility studies of these projects must take into account the costs which, in the past, we used to overlook. we must decide what we want to consume - automotive fuel or food? biofuels are a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional transport fuels and are climate-friendly. "not all renewable energy is totally 'green," wind turbines, for example, disrupt scenic panoramas, are often a source of noise pollution and harm fauna in their vicinity, such as birds. when calculating costs, a zero cost is affixed to birds, but it should not be forgotten that animals are part of the food chain, and the elimination of one species affects other species of flora and fauna and thus ecological balance is disrupted. many countries are converting rainforests, savannas, or grasslands to produce food-based biofuels. they are just thinking about the economic benefits and environmental impacts are not taken into consideration.
drug abuse
i was gratified to offer my expertise on preventing drug abuse among the young kids in a drug awareness programme for parents in a reputed english medium school in dhaka. we were a four member team who were involved in developing and facilitating the presentation. by the way i am not one of the seasoned social workers or an expert on the public health issues. and being an amateur, i, out of passion, opted to participate. in the back of my mind i always kept a strong wish to synchronize my passion and prior real life experiences to build a professional carrier in this field.
