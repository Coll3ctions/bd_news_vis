a budget with many fronts
these are our first impressions of the national budget 2009-10 etched in broad strokes to convey a sense of what the tenor and temper of the document are all about. more comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the budget with specific comments on its major aspects and directional thrusts will follow in the days to come.
withdrawal of 'politically motivated' cases
we are concerned at the government decision to recommend the withdrawal of 62 so-called politically motivated cases filed against awami league leaders during the times of both the bnp-jamaat government and the fakhruddin ahmed caretaker administration. by labeling these cases as politically motivated and thereby moving to exonerate the individuals involved in them demonstrates a disturbing lack of transparency. while we do not presume that everyone against whom cases were filed is guilty, we cannot also suggest that none of these individuals are innocent of the charges filed against them. making matters even more disturbing is the fact that a good number of these individuals have already been convicted of offences ranging from corruption to tax evasion. besides, there are yet cases that are ongoing and about which one cannot make any judgement at this stage.
the devil is in implementation
the 2009-10 budget has been announced amid much fanfare. thanks to the media and initiatives from various business groups, wide scale pre-budget aspirations of people received much air time. the reality, though, is that even the best of budgets and policy initiatives can fail due to issues beyond the control of the finance minister. the devil will not be in the details, but in implementation. so it's important to get the potential road-blocks identified.
vitamin a pills in the dock
health for the children is a part of overall public health care system. three major institutions -- the bureaucracy, ngos and private entrepreneurs are involved in implementation of health related policies and programs. besides, a score of international agencies operate health care programs for mothers and children under family welfare. all such concerned agencies are fully committed to the un convention on the rights of the child.

tigers' exit
bangladesh cricket team has indeed disappointed us by getting knocked out from the t20 world cup, losing to the minnows ireland by six wickets. it was a match where everybody was hoping for tigers' victory but the tigers were terrible in their approach from the very beginning. batting, bowling and fielding--in every department they were outplayed by the irish. there seemed to be no game plan. the weaknesses were very well exploited by ireland and it will be no exaggeration to say that apart from our top four batsmen, the other batters were frustrating, to say the least. even captain mohammad ashraful's form was pathetic and yet again he failed to lead the team from the front. the absence of proven players like aftab ahmed, alok kapali and shahriar nafis was clearly visible and everybody will agree that players like roqibul, mahmudullah and nayeem islam are no match for them. moreover, mashrafe is quite okay with the new ball but he also disappointed in the second spell. bowlers like rubel and shahdat are repeatedly failing to give good support to mashrafe from the other end.

extra- judicial killing
i had the chance to go through the editorial in your daily on 'cross-fire killings' published on the 31st may, 2009. i fully agree with you that there should not be any extra-judicial killing, which you have rightly pointed at. the media has been rightly agitated at the report of the latest death of two polytechnic students, though their innocence has yet to be verified through impartial investigation. in this context, i would like to mention here that the mandate of the law enforcing agencies is to protect the innocent citizens from extortion, robbery, hijacking etc . so, while performing their duty, if they are fired upon by anyone, i am in support of the home minister's claim that they should protect themselves first. otherwise, i am afraid, they will be discouraged and finally turn to be reluctant to perform their duties and the miscreants will get an upper hand.
'yes' to computer!
from the very beginning, fortunately, our governments have realized the significance of computer in the present day world. so, till now policies regarding this sector are very positive. the nation is getting the benefit of this trend also. in an underdeveloped country like bangladesh, within this short period, the expansion of the use of computer is relatively laudable.
aila victims
many aila victims are yet to get relief materials to survive. the government and the ngos working in the affected areas should gear up relief operations before more people die of hunger and diseases.
politicians
i have recently been reading about the achievements of dr. manmohan singh, he will surely go down in history as one of the greatest prime ministers india has ever had. india has voted wisely and re-elected him, making history. i was thinking why he has been so great and why we cannot get someone like him in bangladesh. i can list his qualities briefly: he is highly educated, he is humble and leads a simple life, he is old and probably wants to leave a legacy behind, he is not petty and only attacks when absolutely necessary, he does not take advantage of his position for personal gain, he remains focussed on his goal of improving the lives of indians, he doesn't like to play political games and didn't want to be a politician. how many of our politicians have these qualities? we seem to get the uneducated, greedy, selfish people into our politics, surely there must be some manmohan singhs in our midst who must be discovered if our country is to have a chance. we seem to get the same old players in and out of prison every few years; they have made plenty of money, they are old now and should think about what they did for their country before they die.
pledges alone!
as usual, the speaker and his 'shangshods' pledged a lot to save dhaka by saving the dying rivers. since the grabbers and polluters belong to both the parties, they cannot say a harsher word against them. and the fbcci president! this tv personality pledged nothing on behalf of his community. so, the result will be the same as what happens at the end of all other awareness generating programmes. people will read front-page stories and watch tv reporting and mumble something to themselves and then go to sleep. our lawmakers, policymakers, administrators and the government know that the courts can do nothing to stop river killing. the court may pass orders but who is going to implement those orders? the same officers who are bribed not to look at grabbers and polluters' misdeeds? the initiative of the daily star and channel i is highly praiseworthy. but how long will they be crying hoarse ? and after a few days our parliamentarians will get down to their business of 'akher guchano' with an attitude of 'who cares if dhaka's population dies of an epidemic created by polluted water and choked sewerage system'. for the last 38 years, we have been hearing millions of pledges. i urge the daily star and channel i, along with likeminded organisations, to build up the strongest ever public resistance on this issue and compel the government to take stern actions against the culprits, whoever they are.
thanks, police officers
recently, i lost some valuables at my office. but the stolen goods were promptly recovered after i informed the police department. it was really amazing!
two koreas
albeit people of both korea bear the same blood in them, they were divided once. henceforth they have been growing up not only in separate states but also with separate mentality. south korea has adopted democracy and is following japan in the field of economy. on the other hand, north korea is still following the path of socialism which russia itself left many years ago. they are still very poor. many people die from starvation. but they are pouring money in nuke arms manufacturing to fight against south korea, japan and even the usa. are they mad?
saving the rivers
thanks to the daily star for trying to save the rivers around dhaka. a sustained campaign may awaken the people and the administrators to the dangers around. i hope the daily star would keep up the campaign.
daylight saving scheme
it seems that there is a lot of confusion regarding the day light saving scheme poised to be implemented from the 19th of this month. even the ministry was confused and thought of implementing it on a weekday, the 15th of june. at least that has been corrected and the timing will change on the eve preceding the weekend, i.e. the 19th of june. this gives an edge to adapt to the change in timings.
article on bureaucracy
in your issue of the 03 june, mr. anwarul kabir contributed an article on the bureaucracy. his remarks on curtailing the acc's powers were bold and prudent. but time has come to judge the activities of other groups too.
increased land valuation
a front-page headline on the subject was published in a local english daily on 1st. june. this is a move in the right direction taken by the government. the government deserves congratulations for this pragmatic move at the right time! this will provide more revenue, and also have a positive impact on collecting wealth tax where applicable. given the rise in prices of everything; the proposed hike in a vat like manner will ensure realisation of tax at source. similar increase in registration fees for property sale, lease, transfer or rental may also be considered as another source of revenue income for the government.
resignation drama
resigning from the cabinet is not a big deal in parliamentary democracy. but in our country we never quit unless forced to do so. mr. sohel taj had resigned for any reason, personal or political, but the media coverage that ensued was disproportionate to the issue.

iffat ara dewan: bringing gems of bangla songs to delhi
it was as always wonderful catching up with the talented and unassuming singer and painter iffat ara dewan -- this time not at her home in dhaka but in the precincts of the so-called elite delhi gymkhana club -- of which, luckily, i happen to be a member. our conversation ranged from her recent concerts in delhi, to the main organisers, bengal foundation and impresario india, to her eclectic taste in music, to her family and mine and of course common friends at the daily star.

we will not let them forget you
she was only 22 years old, a very vocal woman activist. an activist from a community that is treated by the bangladesh state as second-class citizens. someone who did not fear the most venerated institution in our country. a combination of all these elements made her a chillingly vulnerable person, a target for "the vanishing" (i.e. those who are made to disappear without a trace).
peace still a far cry in the hills
the awami league election manifesto of 2008 said -- "the 1997 chittagong hill tracts peace accord will be fully implemented. more efforts will be directed towards the development of underdeveloped areas, and special programmes on priority basis will be taken to secure rights of the ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples and other communities, and to preserve their language, literature, culture, and unique lifestyles." unfortunately during the last six months of the present government, there have been no significant initiatives to implement the cht accord.
the indigenous question
indigenous people remain among the most persecuted of all minorities, facing discrimination not only on the basis of their religion and ethnicity but also because of their indigenous identity and socio-economic status in today's world. he or she might be a khasi in the betel leaf gardens of sylhet, bangladesh or a pastoralist in the usangu plains of tanzania, an indigenous person is always subject to fear of persecution. view the page startech
the usb story
many of us have recently seen the intel's tv advertisement which shows ajay bhatt, the co-inventor of the usb, aptly termed as our rockstars aren't like your rockstars walking and moving like a celebrity would. interesting advertisement, to say the least. to those of you are thinking that this article is about intel or the advertisement industry in general, behold! it's about neither and is about the universal serial bus or usb in short.
