never stop believing
“never stop believing in yourself. perseverance and optimism are the route to success.” those are the very words that my father had told me, when i was very young. verily, this credo has been implanted in my mind for a very long time. a very important lesson that i have learnt throughout the course of my life is that hard work never results in futility. however, unless you receive the support of others, the path to success is pretty much like a labyrinth. the former provides you with a tower of strength. in simple terms, hard work and succour are the backbone of success. my opinion might be very subjective, but this is what i believe in.

music in the memory
hasrat jaipuri did not think much of javed akhtar. of course he did not, for he inhabited an era when music and song in india were redolent of meaning and poetry. and did you know that kundan lal saigal, the man from jammu, was in the early stages of his career a typewriter salesman who sang even as he dealt with customers? there were all those times when people walked into his shop and asked him to sing a few lines before they walked out with new typewriters. it was in one of those moments that someone noticed the fine tenor of his voice and thought it could resonate all over india. the rest is, well, history. those who came after saigal began with the notion that music could only be the way saigal made it or it was no music at all. remember mukesh's dil jalta hai to jalne de? there were others who eventually were led to the conclusion that they could carve their own niches in the world of melody only through going out of saigal's shadow. talat mehmood, who never pretended to emulate saigal, could nevertheless know that in the man was a defining spirit of indian music.
