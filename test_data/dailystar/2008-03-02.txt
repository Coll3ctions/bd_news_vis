comments
since independence we have failed to live up to expectations of our people. both military dictators and political parties failed. if we analyse the causes of their failures, i would have thought that going back on the same route is unlikely to solve our problems. whenever we fail we must try something new and different, recognising what common people want. have we properly evaluated their needs and taken care of them? how about engaging academics, students, people from all walks of life who are non partisan to do rigorous campaigning in all the villages, cities, suburbs, mosques for the next eight months to identify virtuous, honest, decent people with a clear conscience to be their representatives at all levels of local authorities and in parliament, these people should not have any allegiance to any political parties for the next two terms.
