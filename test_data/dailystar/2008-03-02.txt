installing jammers in prisons
the authorities have, as we understand, decided to install cell phone jammers in the country's prisons. the move comes in light of the recent instances of a number of high profile prisoners making use of cell phones to keep themselves in touch with families, friends and followers outside their places of confinement. we would like to think that jamming cell phones, especially within the perimeters of the nation's jails, is a necessary step because it will prevent the breach of rules that has lately been going on. however, we cannot at the same time ignore the question of whether the jail authorities are resigned to such wrongful use of cell phones by prisoners and whether they believe the only way of deterring such behaviour is a use of jamming devices. in reality, matters should have been handled differently. a full, efficient observance of the jail code should have been enough to combat the offence.

comments
since independence we have failed to live up to expectations of our people. both military dictators and political parties failed. if we analyse the causes of their failures, i would have thought that going back on the same route is unlikely to solve our problems. whenever we fail we must try something new and different, recognising what common people want. have we properly evaluated their needs and taken care of them? how about engaging academics, students, people from all walks of life who are non partisan to do rigorous campaigning in all the villages, cities, suburbs, mosques for the next eight months to identify virtuous, honest, decent people with a clear conscience to be their representatives at all levels of local authorities and in parliament, these people should not have any allegiance to any political parties for the next two terms.
