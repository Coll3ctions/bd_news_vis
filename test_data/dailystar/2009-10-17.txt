push to save river campaign
it is good to see that the government is being relentless in its pursuit of reclaiming rivers around the city from the clutches of grabbers and the polluting hands of industries. the heightening concern over moribund rivers that this paper brought to the centre of national discourse only a few months back, the government at the highest level responding to it and judicial activism demanding action -- all seem in place to bolster the massive campaign for river reclamation beginning with dhaka and taken forward all over the country.

the lisbon treaty has taken a step forward

of journalism, of literature
i happen to be one of those individuals who, having found themselves in the dilemma that on a prosaic basis we call a search for a livelihood, went through university dreaming of life as a pedagogue, indeed as an academic in the hallowed corridors of a public university. it was not to be, for reasons we often choose to push away or under the rug because they are too uncomfortable to remember. and then i drifted off into journalism, but not before i had burnt a few bridges to what i had once thought would be my future; or before the immanent will, to borrow that meaningful turn of phrase from thomas hardy, let it be known that my future was not in my hands. it was a truth i was not aware of when i proudly lifted my head (and it was a full head of hair in those days, back in 1965) before a bowing field marshal mohammad ayub khan (all men gifted with the majesty of height must nevertheless defer to those condemned to be short and therefore more compact in form if not in substance) and told him that i would like to be president of pakistan. he was impressed and asked my teachers to take good care of me. for the next week or so, i was pakistan's future president. i wallowed in the limelight.
the proud possessor
it is a sweltering hot night in a sleepy remote village called madhupur. although a full hour has not yet passed since dusk fell, it seems quite like midnight. it is typical of a village, particularly one like madhupur. a terribly backward village where days and nights are not determined by the clock but by the behaviour of the poultry. nights begin with their entry into the pen and the day that follows is heralded by their cock-a-doodle-doo. the villagers get themselves into this poultry routine of life. they finish their meal at twilight and go to bed after shutting the hen-house door. the next morning they wake at cock crow. but this night is different. it is too hot to sleep. there is no breeze. the leaves on the trees are still. men and women are outside their cottages for fresh air. some are sleeping out on mats laid on small platforms under the trees.

alarm bells on the eastern border
bangladesh and myanmar are on a collision course with tension in the border that has been heightened by amassing of troops in their respective sides of the border. foreign minister dipu moni, when asked by journalists about the construction of pillars for barbed wire fence along the bangladesh-myanmar border at naikkhangchhari in bandarban, said that the action is in accordance with international law. the foreign minister, however, told journalists that she was not aware that the myanmar military had gathered 10,000 rohingas in the border on their side with the intention of pushing them into bangladesh. the foreign minister also did not comment on the amassing of troops near the border. she was trying to diffuse the tension diplomatically, which is understandable.
terrorist rehabilitation programme for bangladesh
the newspapers in bangladesh are once again abuzz with the stories of islamic militants being arrested from around the country. only recently, their hideouts, training centres and arms cache have been found deep in the jungles of chittagong hill tracts. their recruitment, training and motivation programmes, as revealed by captured militants, even if those are partially true, are simply amazing.
afghan presidential elections
the second afghan presidential elections which concluded on 20 august 2009 were marked by a low voter turnout of approximately 40 per cent, allegations of widespread fraud and 400 incidents of violence- making it the most violent day in afghanistan since 2001. hamid karzai's failure to build upon the previous electoral verdict, which gave to him support of 55 per cent of the electorate- based on a high voter turnout of 70 per cent, and the resultant corruption and lack of governance created a sense of despondency amongst an already war weary electorate, many of whom chose to stay away. this coupled with the threat of the use of violence by the taliban, kept away a large number of women voters. although these elections have been held under extremely trying circumstances and thus their conduct was not expected to be perfect however, the widespread allegations of corruption and fraud has only served to make matters much worse. the un backed electoral complaints commission (ecc) is investigating 726 serious allegations of major vote fraud and over 2000 complaints of fraud and intimidation. these developments have ruffled feathers in the west and undermined kazai's moral standing both in the international community and back home. view the page star books review
saving half the world's population
how many books make a significant difference in matters that concern everyone who lives on earth? you can probably count the titles on one hand. nicholas d. kristof and sheryl wudunn, husband and wife, have certainly written such a book. half the sky: turning oppression into opportunity for women worldwide is the most important book that i have read since rachel carson's silent spring, published in 1962. i am not alone in saying that this is the most significant book that i have ever reviewed.
looking for pearls in an oyster
if i am asked, “what is or what should be your philosophy of life?” i'll simply reply, “this universe is the expression of unadulterated and unfathomable love. that 'love' is the single reason of the expression of me too. so, my only philosophy is to realise that love and spread it as much as possible. my appearance on this earth is also for this. ... the height of a man can be measured with the power and sphere of his love.' nuhul, the protagonist of the debut novel nuhuler monchitro by sheikh. almamun expresses his ideologies this way. yes, no doubt, it sounds really very philosophical, which the novel abounds in wholeheartedly.
the empowerment of citizens
right to information has been playing a vital role in reshaping the state machinery and ensuring greater participation of people in different countries across the globe.
love among the mughals
out of a brothel, perfumed desirably and trailing a mysterious bloodline, an 'overly pretty' traveler reaches the magnificent court of mughal emperor akbar. despite his foolish choice to wear a coat of coloured leather lozenges in the heat of fatehpur sikri, the traveler wittily introduces himself as 'mogor dell'amore', the mughal of love. as akbar falls prey to his silvered tongue, the yellow-haired traveler starts to relate a story of love which can 'make his fortune or else cost him his life.'
