the mercury coating had chipped off from the bathroom mirror - fifteen years ago it would have sufficed to say this much. today there was absolutely no use making such a statement, since the notion of a flawlessly mercury-coated mirror had departed from the heart of zaman sahib a good while back. but then the departure had not been total, since the parting mercury had dutifully left marks of its prior presence at various places, so that even today our nearly eighty-year-old zaman sahib could recognize this four-cornered, ghostly object as a mirror in the bathroom of his two-storied house in maghbazar. it wasn't that he shaved staring at the mirror, where both eyes and mirror were nearly incorporeal, but it was a necessity for him to stand at least once a day in front of the legendary object in the dim bathroom. and standing here every day he pondered on the unimaginable dialogues, those that appeared in life without any provocation, thoughts that forcibly dragged the disciplined man outside the normal frame, made him completely dizzy.

retracing the old proto-historic migrations
the vedic civilisation is still an enigma. mystery in the dating of the civilisation, whether it is actually a material civilisation, where its original homeland was, etc., are questions that still exercise minds worldwide. there are two distinct schools that hold two opposing views. one is the european trend that puts the homeland somewhere in the southern russian steppes or around the caspian and black sea or even in north europe. the other school (mostly indian scholars) suggests it is actually northern india. however, the general belief is of a central asian steppe homeland, from where later migrations took place. these proto-historic migrations took the indo-european (ie) languages far and wide. one group went to western europe and ended up becoming germanic and balto-slavic languages. another major branch took the ie speaking people to modern iran and india where they gave way to old persian and sanskrit languages. all these major branches then bred their own daughter languages. there are also the anatolian language in the asia minor region and the now-dead tocharian languages in chinese turkmenistan which originated from proto-ie languages. philologists believe that all these languages, spoken by most eurasians, were once together in proto-history and manifested themselves in proto-ie languages. one can create important word roots that were once believed to be spoken by proto-ie people. however, whether they were the real language or not one may never know.
insects trapped in beautiful amber
it would be difficult to imagine a more breath-taking and disturbing novel than maps for lost lovers by the widely-praised and award-winning writer, nadeem aslam. the beauty of the author's language, the lush descriptions that almost jump off the page, are set against the background of a plot filled with mayhem and characters so emotional and bitter about one another that they'd best not share the same room. it is no understatement that the author, who was born in pakistan and currently lives in england, is one of the finest writers in the english language today.
the healing power of love
the first paragraph of a bend in the road begins in the words of the narrator of the story. the story is a first person narrative. however, the identity of the narrator is withheld till the last moment. the narrator begins with his view of the complexity of life. he writes, “where does a story truly begin? in life there are seldom clear-cut beginnings, those moments when we can, in looking back, say that everything started. yet there are moments when fate intersects with our daily lives, setting in motion a sequence of events whose outcome we could never have foreseen.”
what diplomats should, and should not, do
craig murray lives these days in quite pitiable conditions in london with his uzbek girlfriend nadira. in these past few years he has been a candidate for a parliamentary seat and then rector of a university. it was in blackburn that he took on jack straw, the man he considers his nemesis, at the 2005 elections. he lost, but then he actually did not expect to win. it was his way of getting back at the man who he believes linked up with the mandarins in the foreign and commonwealth office (straw was then foreign secretary) to deprive him of his job as british ambassador to uzbekistan.
