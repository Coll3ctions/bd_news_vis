let the dap be implemented in full
the good news is that we now have before us a gazette notification approving the detailed area plan (dap) for the nation's capital. we are convinced that if and when the plan is implemented, citizens will derive unadulterated advantage from it. this we say with a caveat, though. the minister of state for housing and public works, who was vocal about dealing sternly with land grabbers only the other day, now appears to have taken a step backward. the government, he now says, will adopt a soft stance regarding dap in certain instances. he also informs us that the authorities might have to accept violations of land-related laws where necessary. such statements on the part of a functionary of the state cannot but cause grave worries, especially when we are all faced with the reality of how dhaka has been losing its appeal and indeed its character over the years because of the exploitative way in which it has been 'developed'.
bcl excesses take an unbearable turn

factories in residential areas
the recent tragic incident of nimtoli has opened everybody's eye and at the same time raised our level of fear and concern. my younger sister is living at mirpur-2, dhaka. although this is a small housing, this is going to be an industrial housing-cum residential area very soon if immediate measure is not taken. at the very entrance of this housing, there is a welding factory which belongs to a very powerful man, just after few yards there is a make-shift generator plant and a few yards after there is a garment's factory belonging to a very high level police officer. the factory is located along with the residential flats. it was learnt that incidents of small fire also happened in that building. people complained several times to the city corporation but as one is a very powerful man and another one is a very high level police officer, the city corporation did not take any action. apart from these, also there are other factories in this housing, such as water bottling plant, cng garage etc.
soccer frenzy!

the information minister told parliament that the government had not shut down the bengali daily and that it was the deputy commissioner of dhaka, who ordered its closure for alleged violation of the publication law. he said this while responding to the allegation made by a bnp lawmaker that the government had shut the newspaper. "the deputy commissioner, be it of sherpur or dhaka district, is the authority to give declaration of newspapers. the dc can cancel the publication in case of any of violation of the law," said the information minister. at one stage, during his prolonged speech, he resorted to personal attack against an opposition mp. the speaker intervened, saying, "honourable minister, your point is: the deputy commissioner has closed the amar desh and the court shut the channel one". "yes, honourable speaker," said the minister adding the present government believed in free flow of information.
bsf and our politics
when the bsf thugs routinely kill bangladeshis in the border regions, they do not discriminate whether their victims in bangladesh belong to the awami league, bnp, jatiya party or jamaat. however, in condemning bsf's regular violations of human rights and its killings of bangladeshis, bangladeshi political parties are sharply divided. some bangladeshi political parties raise a hue and cry now and then to register their protests against bsf's murderous actions. but, unfortunately, a very prominent bangladeshi political party remains dead silent with regard to bsf's wrongdoings.
safari park
is the safari park concept in our country viable? the dulahazra "safari" park is merely a zoo and is in shabby condition. if the proposed "safari park" is planned on the same intended lines, then the government has to think again before embarking on it.
auto-rickshaw
it is highly appreciable that recently in our cities manually driven rickshaw is being replaced by battery driven auto-rickshaw. it is smoke free and is not noisy. so it is pollution free. moreover, pulling rickshaw manually is inhuman and it causes traffic jam. introducing auto-rickshaw will play an important role in keeping the environment pollution free.
education and our society
illiteracy has become a major issue in bangladesh. along with bangladesh, many other countries throughout the world are not being developed due to lack of education. education is a system of training and instruction designed to give knowledge and develop skills. education helps a person become more aware and get better technical knowledge. educated people are able to contribute to the country and help it to develop. they are aware of their rights, responsibilities and the importance of education. they are capable of fulfilling their basic needs and maintaining their health, hygiene and safety rules. the uneducated people's lives are not the same. they don't realize their potential and lead a poor life. as they don't know the importance of education, many uneducated people make their children work to have a better life. many women are also not getting their right to education and several are suffering due to early marriage. education is a right and a basic need for everyone.
us and israel
we are shell shocked to see the atrocities perpetrated by israeli commandos on the turkish cargo ship which came to gaza to supply much needed relief. the raid is reported to have claimed lives of 10 civilian aid workers. israeli blockade in gaza has left the impoverished region in the lurch. what staggers us to say is that when any occurrence takes place in the palestinian terrain, condemnations come thick and fast. but any concrete action against the defaulters fly in the face of reality. it has emboldened the defiant israeli regime to carry out this type of disproportionate attacks on the plea of self-defence.

a wake-up call
the last few days were catastrophic. the shockwaves of begunbari collapse, nimtoli conflagration have jolted the nation in terabytes. there goes a saying, “disasters sink nations not because of the poverty of the poor, but because of the poverty of the minds.” the harrowing tale of the two catastrophic events once again redefines the poverty of our collective psyche. the clarion call now urges a nationwide awareness. home of millions, this bustling city has structures clustered in concentrated fashion that makes it more vulnerable to earthquake. but begungari collapse was not an aftermath of an earthquake. rather the collapses were virtually invited. ignorant of future, we flouted the rules to build structures in slapdash manner. building code exists; however, we the very independent people, don't want to follow it anyway. we got to help rajuk by following building codes. situated in old dhaka, the dilapidated and rickety buildings should be brought under special vigil. demolition or reinforcement is the option we have. apart from that, we don't have a well organized disaster management system for emergency. unfortunately, our management is limited to calling in of the army since independence. on the other hand, the fire service system needs development throughout the country. inadequate water hoses and ladders, absence of modern masks and fire hydrants makes our fire fighting team a mere spectator at the time of crisis. moreover, capacity building is direly needed to combat the future disasters. as time marches off, our enthusiasm wanes off and plans don't march forward until disaster strikes again. we, the whole nation, face a mammoth task to mobilize ourselves to grapple with future disasters. we are the resilient nation that withstood sidr, cyclone, floods. so, be it. let's not be greedy but considerate for a future that we shall face together.

yellow card for the grand alliance?
the voters in the chittagong city corporation election gave the mayor a red card, ending his sixteen-year rule, and a yellow card to the grand alliance government. you may think differently, but an election reflects the voters' mood. postmortems and analyses of this verdict will be useful if the grand alliance takes lessons and acts accordingly. the result is a verdict against non-performance and empty rhetoric.
