hospital land commandeered in tejgaon
now that an elected government is in office, it is time to expect swift action on some prime plots handed out by the previous bnp-jamaat alliance government to its loyalists and friends between 2002 and 2006. originally marked out as a site for a future hospital back in 1973 (and in fact the foundation for the building was laid by then prime minister sheikh hasina in 2001), the 25 bighas of land in question were and are the property of the ministry of health. the alliance government simply commandeered 14 bighas of the land and gave them out to its friends and supporters at throwaway prices. indeed, among those who benefited from such questionable munificence of the then government were some media people only too happy to be part of what came to be known as a media palli loyal to the powers that were.

traffic congestion
dhaka is being held to ransom by the public transport system. the city buses and trekkers stop anywhere for any amount of time which creates artificial traffic jam. the driver does not even care to look behind to see how much traffic chaos he is creating. sometimes buses create a road train by stopping at bus stops in a line. it can be often seen in all the busy areas in the city-- mirpur, mohakhali, farmgate, rampura, resulting in pollution and health hazards for the pedestrians. they suddenly stop on the slightest signal without considering that they are driving on a public road which may lead to an accident.
parliament session
the way the mps are behaving in making parliament the focal point of all development and political activities is not producing any results due to the absence of the opposition from parliament on childish grounds and possible lack of quorum due to the absence of the government party members. the childish issue of sitting arrangement is condemnable by any standard. i think the outgoing speaker applied very bad judgment to make the issue, and the present speaker is equally ineffective to take any agreeable decision. the other striking factor is the continuous “no talk” policy between the two top leaders of the country. why these two leaders of this unfortunate nation are not talking yet is beyond our apprehension. the political parties have changed their political strategy without any change in their policy!
public health issue
every morning when i pass through the main gate of kaderabad housing in mohammadpur, a bad odour comes to my nose & my mood changes. common people use that place as a public toilet. we frequently see that vehicles of the dcc carry wastes, creating air pollution. sometimes i see dead animals lying beside the road.
students and politics
i am writing today with a heavy heart about a concern equally shared by many of the ex-du students, after seeing so much of tension, violence and agitation being spread out across the colleges and universities of my beloved country.
depoliticise public institutions
the new popular regime has one basic undertaking: to depoliticise the established public institutions. we all have bitter experience of the adverse and negative cumulative effects.
inaccuracy
an english language daily recently published an article “utopia in the constitution of bangladesh” on its editorial page. it was written by a retired judge. the article appears prima-facie to be informative, among other things. congratulations!
bnp and zia
the bnp is clamouring as to why the name of the late ziaur rahman was not cited in the president's speech in the inauguration of the ninth parliament. they are very unhappy and hurt. our reaction is 'why the hell?' historically, ziaur rahman is not at par with the other national leaders of bangladesh. his contribution towards the political movements, mass upsurge, emancipation, freedom of bengali nation, liberation war etc. is not at all comparable to the contributions of bangabandhu, sher-e-bangla, moulana bhashani, shaheed suhrawardy, syed nazrul islam, tajuddin ahmed, monsur ali, kamruzzaman, gen. osmani etc. his name can not be taken at the same breath and with the same respect and honour as the above mentioned ones. contribution of ziaur rahman is comparable with that of shafiullah , khaled musharraf and other sector commanders.
political leader's misdeed
recently a local political leader of barabagh area under mirpur-2 has set up a “kitchen market” at the entrance road of a residential area known as “popular housing-1”. people from the adjacent areas use popular housing-1 approach road to go to monipur school to drop their children. popular housing-1 is located at barabagh under mirpur-2 and this is a very busy connecting road between monipur and barabagh. at the starting point of the approach road the local leader has set up the kitchen market occupying the city corporation road. the market starts at 7:00am and continues up to 1:00pm. different types of traders gather here and set their shops occupying almost 70-80% of the road to do their trading. during this time it becomes extremely difficult for us to go to school. the shopkeepers and some unruly boys tease the school girls while they pass through this road.
vice chancellors
a vice chancellor is the academic and administrative ceo of a university. to understand the great importance of the post one must know what the principal function of a university is. like all other educational institutions a university also propagates knowledge. but a university is different from all of them for the unique role it plays. a university creates knowledge, others do not. therefore, a vice chancellor himself must have an outstanding academic career. he must have the academic excellence to create knowledge by carrying out research work himself in his own field of knowledge. he must also be able to provide leadership and guidance to other research scholars under him. the universally accepted yardstick to measure such academic competence is the number of publications he publishes per year in internationally reputed professional journals.
neglected students
thanks are due to syed badrul ahsan for speaking up, in no uncertain terms, about the plight of students in 'on dormitories and schools' (ds 4.2.09). the problem goes even wider.
ensure non-partisan bureaucracy
the sheikh hasina-led government has started reshuffling the civil administration with a view to translating the pledged “digital bangladesh” into reality but in the same way that every political government, after holding the state power and authority, forthwith does. the government at hand is restructuring the administration by promoting the persons dedicated to the party to the higher ranks on the basis of political consideration, rather than seniority that contradicts democratic principles. the civil bureaucracy administered by inexperienced and partisan personnel can neither produce the desired results, nor serve the gross national interest. reasonably, it should be run by the experienced, competent and efficient personnel. therefore, the government should prioritise seniority and meritocracy, irrespective of party loyalty, as the principles of promotion in the bureaucracy and should shun the path repeatedly followed by the past political governments to set a good example before other political parties.
js stalemate
although the outgoing speaker mr. jamiruddin sircar has proved his bipartisan role once again by putting the last nail on the board, i think it is not a big deal for the party in power to negotiate with the opposition by providing them one more seat in the front row of parliament. it will rather strengthen their image further to public.
