the extra-judicial myopia
when ordinary folks who are at the bottom of the socio-economic scale and whose life patterns are dictated by day-to-day compulsions, feel and speak in desperate terms they can be excused. the norms and nuances of an orderly and lawful existence may not be of much significance to them. probably, nobody would be surprised if discussions on the dynamics of civilised society appear fruitless deliberations to such people.

climate defined to be the average change in the temperature over a period of 30 years. but human-induced global warming-led climate change is now a great issue of concern as with the passage of time it is being exposed in front of us as a crude reality and is showing its increased damaging effect on human beings, biodiversity etcetera. united nations framework convention on climate change (unfcc) defines climate change as the change resulting from long term direct and indirect activities, that induces changes in the compared time which are much more than the natural change. taking this into cognisance there is a global effort now in stopping climate from further deterioration. bangladesh, believed to be the worst-affected victim of climate change, has already raised its voice in this regard and is adopting strategies and actions for adapting to climate change impact and if possible for mitigating measures.

jibanananda's thoughts on death, surrealism and beyond...
the french literary critic and theorist roland barthes believes the death of an author makes readers more responsible toward the creations of the author. he concludes his essay, death of the author thus: “the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the author.” here judgement or the birth of a reader takes a prominent place. and that comes through observing the place the modern bengali poet jibanananda das for those who love poetry.
when rabindranath and borges crossed paths
if we closely observe the citation of rabindranath in 'la metafora' and the comment-filled news in the magazine ' proa ', we shall notice that borges had no fascination for rabindranath. what is left is the expression of his emotions that sways between hope and despair. and he has expressed his feelings by blending them somewhat with poetical and oblique expressions. even though borges has provided an indication of his delight and gripping experience of reading one or two works of rabindranath, he has given no definite reason for such expressions. it appears that borges had chained all his superficial expressions to negations, anchored in fathomless depths. the main reason may have been the sharp differences between the artistic nature of rabindranath and that of borges. but through these comments borges did not fully expose the differences between their literary tastes. he did it at a much later stage. view the page star health

there is music in the air, especially when you let nostalgia take over. in the world of black and white that once was, something of the truly lyrical came to define music in our part of the world. sachin dev burman was part of that world. and those who shared that world with him, be it in creating melody or partaking of it, could not have missed realizing the increasingly larger dimensions it acquired through being peopled by burman and his contemporaries. and yet there were the moments, there is that certain feeling, that burman went beyond all those others. he sang, he had lyrics suit the melody. and he did it all with perfection.
