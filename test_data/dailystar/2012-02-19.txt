war crimes trial a must
we as a newspaper from the very outset have been strongly supportive of the war crimes trial not only because it will establish supremacy of law, heal the wounds of the nation but also because it will vindicate the right to justice of those on whom crimes against humanity were perpetrated. that is what we owe to our hapless victims during the liberation struggle. however, we cannot accept the position, adopted in the resolution in the parliament and subsequently supported by the law minister that anybody who criticizes the tribunal and the trial will face legal action. this is misuse of law and amounts to stifling freedom of speech and expression.
