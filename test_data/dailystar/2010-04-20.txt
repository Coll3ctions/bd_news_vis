our lessons in politics
plato learned from socrates. aristotle learned from plato. then alexander tried to learn a few things as a pupil of aristotle. in the last ten/fifteen years, under the much-trumpeted and much-paraded democratic system, we have also learned a few things. in fact, we have acquired profound knowledge on how politics operate and how politicians play their weird little games in countries like ours. we have seen enough. we have heard a lot. we have tested plenty. so, no more an iota of doubt remains in our minds about why the deshdorodi netas and netris would walk through muck once before every election.
