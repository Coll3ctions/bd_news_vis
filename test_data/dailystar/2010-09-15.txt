a hint at legitimising extortion?
centring around eid festival, extortionists of different denominations have had a field day. transports were stopped at different points on inter-district highways to extract 'toll' without any compunction, legal or otherwise. even policemen and ruling party name flaunters were found demanding money from the passing vehicles, reportedly. perhaps, this year's festival time has seen record takings in reckless abandon.
turkey's referendum is a turning point
the results of sunday's referendum in turkey may well be regarded as a turning point, if not exactly a defining moment, for the country. the constitutional reforms package put forward by the ruling justice and development party now has the support of 58 per cent of the electorate. and yet the fact that 42 per cent of voters disapproved of the reforms is indicative of the deep divisions which still assail a nation in the political sense of the meaning. even so, the referendum is a clear triumph for prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his allies. there are quite a few good reasons why that is so. the most significant is that the vote reduces the power or authority of the military, which has for decades seen itself as the guardian of turkey's secular democracy, in politics. that promises to be quite a change, given that the turkish armed forces have on more than one occasion --- four in fact --- in the past four decades have launched coups d'etat against elected governments, especially when they have perceived a threat to the secular republic put in place by kemal ataturk. view the page sports

anthrax red alert!
the government has issued red alert to control spread of anthrax. reported first in sirajganj, anthrax is now spreading to other parts of bangladesh. caused by bacterium bacillus anthracis, anthrax is an acute infectious disease which attacks both animals and humans. domestic animals like cattle, goats, sheep, dogs, horses, etc. are often attacked by the deadliest anthrax disease. anthrax usually spread by the spores of bacterium bacillus anthracis (spores are the asexual production units of bacteria) which lives in soil in dormant condition. they survive well in alkaline soil and multiply when the soil conditions are favourable in terms of moisture, temperature, nutrition, etc. meanwhile the average soil in bangladesh is acidic in nature (ph between 5.5 and 6.5), so survival of anthrax spores is rather difficult. the anthrax spores enter into animal through ingestion while grazing on grassland.
medical treatment
society is going to the dogs; in almost every sector. the campus is full of political activities --- of the wrong kind. the medical treatment has gone out of the reach of the middle class. the diagnostic centres prescribe expensive non-essential tests, for making profits, thanks to the doctors. except allopathic, no other form of treatment is officially recognised. the ambulance emergency service is expensive; with lack of publicity.

bangladesh-israel relation!
plenty of material surfaced to come to conclusion that those arab pilots were not even ready for solo flights in a cessna, those flying objects that hit the twin towers were not commercial aircrafts, 3 big towers collapsing under controlled demolition, the celebration by 5 mosad agents right after the attack took place…all pointing towards a zionist element behind the whole conspiracy. the real victims are the muslims and this is exactly what the conspirator's objectivity was. ground zero mosque is not going to make much difference in the name of building inter-faith relations, it's all politics. are muslims learning?
opposite views
success can be considered from two different points of view. progress in making money and being able to lead a luxurious life is the point of our consideration these days. but when there is no shortage of money and something takes place only because someone has plenty of wealth, we say, if he had less such a mishap might not have happened. on the other hand, when we think about the rewards and punishments of the life hereafter, then we say, there is little necessity of money here.
match fixing
there has been uproar in the cricket world that pakistan team in recent england tour has done match fixing in the match against australia. in that scam one pakistani gambler has been arrested in the hotel suit of pakistan team with a huge amount of money. it is presumed that entire deal of match fixing was supposed to be done through that gambler. pakistan premier yousuf raja zilani vowed to bring to book the culprits of match fixing who tarnished the image of pakistan. match fixing is not new in the cricket world. previous indian cricket captain mohammed azharuddin had been implicated into the scam of match fixing. there had been voice of denouncement and condemnation from around the cricket world against this heinous act. people in india spitted at the portraits of the cricket captain in public places where those were available. azaharuddin had been banned from cricket for life by a ruling of indian cricket board once this scam had been proved. the daily star in its 30th august issue in the sports page quoted some foreign journalists as saying “pakistani cricket players are after money, women and food” whenever they visit england. the pakistan cricket captain in his immediate reaction told one cannot be implicated or prosecuted into a case without proof. it has been estimated at least 7 pakistani cricketers will be implicated into the case of match fixing. so, arch rivals of two superpowers in this subcontinent are not free from malpractices.
biman
biman has a captive set of customers in providing the hajj service (numbers going up and up) and transporting labour to the middle east. its services to other destinations are viewed as of non-core nature demanding little attention or motive for profit. this can be felt by international passengers as there are frequent breakdowns, cancellation of flights, change of schedules, delays and lost luggage.

journeying back to old songs
there is always magic in old music. those of us who went to school in the sixties have, in all these years that we have passed from youth to middle age, have somehow remained convinced that the songs we heard ferdousi rahman sing in the old days, that her peers gave voice to, are music that remains on a perch higher than anything that we have had before us since then. think of jaar chhaya porhechhe / monero aina te and you will know. sheer romance underpins the song, in much the same way that absolute pain struggles with the need for love in ke amar ondho moner bondho duar / fello khule tumi jaante cheyo na. ferdousi's voyage into the world of urdu music, which music was touched by the inimitable splendour arising in robin ghosh, remains an equally poignant reminder of the good old times for us. ye arzoo jawan jawan and wo mere saamne tasveer bane baithe hain are symbols of the grandeur we once associated with music in our part of the world. you spot that grandeur again in farida yasmeen's saiyan bedardi mora dard na jaane re.
