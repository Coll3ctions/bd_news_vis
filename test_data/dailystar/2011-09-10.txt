we are heartened by the speed and competence with which the one-member judicial probe body completed its work in the killing of six students on the night of july 18 by a mob, suspecting them to be criminals. the disturbing aspect of it was that the police stood by while the mob beat the students to death.
media handling left much to be desired
the strikingly different contrasts of how the governments of bangladesh and india handle the media and share information became very apparent during prime minister manmohan singh's official visit to bangladesh which just concluded. the bangladeshi media was obliged to struggle during the summit to acquire the official version of the development of events, often having to chase officials for information and briefings. the media was apparently kept in the dark about the step by step outcome of the talks between the two governments. there appeared to be no designated person to approach in case of any clarifications required and if there was, he/she was not readily available. in fact, there were hardly any press conferences. view the page sports

before the curtain falls
hundreds of theatre activists -- from veterans to young ones -- gathered at the mahila shamiti premises on september 8. they came over to join a festival being held for the last time at the venue widely known as the epicentre of neo-theatre movement in bangladesh. the mahila shamiti authorities have taken a decision to renovate the building. it was an emotional affair for many of the activists, as they reunited at the venue that had witnessed the theatre movement firsthand. they were taking photos of each other and sharing memories. it seemed that the venue went back to its golden days suddenly.

law-enforcement professionalism and political will
while commenting on serious police malfeasance of committing extortion, the daily star post-editorial of august 24 very candidly observes that non-implementation of police reforms "raises misgiving in the public mind that a thoroughbred reform of the police might keep them above politicisation" and "that may be the reason why no political party is serious on this score."
government at its old games
pakistan may not have democracy in the sense the world knows. nor will it pass the muster in the economic field. but it has to its credit independent judiciary and free media which the lawyers and journalists have won after long battles in their respective fields. bangladesh and sri lanka cannot emulate pakistan because the judiciary and the media exercise independence to the extent the governments of those countries allow, although bangladesh is a shade better than sri lanka.
poor governance fuels corruption
people might recall that while speaking in an anti-poverty rally in 2009, prime minister sheikh hasina cautioned that none would be spared for graft and wrongdoing, regardless of party affiliation. speaker of the parliament advocate abdul hamid, who presided over the rally, stressed that curbing corruption and ensuring good "governance" were preconditions for having a poverty free society.

pollution of rivers around dhaka
with a population of over 15 million dhaka is one of the most congested cities of the world. this rapidly growing city is located on the northern bank of the river buriganga and surrounded by other rivers, namely, the turag to the west, the tongi khal to the north and the balu to the east. the rivers surrounding dhaka are an advantage to it and essential for the survival of the mega city as these provide drainage system, drinking water, different kinds of fishes and also waterways for traveling. however, being the capital of bangladesh -- one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world -- the city has been developed haphazardly without considering its physical and social diminution. as a result, the environmental consequences originating from rapid increase of population along with the increase of polluting effluents from industries, and municipal as well as other waste are having profound negative impacts on rivers around dhaka city. in turn, the polluted waters of the rivers are posing increasing threats to the living organisms including humans residing by the rivers.

dying 'peacefully' . . .
i always wondered what it meant when death announcements in newspapers used the phrase “someone has died peacefully.” how does one die “peacefully”? when we were young, the italian poet dante whispered into our ears, “death, always cruel / pity's foe in chief / mother who brought forth grief / merciless judgment and without appeal!” how could one have peace with such a cruel adversary? yet, when my mother, suraiya begum died on the first day of august, i found no other way to describe it. she died “peacefully” --- and that is what our relatives were telling everyone.
a garden of gastronomic delights
a friend of mine always keeps reminding me that if we were asked to rank our most pleasurable activities, the ingestion of good food would always find a very high spot on everybody's list. yes, i couldn't agree more. it seems as time goes by and i get more opportunities to sample a wider range of food, the truth is sinking in. when men reach a certain age, they like picking through their memories. we are indeed willing slaves of our taste buds. how else do you explain the obesity epidemic or the explosion of cooking/dining shows on primetime television?

unite in the fight against noncommunicable diseases
noncommunicable diseases or ncds like heart attacks and strokes, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases — kill about three in five people worldwide (63 percent), and cause great socioeconomic harm in all countries, particularly in developing countries like bangladesh. every year, 9 million people die too young from ncds (under the age of 60). but implementing cost-effective interventions that reduce risk factors for ncds will contribute up to two-thirds of the reduction in premature mortality. global leaders urged to set a new international agenda on ncds to take action against the epidemic, save millions of lives and enhance development initiatives.

footprints on the sands of time
i love the opening line of stephen hatch-barnwell's memoirs the last guardian for its sagacity: “it is better to trust luck than to be clever.” and it is a book of memoirs, and not an autobiography. his purely personal life is dismissed in a total of three or so sheets (that, too, is a generous estimate) out of a voluminous book of 384 total pages. the rest is devoted to his professional career as a member of the exalted indian civil service (ics) during the waning years of the british raj . he ended this chapter after reaching the pinnacle of the service as a member of the civil service of pakistan (csp), the successor service in the new country of pakistan. in fact, he ended his career in east pakistan (he had worked all his civil service life in undivided bengal of british india and the eastern province of pakistan) in 1966 before retiring to end his days in the country of his birth --- england. the unusual aspect of his life and career was that this was a quintessential englishman who voluntarily opted to stay on in the land where he began his professional career even after the sun of the raj that had made his job possible had finally set in its crown jewel. even his name, stephen hatch-barnwell, smacks of the archetypal englishman, somehow even evoking the image of an empire-builder. he has left behind one of the most delightful books that i have read over the last ten years or so.
a woman truly insecure
there are certain american obsessions you cannot ignore. take the fascination with the kennedys, for instance. or think of elvis presley and michael jackson. and then there is the other side of this fascination. fidel castro remains a threat for the us government, despite so many changes having taken place all across the world since the bearded cuban revolutionary marched into havana in 1959. today, it is mahmoud ahmadinejad and hugo chavez who worry america, especially its ruling elite. and obsession sometimes can go to ludicrous lengths in washington. forbes magazine has just informed us that michelle obama happens to be the most powerful woman in the world. now that is surely ridiculous, given that mrs. obama holds no position in government nor has done anything significant on her own to justify that definition of her capabilities. she happens to share the bed of the current occupant of the white house. how then, you wonder, does she edge ahead of the likes of angela merkel as the most powerful woman on the planet?
the tensions of not knowing
hisham matar's anatomy of a disappearance is not so much the narration or analysis of a person's disappearance as a profound exploration of the psychological effects on characters whose lives have been brutally altered because of the disappearance of a loved one. the main character and the narrator of matar's wrenching novel is nuriel el-alfi, age twelve when he begins relating what happened when his father disappeared two years later in 1972. as he observes in the opening of his story:
