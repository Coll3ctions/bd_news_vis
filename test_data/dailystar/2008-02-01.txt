now, a free ec secretariat
it appears that at last the election commission will be-gin to work as an independent body through severing its links with the executive branch of government. that should be cheering news for the nation. demands for the ec secretariat to function independently in the interest of free, fair and transparent elections have been there for as long as one can recall. and those demands have had a direct link with the legacy upon which the election commission has so far conducted itself. in times of a presidential form of government, the ec was dominated by the president's office. no change was discernible when a parliamentary system took over, for the ec then began to operate as an appendage of the prime minister's office.
adp implementation sluggish
at the half-way point of fiscal 2007-08, only 21 percent of the annual development programme (adp) stands implemented. this is the record low rate of implementation in the last four years. that this has happened during the rule of a non-party interim government cannot but surprise experts. the very technocratic nature of the government was supposed to have infused certain efficiency and dynamism into adp manage-ment. besides, being apolitical, the government has been free from political distractions with project planning and selection keeping above any political or lobby considerations.

banning rickshaws
many thanks to mr sikander ahmed for his letter published in the daily star on 15 january 2007, pointing out the plights of the majority of commuters due to ban on rickshaws in mohakhali to gulshan road. i remember the day i was thrown out from a rickshaw on a rainy day on this road by a traffic policeman too keen to implement the ban on rickshaw. it was not very nice to walk the rest of the way to my office all soaked in rain. one reason for rickshaws being blamed for traffic jam and banned is probably that it is easier to implement restriction on the poor and weak! in the last ten years in dhaka i have seen several times traffic policemen puncturing tyres of rickshaws as a punishment for disobeying traffic rules, but have never seen them do any such thing to the cars that clearly ignore traffic rules. true, rickshaw-pullers do not obey the traffic rules and create jams frequently. but the same is true about cars, buses or any other motorised vehicles. nobody appears to be aware of any traffic rules relating to overtaking, changing lanes, right of the way, parking and such things. it's more like doing whatever you can get away with and of course you can get away with almost anything!
hilsha export
i am an expatriate bangladeshi and would like to express my views on hilsha export to foreign countries from bangladesh.
a good government!
bangladesh has been ruled by bad governments for decades. past governments apparently were the results of so called democracy. unfortunately, those governments proved to be complete failures in fulfilling the aspirations of the general public, in putting this troubled nation into a path of somewhat brighter future. instead, the so-called elected leaders have brought the nation to its knees by abusing their authority and power in the government.
trial of war criminals
recently, there have been demands from certain quarters for the trial of the “war criminals”. perhaps it is necessary to find out first if the law of the country is equipped for trial of war crimes and what is the definition of such offence given in the provisions of law. recently, the court discharged a case filed against certain individuals on allegation of being war criminals. i am not against trial of any individual for committing war crime. i belong to a shaheed family that suffered immensely during the liberation war. therefore, trial for committing war crime is also my foremost demand. but to term those individuals “ war criminals” before conviction might give rise to various legal complications. as such it may not yield the desired result. trial could be sought against any specific crime committed either against the country or any individual after collection of enough evidence needed to prove their involvement which in my opinion would be very difficult to get now, after a long time. otherwise, if all those evidences could not be produced, i am afraid, the case will not hold good. everybody knows the al government was instrumental in declaring a general amnesty to the people once opposed to the creation of bangladesh. the al, the jatiyo party and the bnp should be held responsible for their failure to try those opposed to the creation of bangladesh during their 36-year rule.
the sub-continent
what has gone wrong with bangladesh (and pakistan)? why india [all a part of the former british indian raj] escaped such historical inflictions we are experiencing today? pakistan, after the partition in 1947, was without a capital and experience of central government governance. besides rawalpindi, [later, islamabad], the pakistani capital was far away from east pakistan. the communication, cultural, and distance gaps were huge; with a hostile, huge country in between. the separation of east pakistan (bengalees) was a foregone conclusion. east pakistan was replaced by sovereign bangladesh in 1971, in just one generation. today both pakistan and bangladesh are limping; and india is emerging as a giant in asia, next to china.
pertinent questions
the saying is: " do not create or make law from the bench, just understand, interpret and apply the law". this is how we need to prove that the judiciary is independent and has the capacity and will to operate independently . when a government is not elected and run by emergency rules suspending major rights of the citizen, the only hope and shelter for the powerless people lies in the court of law.
catharsis!
being a student of a private university, i am used to facing different kinds of strange questions and each time they left me with utter despair…the other day i met one of my friends, who directly asked me, “hey, i heard that in your university students attend classes standing!! is that true?” this was so much choking for me that i started babbling and only after gathering enough strength to talk again i was capable of saying only, “ no, you heard it wrong”. once one of my relatives asked me, “ do you appear in examinations, or it is not needed?” i just managed to answer, “ no we are not that much lucky yet”. these are some very general inquiries about private universities as well as their students.
the naming business!
perhaps nobody relishes seeing the signboards that introduce many institutions named after begum khaleda zia and they all have been done to portray her as an 'extraordinary' leader, but without thinking if such naming was at all fitting for the incumbent pm who, i say without any malice, could hardly evince any leadership acumen to deliver anything exemplary for the well-being of the people, or for that matter of the nation, that people regardless of their race or religion would go remembering her as a worthy pm the nation had ever had after it came into being. if dispassionately judged, apart from her discredited and disgraceful position as of now, she had done nothing remarkable as twice pm of bangladesh. she left no marks in the political precincts, the only area she could throw herself in because of the death of her husband. she rather destroyed the edifice of redeemed and resuscitated democratic polity in bangladesh by her and her party's absolute rule ( the elected president of the country was sacked arbitrarily, the nation's parliament, the seat of democracy was practically reduced to bnp-jamaat's hub for exercising their exclusive rights and privileges, especially for hurling diatribes against the opposition or belittling the latter's proposal so that it would abstain from democratic process and, made its speaker a 'stooge'), vitiated every institution and establishment with naked wholesale politicisation. and as you know of the abyss of unbridled and unprecedented corruption the whole administrative apparatus of the country has been let to sink during her last tenure. people felt disgusted at her enduring efforts to bring her two sons, brother(s), sisters, nephews and nieces and their cronies into the sphere of power.
bogra-sirajganj road
i would like to draw the attention of the authorities to the on-going construction work of bogra-sirajganj highway at majhira in shahjahanpur. the construction work was started approximately two and a half months ago, but is yet to be complete. the commuters are suffering a lot not only for the incomplete and almost postponed work of the road, but also for the dust generated from it.
police station needed
in mymensingh district, atharabari union under ishwarganj thana is a very important commercial place. we need a police station at atharabari which is situated 15 kilometres away from ishwarganj thana. there is a railway station, bus station, bank, school, madrassa, college, telegraph and telephone office and many sawmills here. atharabari rayer bazar is the biggest market in the area. but there is no police station here. when a criminal incident occurs police can't come in due time.
the chess legend
on january 17, aged 64, the chess legend bobby fischer left this world. it was from the very early days at marshall chess club in new york city, where he used to spend hours reading through old file-cards of 19th century games; than it was in the new york public library, where he learned about chess history, about different strategies of chess through reading numerous books. it was also in his family flat in brooklyn where he used to spend hours playing chess with himself at his bedside table.
medical education
i read with interest the letter by mr. nasar (15.01.08) on medical education. i wholeheartedly agree with the views expressed by him.
dealing with bullies!
bullies are aggressive people who are very astute at reading the cues. workplace bullies share a common goal to advance their position in the company at the expense of a co-worker, often called the target (one who is bullied). the most destructive thing about office bullies is that they tend to target co-workers who are the best and brightest employees. workplace bullies tend to drive out colleagues they view as threats: those who are competent, independent, possess good social skills, and have strong ethics. bullies are a dark and destructive force at the workplace. we all need to have physical and psychological safety in the workplace. view the page international
