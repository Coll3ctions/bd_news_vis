between a yawn and a yelp
it's becoming a habit. whenever congress gets a headache it orders a foot massage. dr. manmohan singh and mrs. sonia gandhi recognised the size of their problem, which is why they met four times, one-to-one, in their attempt to stabilise a government that had lost shape and begun to wobble. they did not need to save the government, since they have not lost it, yet. upa 2 can splutter along on the usual paradox: the bigger the crisis, the closer partners cling together, since elections can only bring bad news.
