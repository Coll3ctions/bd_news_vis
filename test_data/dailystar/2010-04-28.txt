the ban on south asian movies
the move to lift the ban and then not to lift the ban on indian movies raises a very fundamental question about decision-making at the government level. the other day, the commerce ministry informed the country that indian movies, banned in bangladesh since the early 1970s (a move first made in 1965 by the then pakistani government), would be allowed back in. the reason given out was that cinema halls have remained largely empty with people not very drawn to watching films produced in bangladesh. in effect, it was to give a spurt to the movie houses in the financial sense that motivated the decision. and then, before citizens had a real chance of assessing the move, the government came in with the news that indian movies would after all not be allowed back in bangladesh. view the page sports

lagging behind
ten years ago, world leaders agreed at the un on the millennium development goals (mdgs), 8 goals to significantly reduce extreme poverty, disease and illiteracy by 2015. world leaders met to take stock of progress at the mid-point. the first nine years have seen some important successes at the aggregate level, 40 million more children are in school, hundreds of millions of people have come out of extreme poverty, some deadly diseases like tuberculosis and measles have been contained, and fewer people are dying from hiv/aids. but the un secretary general warned that if the world has to meet the mdgs by 2015, the speed of implementation needs to be substantially accelerated. paradoxically, foreign aid levels have actually fallen in the last four years and some of the richest countries are cutting back even further. it is no surprise then that virtually every leader from a developing country spoke during the summit about rich countries breaking their aid promises to the poor with the consequence being schools and health centres left without staff and equipment.

rutted roads
decay has got the better of the roads at nikunja-2 in khilkhet residential area through lack of repair work over the years. almost all the roads are in bad shape, causing daily sufferings to the residents. even with a little rain all the roads get clogged with rainwater as it is one of the low land areas in dhaka city. of all the shabby roads, many are seen as drains owing to stagnant, smelly, polluted water on the roads, especially in the rainy season. during the rainy season all the roads remain water-logged and roads get muddier and slippery very badly. the most distressful thing is that with the aggravated situation of the roads, many rickshaw pullers show reluctance to pull their rickshaw wading through these rugged roads. even sometimes many cars get bogged down in the middle of the road because of the holes created there. there are many official and student residents living in this area who are the worst sufferers. apart from this, we have to wait for a long time to get a rickshaw which is a pretty time consuming and monotonous job.
