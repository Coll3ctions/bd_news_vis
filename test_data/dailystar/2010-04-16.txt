ramna batamul blast case
while the nation celebrated with fervour and festivity pahela baishak on the 14th of april, perhaps the largest festival of the bangalees, one could not but be reminded of the carnage perpetrated at ramna batamul nine years ago that day. there have been bomb attacks on public functions before, and there have been many since then, but this one was quite different from the rest. this was an attack against the very identity of the nation; it was a blow against the very belief on which the war of liberation was fought; it was a stab at the very ethos in which we take immense pride, both collectively and as individuals.

the sundarbans
the sundarbans in the southwestern part of bangladesh has an important buffer function, protecting the densely settled agriculture areas from the full force of periodic cyclones storms and tidal waves. it lies in the west of the brahmaputra-meghna delta covering an area of 587,380 ha of natural mangroves and further 100,000 ha of planted mangroves .it is the largest in the world as a compact single block of mangrove resources.
dhaka stock exchange
while viewing the red against almost all the stocks for the last few weeks, one can easily understand it is nothing but manipulation done by certain vested quarters. gp entered into the stock market and changed the conventional monotonous slow growth share market to a vibrant fast growing one. new investors invested in the share market purchasing shares of different companies with a hope to get an expected return from a share market which got a new lease of life after the arrival of gp. but the situation did not last long. the vested quarters in the name of correcting the share market imposed many conditions like limitation of bank loan, use of cash payment, instead of using instant sale proceeds for buying a particular share etc. damaged the upward trend of the share market. for a few days a total of tk 1500 crore worth of shares were transacted every day just after the entry of gp. now the quantum has been reduced to 50%. why? this is just because of the manipulation of share market by the monsters, who are always out to meet their selfish ends.
sea level rise
climate change will significantly affect migration in three distinct ways. first, the effects of warming and drying in some regions will reduce agriculture potential and undermine 'ecosystem services' such as clean water and fertile soil. second, the increase in extreme weather events in particular, heavy precipitation and resulting flash or river floods in tropical regions. finally, sea level rise will permanently destroy extensive and highly productive low-laying coastal areas that are home to millions of people who will have to relocate permanently. along with other extreme weather events like flooding and tropical cyclone, sea level rise is an impending threat to the coastal areas in bangladesh which has long and densely populated coastlines with many low-lying remote islands. in the severe climate change scenario, sea level rise poses an existential threat that would inundate 18 percent of bangladesh's total land, directly impacting 11 percent of the country's population. salt water intrusion from sea level rise in low-lying agricultural plains, along with other hazards, could lead to 40 percent decrease in food grain production and would increase forced migration to the urban slum areas. estimate shows that with just a 1 to 2 degree increase in temperature would force physical dislocation of more than 35 million people in bangladesh.
power cuts
earlier there was 1-hr load shedding each day. in order to alleviate the sufferings of the people, recently the govt went for 2-hr load shedding. that of course did not solve our problems.
ds campaign
your campaign against various social and political issues plaguing the country and destroying our social and economic fabric is really laudable. we are very pleased with the way the national daily is trying to highlight the problems and evoke the people's interest in them by enlightening them about the state of affairs and goading the government to act to stop and check the degradation of the social, economic and environmental sectors.
pm and bcl
we are very happy to read editorials of three major english dailies on the same day ( april 5, 2010) about the concern of the prime minister regarding the point that the student wing belonging to the ruling party would not be allowed to nullify her government's achievements. now she has again spoken out over the activities of an associate body of the ruling party. months ago, she publicly dissociated herself from the student organisation perhaps in the hope that it would send the right message to the student body to rectify itself. unfortunately, it did not have the desired impact on the student wing. the student organisation has continued to defy appeals made to it to shun violence, tender snatching, extortion and pursuance of illegal ways for making money. in fact, it has made blaring headlines for its misdeeds on a regular basis with no sign of abatement. her assertion that the student wing cannot be led by individuals who cannot be called students any more is a hint at how student politics may have become captive in the hands of what she calls 'adu bhai'. the statement is in itself a warning that unless such bodies as the student wing are led back to the old idealism which marked their coming into existence, student politics will continue to be on a slide. and that will mean the sort of unruly behaviour citizens have seen coming from bcl activists in these past many months. one does not have to tolerate such behaviour, as the prime minister has explicitly stated, or expect that it will end through a mere sounding of warnings. only an application of the law can have a salutary effect on such behaviour. it is clear the blame must lie with the party leadership.
good news
it is heartening to hear that some bangladeshi bus companies are introducing the digital ticketing system. it was reported in your daily that a japanese company has been issuing prepaid tickets for the bus passengers (the star business: 05.04.10). we experienced the benefits of this sort of ticketing system abroad. but for some fishy backdrop or reasons unknown, we never could enjoy such advantages before in bangladesh. the prepaid ticketing system benefits both the operators and the passengers. if the companies consider giving incentives like, some concessions for weekly or monthly tickets, people will be encouraged more to have those tickets in advance. in other countries, for the day tickets, weekly tickets and monthly tickets there are some lucrative concessions for the passengers. the bus companies may also think of this sort of daily, weekly and monthly tickets. it will ensure their profits and stop pilferage of cash money.
price of gas
it was revealed from your news report on 05.04.10 that the secretary of gas and mineral resources division has recommended enhancing the gas price. he mentioned in his statement that nowhere in the present world the price is so low as bangladesh. perhaps, he has forgotten that the average income of the people is not comparable with the countries he mentioned.
traffic issue
this seems to be the slogan of the authorities who come up with one absurd idea after another in the name of traffic control. the ban on rickshaws on main roads, especially mohakhali road is one such example. this main road lies between the residential areas of gulshan 1 & 2, niketan, badda, dohs etc and the working and educational districts of banani and gulshan and vice versa. thousands of people used rickshaws every day to reach their short destinations in gulshan cheaply, safely and much more swiftly than it is possible by car.
saturated fats
meats, eggs, dairy products etc. contain saturated fat or the bad cholesterol (ldl) while certain nuts, seafish, corn, soy, canola and olive oil etc. are rich in unsaturated fats, that is, good cholesterol (hdl). fats in general are essential because they help nutrient absorption, nerve transmission, and many other functions in our body. an increase in the level of fats (particularly the ldl cholesterol) increases the risk of heart attack, stroke. bad fat (ldl) also contributes to weight gain (obesity), cardiovascular diseases (cvd), and certain types of cancer.
street romeos
when the entire country is reeling under the incidences of eve teasing of school girls a by the street romeos which led to abductions and suicides of the helpless victims, the law enforcing authorities in dhaka after rounding off of seven such eve teasers let them go scot-free upon simple undertakings from the parents ! this is ridiculous. we cannot understand why they suddenly became so benevolent in letting the culprits go. those parents are also equally liable for the misdeeds of their offspring's and therefore, should also be prosecuted and given exemplary punishments along with those delinquents. if this crime is not nipped in the bud by handing over severe punishments the situation will go completely out of control. even in the city university campuses female students are harassed openly by the romeos showing muscle power under political colour.
utopia
sometimes it seems like we live in an alice-in-wonderland world. here you will find hardly anybody who will oblige you by paying heed to your torment. life is fraught with countless problems, unprecedented difficulties and unbearable hardships. yet, every five years you will get lots of pledges affirming that, life will be no short of paradise in the days to come provided you give a mere chance by electing the political person who is ardently waiting to eradicate your unabated troubles. he will provide you with uninterrupted power supply, pure potable drinking water, a city devoid of traffic jam and so on. he comes to assure you that you can move freely anywhere without danger no matter what reading the time-piece gives you by then. yes, i am talking about a life in bangladesh where promises are often left unfulfilled. likewise, this government also asked us to lend our trust to them so did we. following the above chronicle the reality came out in a way that is now taking toll on us. like a precious fool, we all have started dreaming this country to be digital before long though price hiking, power outage, gas and water crisis did not give a halt yet. we could not manage to afford a dish of rice for everybody yet, to be digital is a thing of distant future. my entreaty to the government, please take some fruitful measures to meet the rudimentary problems first. all we want is a serene life where there is no crying for foods, no grudges against electricity, no complaints about shelters.
