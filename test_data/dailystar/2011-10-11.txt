it was in the early 1980s and youth was still part of life. romance was in the air, had been since the mid-1970s. and romance is something that often stays with you, must if life is not to reduce itself into a sorry patchwork of mere banalities. jagjit singh and chitra singh, in that particular season when mohammad rafi had been dead a year, came prancing into my life with pehle to apne dil ki raza jaan jaiye. the song was a gift, embedded in an audio cassette. that song was an inaugural, an initiation as it were, in the world of jagjit singh melody. i was not to look back after that burst of light.

regional route to development
bangladesh is strategically located between south and south east asia. it has good relations with all countries in asia and can become a strong and dependable partner in progress in this region. the twenty-first century began with high hopes for bangladesh with pronouncement of "look east" policy. the attempt to look east was unfortunately short lived and haphazard. bangladesh may consider adopting a step-by-step strategy for asian economic integration.
seen, obscene and unseen
wealth is far easier to recognise than poverty. wealth is either seen or obscene; poverty remains largely unseen. poverty of the worst kind is hidden in those parts of india -- or indeed the world -- where it is outside the provenance of government, and beyond the interest of individuals and institutions who fuel the engines of modern life, like business concerns or bureaucracy or media. those of a liberal persuasion do feel the occasional moral twinge at the passing sight of near-starvation, but poverty does not appear on any balance sheet, liberal or conservative. the cure for liberal guilt is aversion. we take our eyes off the hungry. we leave the responsibility to government.

emissions turn into fuel
an illinois research team has succeeded in overcoming one major obstacle to a promising technology that simultaneously reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide and produces fuel.
the theory of everything
in non-technical terms, m-theory presents an idea about the basic substance of the universe. m-theory was developed in 1995 by physicist edward witten. it is actually the unifying theory of superstrings. and superstring theory states that particles, previously thought of as tiny balls of energy, are in fact minute wiggling strings. it must be mentioned here that scientists are still trying to decipher the m-theory however so far, there are just only few leads. for example, physicists still are not sure whether m-theory exists as a single formation or only as a network. but they do ponder, however, over the possibility that perhaps this is the theory that einstein thought to be “the theory of everything” concerning this and the other universes.
the creative urge
archimedes, galileo, newton, faraday, bohr, heisenberg, einstein, landau, fermi, feynman are known as physicists and leibnitz, gauss, minkowski, hilbert, neumann are recognized more as mathematicians than physicists. inspite of their great contributions to physics, rather indirectly, the letter group contributed through the development of mathematical formalism.
secret of mass
a major breakthrough in particle physics came in the 1970s when physicists realized that there are very close ties between two of the four fundamental forces namely, the weak force and the electromagnetic force. the two forces can be described within the same theory, which forms the basis of the standard model. this 'unification' implies that electricity, magnetism, light and some types of radioactivity are all manifestations of a single underlying force called, unsurprisingly, the electroweak force. but in order for this unification to work mathematically, it requires that the force-carrying particles have no mass. we know from experiments that this is not true, so physicists peter higgs, robert brout and françois englert came up with a solution to solve this conundrum.
