the unending 'crossfire' deaths
it is time to register our protest once more on the issue of 'crossfire' killings. in the past five years, 1,500 people have died in what has been given out as encounters, when the security forces were 'compelled' to fire back in 'self-defence.' and in the last five months, 60 individuals have lost their lives in 'crossfire' incidents all over the country. to say that we are shocked would be an understatement. we are, all of us who believe in decency and the rule of law, simply outraged. the time has now come for us to tell the authorities that enough is enough. far too many killings of individuals have gone on in the name of preserving or ensuring law and order than one can justify. more important is the fact that no society can stand by and witness citizens dying in dubious and extra-judicial circumstances. what has become clear over the years is that such killings only spawn more killings, leaving the spectre of the barbaric looming over the social structure.
erratic sugar market

better leaders needed
leadership is of two types. the transformational leader and the transactional leader. the transactional leader is one who is content with running things as they are. while the transformational leader is concerned with change. the transformational leader is not content to see things as they are but always endeavours to transform society through new and innovative ideas. in bangladesh at this moment we need transformational leaders. but unfortunately most of our political and civil bureaucrats who are at the helm of power are transactional. that's why change is very slow and things are not moving.
death, dignity and ethics
i have been thinking for quite some time that i should write at least a brief note on the issue. and finally i have decided to write after watching the tv news coverage of the tragic road accident and the death of former finance minister mr. m. saifur rahman and that of another dreadful accident in which five members of a family were killed. obviously, the news of mr. rahman's death came first in the electronic media and the way the accident scene and particularly the dead body of the late rahman were shown in the exposures was not the way one would expect to watch them. his uncovered body, the doctor examining his pupil all appeared very undignified and highly improper. people should have minimum respect for a dead man whoever it may be. it was more painful to watch when a very popular tv channel gave coverage on the illustrious past of mr. rahman. the coverage again started with his uncovered body and swollen face. similarly, both the electronic and the print media showed bodies of the victims of the other accident in the similar manner, lying on the ground uncovered. this is a very familiar scene when our media cover this type of sad stories. i am not very well aware of the journalistic ethics but still, as a member of the public, i think the ethics should dictate our conscience as how to show respect to a dead body or victims of any other disaster or mishap when the related news events are covered by the media. i firmly believe that the media, in its own way, always dictates our conscience towards ethical norms whenever we need it at our personal, social or national level, but what would happen if the media itself deviates from its own principled responsibility?
railway reforms
a detailed and interesting front-page report on the proposal for bangladesh railway reforms, put forward by outside railway consultants, was published in a local daily on september5. it represents the bureaucratic stand for stone walling the proposal suggesting to hand over powers to the ceo of bangladesh railways. as reported, and i quote: "they (secretary of the communications ministry and his officials) are against creation of a separate division as in the proposed organogram which will empower the br chief to be responsible to the communications minister directly."
eggs and green chillies
japan, is the second biggest economy in the world. the japanese are one of the highest per capita income group people. if some one believes that the japanese government cannot import most tasty and protein rich beef and supply to the japanese, no one will believe it. i have never been to japan but i hear that a kilogram of fresh beef in japan in the present market costs $500.00. japanese cattle farmers reportedly raise cattle with lot of expenses and care because they get handsome return. even though price is very high the japanese do not mind and do not create pressure on their government to bring them cheap beef from abroad. this prove their patriotism.
diplomats and traffic
re: "diplomats and traffic," by a diplomat's wife (sept. 8).
promotions
most recently, the government promoted a huge number of civil servants to different posts in the civil bureaucracy hierarchy. while the mass promotion has been criticized by the media as promotion spree or the like, there is no denying the fact that promotion is definitely one of the most effective tools for generating employees' motivation. this is all the more true in a situation where government employees' incentive packages are not at all commensurate with the market prices, let alone being comparable with those of their counterparts in the private sector. so, granting promotion to the deserving employees (if it has been really done so) is surely a good gesture by the government. but what strikes me is the information that a large number of officers promoted will remain posted as officers on special duty (osd) ( read, officers on no duty). the euphemism “the officer on special duty' is in fact a stigma which is arbitrarily used for dumped officers as well as for officers newly promoted and waiting for placement. the overcrowded lobby of osds will be eased to some extent by posting most of the promoted officers belonging to the administration cadre on in sito basis ( in positions they were holding before their promotion). but officers who got promoted to the post of deputy secretary from other cadres perhaps will have to sit idle for a long time. some of them will get posting by dint of strong tadbir (lobbying) or just by virtue of luck. while the secretariat is overcrowded with osds, some important cadres like audit and accounts, customs, income tax suffer from acute shortage of manpower. by losing more senior level officers who opted to become deputy secretaries, the hrm situation of these department will worsen further. so, as in administration cadre, it will be an effective and efficient decision for government to post officers coming to the senior service pool from other cadres on in sito basis in their respective cadres until they are posted in the secretariat job. otherwise, the government's indulgence in the luxury of having a huge number osds by paying them and not getting any service from them in return will simply be damaging in the long run. moreover, psychological trauma of the osds who are otherwise not meant for being traumatized by remaining workless and hence worthless is sure to adversely affect the collective efficacy and efficiency of the bureaucracy.
creaking law and order
this is response to the editorial entitled "arrest surging crime" published in your daily on the 8th september, 2009. the account of robbery, extortion, hijacking, murder, rape and all other kinds criminal activities which have been very correctly presented by the learned author, mr. asadullah khan, is really alarming. it may have surpassed all the records of any of the previous governments, not to mention that of the previous caretaker govt. so, it is high time to find out the reasons for such an alarming surge. it may not be due to any flaw in the democratic system which we are exercising in this country.
grabbed canal
a couple of days back a piece of news published in ds caught my attention which read “pm orders the concerned department to free all canals of the country from the illegal grabbers. it is a very worthwhile decision and got me interested in writing this letter. on the 3rd july (if my memory doesn't betray) there was a report on channel 1 news on freeing a 100-year-old canal from illegal grabbers at karatia, tangail. this canal flows through just behind saadat university college, one of the first five university colleges of the country. just after the report was telecast on channel 1, a number of policemen along with a magistrate reached the canal side and started breaking the encroachment. but the local union parishad chairman showed up there and requested the magistrate to give him 7 days' time to get the land free from grabbers. but alas, two months are gone! nothing has happened! the grabbers are still encroaching govt lands.

a huge number of passers-by have to cross the road in front of banani chairmanbari, which links mohakhali and kokoli. in banani there are a number of offices and garment factories the employees of which mostly live in kafrul, kachukhet, mirpur, pallabi, kalyanpur and the cantonment area. after office hours they have to cross the extremely busy road of banani chairmanbari. in the recent past a number of accidents took place. crossing this road is very risky.

meeting the shortfall
major primary commercial energies used in bangladesh include natural gas, petroleum products, coal and hydro. 90% of bangladesh's power generation is tied to indigenous natural gas, and urea production is also based on natural gas. since 2001, bangladesh has been unable to meet the demand for natural gas required by the power, fertilizer and industrial sectors and, at the same time, the gap between the generation capacity of electricity and demand has been widening. the situation has been worsening because of inability on the part of the government to act expeditiously. its dependence on the bureaucracy of the energy sector for guidance, policy, planning and implementation is at the root of today's crisis.
