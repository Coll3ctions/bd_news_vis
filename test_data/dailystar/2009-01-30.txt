changes in the administration
politics has for a long number of years played havoc with civil administration and the careers of government officials at the senior levels. perhaps some of the most glaring instances of a politicisation of the administration were noticed in the five years of the bnp-jamaat alliance government, when officials were rewarded or punished, as the case may be, on the basis of their loyalties to the powers that were. one example is the mass promotion of 103 joint secretaries to the position of additional secretaries under that government. at the same time, there were an inordinately high number of osds (officers on special duty) under them.
