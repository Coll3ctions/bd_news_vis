how likely is flooding this year?
what is seasonal forecasts: some readers will be a bit surprised to read this article as when the country is dry and hot with a serious shortage of rainfall, i am writing about a probabilistic outlook of flooding for the next few months. this is the beauty of probabilistic forecasting techniques where you can make advance forecasts for at least 3-6 months in advance. in the case of short-range and deterministic forecasts, we can generate information 3-7 days in advance, but the probabilistic seasonal forecasts can produce information for about 3-6 months in advance with reasonable accuracy. however, there is a problem here while the deterministic forecasts are mostly accurate as these are on shorter time scales, the probabilistic forecasts have some uncertainties as these are on longer time scales.

of ducks and sun-filled afternoons
we sat on the edge of a man-made lake somewhere in the north of the city of edmonton. it was a spectacular late summer afternoon...almost timeless…the temperatures touching a balmy 25 degree centigrade. lake beaumaris is a storm water lake and brown hued ducks were all around, diving for little silvery fishes and critters off the surface of the lake. we spotted a couple of grey canadian geese too. there was a ripple and a flurry of sorts, all around the water as the creatures played in the afternoon sun, content in themselves. the grass felt firm under me and i inched my feet out of my sandals and unto the mossy earth. it pushed itself back. i surveyed my toes with a certain amount of approval. suddenly, a couple of waddling ducks ventured out of the water and headed towards me. i was startled! surely my toes were not on their gourmet meal for the evening! perish the thought of toe eating ducks!
memories of 1968
there are the years that give a shake to your sensibilities. and these are years you recall with something of fondness, with sometimes a dash of sadness. in 1968, we were young, we were in our teens, and we watched in amazement the way the world around us as also the world of which we were a part moved on, in breeziness that left us worried about the future to be. for those of us who remember 1968, it was a time when the world changed. we changed, all of us, enough to develop new perspectives on life and politics around us.
man in the mirror
he wore his full sleeve shirt over his grey trousers. there was nothing remarkable about his features. but his long hair parted in the middle and ran down to his shoulders a trend of the times. a man on the other side of thirty that he was, his glasses had a thick black frame, giving him an intellectual air. he was holding a cigarette between his fingers and he smoked with hauteur. it was a time of defiance. we had assembled to submit advertising campaigns. it was a collection of men that walked in the cloud. his men hung around him and prattled on. he lazed in his silence and spoke only when talked to. soon the agencies started to submit their presentations and they did it with great relish. when his agency was to speak he curtly observed that since this was not a trade fair, he would prefer an exclusive opportunity. his wish was granted and it surprised me. i was a neophyte to the trade. and i got curious to know who this brash gentleman was. i was buffeted by a foreign name that showed his baptism. i naturally did not proceed any further.

pakistan under us and uk attacks: a look at history
pakistan has suddenly become the scapegoat for what is going wrong in afghanistan. the latest documents released on wikileaks (92,000 documents in total) reveal that in afghanistan usa is losing the war and the truth is far removed from what the obama administration has been telling the people. the documents also show pakistan's intelligence agency (inter services intelligence) isi's close collusion with the talibans and other terrorist groups. in line with the leaks, british prime minister david cameron has caused a major controversy by stating bluntly that his country and allies cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that pakistan is allowed to look both ways and is able in any way, to promote the export of terror to india, afghanistan or any other country. quite understandably, pakistan protested furiously but david cameron did not recant his statement rather he came up with free advise about what pakistan should do, which was like adding insult to injury.
the kabul conference: a fruitless exercise?
the plane carrying un secretary-general, ban ki-moon to the kabul conference last tuesday had to be diverted to bagram air base from kabul airport, due to rocket fire. the 70 countries, organizations, and groups attending this conference cannot possibly feel any reassurances about their discussion after this incident. peace and success seem to still be a distant quixotic notion for the people and government of afghanistan, and while the kabul conference reports boast of unrelenting support for president hamid karzai, there are still many elements lacking in this country before it can become a fully functioning, sovereign, governing body.

home truths from the great african moralist
the occasion of a new book by chinua achebe, africa's most celebrated writer and author of things fall apart, the great african novel, cannot be ignored. it's been twenty years since his previously published book and more than that since his last novel. much has happened to achebe and nigeria during those years, much of it not good. but even prior to those twenty years there was the civil war in nigeria (1967-1970), after the country's igbos succeeded and formed their own country called biafra. it took years for the scars of those events to heal (if they ever did). achebe and many other igbos were left in a state of emotional collapse and, if you talk to igbos today in southeastern nigeria, they'll tell you that a similar situation could occur again.
loneliness of a mother
"caro” is short for caroline venable. a woman in her thirties, caro lived in peacock's island, south carolina. she was born there, grew up on the island and knew of no second home. dayclear, a settlement of the gullahs, was just a part of peacock's island divided by a marshland. to caro both the places were like heavens in this world. she was in awe of the old civilization of the gullahs. she wanted them to retain their own lifestyle and live on there in their own way. to her, the word gullah was a beautiful word, a part of the strange and lyrical amalgam of west african and colonial english once spoken by the handful of gullah community. they were the descendants of the slaves brought here by the first white settlers of these archipelago marshes. some of the elders still spoke the old patois among themselves. to caro the gullahs were a part of her home, part of her being.
between bat and ball . . .
ramachandra guha gives you here, not the details of cricket matches in history but the personalities who left indelible impressions on the game. you have here a collage of essays straddling various periods of time, articles that throw up images of a bright past. the surprise is that those who may not understand the nuances of the game, indeed may not have demonstrated much attention to it (include this reviewer in that group of the ignorant) will nevertheless end up admiring the write-ups here. did it ever occur to you that hanif mohammad, the original little master, went to a madrasa in pakistan after his family had migrated from india in the aftermath of partition? those of us who went to school in the 1960s recall the splendour he brought to cricket with his quiet handling of the bat. ah, those were the days of hanif, mushtaq, kardar and so many others. remember the ceylonese (today's sri lankan) named michael tissera, whose batting so impressed the girls in karachi in 1967 that they all crowed in unison, 'tissera, tissera, we want a century'?
problematizing conrad's eastern vision `
there is much to commend in agnes s. k. yeow's recent book, conrad's eastern vision: a vain and floating appearance. it is thoroughly researched, lucidly written and completely focused on its subject: the stories and novel joseph conrad wrote where the malay archipelago is the setting. making good use of recent conrad criticism, poststructuralist approaches to texts, and her knowledge of the history and geography of the region, yeow has provided us with fully contextualized, readable, fascinating and nuanced readings of works such as an outcast of the islands, almayer's folly, and of course, lord jim. in the process, she manages to convince us not only of the “romance” that drew him to fictionalize the region he had experienced on his own but of the way he problematized it in his narratives. additionally, she tries to persuade us that “in the trajectory of conrad's aesthetic development, there is clearly a 'malayan' phase” in which he negotiated between art and history.
