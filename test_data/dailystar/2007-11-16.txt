empowerment of local bodies
the recommendations of the report on strengthening local government are a reflection of the needs of the times. they are so because much debate has gone on around the issue of a devolution of power from the national government to local authorities. there has been an acutely felt need for administration to be decentralised through a necessary and proper empowerment of local government institutions. the suggestions made in the report surely go a long way toward meeting such goals. indeed, the reality is that democracy does not function very well, or runs into roadblocks, when political power is absent where it matters, in this instance the grassroots. that is one more way of saying that participatory democracy is ultimately dependent on how strong and effective local bodies are in a country.
why take it out on the media?
although the adviser for industry, geeteara safiya choudhury has changed her tack a few times since she first blamed the fertiliser crisis on media hype and the impatience of farmers in long queues, her original observations do not cease to ring into the ears. she is urging the journalists now to read out to the farmers 'who can't read' the newspaper ad. put up by the government declaring that there is no fertiliser crisis. but if insistence on stock position being satisfactory and admitting to existence of some 'distribution problems' do not constitute a crisis than what does?
out of circle, out of magic
the story has it that once a centipede was happy until it met with a frolicking frog. when it saw the frog jumping in the air with only four legs, it thought it should be able to do the same since it had many times more legs. so the centipede wanted to give it a shot and that is when it started to hesitate. it tried to lift one leg, then another, but couldn't figure out which one was to come after which. in the end, the legs got tangled and the centipede couldn't even stand up. the short moral of the long story is that fewer legs can increase speed, but too many legs aren't a good thing.
the baneful violence of our politics
if there is any serious attempt by caring bangladeshis to understand the reasons for the malfunctioning of our polity by placing them in the historical, sociological and political context, it may turn out to be an agonising experience. the suspicion could be that our concern for democracy amounted to merely false consciousness or, worse, was it a crude legitimisation of the so-called politically driven conflict? should we look for the roots of the problem in the phenomena of social exclusion, economic marginalisation, contests for power, and other contingent factors?
appraising ctg performance
the present caretaker government (ctg) is unique in the sense that it was established after proclamation of emergency to save the country from total collapse because of the short-sightedness, arrogance, and greed for power and wealth of some top leaders of some major political parties. in the name of democracy, anarchy was established. muscle and money ruled the society. view the page sports

“democracy day”
this year also nur hussain day was observed on 10 november as before. nur hussain sacrificed his life for democracy. the blood of nur hussain helped end autocracy and establish the so-called democracy. unfortunately, the political parties are not strong believers in democracy, rather they are interested in having the charm of governance and staying in power, showing zero tolerance to the views of the opposition and maintaining no norms of democracy in their official functions.

harassment at zia
one of my closed relatives reached zia international airport (zia) from hong kong on 08/11/2007 at 01.00am. they had to wait with their luggage up to 02.30am because the belt operator was not there at that time. there were many foreigners in that flight, besides locals. it was very surprising for the foreigners. even locals were annoyed though they are accustomed to being harassed in their daily life. after a long journey they wanted to come out from the airport at the earliest. another point of harassment is customs formalities, though it is a bit better now then before. customs officials should behave politely, especially with the passengers from the middle east. they may not be aware of customs rules but customs officials can convince them about the applicable rules in a polite way. if more officials are required for that purpose , the authorities can think about it. but, harassment of common passengers should be avoided. for security reasons and necessary formalities there will be some delay which is acceptable, but harassment due to inefficiency, negligence, corruption and misbehavior is not at all acceptable.
thinking beyond 2010

killer's voice!!
it seems like anything and everything is happening in bangladesh and elsewhere without any thought or consequence. although nothing big, but i was dumbfounded to see the interview of the father of the nation's killer in the newspaper. it is very unfortunate to see one of the killers of our father of the nation get the chance to speak his mind and give his opinions on our sacred independence and its leaders. the trouble with publishing his interview is giving him a voice, which he does not deserve.
too small
kindly note that i regularly read "the daily star" and the important part of the news comes under the "headlines". i do not know why you have to install it so tiny with tiny fonts, so much so that i have to wear my reading glasses for it and then i find it difficult to click on the right spot since the mouse and arrow cannot be exactly lined up.
flawed maps
this is in reference to prof. sufi's letter on flawed maps (ds 11/9/07) on sale all over bangladesh. my experience is similar to those of prof. sufi. i also started travelling around bangladesh equipped with maps published by different publishers, my dependence on these maps promptly got me hopelessly lost.

climate change and india
un's ipcc indian head, r k pachauri, gave a rather obsessive lecture this month at an asia conference in delhi in which bangladesh was made out to be a complete joker in the pack. not considering the fact that hundreds of millions were affected by disastrous floods in india and the rioting, terrible problem of management of the crisis, diseases, food shortages, hunger in the last few months in his own country, mr. pachauri gave a glowing picture about india's wonderful ability to cope with these; this was contrasted by the helplessness in a neighbouring country. mr. pachauri suggested that india must intervene in future.
anti-musharraf campaign
i would hardly be classified as a supporter of musharraf. in fact, i despise his , or any non-autonomous foreign policy, as well as his dismissive attitude towards both local and international law. yet, the fact remains that the recent crisis and protests against musharraf are of inherently racist nature - as pakistani politics largely has been since the dictator ayub khan's time.
a new strategy
with the advancement of e-media and e-publications, today's world has reached such a volcanic point where one country may erupt in doing either consciously or sub-consciously or unconsciously any faux-pas with its heinous and sinister lava at any time to subvert another country's economic, national, ideological or religious base. this is happening all over the world. but this shameful and aggressive attitude imposed, especially by the powerful countries on the comparatively weaker ones, in a different way these days is more skilled than before. not that this trend of vicious circle is newly developed, rather its source originated in the past and is likely to be gargantuan in the days to come. this is not a mere deduction but deeply evaluated calculation done on the insightful observation that the way of attacking one country chooses for another one in a different modus is more psychological and less physical than that of their forefathers. this is because the fusion of strategy with the highly advanced technologies is leading the world to the state of schizophrenia as a whole. view the page international

voting right of non-resident bangladeshis
like most people of the world, bangladeshis have joined the world trend of human mobility across continents and countries. bangladeshi immigrant communities in the uk, the usa, australia and new zealand are well-established, and are contributing the lion's share to our revenue earning and the forex reserve. perhaps accepting this reality, the interim government is seriously considering ensuring their voting right in the new context of our political realm. however, i am not sure that the government as well as the election commission have done sufficient homework on the implications of such a crucial decision. this article tries to capture some possible detrimental consequences of providing voting rights to non-resident bangladeshis (nrb).

bicycling : can dhaka adopt it ?
traffic jam is not a new problem for residents of dhaka. due to urbanisation, the demand for different kinds of urban transport has been increasing in big cities, and so has the number of vehicles. in dhaka, we have seen that in the last six years the number of rickshaws, three-wheelers, buses, and cars has increased greatly. but we have not seen many bicycles. in dhaka, the bicycle is not considered as a mode of transport. what is a bicycle like as a mode of transport? can it change people's habits? in this writing i shall try to answer those questions in the light of my experience in beijing.
