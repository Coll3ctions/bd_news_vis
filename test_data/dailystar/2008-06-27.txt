it is amazing how a well-intentioned monetary relief programme for marginal farmers initiated with the good of the economy in mind has had a tailspin through the machinations of vested quarters. with insatiable hunger for money the opportunists scavenge on anything smelling of monetary gains.
drug users falling prey to hiv/aids

crimes and misdemeanours
ever since it began, i have often wondered about the wisdom of the anti-corruption campaign as a means to an end. it seems to me pretty clear that the entire point of the anti-corruption drive was two-fold. the primary goal was to fix a broken system. it was to this end that the institutional reforms were undertaken, and institutions such as the acc, psc, and the election commission were cleaned up and given the manpower, resources, and direction to operate effectively beyond the reach of partisan political interests.
boycotting local government election
the june 23 editorial of the daily star says: "new controversies appear to be coming to the fore as the country prepares for the long awaited general elections by the end of the year. the major political parties have raised questions about the polls schedule for four city corporations and nine municipalities. the bangladesh nationalist party has rejected the schedule while the awami league has described the move by the election commission as conspiratorial and farcical." these objections are threatening to drag the country into the pyre of partisan flames.

save environment
we do not think about the ill effects of detrimental toxic co2 and cfc gas because we are not concerned about our environment. actually, we are destroying our environment in many ways like producing co2 and cfc gas from vehicles, air coolers, and not following the perfect waste management procedures. apart from these, we are cutting down trees.
road digging
to some readers the photo might have appeared to be that of an earthquake aftermath or devastation left by aerial bombing! however, the photo was showing the condition of the footpath adjacent to the secretariat boundary wall across topkhana road. the photo was taken on june 18. if the condition of secretariat's footpath is this, the condition of others could easily be guessed! where will the pedestrians walk?
keep it clean and green
the city is gradually becoming dirty, chaotic and unusable. most of the roads are found littered with items of all sorts. overflowing foul stinking garbage lie uncared for days together. the uncovered drains remain clogged with garbage thrown by the shopkeepers, much to the dismay of the pedestrians. construction materials, push carts, open garage, food stalls, paper stands, shops of all items from ready-made garments to shoe and slippers and undergarments, the list is endless, all occupy the footpaths, thus putting more pressure on the city roads. shopkeepers throw all their rubbish on the roads. kitchen and garden wastes are thrown aimlessly on the roads far away from the dustbins. old, worn out, tattered banners and festoons remain displayed unnecessarily for months. the city roads should be made free of hawkers and vendors as the first step to keeping the city clean. footpaths should be repaired and made user friendly. haphazard and mindless parking of vehicles should be severely penalized. in order to ensure cleanliness, penalties of various grades should be implemented regularly. mobile courts should identify the defaulters on a regular basis and award penalties. the shops should be penalized bdt 200. similarly, residents should be penalized bdt 500, and commercial and industrial establishments bdt 1000 if litters and wastes are found outside their premises. the dhaka city corporation should also monitor cleaning activities routinely through the ward commissioners.
shrimp export and sea turtle conservation
i was attracted by the news item with the heading "bangladeshi shrimp plants fully compliant" (business page; 19 april 2008). there is no doubt that the shrimp industry is the second largest foreign exchange earner of bangladesh. this is one side of the story. this earning comes from what cost on the ecosystem and nature is another side of the story. i am going to highlight an issue related to the conservation of sea turtles and shrimp trade.
the new conversation
i congratulate mr. badrul ahsan for focusing on the latest psyche of the corrupt politicians and their cronies ( the ds, may 30, 2008). in military terminologies there is a popular term called psychological warfare or in brief psy-warfare. the psy-warfare is played during war between two warring countries and its purpose is to create awareness through propaganda and other means among the people of the enemy country that whatever their government is doing is wrong and harmful for them and they should force the government to stop it - in other words submit to the dictates of the opposing party or surrender. history is replete with this and i need not elaborate further.
non-invasive coronary treatment
a very informative and revealing article which is figuratively the "cape of good hope" for those who are suffering from coronary diseases and diabetes was published in local english daily on june17. their numbers are increasing day by day in bangladesh; possibly due to our more sedentary lifestyle, particularly in the cities of bangladesh.
tib reports
the recent report of the tib, as planned and expected, has given rise to more political controversy than any solution to our century old graft culture. one major political party is demanding the resignation of the government due to increase in corruption, despite the ongoing drive to curb graft. the finance adviser is happy to note that there is no corruption now at the highest level or national level. the burden of corruption has been shifted to the poor in rural and semi-urban areas by the tib. the corruption the tib is talking about is century old and part of their livelihood.
traffic rules
frankly speaking, new kinds of motorized and wheel-based vehicles are imported, not made by us. sometimes, these kinds of technologies are bought from developed countries to make motorized vehicles.
diplomatic assignments
a few days back, services of some high-ranking army officers were placed in the ministry of foreign affairs for their appointment as ambassador in bangladesh missions abroad. true, the government appoints officials outside the foreign-service cadre in public interest. i appreciate this but why not senior competent officials from other disciplines including varsity professors, are given diplomatic appointments ?
duration of government
can you presume how long this caretaker government will go on? i can! no specific duration of this government is mentioned in any law. though the constitution has given the direction but this government does not care about any constitutional order or provisions. the tenure of this government may be found if we explore the laws which are still playing a pioneer role to secure this government from any sort of trouble in doing whatever they want to do, whether it is prohibited or not by the constitution.
humanity vs. education
in our society, we find some opulent and educated people. though they are educated, most of them are not truly educated.
judges
i want to thank mr. shafi ahmed, an engineer from london, who wrote his opinion about article 97 of our constitution on 18 june. i wanted to say in my letter that there is a provision “any other cause” in article 97. owing to the presence of such a provision in pakistan's constitution, general pervez musharraf could remove the chief justice of the supreme court. a chaotic situation followed, which is yet to be resolved.

vittachi's humour
i do hope you are being inundated with letters appreciating the wonderful humour in nury vittachi's articles. i usually keep it, as a treat, as the last thing in the daily star that i read but there are times when i cannot resist making it the first!
medical treatment abroad
the present caretaker government (ctg) released the chairperson and the general secretary of the awami league on parole to get medical care overseas. recently ( the daily star, june 19, 2008), the bnp chairperson demanded that all political leaders who had received medical treatment earlier should be allowed to seek medical care abroad. while receiving appropriate medical care is a basic human right for all individuals, whether they are free or are in prison, bringing the perpetrators of crime and abuse of power to justice is also a matter of paramount interest. in our prison system, these financially well off political leaders receive much better care than the other inmates who are poor. in the past, they may have been abroad to seek medical care for ailment that could have been managed with the facilities we have at home.
unruly law enforcers!
prior to my leaving the country, i was stunned to read the news that a group of ansars went berserk, took the law in their hands and attacked the patients and their relatives, who all were standing in a queue, anxiously waiting for their turns at the out patients department of the bsmmu, over a silly incident. but was this a new incident? no! not at all. the ansars, an auxiliary police force but under independent command, have been let loose in the past by the administration on unarmed innocent public. there seems to be no authority on top of them.
why this discrimination?
teachers play an important role in building up the nation. and only the teachers of government institutions don't play this role . teachers of non-government institutions also have their contribution to the process.
“fatal” mistake
the term should not be "fatal bacteria" as reported by your bogra staff correspondent (ref: the daily star, june 21, 2008; page 2); it should be "fecal bacteria". the word 'fecal' is the us version of the english word 'faecal', which means 'from feces', i.e. from human or animal excreta. hundreds of types of bacteria are normal residents in the intestines of man and other animals. view the page international
