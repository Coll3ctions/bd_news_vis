india should stop border killing
despite much assurance from the indian premier, border killing is going on unabated. i think bangladesh should refer all these killings to the international forums and united nations as it is clearly a violation of international law. for the sake of peace and prosperity of this region, india must stop killing innocent bangladeshis. it must control the bsf and investigate all the killings and give punishment to the guilty. by punishing the culprits india can prove that they are really sincere about stopping border killings. in this era of globalisation, no country can expect to live in peace and prosperity without ensuring its neighbours' safety.
