our lessons from mumbai carnage
it was only on 24th november last that this writer pointed to the lurking threat of the so-called religious extremists to our democratic polity. in fact, there are enough indications to believe that the extremists who masterminded and perpetrated the mindless violence in the not-too-distant past in bangladesh are lying low on account of tactical reasons. the mumbai carnage of 26th to 28th november bears fearsome testimony to the premonition that the terror network suspected to be maintaining regional connection can strike at ease even in a locale that has seen repeated violence.

for all muslims of the world hajj is a pilgrimage to holy ka'ba. situated in the holy city of mecca the ka'ba is the greatest place of worship for all muslims. hajj is one of the five strong pillars on which the grand edifice of islam stands. other four pillars are (1) "iman" (faith ), (2) "salat" (daily 5-time prayers), (3) "siam" (fasting) and (4) "zakat" (poor's due). it is obligatory on the part of every able-bodied, resourceful and adult muslim to perform hajj at least once in his life time.
challenging the frontiers of poverty reduction
there is always a group of people who slip through the cracks of every form of poverty alleviation strategy tried and tested until now. be it the manual labourers living daily from hand to mouth or the women and children who work in our houses in exchange of meagre sums of money, different circumstances always prevent them from participating in the elaborate development panaceas that are implemented. they generally tend to fall into the last quintile of the income distribution and therefore are sucked into a poverty trap and it takes a lot more effort to get them out of abject poverty compared to the run-of-the-mill strategies such as microfinance. in an effort to counter this problem, brac implemented a programme that has not been used anywhere in the world before, aptly named challenging the frontiers of poverty reduction: the specially targeted ultra poor (stup).

the mumbai carnage: time to go to the roots
the carnage in mumbai is a shocking reminder once again of the fear that few non-state actors can cause, which only full scale wars between nations could in the past. in 9/11 acts of terrorism, it was one score; in the mumbai massacre, the perpetrators were fewer who actually caused the carnage and mayhem. there are of course many more involved in organizing and executing these acts such as terrorist organizations and nation-states. pursuing them to root out terrorism has so far been futile as these terrorists and their groups keep on changing strategies as they have done in the mumbai carnage to escape detection. the mumbai terrorist attacks, the tragedy and carnage notwithstanding, should therefore lead those pursuing the war on terror to make a strategic shift and deal with the causes as much as the perpetrators. so far, at least since 9/11, the objective has been to pursue the perpetrators with little attention to the causes that breed terrorism.

a weaving and interweaving of relationships
the wedding is a richly imagined novel in which emotions of men and women branch out in extraordinary ways. nicholas sparks has the gift of sketching out human relationships with luscious blends of love and lust. there is noah who seems to be living with his long dead wife allie. there seems to be no love lost between the living and the dead. there is this belief in him that allie comes to him as a swan that visits him in their pond everyday. noah and the swan give a spiritual touch to the story. there is jane, noah's daughter, who after thirty years of marriage to wilson finds that there is still much to be discovered about the relationship. and there is ann, jane's daughter, who loves keith in her wild, romantic ways. their love story is yet another rich chapter of the book. the story whips up with trouble brewing in the marriage of wilson and jane. the family suddenly finds itself on fragile grounds, grounds that seemed to be giving away beneath love that is suddenly lost in confusion. the neighbors too are caught up with the family's gains and pitfalls. however, each of the characters is shadowed by the other and we find a touching story of love and kindness coming out of momentary dark shadows.
scoundrel in our midst
this year's man booker prize was lavished on aravind adiga for his first novel, the white tiger, which beat out novels by two other distinguished indian novelists: salman rushdie and amitav ghose. the award created a kind of brouhaha in literary circles because of the novel's protagonist: a con man and a murderer, who relates the story of his rise from lowly driver (for a rich indian couple) to successful entrepreneur in bangalore¯narrated in a kind of tongue-in-cheek tone, though smirk may be more appropriate. even the author himself has spoken of his novel, "it's not a book that's meant to ingratiate itself with anyone."
