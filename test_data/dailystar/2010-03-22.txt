death of gp koirala
the death of girija prasad koirala brings to an end an illustrious career in nepalese politics. koirala was a political figure who came in the mould of those remarkable for their role in a reshaping of history. like so many others dedicated to the principle of politics being a trust and a call to duty in the service of people, the late nepalese leader upheld certain norms and values he considered essential for the growth of progressive thought. that his was an indispensable presence in nepal's history was proved conclusively when he brokered the deal which was to put an end to the conflict between the state and its maoist rebels and thereby inaugurate a new phase in the country's evolution to democracy. at a time when few people believed that nepal could wriggle out of what then seemed to be an intractable problem, koirala did not lose faith in his belief that better days would dawn. view the page sports

women trafficking
women and child trafficking is a perennial problem in our country. it is not only a problem for bangladesh but rather it is a global problem. poverty, overpopulation, gender-based discrimination, lack of consciousness are the reasons among others behind women and child trafficking in bangladesh. uneducated and vulnerable woman and children deprived of financial, legal, social support and opportunities become victims of internal and cross border trafficking.
trial of war criminals
the trial of war criminals has now become one of the headlines in our newspapers. there are speculations from various corners whether the trial is against a particular political party or against the real war criminals. however, the people of our country are awaiting a trial which will be held after a scrupulous scrutiny, justice and impartial investigation. in this trial, our government should not misuse the political power or vested interests of some people or group since it may cause defamation, irreparable loss or punishment to some innocent persons or groups. any injustice may lead to trouble.
electricity
this is the third time i am composing this letter because every time i tried to relax and compose this letter, power failure occurred. i am pretty much sure that not only me but people of all around the capital city are too much annoyed with the number of times the power failure occurs in a day. this electricity problem is hampering the activities of our daily lives and rather than solving this crisis, our government is busy changing names of institutions. is this the real meaning of digital bangladesh? we always had this electricity problem and so far none of the previous governments paid special attention to it.
foreigners treated shabbily
i am very shocked at the incident of mugging in gulshan-2 on 9 march. but it is a very common incident in our country to cheat the foreigners. should it not be stopped?
good teachers needed
a qualified teacher is crucially important for quality education. teachers play the most important role in education. without qualified teachers we cannot think about quality education. in the public universities of bangladesh we do not have as many qualified teachers as we need. the bad practice of teacher politics in our public universities has worsened this situation day by day.
women's progress
once there was a time when women were kept in their homes to perform household tasks. they were not allowed to come outside their homes. but now they are engaged in all types of jobs. they are working in factories, schools, banks, universities, armed forces, and so on.
parliament overheating
national parliament house is the heart of a country, particularly for a democratic one like bangladesh. it is expected to be a quiet and disciplined place because the destiny of the people and the country depends on the decisions and discussions made here. but it is a matter of profound regret and shame that the parliamentarians have made this place no better than a 'fish market'. sometimes it seems that a 'fish market' is far better than this place! this is really shameful for us as a nation. the mps, whom the general people chose to speak for them, use vulgar, nasty and uncontrolled words as if they are fighting with their enemies in a battlefield! this has been so common a matter that now we see it almost in every session of parliament.
raucous js sessions
the speaker of the bangladesh parliament believes that the leaders of the treasury bench and the opposition should play an effective role in maintaining order in the parliament which plunged into pandemonium last week due to the unruly behaviour of some lawmakers from both the government and the opposition. “if the top leaders are active to this end, i strongly believe that parliament will be more functional and dynamic, and will run smoothly,” he added. during the nearly hour-long interview at his parliament office, mr hamid touched upon issues ranging from parliamentary affairs, code of conduct for the lawmakers, political culture, parliamentary debates and so on.
results of 28th bcs
bcs is a very competitive exam for the participants and also a very important national issue as the officers selected through this exam play a vital role in national strategy building in future. so, a fair selection of the officers is essential. it is a rigorous exam and also a lengthy process. almost two or more years are required to get the selected candidates appointed after the date of circulation. this lengthy process brings a question about the fairness of the selection procedure. only a single paper objective type answer sheet (computer readable) takes more than three months! then the written exam results another 3-4 months. after the written results are published, a few candidates are selected for viva voce. and it is a matter of great regret that even six months after the viva was held, the results have not been published.
environment
recently, a news report was published that bangladesh offered to host a regional summit on environment conservation and carbon emission cut. bangladesh is the most affected country across the globe by carbon pollution caused by the developed and industrial countries. as well, dhaka is the most polluted city in the world.
national flag
only a few days ago i went to chittagong stadium for watching a cricket match. it was bangladesh vs. india. i saw that a boy was cleaning his sit with the flag of bangladesh. i want to say that he used his flag like a brush. i said to him " do you know what you are doing". he replied, "yes i am cleaning my sit, what is the problem?”
powerful women!
the bss dhaka, news report was published in the front page of a local english daily on 10 march. it ranked our prime minister as the sixth most powerful women of asia!
on research
my attention has been drawn to a news item in the daily star (march 11, "findings of researchers can be used in formulating policies").
comilla region
the comilla region was once under ancient samatat and was joined with tripura state. this district came under the reign of the kings of the harikela in the ninth century ad. it came under the rule of east india company in 1765.this district was established as tripura district in 1790.it was renamed comilla in 1960.chandpur and brahmanbaria subdivisions of this district were transformed into districts in 1984.
poor umpiring
are international umpires really that blind or was it another plan to swindle bangladesh and make england win? during the second odi between bangladesh and england, i believe bangladesh played a perfect match and outplayed england in every aspect but they were still short because the umpires made terrible and obvious mistakes. was it deliberate or are they just reckless?
technical education
the industrial base of bangladesh has been expanding in the last two decades. mentionable development has been achieved in garment, cement, textile, steel, sugar, paper, pharmaceutical, ship breaking, shrimp culture etc. manpower export has already been proved a positive factor for the economy. in addition to the garment industry, information technology and ship building industry have tremendous potential and are developing fast. to operate the existing industrial ventures; to expand the industrial sector and to export technical manpower abroad bangladesh needs huge technically educated manpower at diploma and undergraduate levels.
uncivilised behaviour
nowadays govt officers are assaulted by ruling party's student leaders. it happens when govt officers are performing their duties. there is no such example in any other country, not even in african countries.
time running out
who the government is for? certainly not for the common and poverty ridden people. the government has completed about one and a half year but their activities and performances do not exhibit that they are acting as per there election pledges. in the last election, the present government got the popular mandate for their pledges to the nation which seem to be unattended now. a good number of important projects need to be implemented immediately but the government is not paying any heed to those. there are a series of assurances, commitments, plans and policies, fund allocation for various development works but execution of those development works is being ignored and nobody can say when those works will be complete.
let it be pragmatic
thanks to allah, at long last the government has given in to the demand of the general mass regarding the clock issue- an issue unnecessarily created by them. the unfortunate part of this drama is the govt was adamant on their decision without caring for people's opinion, so much so that the prime minister herself very strongly declared in the house that her govt would not change their decision and let people who disagree adjust themselves to the new set-up. it sounded so undemocratic and dictatorial!
banks' recruitment policy
it is quite common to see that banks are contributing to the economy both by accelerating the wheel of economic growth and taking a huge number of talented people as employees who are best of the best in terms of academic qualification. as banks go through rigorous selection test to recruit their employees and offer lucrative salaries, in most cases, banks ask for people who possess extra ordinary academic results and other track record as is shown in the recruitment circular of various banks. in selecting qualified candidates, no doubt, banks are following the right recruitment procedures. however, as a student, what makes me dumbfounded, by observing some recent circulars, is confusing and discriminatory as a means of selecting candidates for written test. in recruitment notice, banks mention that candidates having 4(out of 5) both in ssc and hsc exams need not apply, creating discrimination between students who appeared in ssc exams in 2001 and 2002the years when elective subject was not added (and still not added) to the total gpa and the student, who got results after adding elective subject to the final pointappeared in the exams afterwards. even, the candidates who sat for ssc exams in 2001 experienced same discrimination in their hsc exams held in 2003. view the page international
