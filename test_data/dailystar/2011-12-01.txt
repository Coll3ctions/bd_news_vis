a blunder
the inexplicably hurried move to split the dhaka city corporation (dcc) into two parts is ostensibly to provide better services to the city dwellers. but the popular impression is that it has been done to reap political gain.
is this change real or cosmetic?
the passing of the bill vesting executive powers of the upazilla parishads in the chairman instead of the parishad itself is apparently in line with the long-standing demand to strengthen local government bodies. the bill authorizes the chairperson to prepare the annual performance report for the parishad officials while upgrading the latter from secretary to principal executive officer. this will give the executive officer the power to implement the parishad's decisions and maintain financial discipline. undoubtedly the bill has given a more meaningful function for the chairmen who have often expressed their frustration at being mere figureheads of bodies that are vital for spearheading real development especially in the rural areas. but the fact remains that the bills have retained the power of the mps to be advisers to the parishads of their constituencies effectively allowing them to interfere in the functions of these bodies if they so choose. view the page sports
