separation of judiciary
parliament is supreme in the land for making law and it is the function of the courts and the judiciary to interpret and apply such law. judges can make some law (case law) in areas where there are no parliamentary statutes. a statute will supersede any case law and take its place and there can be no conflict. claims of such conflict are mere exaggeration and like the proverbial storm in a teacup.
tea workers
there are about160 tea gardens in bangladesh. these tea gardens are located mostly in moulvibazar, habiganj, sylhet and chitagong hill tracts. though these tea gardens increase natural beauty of bangladesh and add to our foreign currency earning, the woes of tea garden workers have a dampening effect on their performance. tea labourers have a significant role in the tea industry. the progress of the tea industry depends on the hard work and motivation of tea labourers. but they never got their due in terms of salary and other benefits.
myanmar's negative attitude
myanmar has totally failed to show due respect and good neighbourliness towards bangladesh. once myanmar was a rich country in asia, it was earning a considerable amount of foreign currency exporting surplus rice, logs etc. but the military junta has destroyed the country's wealth as well as good norms and values to a great extent.
gulshan
it is appalling and shocking what dhaka city residents are being subjected to lately. apart from frequent load shedding, unbearable traffic jams, water shortage etc, to which everyone seems to have got used to, now, in a posh area like gulshan, prostitutes are openly moving around in broad daylight! beggars of every description, not to speak of the women carrying someone else's babies, knocking on car windows are now a part of the traffic scene in gulshan 2.
priorities
it is imperative that the incumbent grand alliance government lay emphasis on the priorities like ensuring clean water supply, more gas supply, increasing the generation of electricity & resolving the traffic jams across the country.
drug menace
drug addiction is a serious threat to humanity, especially young generation all over the world. it engulfs all values and destroys the social fabric.
crime and punishment
the nation is aghast, stunned into silence at the indescribable acts of violence at bdr headquarters at pilkhana recently. it is only logical and fair to demand exemplary punishment to the conspirators, perpetrators and their cohorts. however i would like to raise an issue that seems to have escaped most of us. the disciplined bdr jawans who risked their own lives to protect the army officers and their families should be duly and suitably rewarded for their heroic deeds.
slum dwellers
it drew our attention that “court permission will be required to evict slums, a private bill by saber hossain chowdhury” published in the daily prothom alo on 24 february. we express our deep gratitude to the member of parliament, saber hossain chowdhury for tabling such a bill. we express our full support to the initiative.
the poet
shamsur rahman is a star in bangla literature known for his creative works. he was a journalist, dramatist, novelist and a poet who had worked relentlessly all his life.
fertilisers
to increase production use of fertilisers is a common practice among the farmers. though farmers can make much benefit by using fertilisers on the soil, it is having a negative impact on soil fertility. the use of fertilisers on the soil destroys its original fertility. the use of insecticides helps destroy the harmful insects. but sometimes these insecticides mix up with the surface water which is a big health hazard.
points to ponder
abm musa, the respected journalist, highlighted his point of view on a channel-i programme on issues of bdr enquires and terrorism scare in the government. we are not aware whether the government has any system to listen to and act or react to such comments coming from a popular media programme. the issues mr. musa raised should be an eye opener for the government policy makers.
australian visa
the system of skill category migration has been in place in australia for long. there are some methodologies/procedures/rules to get/obtain skill category migration. initially, the applicant has to obtain 90-120 points to apply for skill category migration. this point is measured based on the applicant's age, proficiency in english and job offer in australia. it should be learnt that the australian government prepares a migration occupation list each year. an applicant who does not have any job offer, whatever qualification s/he has, will not qualify to apply for the skill category migration.
hsc exams
unlike other years, this year the hsc examination is scheduled to start from the middle of april-- probably the hottest month of the year. in the previous years, the exams were held in june--the month when monsoon arrives .as we know, load shedding becomes a very common affair in the summer, making life difficult through the length and breadth of this land.
corruption
corruption is a multi-faceted term these days. corruption may be committed in two ways --corruption above the table and corruption under the table. mahathir mohammad once said the former can be checked through the rules or laws but the latter cannot be rooted out through the mundane rules, it is related with the moral values and norms. corruption is a practice which deviates from the accepted norms. it is prevalent in every society from primordial times. in the eighteenth century the level of corruption in america and the uk was less in comparison with the later centuries.
fate of a migrant worker
i want to start my story with a proverb; wherever the luckless goes, he would get the same result. since my childhood, i heard the buzz proverb several times. though i could not understand the actual meaning of that, but today, the alarming rate of our migrants coming back due to global economic recession makes it clear to me.
power supply
in light of the current huge shortage of electricity and future increase of demand and scarcity of gas for large-scale power generation, it can be said that the county's electricity supply situation will never be normal without at least one 1000mw n-power plant.
ru incident
a few days ago, we witnessed a shameful incident at rajshahi university . our past heritage provides us with ample evidence of students' glorious presence in and contribution to politics. past studies show that in our language movement and the movement of our independence the students had contributed a lot.
redefining secularism
"redefining secularism, published in the ds, is an extra-ordinary article indeed. mr. anwarul kabir in this prudent write-up has rightly defined secularism. while defining secularism at the state level, we must consider the people and their psychology. secularism devoid of religion will not be acceptable to the people of present bangladesh. rather, we have to think about religions with liberal views. as long as religions remain flexible and show tolerance, establishing secularism of our style is possible. restricting religions to the private sphere of the life, as western notion suggests, is not possible right now. even western society is now in a dilemma and with the increase of muslim population, some countries in europe and america are considering installation of sharia board (e.g. canada). france is also compromising in the context of wearing hizab in public schools.
poor decision
i was really shocked to see on bbc that bangladesh had banned youtube for broadcasting certain things. i do understand that there is classified information which should not be published. whoever had uploaded those things did not act like a good citizen. but, unfortunately, my concern was more about the way the government had tried to resolve the matter by banning youtube in bangladesh. such action was not expected from the party that has promised to build a digital bangladesh. i believe the situation could have been dealt with more efficiently. before banning, did anyone from the government request youtube to restrict viewing the news from internet concerning our internal security? i believe they would have got a good response.

bdr carnage
the entire episode was eye-opening. stark was the absence of a national crisis management mechanism designed to swing into action. the prime minister's meeting with mutineers to settle issues 'politically' was in itself a breach of security protocol. equally absurd was professionally ill-equipped home minister sahara khatoon and state minister jahangir nanak's role as negotiators.
our students
population boom is one of our main problems. about five lakh job seekers are not getting jobs, as the job market is small. our students cannot study in good universities in developed countries due to lack of required standards and poor performance in english. there are many reasons behind these. one of them is student politics. our students do not study as per requirement. after taking admission into the public universities, they start indulging in politics for getting undue facilities. view the page international
