roads in disrepair and citizens in misery
it is the same old story all over again. it is the monsoon season and just when citizens are in need of life being kept normal, they see that the roads they must use are in pitiable conditions once more. six months have gone by since roads in the city's hazaribagh and rayerbazar area were dug up by the dhaka water and sewerage authority (wasa) to install storm sewers. in any civilised society, this kind of work would have begun and ended in a few weeks. but in the particularly sordid conditions in which we live, it really matters little to the authorities whether or not the amenities we are entitled to as citizens are there. now an engineer of the dhaka city corporation tries to explain away the problem by suggesting that after installing the storm sewers, wasa covered the dug-up roads with earth rather than sand. our question is simple: where was the dcc when wasa was committing this manifest wrong?

child beating
physical beating of children by caning, ear twisting and hard slapping, has been practiced, and is still being practiced in 'maktabs' and primary and secondary schools in bangladesh, as reported in most dailies over the last few weeks. one wonders if it is a good or logical practice in raising and teaching very young children the proverbial "3rs"!
playgrounds
while we were students, we used to play in the fields regularly in mohammadpur. we had to encounter some encroachers and we found out that the number of playgrounds was dwindling. now, there remains almost no playground in mohammadpur. some leaders of the political parties are the inspiration for the encroachers in this regard.
admission crisis
a severe crisis has been predicted to loom over the admission of the students, who have passed the hsc-levels this year, to higher educational institutions due to dearth of seats in medical colleges, national universities and other different private and public universities. besides the universities, a shocking situation is likely to occur in the leading colleges in cities where many bright students are unlikely to get admission due to shortage of seats.
power crisis
we have been facing power crisis for decades mainly because of our inadequate capacity to generate electricity. as many power plants run using cng, the demand of cng is increasing. the government has taken a decision to close the cng stations from 3pm to 9pm daily to balance supply and demand.
ramadan
ramadan is a month of training for each believer. this month is divided into three parts-- the first ten days of rahmat, the middle ten days of magfirat and the last ten days of najat. in fact, each day is of rahmat for a mumin as s/he engages her/himself in doing good throughout her or his life. everyone should take lessons of the holy ramadan and apply those in his or her life.
tax on saving certificates
for most senior citizens, saving to reduce tax liability is hardly a viable option. nor does it make sense. ironically, most of them are wholly dependent on the income from the investments they made during their working life in tax saving schemes such as the employees' provident fund and the public provident fund. to suggest a similar method to save and reduce taxes during their retirement is unjust on many other counts as well. the point has repeatedly been made that the present generation of senior citizens has not benefited from macro-economic policies of the recent past. a period of historically low interest rates has certainly enabled many individuals to borrow against future income and buy homes and other assets.
draft police ordinance
your timely opinion on the whereabouts of the 2007 police ordinance makes a passionate plea that has been heard a hundred times since independence. while i commend your earnestness and hopefulness, please allow me to be more realistic. the cold fact of the matter is that no political government, regardless of the party in power, will ever willingly undertake any reform that would check its own unbridled power. i am in my late thirties now. since my teenage years i have seen well attended seminars and symposia on reforming police ordinances, updating preventive detention laws, creating autonomous local authorities, and establishing the constitutionally mandated office of the national ombudsman. except for a few meaningful reforms pushed through by non-political caretaker governments, nothing has ever come of the beautiful speeches given at these symposia. the bangladeshi politician and the bangladeshi bureaucrat are two creatures who have an inherent belief that the nation owes them subservience for the good of all concerned. to expect such creatures to willingly give up their jealously guarded privileges of lordship over the masses is to be optimistic beyond reason. it has not happened in forty years and it is not about to happen now, notwithstanding the prose at seminars and passion in editorials.

day after day, year after year, some good-thinking people are writing in your 'letters to the editor' section. are there any solutions of the points and problems raised in those letters? where are the follow-ups?
no more university!
recently the microsoft-founder bill gates at a techonomy conference in lake tahoe, calif said- “place-based colleges are good for parties, but are becoming less crucial for learning, thanks to the internet.”
amnesty appreciated
the government recently released nearly 1000 long-serving prisoners, recognising their good behaviour and other things. many of them have already served over 20 years of imprisonment and have grown old. the authorities took this issue into consideration and rewarded the prisoners who had showed remorse for their wrong-doings. this act of kindness from the government is greatly appreciated.
ground zero
this is an election year for the lawmakers (congress) in the usa, which is only a couple of months away from the election day. the right-wingers do not have real issues because the republican rule for the last two terms have completely ruined the us economy. irrational and unjust iraq war have drained the us treasury of one trillion dollar, almost 5,000 soldiers died and several thousand were severely injured. on the iraqi side tens of thousands of innocent civilians were killed or injured for no reason. the us has lost its moral and ethical image in the world scene by brutally treating people in iraqi prisons. now the religious right republicans have this mosque issue out of context to incite hatred and raw ethnic emotion to arouse sentiments to win the election.
lawbreakers everywhere
that day i was passing through mirpur road, i had to stop over a bookshop to pick up some books. after i had reached there, i noticed a car parked just beside the shop.
aarong incident
this is in response to letter written by ms. tasnuva sharmin, published on 23rd august. it may seem unusual but i really cannot agree with her assessment or handling of the situation. as someone who has spent a considerable amount of time in another country where the populace knew neither english nor bengali, i can actually relate to the frustration felt by this american woman. but a lot of the time i did get assistance from other helpful locals who were familiar with english and this helped alleviate my problems. if ms. sharmin was fluent in english, would it not have been more prudent/helpful to actually translate for her? i mean she is a guest after all. the american woman's comment , although disparaging, could simply be translated as frustration and lack of understanding of our cultural attire. but is it not up to us to make foreigners aware of our culture, history and social norms? not everything can be learnt from a guidebook and maybe a little sympathy and communication would have made things a lot easier.
usa immigration policy
as a man of the law i am aware of the intricacies of citizenship and the fickle nature of international law; it is very difficult for people born with ethnic roots in one country to receive citizenship of another. it is even more difficult, verging on the impossible nowadays, if you are from a third world country and trying to get citizenship of a first world nation. we don't call the industrially developed nations the first world for no reason, everything from life expectancy to education is better there, and in comparison to our own country maybe a million fold better. so everyone and their kitchen cook is trying to get themselves to one of these first world countries, especially the usa, and dreaming of becoming a citizen. and so these first world countries are making it more and more difficult for people like us to get in.
private cars and traffic jam
previous projects or plans which had been accepted to control traffic jam in the capital were car oriented, not human oriented. stp (strategy for transportation plan) that was approved by caretaker govt is a glaring example. thirty five percent financial allotment was also kept in stp for private car-friendly transportation. this was not expected by us. because, only five percent citizens of dhaka have private cars. a few days ago, a daily newspaper revealed a report that 100 private cars land on the roads of dhaka every day.
suppression of women
this is in response to an interview published in 17th july issue of the 'star insight' entitled 'dr yasmeen haque: a voice of strenth' by rafi hossain. there dr yasmeen haque(provost of the shahid janoni jahanara imam hall at shahjalal university of science and technology) stated in her interview that “ i believe once women find their voice to protest wrongs, a voice to claim their rights, half the gender rights battle will have been won.” her comment was proved wrong within a month when some female students of 1st year 2nd semester formed a peaceful human chain protesting fee hike of women dormitories. notice was given to the students to vacate the hall. whither rights of women?
tolerance
there is a saying, "gorom vaat e biral bejar, uchit kothay bondhu bejar". if you offer a cat it won't like steaming hot rice, it will sniff and express dissatisfaction and move away. and when you say the righteous words to a friend that goes against his stand, he is likely to dislike those words and your friendship may be ruined, it depends on his power to take the truth because true words are intolerable.
armed guards, not gunmen
recently some newspapers referring to the ministry of education and university grants commission have reported that the vcs of our public universities are going to be provided with 'gunmen' for strengthening their safety and security. here the word 'gunmen, which is the plural form of 'gunman', is not appropriate at all. the meaning of 'gunman', according to oxford advanced learner's dictionary, is 'a man who uses a gun to steal from or kill people'. that means gunmen are robbers or muggers or dacoits. can they be employed for anybody's security? actually, the word, 'armed guards' should be used instead of 'gunmen'. view the page international
