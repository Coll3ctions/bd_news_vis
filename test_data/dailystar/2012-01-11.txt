dangerous trends in the economy
inflation rate in bangladesh is now prevailing at a double digit figure, approximately twelve percent. inflation rate is considered one of the most important macro-economic indicators. bangladesh's economy is at its worse at this moment. there are scores of reasons for rising inflation such as, demand-supply gap, poor monetary policy, lack of proper government regulations and policy decisions, excessive expenditures on non-productive sectors, import-export imbalances, etc. inflation contributes to the loss of purchasing power, decrease in real income and a prolonged negative impact on investment. given that we have twelve percent inflation rate till date, our savings rate remains somewhere around twelve percent or below. now consider its consequences. we invest in different savings instruments with the sole objective of a good return whereas we end up with fewer amounts compared to what we had before in real terms! this is a nightmarish situation for any economy that exhibits a very dangerous trait if we consider the market dynamics such as multiplier effect, people's expectations, and demand-supply equilibrium. it is hard to survive in such a situation where people are struggling to obtain their basic needs. hence, it demands drastic measures on the part of the policy makers.
we need cautious optimists
depending upon the lens through which one analyses bangladesh's current economic development, anyone will arrive at different conclusions. this is similar to the parable of four blind men who conclude differently as they touch different parts of an elephant's body. the one touching the tail compares the animal with a rope, the one feeling the trunk thinks it to be a snake, while the one touching the body decides that it must be like a wall. like the blind, we also miss the big picture if we fail to recognise the different lenses and conclusions. at one extreme are the optimists who embrace free trade, free markets, liberalisation, and privatisation.

making students e-textbook savvy

why make osds?
byron's last page report in your january 7th issue defines osds as those who are officially called as officers on special duty, which many jokingly refer to as 'officers searching a desk'! however, there is contradiction in the report. in the first paragraph, it is stated that osds "are considered to be in a state of punishment"! this naturally pre-supposes that some fault or mistake has been committed by the officer. in contrast, in the eighth paragraph, officials from the public administration say that "civil servants are made osds mainly for two reasons - they get promoted but are not given any posting and for political reasons"! it adds that "these officers get full pay and all fringe benefits, including official vehicles where due." this therefore precludes any state of punishment! although no statistics are available, it is estimated that the government spends several crore taka a month on osds! assuming that it is ten crore taka a month, it comes to hundred and twenty crore taka every year, spent for "no work with all pay"! in contrast, low paid workers in the production sector work on "no work no pay basis"! is it not a gross injustice? if osds are being made as a measure of punishment, then government should consider reducing their earned leave by half the number of days they are posted as osds. this can be adjusted against their usually large accumulated leave during payment of final dues at the time of retirement. that will have at least some monetary effect of the punitive measure taken.

two brave men of prague
vaclav havel will be recalled for the nobility of purpose he brought into his struggle for a democratic czecholovakia in the 1980s. but, of course, his campaign for popular liberty began long before that, through his plays and his articles and his absolute fearlessness before the powers that were. when he died recently, it was once again time to recall the tumultuous times which he inhabited, indeed helped shape, in what would soon be a post-cold war world. by the time he died -- and this is again the unvarnished truth -- he was no more the political giant he was when he rode to power in prague at the head of what came to be known as the velvet revolution; and yet that old appeal, the unforgettable charisma was always there. havel went to his grave as one of the more widely respected political figures of his time.

on syed mahbub murshed
january 11 is the birth anniversary of the late justice syed mahbub murshed. he will be remembered for many things, particularly his fearless independence on the bench and many landmark judgments, chiefly on constitutional issues. consider the following cynical statement about justice made by one thrasymachus in plato's republic: “i declare that justice is nothing else than that which is advantageous to the stronger.” to plato (and murshed) justice was the very antithesis of this rhetorical statement. judges are meant to be independent, but do they always dare exercise this independence in the face of a powerful executive, and when their own personal advancement may be jeopardised by the exercise of strict independence and adherence to the right, however inconvenient? in other words, there are many who behave in accordance with thrasymachus' thinking, and a few who do not.
