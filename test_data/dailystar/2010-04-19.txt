in an unprecedented move that the chief justice was constrained to take yesterday, he administered oath to 15 of the 17 judges to the high court recommended for appointment by the government and approved by the president. by taking this position, we think, he has asserted his sense of integrity and shown boldness where it was required which we appreciate. we are hopeful that this will help enhance public confidence in the judiciary.
gathering bitterness over bhola-3 by-election
much heat is being generated over the forthcoming by-election for the bhola-3 constituency. the by-election, scheduled for 24 april, has already come under a cloud with the ruling awami league and the opposition bnp accusing each other of trying to foil the election or engineering a result that will favour either one of them. leading figures of the awami league have charged the bnp with creating the ground for chaos if the opposition candidate does not win the by-election. for their part, senior politicians of the bnp have consistently warned that the ruling party is engaged in a ploy to deprive the opposition nominee of victory at the polls. to substantiate their arguments, they have pointed to the instances of violence which have marred the campaigning of the bnp's hafizuddin ahmed. indeed, the bnp election coordinator nazimuddin alam came under attack allegedly by awami league activists last week. the al has rejected the charge and has instead suggested that the bnp itself orchestrated the attack as a way of undermining the voting. view the page sports

new year 1417
though bangladesh is a small country in size, it retains multicultural heritage from the primordial era. the people of this region are caring enough to celebrate festivals. with the help of modern technology (e.g. cell phone, satellite channels) this trend is increasing rapidly. this tendency has been amplified in the last few years tremendously in case of celebrating the bengali new year.
groundwater depletion
about 65% of the surface of metro dhaka was water bodies (ponds, small lakes, steams etc.) about 20 years ago. the soil profile of dhaka and its surrounding areas is clay with silt with some silt-loam composition. water percolates very slowly through these soils from the water bodies to recharge the ground water table. during the rainy season the water bodies around dhaka were filled up and a significant quantity of surface water would also runoff into the streams and rivers. water from the filled up water bodies used to slowly percolate over time and recharge the groundwater, thus elevating the water table to a constant level every year until lately with introduction of massive land filling projects to build houses for an ever growing dhaka population. a significant portion of those water bodies was filled and so most of the rainwater escapes dhaka through surface runoff, creating artificial flooding in many areas. because of land filling surface water does not percolate and recharge the groundwater table. it is estimated that we are losing 1-2 inches of water table every year. with more and more land filling and concretisation of metro dhaka, this rate of groundwater depletion would be worse.
solar power scheme
i am highly optimistic after reading the article “power crisis” ( the daily star: 12-04-2010). grameen shakti's power generation by using solar power is undoubtedly praiseworthy in the sense that it can compensate for the future & further shortage of electricity in the capital! the matter is in our government's hand. looking at the further/ ongoing construction of high-rise buildings, gob can make it obligatory for rehab members to install such solar power system in their buildings. prices of all electronic commodities are falling day by day; which are benefiting this wealthy population! why can't they spend on this scheme? let us proliferate the solar home system providers! as the raw material i.e. solar power is more than abundant, is it impossible to implement the project?

chittagong university is one of the prominent universities in our country. but, unfortunately, many children are working in cu cafeteria and restaurants. they are deprived of education, though they are eager to become educated.
shakespeare
the month april is significant because great dramatist shakespeare was born in this month. shakespeare is a unique figure in the world of literature. the more i read, the more i get from his dramas.
climate change and we
without an iota of doubt it can be said that the world is getting warmer and subsequently the world climate is getting changed. but the people of this planet are not well prepared to face these natural ups and downs. a good number of countries are the worst sufferers of this cataclysmic hazard such as bangladesh, bhutan, maldives, sri lanka, especially the whole south asian region. people were not much acquainted with the term 'climate change' in the past. lately, it has become a buzzword. of course, natural “dis-equilibrium” creates many changes in the whole process of climate. generally, we know that any change in climatic process occurs after a long time pause. in recent years, the changes have been happening very rapidly. it is obvious that men made activities are massively responsible for climate change.
an appeal to the govt.
we, on behalf of the retired armed forces employees, are humbly drawing the attention of the honourable prime minister to an important issue. our honourable finance minister recently declared that the government officers and employees, who took retirement up to july 2008, would be included in the new pay scale, which came into force in july 2009. in accordance with the declaration of the finance minister, the government civilian officers and employees have been included in the new scale. but it is a matter of great regret that the retired armed forces employees were not included in the pay scale. even we, who have gone into retirement in january 2010, have not been made the beneficiaries of these facilities.
government's policies
this refers to the prime minister's concern regarding the civil servants that her government is still trying to bring back confidence among the public servants that was lost during the army-backed caretaker regime. she alleged that a sluggish situation is still prevailing, the regime is facing trouble in doing government's works for the people. she also alleged that the army-backed caretaker government was engaged in absurd works in the name of eradicating corruption. she also accused the bnp-led 4-party alliance government of destroying the morality of the public servants. there were stalemate, fear and panic. she added that her government could not overcome these adverse factors yet. but she said that in the near future these obstacles created by the caretaker government would be removed.
customers
customer perceived value(cpv) is a very important concept for any business organisation. many businesses are not facilitated to shape their “point of differences (pods)” for their product. though they are not able to modify the product , they can increase the total customer benefits. personnel benefit is a key to the way of achieving this goal.
challenged people
if you keep our eyes open we can see that about 5% people are physically or mentally disabled. the rights of autistic people are strictly followed in the developed countries or they provide better facilities to them but the developing countries like bangladesh could not afford minimum facilities to them.
unliveable city
i am sure that you are familiar with the nature of crisis in bangladesh, so why are we not taking action? the trash in dhaka is out of control. everywhere we go we see paper, plastic, food wastes and construction site wastes in the streets.
girls and stalkers
reading the daily newspapers we are shattered with shame and sorrow when we see how the girls are being dealt with. due to the presence of some misguided young people, the innocent girls are leading themselves towards death. while going to school, the girls are irritated by stalkers with rubbish words and vulgar proposals and for getting rid of these they commit suicide. in some cases, even the parents have been killed and humiliated. they can't file any case as they are threatened by the criminals.
netanyahu's arrogance
after reading this article, i found myself extremely sympathetic with the palestinian cause. the gesture of the israeli prime minister was childish at best and i can't believe a man with such a high international position would stoop to such low levels.
appoint smart people
it seems that the recently formed investigation agency is directionless and not up to the task. this is because the persons appointed are not media savy. they seem to be shy of the media whereas the success of the entire process depends on people's support through the media. i suggest that smarter and more intelligent people be appointed.
holy hadith
the ongoing wastage of water, power and gas in some places, when the country is reeling under the combined effect of severe shortages of them, reminds me of a fact mentioned in the holy hadith. once some followers of our dearest nabi hazrat muhammad (pbuh) asked him, ''ya rasulallah! can we use as much water as we want during ablution when we remain on the sea?'' our dearest rasul (pbuh) replied, ''no, rather you are allowed to use as much water as you require for ablution, even when you are on the sea.''
pohela boishakh
it has been a common trend for our so-called intellectuals to criticize young generation for wearing western dresses. on pohela baishakh, irrespective of age, people wear traditional panjabis and sarees. young people refuse western dresses & fast foods on that day. they enjoy the day having our age-old makeup. but there are a lot of intellectuals who keep on blaming our young generation. on all other days, youths prefer western dress and makeup . why do they wear traditional dresses only on pohela baishakh? this is the question asked by the guardians. view the page international
