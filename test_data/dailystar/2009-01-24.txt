understanding bangladesh from a neighbour's door
the mahajote's victory in the recent bangladesh parliamentary election may be seen as one of the most important event in the history of the country. it is eventful because when the world was busy to project bangladesh as a breeding centre for islamic fundamentalism, the outcome is certainly a paradigm shift. the mohajote has been able to reach across divides of religion, race, gender and politics and unify the country once again after 1971 war of independence.

smart power diplomacy
i would like to begin by quoting henry kissinger, secretary of state under ford presidency: "no country has influenced internationals as decisively and at the same time as ambivalently as the united states. no society has more firmly insisted on the admissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of other states, or more passionately asserted that its own values were universally applicable". that was precisely the foreign policy trend of the government of the united states. but disastrous foreign policy was presented by president george w. bush when he invaded afghanistan in 2001 without presenting evidential proof that osama bin laden, a saudi arabian, who was a guest resident of afghan government, was responsible for launching attacks on the world trade centre in new york and without the authorization of the united nations. view the page environment

on death and loss: remembering my mother
one of my earliest memories of the mystery of death is my recollection of a story we read in elementary school. in the story, we learned about the reaction of siddhartha, who later came to be known as gautam buddha, when he had a face-to-face encounter with death in kapilavastu. his father, king sudhhodono, did not want his son to have to deal with death or human suffering. but gautam witnessed both, in spite of the king and his courtiers. since the time i read the story, it has stayed with me, and the manner in which siddhartha went about on his now legendary quest for the meaning of life and death has always fascinated me. later i realized that, amongst my friends, like many others growing up in the indian sub-continent in the 60's and 70's, we had a shared feeling that real search for truth begins only after you witness death or experience love.
south asian literary conference
i should not have spoken ill of winter in my earlier dispatch. old man winter continues to wreck havoc - especially on the west coast. the pacific coast, known for its balmy weather, was taken by surprise when they were dumped with snow of the amount many have never seen in their entire lives. life literally halted. the most affected by this recalcitrant weather pattern were the holiday travelers as their travel plans went haywire with cancelled flights, delays and re-routings. television news replayed pictures of sleep-deprived travelers anxiously waiting for a lucky break that would transport them from the no-man zone of the airport to their familiar abodes. then there would be others, who would camp out in the waiting area, oblivious to the rest of the world. when i had booked a flight from montreal to san francisco five months ago, i had no idea i would be caught up in this travel frenzy myself.

war in gaza: the domestic, regional and strategic implications
the gaza war planners have succeeded at most to mobilize israeli public opinion in support of the military campaign against gaza. although the trio of leaders, olmert, livni and ehud barak, lack real support from the public to lead, they have succeeded to convince israelis, getting 90% support, of the necessity of this campaign. olmert, who has been questioned tens of times by the police, is suspected of receiving bribes and of other wrong doings, was forced to leave office early and to agree to early elections. he declared war on gaza one and a half months before the elections as a transitional prime minister. nobody knows how prime minister olmert has succeeded to conduct a war given his current status as a prime minister under suspicion for taking bribes. some argue that all the investigations against him were part of a grand deception to show that there is no prime minister functioning while at the same time planning the grand strategy of the war. others argue that the military leadership decided to conduct a war exactly at this moment with a weak transitional prime minister.
