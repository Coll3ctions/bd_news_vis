towards a new education policy
the education ministry seems all geared up to place before the nation a new education policy within the next three months. a 16-member committee is working at it. as stated by the education minister, the new policy would aim at improving the present state of education at all levels, giving special emphasis on setting up institutions for providing vocational education at all upazilas across the country. theoretically, all this sounds good, but we wonder whether he is living up to his own criticism of the culture of frequent shifts in policies by himself initiating yet another policy.
thailand's descent into chaos
a summit of asean leaders was aborted in the thai beach resort of pattaya on saturday when hundreds of supporters of thaksin shinawatra descended on the venue to demand the resignation of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva. obviously, it was an embarrassing sight in full view of the world and it certainly put thailand's embattled government to shame. the incident clearly shows the pitfalls the country's fledgling democracy has been up against, especially since a coup in september 2006 deposed thaksin and replaced it with what has come to be seen as unending chaos.

daylight saving
in the backdrop of scarcity of electricity one may think of daylight saving by advancing clock timing which is in practice in europe and other countries. bangladesh is a tropical country where difference of day and night time is not too wide. sun shines 10 to 12 hours in daytime around the year. as such advancing the clock by an hour will not be useful for us. the concept of day light saving is very much correct and we should utilise it in a customised way but not by advancing clock time. this is not also practised in our neighbouring countries india and pakistan. we can do it by designing and constructing houses and offices very much accessible to daylight. in contrary to that we see that houses and offices have no access to light, even in secretariat building windows and doors are covered by heavy curtains to make artificial dark and then light it with many unnecessary decorative lights consuming a huge amount of electricity. we should immediately stop this culture to get the benefit of daylight.
primary education
i am really disappointed to know that our government is planning to raise primary education to class viii. as an ex-student of bangladesh primary school, i would like to share the following with the readers, policy makers and concerned institutions. the simon fraser university, canada conducted a study in 2006, the author was sandra nikolic, titled "educating the future: raising the quality of primary schooling in bangladesh". this study investigates the low quality of primary school education in bangladesh. elite interviews suggest that gob (government of bangladesh) primary schools fail to provide students with quality education, demonstrate poor teacher performance, have overcrowded classrooms, and weak management and administration. quantitative analysis of parents with primary-aged children reveals that of the four principal primary schooling options available, public primary schools are more likely than other primary schooling options to exhibit components of poor quality. the findings indicate that parents are equally concerned about male and female education; that administration functions are a matter of concern, and that poverty is an overarching barrier to attendance and retention rates. the important policy message is the need for establishing a system of accountability of school performance to parents and communities. all stakeholders, in turn, should be involved in partnerships affecting primary school conditions.
hospital for all
khwaja yunus ali medical college and hospital is a world-class hospital situated in a rural char area in enayetpur, sirajganj. the vision and mission of the hospital is to give gold standard service to the poor at a minimum cost. at this moment, the cancer institute adjacent to the hospital is the pioneering cancer treatment centre in bangladesh and the service is unique in nature in south and south east asia. the patients do not need to go to singapore or india because a minimum cost helps the cancer patient to survive. the hospital has varieties of specialty and also has specialty in heart surgery. all types of cardiac surgery are performed here at one-third cost, compared to private hospitals in dhaka.
of guidebooks
we've talked a lot about the guidebooks menace so far; we've talked and written a lot on the mushrooming coaching centres and their activities in the name of inculcating “knowledge” to the students at large. yet, very unfortunately, we haven't been able to stop the “guidebook business” in the open perimeter of the institutions and beyond --- they are being printed and sold out to the students. it is unfortunate because most of the guidebooks, as it has been reported frequently, are full of mistakes, haphazard organisation of ideas, and most tragically, misleading. despite the government's ban on the guidebooks they are on the open platter in the markets for the education pursuers.
stop the goons
all dailies in a front-page news report on 1st. april covered the dmch incident triggered by bcl's violence on the campus. it is a poor reflection on the al's management capabilities. if they cannot manage their party's activities; how can they manage the various problems of bangladesh?
student politics
the glorious past of student politics is now waning because of present so-called student politics. student politics is now a horrendous proposition. today student politics means extortion, tender hijacking, admission business, occupying dormitories, taking free-meals, seat politics, controlling campus, chanting slogans in favour of their god fathers or so called leaders etc. not an iota of activities in favour of general students is visible. so, why is student politics prevailing on campus? obviously, not for students, but for the ruling party and the opposition.
a tragic death
the boy with a bright future is gone. he has left all of us and has gone to such a place from where he will never ever come to us. sayem, a brilliant dhaka university student of psychology, was like my younger brother. he passed away on april 8, 2009 after suffering from cancer for almost a year. we met a couple of times and i have always found this boy sober and calm. he was ambitious and was always optimistic. he always looked at the positive sides of life. even, the last time when i met him at the hospital a couple of weeks ago, he was hopeful and positive that he would recover soon and start attending his classes again. i was shocked when i heard about his death. it was unbearable for me to witness the death of such a young optimistic boy. now, i can only tell myself, sayem, my brother, today you are no more with us, but your memories will always be in our hearts and we pray to the almighty for your eternal peace.
smoking in public places
this is in reference reply to my letter by a. bashar, published on april 10, 2009. the writer accused me of charging smokers in a wholesale manner in my letter, disregarding the tobacco act. my point is that when a doctor examines a patient suffering from tobacco related diseases he never asks whether the patient had smoked cigarettes maintaining tobacco code or not or whether he had smoked in the public places or private places designated by the government. it seems the writer is a supporter of smoking and i had hurt his sentiment by comparing the smokers with terrorists and by appealing to the present government which initiated the anti-smoking law to enforce the same very strictly. smoking is harmful and injurious to health which may cause death as is evident from the statutory warning on every cigarette packet.
a profitable business
when a new party assumes power, their student wing is found to be in a hurry to regain control over all the educational institutions, defeating other student wings. after that they start to fight among the groups of their own parties. they always try to reign supreme on the campus. why do they adopt such a policy? actually, it is a profitable business. the student wing of the ruling party tries to control all activities and take a big share of money spent on different projects.
clemency by tac
recently, the government disclosed the names of officials seeking clemency from the truth and accountability commission (tac). but the officials opted for voluntary disclosure with confidentiality guaranteed by the then government. disclosure of their identity was indeed not fair to them.
construction act
the construction act gazetted on 27th may 2008 and published on 29th may 2008, is no doubt appreciable in many a respect, but the new floor area ratio (far) seems to be unrealistic, in the context of our availability of land mass. the far table deserves revision for the benefit of the small landowners. as per the far, small landowners possessing up to 10 katha or less have to keep almost 50% of the plot vacant all around to conform to the new regulations. it is simply not feasible to construct a liveable house by the land owners/developers on the plots measuring up to 5 katha or less. we have come to know through media that large number of applications filed by such landowners is pending, awaiting approval of the offices of rajuk in view of above provisions.
price of rice
referring to the report in your daily on 6th april on a comment by the agriculture minister, "prices of rice had been between tk 9 and tk 9.50 a kg during the tenure of the last al government between 1996 and 2001, which increased to tk 22 to tk 23 during the bnp regime." such a comment to prove the weakness of an opponent is not judicious.
harassed twice!
income tax & value added tax (vat) of a business is assessed on the basis of sale or turnover. this is unbelievable but believe it that in bangladesh the sale or turnover of a business is always assessed twice by two different govt. departments & the sale or turnover figure assessed by the two departments for the same business is always different. this funny thing is happening because income tax & vat is assessed by income tax & customs departments respectively and there is no co-ordination between the two departments. as a result, a businessman is harassed twice for the same business, which is completely unnecessary.
brta's blank cheque?
some time back, prices of oil were up for a while for which a transport company raised their bus fare from dhaka to chittagong and vice versa from tk. 465 to tk. 565 for non executive seats. has the brta any consideration of such factors on which a reasonable bus fare is to be decided?
