scientific family
dr. moyra mcdeal is professor of mechanical engineering at a famous university in canada. in an international conference on science and technology held in july 2002 at the congress hall in ottawa, she introduced herself as member of a scientific family. she belongs to a five member family and a scientific happy couple. all members in her family are scientifically qualified. she was discussing on scientific advancement drawing examples from her own family. she tried to show how scientific couple can enhance the efforts of developing scientific family and scientific community in a country. it was a unique presentation for learning and picking ideas particularly for participants attending from developing countries. after a long gap of seven years, dr. moyra's suggestions seem very effective for us all.

the universe and the creator
in plain words the universe means the sky - the whole firmament that man finds spread over him, day and night, in which the sun shines in the day and the moon and countless stars glitter at night, which amazes him even when he sees it with the bare eye, but which appears as vast, limitless when he looks at it through the telescope. it seems to be starting from nowhere and ending nowhere. millions of times larger planets than our earth are moving in it like tiny balls; thousands of times brighter stars than our sun are shining in it, our entire solar system is located in a comer of its only one galaxy; only in this one galaxy there exist at least three thousand million other stars like our own sun, and man's observation has so far discovered one million such galaxies. out of the lakhs of galaxies, our nearest neighbouring galaxy is so distant from us that its light reaches the earth in ten lakh years travelling at the speed of 186,000 miles per second. this shows the vastness of that part of the universe which has so far been observed and explored by man. as to how vast is the entire universe of allah, we have no means to estimate and judge. if about the god who has brought this huge and wonderful universe into being, this tiny talking animal, called man, who creeps the earth, asserts that he cannot recreate him once again after death, it would be due to narrowness of his own mind. the power of the creator of the universe would not at all be affected by it !
law and order situation
recently, the law and order situation has taken a dramatic downslide in the country. every day the dailies are filled with news of murders, rape and all sorts of crimes. surely, this is not the change people prayed for while installing the new democratic government. the caretaker govt., although undemocratic and laden with a list of failure records, could at least boast of the considerably improved law and order situation. a developed bangladesh means not only the cyber amenities, but also providing security to every citizen with regard to his or her life, honour and property.
