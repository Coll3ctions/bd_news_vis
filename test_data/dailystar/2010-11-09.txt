tilted buildings may be a tip of the iceberg
the front page story in this paper yesterday said it all -- a seven-storey building awaiting finishing touches at kanthalbagan tilting, its domino effect has ensnared a 17-storey and another 10-storey building impelling massive evacuation of inhabitants to safety in the small hours of night. the reason why it tilted is put down to a basement pillar of the unfinished building having collapsed. the developer of the apartment building in question claimed that it was constructed in compliance with the building code. "i followed the rules including soil testing," he would have us believe. but because the construction was raised after filling a big pond, an official supervision from rajuk at least through the initial stages of construction was an imperative necessity. was it done? if not, why not? if so, was it compromised? these are natural questions to ask.
