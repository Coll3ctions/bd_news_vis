lailat-ul-qadr
this is the most auspicious night for muslims all over the world. it is more blessed than a thousand months. for the muslims it is a special dispensation from allah, for allah has said that a night's meditation at this occasion is equal to that of thousand nights. for this is the night when allah revealed the holy quran, through the last prophet muhammad (sm), not just for the muslims to seek guidance from but for the entire mankind to be guided by. the holy quran, along with the last prophet of allah, has come as a redeemer to the muslims in particular. and it is for the muslims to internalise and understand the essence of the teaching of the quran, for salvation not only of the soul in the hereafter, but also of the body in this world.
the workers' visas were genuine?

violence against women
acid throwing is a vicious form of violence against women (vaw). although, we know that vaw is a universal phenomenon, what many of us may not know is the extent and form the violence takes. acid throwing is a particularly vicious and damaging form of vaw in bangladesh. there are cases of acid throwing in other countries but these are isolated incidents, nowhere near the number of attacks that occur in bangladesh. the victims are attacked for many reasons. in some cases, the attack takes place because a young girl or women has spurned the sexual advances of a male or has rejected a proposal of marriage. recently, however there have been acid attacks on children, older women and sometimes also men. these attacks are often the result of family or land disputes, dowry demands or a desire for revenge. the major victims are women(47%), men(26%) and children(27%). when acid is thrown on a person the results are horrifying. it causes the skin tissue to melt, often exposing the bones below the flesh, sometimes even dissolving the bone. many acid attack survivors have lost one or both eyes.

myanmar people

simmering “discontent”
the dictionary describes 'simmering' as bringing slowly to a boil. when this is coupled with 'discontent' the authorities should beware. we have already had a couple of manifestations of 'simmering discontent' in recent days that caused immense damage to national property and prestige. i am giving 4 more flash-points simmering fast.

two important issues
as per media news, two important decisions are in the process of consideration of the ctg. these are:
aussies back to business
the rise of the australian cricketers in india after lying very low for some time both at 20/20 in south africa and elsewhere is indeed amazing.
tib report
in this letter i would like to make a comment on the above report by drawing information from the news published in your paper on sunday, october 2, 2007 under the heading “tib says its study not applicable to all ngos”. in particular, i will keep my comments within the limit of the methodology used to collect information.
un positions
on 6 october you wrote in support of bangladesh's efforts to secure senior level positions in the un by virtue of, among other things, bangladesh's contribution to the un department of peacekeeping operations throughout the world. without question, bangladesh's contribution of troops has proven useful to the un. like jordan, nigeria, pakistan and kenya, all major troops contributing countries, bangladeshi troops cost much less than troops from north america and the european union.
trade licence
i fully support dr. abdus sattar syed's opinion on this issue (letters to the editor page, june 19, the daily star) that the advance income tax of tk.1000 proposed on every fresh issuance or renewal of a trade licence should be withdrawn. i would like to go even further to propose that the requirement of trade licence be waived for very small starting enterprises (a suggested limit: fixed investment under tk.1.5 lakh). unfortunately, we inherited a legacy of a top-down authoritarian rule of the colonial past which has not changed a little even after adoption of democracy. field officials of the government have the authority to harass the general public if their corrupt demands are not met.
our workers in malaysia
just within a week of dr. fakhruddin ahmed's meeting with malaysian prime minister mr. abdullah bin ahmad badawi in new york where, as reported in our media, the malaysian pm assured our chief adviser of all possible help to assist bangladeshi workers in malaysia, comes the bad news of ban on our workers in that county.
tib report & ngos
it is an undeniable fact that some very remarkable accomplishments have been made by some ngos in healthcare and education and expanding opportunities to the disadvantaged children of bangladesh. yet, no doubt, the tib findings on corrupt practices of ngos are well founded.
ammonia pollution
mr. islam's report in your daily (oct:3) on abnormal quantities of ammonia gas exhausts from zia fertiliser co. ltd. , polluting the environment around zfcl factory, is deplorable news. what are the authorities doing about containing it? the surrounding cropland of about 200 acres is losing fertility due to excessive alkalinity. fishes in ponds within this area are also reported to be dying unnaturally! people in the locality are suffering from skin diseases and respiratory problems. however, strangely, nothing was mentioned about the employees of the factory and their families who live in the factory location!
misplaced priority
the politicians have again started to beat about the bush. though the main problem of bangladesh is now corruption, some politicians are saying undemocratic things. whatever is good for this world is permissible in islam, then why do you question islam's complete code of life? i think some people's hard line against islam ignites jihad among some fervent muslims, which is creating dire situations in many countries.
business community
in plato's republic, the place of the business people was earmarked outside the city. may be their loyalty and patriotism were suspect. modern day multinationals are, however, quite unabashed and unconcerned about it.
what's going on?
we were encouraged when the malaysian prime minister assured the chief adviser in ny that all problems pertaining to the bd workers in that country would be solved, but now we hear that malaysia has imposed a blanket ban on bd workers!! what is this? why around 300,000 would be workers had to be put in this situation? it seems that the present administration is more interested in pushing those hapless workers to different countries than engaging in wise and effective negotiations. we suggest the government immediately send officials to other manpower exporting countries, like the philippines, sri lanka, pakistan, india, egypt....to learn as to how to ensure proper safeguards for our workers. view the page international
