cracking down on cell phone crimes
it is certainly makes sense for the government to crack down on cell phone crimes through tightening the rules about the use of mobile phones in the country. why such a step has been so long in coming is rather surprising, given that efforts have been underway since 2006 to check the misuse of cell phones, especially in the matter of utilizing them for criminal activity. more worryingly, we fail to understand why the authorities have till now been unable to ensure a foolproof registration of mobile phone users despite the fact that it is not really hard to do the job. in the recent past, much concern has been expressed about the threats that individuals and organizations have been receiving from unscrupulous and nefarious elements. needless to say, these threats have generally centred around demands for money. these criminal elements have been rather active in trying to extort money through their faceless threats to people and organizations that are generally known to be well off economically.
where plenty is a curse!
whereas bumper cash crops should put a smile on the face of producers and give a wafting sense of comfort to consumers, they are actually leaving the former accursed and the latter bemoaning predictable loss of relief in prices. the case in point is the abundant availability of potatoes and tomatoes vis-Ã -vis our stark incapacity to store or conserve them. in no time, on being hauled from the field, can their freshness evaporate, they wilt and rot before the very eyes of the producers, unless of course these have been promptly stacked and tucked away into the safe temperature of cold stores. view the page sports

reminiscing manu as a cricketer
he was fondly known as manu singh to those of us who played alongside him at azad boys club. a gregarious and very cheerful personality, monawar hossain manu was a cricketer par excellence. i remember the matches in which azad boys were either playing abahani or mohammedan as it was manu who more often than not either got us crucial breakthroughs or was even instrumental in winning us so many crucial matches with his fastish off breaks. a bowling action that was so reminiscent of a cowboy ready to slap leather as he gave a little hop on one leg before crossing the umpire to hurl those innocuous looking deliveries that so often deceived the batsmen into submission. a quintessential figure was manu for whom azad boys club meant a lot and be in triumph or in defeat manu was one who always had a good laugh and was always the first one along with his beautiful wife gajju bhabi to be present at ashraful bhai's house for some good lively moments during the evenings of the match.

disorder behind glitzy facade
the policy of liberalisation in the telecom sector initiated by the previous awami league government more than a decade back permitting competitive carriers to operate parallel to the state-owned operator (bttb, currently btcl) has resulted in an impressive growth in teledensity, and the subscriber count now is close to 54 million. however, this growth has been totally confined to the mobile sector led by five foreign operators owning 51 million subscribers out of a total of 52 million. the remaining one million subscribers belong to the state-owned mobile operator, teletalk. the pstn (public switched telephone network) sector with a current subscriber base of 1.6 million is still dominated by btcl owning 1 million and the remaining 0.6 million by the private pstn operators. the private pstn operators owned and operated by the local entrepreneurs are plagued by a multiplicity of problems and have not been able to take off as yet. the same is true for the local internet service providers (isps). only with the recent involvement of the mobile operators, the data subscriber count has risen to about 4 million.

a fantastic cricketer
the reason for my e-mail is the frustration i am feeling within myself on the state of bangladesh cricket with the world cup round the corner. i am fortunate enough to have seen international cricket in this part of the sub-continent grow from day one when india visited pakistan in 1954-55 and the tour opener was played in chittagong. ever since that day, i have lived all these years with cricket in this country and have known most of the players at the national level.
more baby-taxies needed
the city dwellers in metropolitan dhaka, especially the middle-income group, find it very difficult to move from one place to another. private sedan is out of their reach for financial reason. taxicab service is not easily available and is also very costly. when a family likes to join in a marriage ceremony, it needs a low cost vehicle to go to a community centre. when a patient has to be shifted to a hospital, an affordable baby taxi is needed. if a family wants to go shopping to celebrate a festival, a baby-taxi is required. to appear in a public exam hall, a student needs transport service of a baby-taxi. it is the reality in dhaka metropolis that affordable transport is not easily available. the baby-taxis that are plying go to garage just in the evening. on the other hand, one cannot move to all desired destinations by available bus service in dhaka metropolis. it is very difficult for females to travel by bus owing to limited service, too many passengers and un-civilized behaviour of a section of male passengers. but it is unfortunate that in the past, the governments ignored the acute need of city dwellers. in the name of traffic jam, rickshaws are not allowed on many roads. then how will the general people move?

gaddafi's call
libyan leader gaddafi has called the muslims to boycott switzerland in connection with the recent swiss vote against the building of minarets that are integral parts of the mosques used by muslims for praying. this is a direct interference in the right of a community to observe its religious rituals by a country that probably believes in secularism. france has also forbidden veil or hijab, a mandatory dress for muslim women. what other non-muslim countries /nations are doing against islamic faith is well known and being manifested in the form of âclash of civilisationsâ. but there is no muslim country in the world that has put any such prohibition on the religious rituals of any other community living in that country or anywhere else.

confrontation ahead?
we are so scared of what is in store for us in the very near future as the bnp from the very day it was trounced in the election of 2008, apart from making sweeping accusations and allegations against the al-led mohajote government, called for mid-term election as according to it, the al led govt. was persecuting its activists, was failing to deliver and was not releasing the scions of begum zia. in a dispassionate observation, they are too harsh and born out of political vendetta, though the al has in some sectors glaring failures to draw flake. but bnp leaders have been saying all these in their party office and at other forums without caring a damn for their moral obligation and commitment to the nation. the people, however, well understand their anguish of being out of power but they would not put their hubris aside to soul-search about their misdeeds or follies and frailties.
gas supply
nababganj and dohar upazilas in dhaka sadar dakkhin (south dhaka) are only thirty and forty kilometres away from dhaka, but the people there are left to cry for gas. keraniganj upazila gets the supply through pipeline from dhaka city. even some districts of north bengal have been brought under gas supply and the jamuna bridge has made it possible. it is not understood why such places near dhaka do not get supply of gas. will the authorities concerned look into the matter?
trafficking
women who have been trafficked are often vulnerable to being so again. creating awareness, changing mindsets and removing stigmas towards survivors, is also crucial in preventing the vicious cycle from continuing. while it is sometimes argued that trafficked persons have a better life than their lives of poverty back home, the fact that they are cheated into this life not knowing what they are in for and then subjected to torture and slavery is what makes trafficking an inhuman crime that must be stopped.
campus
when we first came to this campus as first year students, the tradition in our campus was to respect our seniors. we didn't want to know who was a political or non-political figure. as a result, our respect was for all seniors and we lived like the members of a family. but at present it is a common phenomenon that a student who comes to this campus looks for the shelter of a political big brother. the political elements also persuade them to get involved with politics for their own stability with the assurance of giving some benefits including accommodation facility in the dorm. eventually, that innocent student gets involved in politics and respect only the political mentors, not other seniors.
