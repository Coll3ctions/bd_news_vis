to the goddess of poetry
they wrecked my face with their fists yet i'm yours,

in this dark alley i have come to stand and wait for you
today's a load-shedding day; like that grey rainy srabon-day
when from the dark suddenly three of them, dark, or maybe four
slammed me beside the wall with its 'vote for ladder' slogan
that was the first time, so they let me off easy thank god
in the rain, darkness, they were beating me up, why
i didn't know until one snarled through gritted teeth:
“bothering our binny, eh, you bastard, if ever
in this neighbourhood we see you again…”

be a smart patient!
it is common in our daily practices to have 'hand-on-the-door-knob' patients who suddenly remember their main concern just as they are about to leave after the consultation. some patients, minutes after leaving the chamber, return and tell — 'sorry to bother doc, i just forgot to tell …’

qaumi madrassas and the reality
the world bank country director recently forwarded to the government a report that is interesting in the context of islamic militancy in bangladesh in reality. in the last few months, the media has published series of reports and news items, many based on statements of ministers that would suggest that bangladesh is in imminent threat from islamic militancy. at the time the intelligence agencies discovered a huge arsenal of arms and ammunitions in a remote village in barisal and linked it to a bangladesh born british national. some concluded that the qaumi madrassas (qm) were hotbeds of islamic militancy. the wb report contradicts most of these allegations.
pakistan on the brink: lessons for bangladesh
news from pakistan over the last few months kept getting worse. the threat posed by the taliban and their al-qaeda sponsor have been growing everyday. vast swath of northern territory in the federally administered tribal agency (fata) as well as parts of the north west frontier province (nwfp) is virtually outside the control of the government. militant leaders, each with his well-armed militias, have declared their own emirates. the taliban incursion into once-peaceful valley of swat has been particularly brutal; they destroyed hundreds of schools, especially girls' schools. banks and treasuries have been looted and people terrorized by arbitrary killing, whipping and other cruel punishment. all men have been forced to grow beard and women driven inside the burqa. pakistan government's policy of appeasement has only emboldened the militants. since the joint declaration by president obama, zardari and hamid karzai on 5 may '09, a renewed offensive started in swat. but how long the steam will last is a big question. the situation is particularly perilous in view of the nuclear weapons in pakistan's possession. the west is worried about the disposal of the nuclear weapons if the militants come to power in islamabad or a right wing coup takes place.

tales of the famous and the brave
looking through the prism of life these days, one wonders how far one has strayed from one's roots, become oblivious of the glory that was there in the past that constitutes one's existence. with this feeling and realization that emanates from it when one looks back, one sees trails of stories both elating and saddening that are stashed in every nook and cranny of predominantly rural bangladesh. one such village lying by the river gorai in kushtia is koya --- an appealing name in itself that moulds an image of a tiny chirping bird in the vision of this reviewer. it takes someone with an immense sense of responsibility and a heart full of passion to weave the things that, although discrete in terms of chronology, are yet arranged into a colourful tapestry. rakibul hassan has fulfilled just this task in a masterly way.
a book, a flavour of culture . . .
kabir chowdhury is perhaps one of the last of our men of letters who have known history as well as have a hand in the making of it. he defies age (he is in his mid eighties) and he continues to make his presence felt when it comes to raising and popularizing issues of public interest. he has taught literature, has had a stint in government; and his has over the years been one of the loudest voices in defence of the demand for a trial of the war criminals in bangladesh's war of liberation in 1971.
life's story told with feeling
the pursuit of happiness reminds the reader of an acknowledged truth that as human beings we are always pursuing happiness in life. betsy, the sixteen year old young woman, is doing just that, pursuing happiness after the death of her mother. betsy irving, her teenager brother and her father are left in a house that seems to echo with the memories of her mother with each and every breath. the troubles and grief the family goes through is touching enough to hold the reader glued as if he or she is a part of the irving family. most of all the doubts, the confusions of the motherless young girl do not fail to touch parental hearts. it is a touching story of love and loss taking part in morrisville, new jersey.
