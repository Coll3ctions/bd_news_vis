a celebration of life
there has regularly been talk of latent talent lying generally undiscovered all over bangladesh. such talent has not so often been spotted and brought into the limelight. against this backdrop, on friday, celebrating life, a cultural event organised by the daily star in association with standard chartered bank brought to the fore an array of talented young people in such fields as lyrics, photography and documentary films. what celebrating life asserts is the principle that searching for talent throughout the length and breadth of the country cannot but be a continuous, deeply satisfying affair. in this connection, the quality of the lyrics, photography and films that was on display on friday was a very strong indication of how much more can be spotted and harnessed in bangladesh through such culture-specific steps. indeed, with such aspects of culture not adequately focused on in recent times, it is important that more be done to reinforce the traditions that have historically solidified our society.

poor diplomacy!
it is a sad truth that our diplomats are not diplomatic enough when it comes to performing their duties. once again our image has been blurred abroad due to poor diplomacy. the recent "kuwait issue" is the living example of our poor diplomacy. in foreign countries, particularly in the middle east, bangladeshi workers have faced a lot of problems.
rmg sector
the readymade garments industry in bangladesh is in jeopardy. it started a few years back--'the unrest', stoppage of work, creating havoc, and damaging valuable assets in and around the factories and even in the streets.
students in trouble
shah jalal university of science and technology, sylhet, is one of the well-known public universities of bangladesh. but now it is facing many problems. students of sust are facing the problem of transportation, because the number of buses for the students is inadequate. there are nearly 6,000 students. among them 4,000 are dependent on the university bus. but the number of buses is only 12. as a result, every day students have to struggle for seats. the sufferings of the female students know no bounds. recently, the three advisers of the caretaker government inaugurated eight 'new' brtc buses and an academic building. but the eight buses are new only on paper. these buses also have far fewer seats.
future of democracy
i appreciate the decision of the government and also of the judges on releasing political prisoners on medical grounds. unfortunately, politicians are demanding the release of all prisoners even if they are convicted of corruption and murder. i am certain soon after the takeover of power the political government will release all the criminals or will influence the court to release them. i want the political government to take over power as soon as possible and at the same time i am afraid that godfathers will reappear again with their ugly faces and the helpless people will become more helpless. the irony is that i find many so called intellectuals supporting those criminals' release.
school textbooks
almost every year our school children face a severe problem with their textbooks. the textbook board fails to send the books to all the students in the country before end february. hence many students waste their valuable time for non-availability of new books in their new classes. but the board should make the necessary arrangement so that the students get the books after their annual exams.

leaders and their enemies
march 26, 1971. from radio a voice of hope, an announcement of a lifetime, a direction for a nation, a piece of news for the world was heard. a war hero, a sector commander of mujib nagar sarkar, a valiant freedom fighter, who later during the crisis period of the nation again came to the scene and took over power in his hands to rule the country, was speaking. later he floated a political party to start the democratic process in this country. but he was brutally killed in a failed coup in 1981. this was the brief history of major zia, ex president ziaur rahman, commander of z force during the liberation war. during the liberation war he offered his life, during the crisis of 1975 he also came forward and finally he was killed while on duty for the country. the name of president zia will ever be remembered with respect.
tale of our workers abroad
yes, the sordid condition strikes us, stirs our senses as well. the expatriate labourers broke down in tears. returning home they buried all hopes, aspirations and dreams not only theirs but also that of the near and dear ones. many sold land, livestock, some even living place for bearing the expenditures. now what they will do is a big question. as time goes on, people fall in different types of difficulties. the old wound will dry up; people will have new dreams. they can recover! i saw in my childhood asane bhai, local name, our neighbour, collecting money to go to saudi arabia. and he went away. staying there for a few years, he returned home carrying goods and a bagful of dreams! he could restore a bit of lost property. then he flew for saudi arabia again. after that no one knows what happened to him. there's rumour that he went there illegally and the saudi authorities caught and imprisoned him. after getting released he returned home. but they confiscated his money which he deposited there. he returned in a wretched condition. but where he took shelter no one knew. one night he emerged from somewhere else. people thronged to see him, which happens in villages. he left the village alone and forever! alas! asane bhai, the dream he dreamt broke down into debris. but some lessons remain for us.
strengthen family bonds
children often disregard poor parents and are less interested to visit them even once in a year. even though “blood is thicker than water,” we bangladeshis evade the responsibility of taking care of poor family members. i believe that harmonious family relationship is the basis of a healthy society. we have to pass down our traditional virtue of respecting our parents, regardless of their income and position in society. things have changed a lot.
27th bcs results
the public service commission (psc) showed the highest sense of responsibility by issuing a press release on 19 may 2008, clarifying the status of 27th bcs results. this is a rare case of showing respect to the public sentiment by a statutory body like the psc. the people have the right to know the status of the results. the psc, before anybody's pointing of finger, disclosed the truth before the public. the psc, in other words, performed the job of ensuring people's right to information. every government department should follow the example of the psc.

where is asif?
no doubt asif could be a legend for bangladesh. he might have won a gold for bangladesh. but that has not happened. let us look back. it was on 2nd october 2006 that we, the people of bangladesh, were speechless. what happened on that day? our boy asif was beaten by the police and sent to court.

south ossetia
a conflict over a tiny piece of land has sparked a catastrophe in the caucasus. the epicentre is south ossetia.
we need supporters, not slaves
it will appear to any casual observer that in bangladeshi politics the leaders do not have supporters or followers. they have slaves. these slaves blindly support their respective leaders, even if such leaders are grossly wrong, corrupt and unpatriotic. these slaves are mostly created by sycophants, and dalals (paid agents) employed by a leader in exchange of undue favour. the media, which in most cases in our country are owned by corrupt businessmen, also play a big role in making a corrupt person a big leader. what is most shocking is that many highly educated members of our civil society and intelligentsia shamelessly enrol(ed) themselves as the slaves of one leader or the other to become vice chancellors, pro vice chancellors, ambassadors, dgs etc.
sau campus
it was a debatable issue since the bangladesh agricultural university was established. as formerly bai was the first agricultural institute, it had the option to become a full university. due to the nepotism of a political leader at that time it had to sacrifice that option. but the students, teachers, well wishers did not deviate from their mission of setting up a university.

rafi hossain, in charge of star insight, mastermind behind the contest:
“in ancient times, kings and emperors were patrons of arts and cultural practices. unfortunately, there are no such patrons now. but cultural activities do need sponsorship and the few patrons in our country mostly concentrate on the popular aspects of art. so i thought why not arrange a platform for talented young individuals scattered all over the country in different sectors apart from the performing arts. when i approached our editor, mahfuz anam, he gave his consent at once. the event needed financial backing and standard chartered bank, one of the corporate giants, came forward to sponsor it. we have searched for the talents through an extended period of time and i'm proud to say we have come across some impressive and creative individuals."
excerpts from speeches:
mahfuz anam, editor and publisher, the daily star: “it is easy to feel frustrated and we find ourselves burdened with challenges. we often overlook our achievements. through this competition we wanted to celebrate everything that encourages us.
