subduing west indies

tale of a flood victim
bablu miah has again been affected by floods. he is a retrenched jute mill worker. he has lost his job. his tin-shed house, furniture, home appliances, cattle, toilet, livestock-- all have been washed away by the floods. his 12-year old son has been drowned in the heavy current of the floodwater. his wife has been suffering from fatal skin diseases. he has no work now. unemployment has made him mad. he is under extreme marginal conditions. now he is passing his days un-fed , half-fed and under-fed. his physical condition is worsening .
reopen the public universities
our university is closed indefinitely. everything was running very well and smoothly without any problem. even we had started thinking of our current semester to be finished within next december. but suddenly an unexpected incident took place and changed the whole situation. it was nothing but a silly, trifling incident that occurred on the dhaka university campus on 20 august last, and the agitation took little time to spread out among the general students all over the country. later, the general students came out and resorted to violence.
9/11
we shall never forget 9/11, for the tragic incident not only changed the world political matrix but also affected the lives of millions even in a country like bangladesh.
begum zia and sheikh hasina
we were flabbergasted at the statement made by begum zia to release sk hasina and dismiss false charges against her. an amusing episode is being played in the political arena of bangladesh. only a few months ago the two leaders could not tolerate each other. their obstinate attitude made the country a veritable hell. instead of solving national problems for the well being of the people, they had brought the country to the brink of disaster.
uk visa
it is a great pleasure that âworking holiday visa facility in ukâ has been re-introduced for bangladeshis.
exorbitant fees
the govt. of bangladesh has increased the registration fees of the companies and others fees like searching fees, return submission fees, name clearance fees etc abnormally, which is likely to hinder corporate development in the country.
wanton violence
excess of anything is always bad. when we do something we need to consider whether we are crossing the limits. when we cross the limits, certainly there will be bad consequences. i support the students' protest on du campus, but not the incidents that happened afterwards.
power shortage
an english daily correspondent's optimistic front page news (sept:8) appears to be appeasing the authorities; rather than being pragmatic facts!
stranded pakistanis
i must strongly defer with the idea of granting citizenship to the stranded pakistanis and making them voters. this looks like another process of adding burden to already overpopulated bangladesh. and, if pakistan cannot take them, why must bangladesh on the so-called humanitarian ground? most of the senior and young sections of these people are not loyal to bangladesh and they actively participated with the pakistan army in the atrocities committed against us in 1971. they never asked for any forgiveness. if they are made voters, it is not difficult to realise that this will help the anti-liberation forces and the fanatic parties. as they are pakistani citizens, pakistan should take them back. we were generous enough to let them live here, that's enough!
price hike
it is unfortunate that the government could not stop the price hike of essentials. prices are going up and up. the government took a lot of steps to control this unending price hike but all the attempts have failed.
unscrupulous traders...
despite government's sincere efforts, the unscrupulous traders are still resorting to malpractice.
elevated expressway
a news item published in a bengali daily on 10 september 2007 stated that the government is going to build an elevated expressway in the capital to ease the traffic jam which will cost $1,100 million. one thing i do not understand why a country like bangladesh goes for such an extravagant project which will cost a huge amount of money.
biman issue
the adviser in charge of bangladesh biman was expected to clean the aegean stable in balaka bhaban (housing the hq of the national flag carrier). but we are utterly disappointed. the situation is progressively going from bad to worse day by day. if this is by design, then we have nothing to say.
the justice system
i would like to congratulate mr. a k m shamsuddin for writing a wonderful article in your newspaper on 12 sep 2007 under the title 'the judiciary reform from within' about what is really happening with our judicial system, 60 years after the british left us. the courts of bangladesh have become a haven for evil men who take advantage of the weaknesses in the legal system.
proactive anti corruption policy
at present the crack-down against corruption is just reactive, i.e. people have indulged in corruption and that is why they are being put behind the bars. but my understanding is that pacp is essential to reduce corruption.
save my sister's life
my sister got 43% burn injuries and is being treated at city hospital, dhaka for the last two months and a half. her healing process has stopped. now the doctors say that she needs to have skin grafting from a living donor--some skin (only surface of the skin which will be cured within 5/6 days, as doctors said) is required from a living donor for her grafting. any person irrespective of sex, age, blood group can come forward to donate skin which may save my sister's life.
donât punish them
i read the letter of mr. m. emad, oxford, uk, entitled "stranded pakistanis" published on 13 september 2007 in your newspaper. according to him the decision-makers, who have decided to recognise these people as citizens of bangladesh have no understanding of history. i think the writer has not read the constitution of bangladesh which was not framed by the present caretaker government but by those freedom fighters who fought and created a new nation to establish justice, rights of the people and democracy. these people were given citizenship because they were born in this country and according to the constitution of bangladesh they are very much bangladeshis, like those who were born in this country before the emergence of bangladesh. the new generation of the urdu speaking community has not seen the war of liberation, as they were not born at that time or were too young.
mobile âre-registration"
in this land of confusion, we now see the mobile service providers putting up ads requiring "re-registration" of connections in such a manner that it would seem the people who became subscribers before 28-feb-06 are the only ones left out with possible faulty documentation/ identification!
charges against hasina
is it not prudent for sheikh hasina and her supporters to demand that she be tried in an open court of law (televised, if possible) to clear her name from all the corruption charges brought against her? the alleged lingering scandals, such as the mig-purchase-affairs, have been haunting her for a long time. instead of trying to clear her name through a court verdict, she has been trying hard to squash the corruption cases against her from being tried in the court. if she is innocent, what is she afraid of?
scarcity of medicine
the scarcity of medicine in the country, as observed in the last few days, appears to be very artificial and the result of the manipulation of pharmaceutical companies. bangladesh has earned its reputation for production of quality medicines and the pharmaceutical companies have demonstrated their excellence at home and abroad. view the page international
