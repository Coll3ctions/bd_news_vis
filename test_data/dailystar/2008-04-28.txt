reaching out to communities through dance
international dance day is once more on the horizon. time for dancers and organisers to assess past successes, failures, milestones and envision the future. for some reason this art form has lagged behind in mass popularity when compared to other mediums like films, tv plays and music. while many young dancers have an eye on the more glamorous outlets, dance is picking up slowly but surely and there are many who are ardent devotees to the art form. a heartening trend is the mushrooming dance schools. beginning in the 1950s with bulbul academy of fine arts (bafa), many dance schools have come up and earned recognition. prominent in their ranks are jago art centre, chhayanat, nritya nandan, nrityanchal and pallavi. and this development is not confined to dhaka. some established dancers have taken their art to various districts and organised workshops, lecture demonstrations, cultural exchanges and festivals. for this art form to truly thrive, dance needs patronage from the corporate sector and the exposure from the media. likewise the ministry of cultural affairs needs to pull its weight on this front. to gauge the status of dance in bangladesh today, the daily star spoke to a few leading dancers. here's what they had to say:
