handling the population issue
investing in women as a way of advancing the cause of national development looks like an eminently sensible idea. and that is what the observance of world population day this year has been all about. there can hardly be any arguing with the fact that a rising population threatens to put at risk all strategies related to economic progress in the country; and this despite a declining population growth of 1.39 per cent at the present time. and in spite of the rate of reproductivity now being 2.7 per cent as compared to 6.3 per cent in 1971, there are some rather obvious reasons why the population issue needs to be handled in a more streamlined manner. foremost among them is the question of how men more than women are dealing with the population control programme at the various tiers of society. for instance, it has been suggested that of the 55.8 per cent of those who employ family planning methods, a meagre 5.2 per cent happen to be men. in other words, the apathy of men toward family planning as opposed to the greater sense of awareness of the issue on the part of women is a stark reality.

suddenly, my residential telephone got disconnected for reasons not known to me. initially, i thought it to be line trouble. i requested the local complaint centre to restore my telephone line. in the mean time two more days were gone. neither my telephone was restored nor i got any feedback. again i contacted the complaint centre. they informed me that my telephone had been disconnected and told me to contact the office for restoration. i sent a man to the telephone revenue office in g.p.o. building to know about the matter but he could not make any way out. the next day i personally went to the revenue office. after looking here and there i got the revenue section room. about 20/25 people sitting face to face in a congested room were working in the revenue section. the situation in the room seemed to me very much chaotic like a kitchen market devoid of any congenial atmosphere for doing office work. finally, i could reach the upper division assistant of rampura area and came to know that my telephone had been disconnected for default of payment. i produced the paid bill copies up to april'09 to prove that the payment was up to date. the person told me that the charge due for the month of june'09 remained unpaid. i told him that this was middle of june and normally bill for the month is available during the 3rd week or so of the month. as such, i have not yet received the bill, so how could i make payment? he told me to take a fresh bill from the office to make payment and to inform the office. he prepared for me a bill with a validity up to 30th june'09. however, he agreed to connect my line by the evening. really i got my telephone restored in the evening. i did not make payment against the prepared bill, rather i waited for the normal bill to come. yes, it came around june 24th'09 with validity up to june 30th. and i paid within the time. even after all these things i could not understand as to why my telephone was disconnected putting me in trouble and thus deceiving bttb from revenue earning.
joyriding
the front page news feature on the obnoxious style of car rides commonly practised by youngsters these days (of course encouraged by their loving parents) is not only a social nuisance but also a threat to the safety of all on the road, passengers of other vehicles and especially pedestrians and rickshaws as well. in addition to the reckless driving at high speed and making unbearable noise from their cars, the extremely loud music also affects the hearing of small children. with such vehicles on the road, all are at risk, from a health point of view as well as safety. this is a serious issue and should not be overlooked. it is not harmless fun.
religious bigots and fatwa
the recent “fatwa” induced inhuman punishment meted out to a woman for alleged social misconduct on the basis of a mullah's judgment, as reported in your pages on 29 june, is a crude and sadistic act of illegal violence. he should be taken for psychiatric treatment, though he may be otherwise sound in body and mind. such behaviour cannot be tolerated in a civilized society. in contrast the mullah is a prime example of applying uncivilized “ law of the jungle” in bangladesh!
us and latin america
the ousted honduran president manuel zelaya vowed to return to honduras in an attempt to reclaim power. zelaya was forced out of office and exiled to costa rica in a military coup d'etat.
iranian protestors
vast majority of iran's women and youth, who are more than 70% of the population, had voted for reformist candidate mir-hossain mousavi and yet ahmadinejad claimed that he had won the june 12 election. when the news spread that ahmadinejad had won more than 60 percent of the vote cast, most iranians reacted with shock. by june 14, the shock and disbelief had given away to moral outrage and the people of iran took to the streets to protest such a well-orchestrated voting fraud by the regime. their demands were simple: a re-election or at least a total recount.
failed parliamentarians
it is very sad that most of the parliamentarians of the country are not serious about their duties which has been revealed by the tib. the report says that almost tk 5.5 crore got wasted due to quorum crisis in the first session. what i want to say is that it is the main duty of the parliamentarians to modify and formulate laws, being present in parliament, and they know it very well before being elected, but soon after they get elected they forget their main duties and become busy with their personal business, leaving their main task incomplete. this way the main target of democracy remains unfulfilled. a few days back one of the veteran ruling party lawmakers exhorted the opposition lawmakers to resign their position as they are not joining the parliament sessions. one reasonable question arises here: the awami league led government won more than two thirds of the total number of seats and if one third of their mps join parliament sessions on time, there will be no quorum crisis. do they perform their duties properly?
patriotism
the government is going to change some books of primary and secondary schools at a time. the intellectuals of bangladesh said that sheikh mujibur rahman is not underscored in those books, rather importance has been given to ziaur rahman. it is really a gigantic task.
stop wasting resources
millions of cases are gathering dusts in different courts and police stations in our country, but no one has time for those. our poor people have to wait 10/15 years before they get their cases heard by a judge (some people have even passed away while waiting!). our poor people pay the fees of lawyers and police! it is for this reason i find it surprising that within a few months of the al government taking office, no less than the highest court in our country found the time to tell us that bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, not ziaur rahman, had proclaimed the country's independence in 1971.
local government
in our country, local government structure is not developed enough to contribute to national development. like any other least developed country, bangladesh has been facing many problems in the way of its development. local government may be a strong institution in development. in bangladesh, the local government consists of three tiers : union parishad, upzila parishad and zilla parishad. among these three tiers, the union parishad can play a significant role in development. the union parishad will have some responsibilities like it will maintain birth and death records, it must have information about total land of the respective union and the total arable land. besides, it will record total crop number and the quantity of crops that are produced in that particular union all the year round. about population, it will have information about the total number of people including their age, profession etc.
unpunished war criminals
mian tufail mohammad, the former chief of jamaat-e-islami pakistan (jip), died in lahore on june 25. from 1966 to 1972 tufail was the west pakistan chief, while golam azam in east pakistan and abul aala maududi (died in 1979) was the all pakistan chief of jip. in the name of islam, these top jip leaders were directly involved and played a key role in the heinous war crimes of the pakistan army in 1971.
