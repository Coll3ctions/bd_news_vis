overcrowded jails
we are quite appalled at the news that the country's prisons are bursting at the seams with 87,000 inmates trying to fit in a space meant for only 27,451. this is a horrendous figure and it speaks loudly of the existing conditions as far as jail administration, maintenance of discipline and order, upkeep of physical environment and constant supply of utilities are concerned. a front page news item in this daily on saturday says that the number of prisoners nearly doubled in a decade while the authorities failed to grapple with the problem by increasing the physical space to accommodate the growing number of inmates.
manpower import moves in the middle east
there have been quite a few encouraging moves for bangladesh's manpower export sector in the last couple of weeks. the saudi ambassador has been speaking of making matters easier for bangladeshi migrant workers in his country; and bahrain, where bangladeshi workers came under a cloud because of a recent crime incident, with a consequent ban imposed on fresh manpower recruitment from bangladesh, is taking new steps to ensure that our workers can continue to go and work there. we are happy that the bangladesh authorities, so rudely awakened to the sad realities around them regarding the manpower sector, have been taking the necessary measures to keep the things going.
escaping poverty traps
poverty estimates, whether levels or trends, have a tendency to be deceptive. when a country witnesses a reduction in overall poverty levels between two periods, it is considered a win; but when pitted against a figure of 25% of the population continuously below the poverty line, the same statistic loses its meaning.

not since michael clarke's first match has a test debut been so anticipated or successful. like clarke against india in bangalore in 2004, ajantha mendis has burst onto the five-day scene in style, becoming the first sri lankan to take eight wickets on test debut. muttiah muralidaran, who took 11 wickets at the ssc, pointed out two things after sri lanka handed india their third largest defeat; one, that mendis is far more talented than he was when he debuted and two, that mendis will take the pressure off him and perhaps extend murali's test career.

once upon a time…
i am sure you are familiar with how stories begin. didn't we enjoy stories when we had the leisure to hear or read them at times gone by? our evolution tells us that we learnt to talk first rather than to write. the use of a pen is more of a recent invention compared to oral communication. as such, story telling is the most ancient form of entertainment, telling and remembering history, and was the means of passing the tribe's historical baton from one generation to the next. stories help us to connect with our history.

river erosion victims
as the monsoon sets in, the problem of river erosion takes a turn for the worse. the mighty rivers-- the padma, the jamuna and the meghna --devour huge chunks of land as they meander through the alluvial plain. on an average, every year 2400 km of riverbanks experience major erosion. needless to say, millions of people of are affected by erosion. many people lose their homesteads, farmland and other valuable property because of erosion.
burning issues
at present the world's leading industrialised countries are reeling under three serious economic problems namely food, fuel and usa's financial turmoil. the chain-effects of these happenings have encompassed the entire world. unprecedented inflationary pressure on all consumer commodities has made common peoples' lives miserable. the very edifice of global economy nay human civilisation so painstakingly built through ages has come near collapse. this world wide catastrophe is chiefly for the following reasons:
save cultivable land
it is high time to strongly enforce a law to protect our cultivable land. our existing cultivable land should not be used for housing business; this has become a resourceful commodity in the quick money making business. only the government can arrange land for housing and industrial purposes as deemed justified by top level decision makers. again we need to give importance to acquiring of land for making industries like power generation plants, fertiliser factories etc. at the same time, opportunities need to be created and business people must be encouraged to construct high rise buildings to combat the rising demand for housing. the cost of an apartment will be proportionately less in a high-rise building. such practices are well established in many developed countries.
primary education in poor shape
i have done a survey on both govt. and private primary schools on the basis of total quality and performance of the schools. my survey has the synopsis on the findings derived from schools. private primary schools are going ahead, whereas govt. primary schools are lagging behind silently. while talking to the govt. schools' senior teachers, i came to learn that the huge number of students was a problem that they could not manage. most of the govt. schools have an unmanageable ratio of teacher-student. for instance- in kurmitola govt. primary school located at khilkhet, the teacher-student ratio is 1:86. so, here this ratio depicts the real picture. as a result, students' overall quality as well as performance goes down. apart from these reasons, there are other problems like late allocation of textbooks, mistakes in textbooks, poor educational background of teachers, reluctance of teachers to motivate students, and last of all guardians' indifferent supervision over their children etc. on the other hand, private primary schools' senior teachers mentioned that their students were doing very well.
iran's stand
re article: "the iranian missile test," by prof. abdullah a. dewan, professor of economics at michigan eastern university (july 17).
bsf atrocities
in light of recent bsf intrusion into bangladesh and killing of bdr personnel, i have to draw a parallel to what china is accused of doing in tibet. it seems like the bigger powers in our region have no shame and no regard for international laws. i would suggest that the ctg take this case along with numerous other such cases to international court of justice and pursue this case until it brings some justice. we should not take the injustice sitting down in our chairs doing nothing.
morning walkers in trouble
thousands of people visit dhanmondi lake every morning. among them some take exercise in groups or individually, some play different games but most of them walk along the lakeside path. but it is a matter of regret that when the people do their walking, the sweepers start cleaning the place. many people tried in the past to draw the attention of the authorities concerned to the matter but nothing has been done so far.
corruption in medical sector
unbridled corruption, shameless nepotism and rampant politicisation of administration totally destroyed the medical system in the country during the previous “golden era” of the infamous jote regime. professionals with blessings from the dab and/or bma were unduly awarded 'abnormal' promotions. medical officers became 'professors' and 'directors' overnight flouting all norms and regulations. surprisingly, most of them have managed to 'manage' so far. it is a known fact that bma leaders minted crores through appointments and transfers. doctors of the ruling party manipulated admission in the medical colleges, post graduate institutes, subsequent graduation and post graduation, appointments and transfers, study tours, hajj and employment in the govt. /private institutes.
report on dialogue
if i remember correctly, the team of election commissioners met the president and handed over a well bounded red cover report to him. they said this was the report based on the ec's discussions with the political parties. we have not seen the contents of this report in the media. my question is: whether all political parties have been supplied with a draft copy report for their verification, as to what they have discussed, and what has been printed in the report. if not, why? they are supposed to get a draft and respond with their comments.
failing states?
the us congressional committee has published a list of failing states. bangladesh has been put in the tail of a dirty dozen. in the inglorious list of 12, eight countries are from africa and the rest four from asia. seven of such countries have a muslim majority and three are from saarc region.
mockery of humanity?
i am replying to a letter that was published in the daily star on july 21, entitled "mockery of humanity!", written by rafiqul islam of chittagong. in the letter, mr. islam talks about cnn's coverage of the recovery of an iraqi boy, named youssif, from burns he acquired in january of 2007 when masked men doused him in gasoline. mr. islam contends that cnn's coverage of a single act of kindness by the "american authorities" is an "imperialistic hoax". he goes on to say that cnn's recurrent coverage of isolated acts of humanity raise questions as to whether american "media are the mere tools of the ever burgeoning imperialism".
overcoming disability
disability is not a burden in the modern age of technology and science, because if physically challenged people get ict training, they will move ahead. the purpose of ict is accessibility to information technologies for persons with disabilities and to face the challenge of the modern world as participants to all activities.
erratic power supply
a couple of days ago, i was having online conversation with one of my friends in sweden and he told me, “does it really take 37 years to solve the problem of power crisis?” all i could tell him is that due to inefficient governance we always lag behind. we never had someone who could aggressively work for the betterment of the country. today, even after 37 years of independence, when we look at our nation all we can see is that all kinds of infrastructures are falling apart.
stop population boom
it is time for bangladesh to take a strong decision to stop the population growth. the government and citizens should come forward and take this decision to stop population growth for at least the next five years. a law should be enacted to ensure no more new births in the next five years. what is our present population? 140/150 million? our space is very limited. the land is not growing, resources are not growing but hungry mouths are growing geometrically, not adding anything to our gdp.
