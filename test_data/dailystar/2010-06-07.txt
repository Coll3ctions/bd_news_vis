the pressure dhaka city is under
dhaka is increasingly turning into a rather uninhabitable city. that is the bottom line in a report carried by a leading daily in the country. we have no reason to disagree with such a finding, especially against the background of the recent incidents of building collapse and fires in different parts of the capital. there is little question that dhaka has always been an unplanned city. but what is mind-boggling is the rapidity with which it has in the past three decades or so mutated into a symbol of chaos and confusion. the mere fact that a few minutes of rainfall leave entire areas of the city water-logged speaks of the myriad problems which now the city is confronted with. the bigger reality is that the relevant urban development authorities have little clue as to where all this will push the city in the short term as well as the long-term future.
why this foot-dragging on mpo?

manpower agents or cheats?
recently, the honourable prime minister warned the predatory manpower exporters of serious action. the ineffectuality and hollowness of such warning has been delineated in the editorial of the daily star (may 22, 2010), which needs no further elaboration.
education and hygiene
it is a matter of great concern and regret that as a nation our consciousness regarding hygiene is very poor. you'll find people doing all sorts of things that are considered unacceptable according to the norms of social and personal hygiene. it comes as no surprise that we often get to see outbreaks of diarrhoea, typhoid and other diseases that can easily be prevented if we become a bit more knowledgeable on how these diseases are caused and how these spread.
road accidents
deaths on the roads across the country have assumed a monstrous proportion. you come across the death news in road accidents almost every day; either an erratic bus collides and crushes another vehicle or some passers by are run over by some over jaunty vehicles driven by inefficient and crazy drivers without a valid driving licence --- a common but tragic phenomenon unchecked at work at the cost of human lives.
power of forgiveness
many years ago i read a true story which touched me very much and often it comes to my mind. it was written by a man called john kord lagemann. he spoke of a man who was sitting in a railroad coach next to a young man who was obviously depressed. finally the man revealed he was a convict returning from a distant prison. his imprisonment had bought shame on his family, and they had neither visited him nor written often. he hoped, however, that this was only because they were too poor to travel, too uneducated to write. he hoped, despite the evidence, that they had forgiven him.
good results, butâ¦
good results of ssc are soaring higher than expectation every year. board examinations are just like a veiled fiction and when we unravel it we face the tragedy. every year the number of gpa-5 students goes on increasing. besides, this year nctb has introduced the structural question based examination for the first time. but before undertaking this daunting task, they didn't consider for a while the students' problems. in fact, there had been hardly any teaching courses for the teachers. moreover, the little amount of information that the teachers grab from different sources is not even enough to set questions for school exams, let alone the board exams.
online addiction!
i think twitter, myspace and facebook are social networks helping people to communicate with others. just think about the cousin or friend who's now abroad. without the social networks, would it be possible to connect with them every day? you can see their activities online now on your homepage. okay, let's not go far. it is connecting us with the relatives who're in the city or outside dhaka. we can meet friends every day at schools and workplaces, but not our relatives.
poverty
the most important causes of poverty all over the world are poor education, teen parenthood, lack of opportunities, and being a child or elderly. lack of food, natural resources, and efficient government are some of the causes. taxes also cause poverty. in our country households with lower levels of education face difficulty in escaping poverty. it seems a chronic problem for us.
labour unrest
labour unrest has become the most talked about issue across the country. garments industry is now the 2nd largest sector that is contributing to our economy a lot. statistics show about 95 percent workers engaged in this sector are women. but the recent unrest led this industry to destruction. extortion, killing, looting, strike have become quite common in the present context of the country. to resolve it, i want to draw the attention of the authorities concerned on the following points:
moudud's campaign
it has been reported in the print media that barrister moudud ahmed has vowed to bring general moin u ahmed and other ctg leaders to justice for what he called their illegal take-over of state power which according to barrister maudud, pushed the nation to an economic disaster. he strongly vowed that he is organising a countrywide campaign in this respect.
facebook
the blocking of facebook for what they called the satiric portrayal of some of our politicians including the pm and the leader of the opposition was least acceptable and hence only exposed the intolerance of the ruling people. when the government does not spare a single opportunity of talking about free access to information and ' a digital bangladesh", the hasty move to silence critics on the cyberspace by blocking the facebook not only transmitted a wrong signal to the outside world, but was also tantamount to negating the freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution. by blocking a social networking site reputed worldwide, were we going to follow the examples of the bigots in iran and afghanistan?
nuclear power plant
recently, bangladesh and russia signed a framework agreement for development of a nuclear power plant. bangladesh plans to produce about 2000 kb energy from that plant.
performance award
every year a huge number of hajj pilgrims are visiting the holy places of mecca and medina to perform holy hajj and say salam to our beloved prophet hazrat muhammad(pbuh).this year, according to the agreement signed between the government of saudi arabia and the government of bangladesh, 75,000 people from bangladesh will be allowed to go for hajj, out of which fifteen thousand through the ministry of religious affairs(mora) and the rest sixty thousand will go through govt. approved hajj agents. hajj is a major religious ritual and it deserves to be given top priority in respect of service.
education and development
if people are educated then they can differentiate between right and wrong. there are eight millennium goals and they are-- eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce childe mortality, improve maternal health, combat hiv/aids malaria and other diseases, and ensure environmental sustainability and global partnership for development.
cost cutting in britain
a staggering 156 billion pounds in deficit has forced the new tory-libdem government of the uk to cut costs at every conceivable area, including asking ministers to walk to office or take public transport. shocking, as it may seem, for the britons, from a life style of plenty to a life of austerity will be a tough go, no doubt. this is the price of wasteful expenditures over so many years.
our man musa!
when musa ibrahim as the first ever bangladeshi conqueror reached the summit of mount everest to hoist the flag of bangladesh, he took down his name in gold in our history. he not only made history, but also became the national hero in the hearts of sixteen core people of bangladesh. no eulogy is enough to praise his deed, as it was a utopian thinking for us before 23rd may, 2010 to reach mount everest.
tinted glass
so far we know, using tinted glasses in the cars and jeeps is prohibited in our country, albeit a good number of those are garbed with coloured covers flouting the laws. some of those are so darkly covered that you cannot even recognise who is in, which sometimes scares us. these sorts of transports sometimes may be used by the criminals to hide themselves in as and when they think necessary.
pm's advice to physicians
while addressing a function in the city's mohakhali area on 25 may, prime minister sheikh hasina called upon the physicians to render their services to the poor people, especially in the remote areas, being confident of their profession, knowledge and experience.
tourism industry
in recent years tourism has become a major element in the balance of payments of many countries. at present bangladesh is failing miserably in attracting international tourists. bangladesh accounts for only 4.5% of all international tourists visiting south asian countries, and almost two-thirds of foreign tourist arrivals in bangladesh are from india, pakistan and other south asian countries. the majority of visitors from the uk and usa are ethnic bangladeshis, who come to visit relatives and friends. almost 60% of foreign tourist arrivals are for business or official purposes, and the number of leisure tourist arrivals is insignificant. there are many possibilities of tourism industry in bangladesh and tourist spots are available. but there are problems in this sector. the problems are given below- view the page international
