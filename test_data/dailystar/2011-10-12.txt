young generation needs guidance
we, the young people, are said to be the 'future' of the country, but i wonder how we will guide our country when we lack proper guidance. the adults say that we are now very modern and that we all have a facebook account, but my question is what is the need of a facebook account when we don't know the basics of life? we, especially the urban children, do not know how to swim, how to climb a tree, and some of us even don't know how to fold a cloth! 'our children are our future' - that's what most of the politicians say but what are they doing to enlighten us with knowledge? we don't have a ground to play or a useful tv channel to watch. hence, we are forced to watch hindi serials. and so, our talent as well as our interest to know is confined to the fast food shop and the internet. only studying in schools cannot make us perfect human beings. the elders need to guide us properly, if they want us to guide the nation in the future. otherwise, we will be nothing but a burden to the nation!
leave the economy alone

calling hartals
i have read many letters in your columns about hartal. everyone writes about the bad impacts of hartal and suggest that the bnp should refrain from calling hartals, as it has detrimental effects on our economy. of course, i agree with all their arguments. but what surprises me is that nobody says a single word about the hartals which were called by the al in the past. the al called more hartals than the bnp did, although sheikh hasina declared that she would not call any hartal when her party would be in the opposition. but soon after that she forgot what she had said and called hartals in a row, when she was the opposition leader. did she think then that her party would never be in the opposition again? what was on her mind when she said that?
psc's innovative approach to plug question leakage
we have carefully read the article by syed fattahul alim published in the daily star in october 3, 2011. the article dealt with leakage of question papers in public examinations of bangladesh. there is, however, some factual inadequacy in this write up. bangladesh public service commission has conducted more than 300 written examinations in last four years. no complaint was heard about leakage of questions in any of these examinations. bangladesh public service commission has come up with some innovative methods in order to guard the secrecy and integrity of question papers. the commission makes sets of question papers for a particular examination. the commission selects one set of question paper through lottery just 25 minutes before examination and informs hall authorities by using all modern means of communication. in this method there is no scope for leakage of questions. the commission has succeeded in effectively arresting the pernicious trend of leakage of question papers.

metro rail and the public interest
the bangladesh air force caused quite a bit of a stir a few days ago when it came forth with its views relating to the controversy over the planned metro rail network in the nation's capital. it sought to explain to the nation why it thought the network would benefit citizens if the route went by way of the khamarbari area. that was a fine expression of sentiment. but the surprise for us is in the fact that a defence force suddenly thought it wise to acquaint citizens with news of all the good that could accrue from a project undertaken in the public interest. interestingly, the air force said not a word about the uproar caused by its reservations about the original plan of the metro's following a path around bijoynagar. air force flight operations, it was said at the time the reservations of the air force came to be known, would be at risk if the original metro plan was followed through.

international day for disaster reduction is being observed today with the slogan "making children and young people partners in disaster risk reduction." the main motive is to involve the young generation in disaster risk reduction (drr) initiatives so that they can have a long-term effect. the bangladesh government and ngos have taken up programmes to raise awareness throughout the country.
education first
education is a precondition for economic and social development. we have professed the importance of minimum education for the masses but have done very little in translating those pronouncements into action. we want democracy to function in the country, but how can democracy work in a nation where a vast number of the people are illiterate? we also want to implement such vital national programmes as family planning, increased food production, improved health and sanitary conditions, etc. but can any of those make any headway unless the people are able and willing to participate? the answer is obvious.
