the truth commission
the government has its rationale behind the setting up of a proposed truth and accountability commission. as the draft voluntary disclosure ordinance 2008 notes, the length of the normal legal process as well as the associated backlog has necessitated the establishment of such a commission. while we understand the argument, we also must note that the commission, once it is in place, will function for only six months. our question now is rather simple: what happens once the truth and accountability commission is no longer in existence? let us stretch the thought. there may well be a number of cases the commission may not have time to deal with. does that mean that while some people accused of corruption go free once they have confessed to their crimes before the commission, others will go through the normal legal process only because the commission will have ceased to exist?

contaminated water
we the city dwellers in capital dhaka and narayanganj solely depend on wasa for our water. there is no other source of water in these places. wasa is a government owned water supply agency, a semi-autonomous body under the administrative control of the lgrd ministry. wasa is supposed to supply pure water suitable for human consumption. but it has miserably failed to perform its task of supplying safe water. recently, the city dwellers have been observing with concern that wasa is supplying water, which is muddy and smelly. this has been going on for a pretty long time. in the 21st century it may sound incredible, but it is the reality in bangladesh.

hasina's health
i wish to thank you for your forthright comments about the people's right to know the condition of hasina's health. and you are right to tell the govt. that the nation has the right to know about the health and well-being of the former prime minister of the country. the behaviour of the present caretaker govt. is indicative of their total disregard for accountability. that's what we have been witnessing from the very beginning of their dealing with hasina and khaleda.
rice and potatoes
some people are advocating more consumption of potatoes, instead of rice. i think that's a logical proposition. price of potatoes is less; nearly half in comparison to price of rice and the food value is the same. surprisingly, many politicians and intellectuals don't support that. the question is why? is it illogical?

old beggar
it was pathetic news. a 97 years old man was jailed for begging on the street. this unfortunate man, jumman ali, was jailed for three days. not only that, we are also told that more than 2,000 suspected beggars have been arrested in the last three months. however, my question to the government is: could you please tell us what will they do when people have to live by having only one meal a day?
dignity?
honestly speaking, the news of ex-mps' unity to resist the government move regarding allocation of nam bhaban flats made me laugh out loud! how funny ! as the report had it, our "honourable" ex-mps have taken a firm stance to protect the "dignity and property" of parliament. i have nothing to say if the word 'dignity' were omitted.
labour law reform
for the last few days one important piece of news is being served by the media that the government is contemplating allowing only one trade union in the seaports. as a loyal citizen of the country and a researcher on labour economics, i would suggest the policy makers not to take the other extreme step of allowing too many trade unions.

good piece
hats off to mohammad badrul ahsan! he has written a brilliant piece on tagore's analysis of the bengali psyche in friday's ds under the heading "take it from tagore". he has put into perspective what tagore in his interview said about his observation of the character of bengalees. we have to honestly admit that our negative traits have kept us divided, despite our many positive qualities and potentialities as a people and a nation. no one could have written a better description of the nature of our fellowmen than tagore who traversed the world in search of treasures and found it right in the heart of his golden bengal; "a single dewdrop on a single blade of grass". no one could have analysed tagore's observation better than the writer who went into the very heart and soul of our national character!
price hike and election
prices of daily commodities are increasing day by day. people are just dragging on their lives. they hardly can buy all the necessary things from the market. the government is trying to keep the prices under control, but it has not succeeded so far. on the other hand, the government is determined to arrange the national election within the scheduled timeframe and almost every day we hear something about it. my question is, if the people do not survive, then who will vote in the national polls?
what does it mean?
i was there for seven years and participated in every national day programmes held on rajshahi university central shaheed minar premises. i was not an activist of any organisation, not even any cultural organisation. i love independence and i love my university. but it is regrettable that the ru authorities allowed chattra shibir backed cultural organisation bikolpo to hold programmes at ru central shaheed minar on the independence day. central shaheed minar is not a place for anti-liberation forces. it is a place for liberal people and chattra shibir does not belong to that category.

is it a joke?
'cigarette company paid for lung cancer study'. this is a report of the new york times. it reveals that a study on lung cancers is going to be funded by a cigarette company. is it a joke or a sign of benevolence? we don't discourage the funding on research; it is highly needed. but my point of objection is whether it is fair to conduct a research funded by one responsible for lung cancer. view the page international
