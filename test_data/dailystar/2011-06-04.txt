need for a green budget
forests: nature at your service’ is the theme slogan of world environment day, 2011. it reminds us of the call of engels, “let us not….flatter ourselves over much on account of our human conquest over nature. for each such conquest takes its revenge on us”. other classical or ‘positivists’ (comte, durkheim, spencer and others), however, might have thought that natural resources will never be depleted. the popular idea, around the ‘developed world’, was that a nation will achieve progress through industrialisation (raw materials of which have to be extracted from nature, mainly from forest resources around the world). since then, despite nature’s endless effort to provide a balanced natural habitat for all species, human population has been engaged to unprecedented consumption through indiscriminate squeezing the nature’s resources.
forests are at our service, but we...
this year, the world environment day (wed) is celebrated under the title and theme "forests: nature at your service" in order to draw attention to the plight of forests all over the world. the theme complements the focus of the un international year (2011) of forests.
indoor plants also at your service
indoor plants not only look help but also the air to clean fantastic. national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) research demonstrates the efficacy of plants as indoor air cleaners. indoor plants reduce unhealthy pollutants and airborne bacteria, fungi while adding the humidity needed to combat respiratory and allergic conditions.. many pollutants are chemical compounds that are released into the air through a process called "off-gassing". it is often difficult to completely control the indoor climate in an office or home.

bridging home and the world
compared to rabindranath or other pioneering poets/lyricists/writers of his time, kazi nazrul islam's travel credentials would not be considered that impressive. the furthest he went was karachi, where he was posted after joining the 49 bengal regiment in 1917. this experience, however, provided him with an exposure to other cultures and languages, an exposure that would have a major impact on his poetic style. during his time in the army, nazrul learnt farsi (persian). son of an imam, nazrul's introduction to arabic happened at an early age. as an adolescent he joined a leto group and developed a skill in composing poems and songs on short notice. through his association with the leto group, he also began learning about the hindu puranas.

a nation finding its way . . .
forty years into bangladesh's independent statehood, it makes sense to travel back in time and reflect on some of the pioneering work which went into the making of the state. nurul islam was one of the men who played a quiet yet formidable role in advancing the bengali cause through his assessment of the economics that needed to underpin the idea of, first, regional autonomy for east pakistan and, second, full sovereignty for bangladesh. with him there were anisur rahman, rehman sobhan and mosharraf hossain, men who shared his view that pakistan's bengali province, being geographically removed from its western half and, more significantly, characterised by clear socio-cultural differences with islamabad, could legitimately lay claim to a different, more attuned to reality sort of economy.
a weaver of imaginary tales
“all autobiography is self-indulgent”; so said daphne du maurier, whose books so many of us have read and loved. who can forget “rebecca”, “my cousin rachel”, “the loving spirit”, “frenchman's creek”, to name just a few of her novels? hence, an opportunity to read about this writer in her own words in a book she calls “myself when young. the shaping of a writer”, is not something lovers of english literature can let pass.
of reputations proper and misplaced
swedish linguist sven ohman (1936-2008) knew differently, and it would be even harder to imagine why he believed that noam chomsky (b. 1928--) has never been a linguist. it is something hard to believe for anyone who is familiar with the name of chomsky and the reputation it carries. formerly an uppsala university professor of linguistics, sven ohman in his book, the essence of language: a philosophical problem, has successfully established his observations and findings denying chomsky's position as a linguist.
