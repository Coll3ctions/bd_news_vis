police efficiency in dhaka
increasing demographic pressure on the metropolis and high incidence of crime must have prompted the government to decide to add eight more police stations to the existing 33 in the capital city. the metropolitan police commissioner while announcing the decision admitted that they were hectically looking for suitable buildings to house the police stations, which seem to be in short supply in the city. meeting the specifications of a standard thana complex is a logistical issue of a specialised nature. apparently, this was lost on the decision-makers so that the commissioning of the thanas is set to be delayed till such time as suitable accommodation has either been found and hired or built up by the police authorities themselves to suit their purposes.
india-pakistan deal
the signing of a deal by india and pakistan on an exchange of prisoners augurs well for peace and stability in south asia. the fact that such a deal has been agreed upon by visiting indian foreign minister pranab mukherjee and his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi reflects somewhat a new spirit in relations between the two countries in light of a new, elected government having taken over in islamabad. although it is too early to say if indeed a breakthrough will be achieved in relations, there are fairly good reasons to think that a change in attitude between the leaders of the two nations is possible.
compromise, bangladesh style

population explosion
one hundred forty million people in one hundred forty-seven thousand square kilometres of land is beyond the carrying capacity of the land by any measure. the density of 950 persons per square kilometre is unprecedented in this earth. land, ecology, climate and society are vitiated and becoming unliveable with an expanding sea of humans. but there is still no let up. every day 5500 new mouths are added to the existing stock of people, leading to around 22 lakh additional humans each year.
water pollution
water is the most vital element and crucial for the survival of all living organisms. the environment, economic growth and development are highly influenced by water. spatial and seasonal availability of surface and groundwater is highly responsive to the monsoon climate and physiography of the country and upstream withdrawal for consumptive and non-consumptive uses. our country is the lower riparian of three major river systems, the ganges-padma, the brahmaputra-jamuna and the meghna (gbm). the problem is that we have too much water during the monsoon and too little in the dry season.
education and research
education is the key to success for development of a country. research, on the other hand, has a close association with education. if we consider education as a "body" and research as "ornaments", integration makes education worthy to the people.

buriganga
a few days ago i was reading an article in a daily newspaper that the land grabbers are again filling up a portion of the buriganga illegally. what is our government doing about it? the country is going through a state of emergency but the "land grabbers" are still very active.
prison break and negligence
the prison break at chuadanga starkly contrasts the skill and capabilities of the prisoners compared to the inefficiency of the prison authorities. however the authorities' capability to pass the buck on is nothing short of remarkable!
cnn, bbc and bangladesh
as a regular viewer of both cnn and bbc news, i am getting just a little bit weary of their negative attitude towards bangladesh. cnn has reported that there is shortage of food in dhaka, bangladesh. i am sure there is, as there is worldwide. but did cnn not think it worthwhile to perhaps report the bumper boro crop, the bumper potato, the maize and wheat crops, which have also been good this year? or does that not meet its agenda on bangladesh? where do they get their news from? as for bbc, the less said about them, the better. it seems as though they are disappointed when they do not have anything bad to report from bangladesh. how about reporting the ban on plastic bags in this country, in effect for years now? how about reporting the use of cng for public transport and how environmentally friendly it is? or again, do they not meet their goals, i.e. only the negative about this country?
where are those billboards?
during the tenure of our late president ziaur rahman several billboards were erected throughout the city at prominent locations including one just outside the third gate. significant verses from the holy koran were printed in bold letters on those boards with translations in vernacular. the verses used to include warning to the wrongdoers and advice to mankind to follow the right path. city dwellers passing by those boards used to read and be reminded of the guidelines as ordained in the holy koran by allah..
"why this sweet name?"
i am writing this letter to give the answer to wally rahman's question “why this sweet name?” you have to read the ancient mythologies to find the answer to this question. in every ancient mythology you will find that the people always liked to worship the evil powers in different manners so that they might not harm them. devastating and destructive phenomena like cyclone, flood, storm, earthquake, thunderstorm, deluge were always worshiped by people in various manners. they liked to call them by beautiful names (most of them are female names), they used to sacrifice animals (sometimes virgin girls) so that those evil powers (natural calamities) might not harm them. still, consecutively or traditionally we are doing the same thing (almost) all around the world by giving them beautiful names.
corruption
corruption is a complex phenomenon that has deep psychological and cultural roots. beyond the actions of our leaders and institutions, we need to believe that corruption can be eliminated. such change may take generations and will require a concerted effortfrom our family, schools, varsities and other institutions. but perhaps more importantly, it requires our commitment to be part of such efforts to effect the change we would like to see. we must understand the reasons why corruption continues to exist in the country and we have to do something about it. people commonly define corruption as some form of malpractice. corrupt acts fall into two types: small scale (those done by individuals as citizens or in a business context) and large scale (those associated with the government).
an appeal
i would like to draw the kind attention of the chief adviser to the fact that the poor people are suffering due to the wrong policies and inefficiency of the government.
lawyers
when the entire nation is struggling to get out of the "hartal" and "boycott" culture once and for all, it is very distressing to see that a section of lawyers who grace the corridors of the highest seats of justice engage in such activities.
high price of bread

fcc story
dr. fakhruddin ahmed's write-up in your april 26 issue on the 50th anniversary of faujdarhat cadet college (fcc) brings back a well of memories. i was not a faujian - but my younger brother tanwir was in the first batch of class vii in 1958. there was nothing much for outing in chittagong in those days - except going to patenga sea beach. so, when my brother was accepted in the very first batch in 1957, we began visiting faujdarhat to have glimpses of how a cadet college looked like where my brother would be studying for the next few years! if i recollect correctly, it was mr. moidul islam who was supervising the activities at that time as acting principal until col. brown arrived in 1958. capt. moshrul hoque was the first adjutant cum teacher.
unbearable sufferings
price hike of essentials, water crisis and load shedding have become a regular phenomenon in the lives of city-dwellers, especially in dhaka.
rickshaws
it is heartening to see that this debate that i initiated eight months ago with the first of my 15 letters to-date, is now gaining ground on ds pages. i thank all participants whether they agree with me or not. lately, readers from khulna and chittagong have joined in as have the venerable messrs o h kabir, a husnain and ghiasuddin ahmed with many logical and workable solutions to our worst nightmarethe traffic jams, that often turn us to jelly.
noise pollution
in dhaka city noise pollution is increasing day by day, causing suffering to the inhabitants. it seems no one is looking into this problem.
upgrading of scales
the other day, newspapers published the report that inspectors of police (ips) or officers in charge (ocs) of police stations will be upgraded as first class but non-gazetted officers. at present they are second class gazetted officers. the news of upgrading is really inspiring but the aim is questionable, particularly for the local level policing. when almost all other government officials at the upazila level are class-1 gazetted officers of the senior scale, what is wrong with the police to provide an officer of equivalent rank as upazila police officer? in reality, the bcs police officers are not willing to go to the upazila and hence they try to be placed at the district headquarters. the aim of decentralization is to bring the administration closer to the people. upazila administration has been the centre of all development activities and the functions and responsibilities of police with all other departments at the upazila have increased. view the page international
