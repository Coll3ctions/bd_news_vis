plight of tricked job-seekers
cheating of job-seeking foreign-bound workers by local fraudulent recruiting agencies and their counterpart suppliers in the host countries has been continuing unabated. after malaysian experience, one is now faced with the extreme plight of migrant workers in libya at the hands of the bangladeshi brokers and libyan companies with dubious antecedents. reports have it that between five and six thousand bangladeshi workers are held in confinement in different desert locations, where bangladesh-origin brokers in collusion with their libyan accomplices are holding these hapless job seekers to ransom.
growing interest in jute
the recently slapped government ban on raw jute export has caused the once famed 'golden fibre' to come to the fore. the background story speaks for itself. during the july-september quarter of this fiscal, export of raw jute registered a rise of 28 per cent over what it was in the corresponding previous fiscal. the volume of raw jute produced this year is also estimated to be as high as 5.5 million bales. matching the rise in exports, the price of raw jute, too, has shot up in the local market. some traders are also allegedly stocking up on raw jute raising its price artificially in the market. as a consequence, jute mills, which manufacture various jute-based commodities like gunny bags, carpet backing and the like are facing crisis in the supply of their raw material.
expanding the use of renewable energy
we all know that there is a close association between the availability of reliable, uninterrupted power supply in industry and commerce and in the attaining of socio-economic potential and decent living standards. in this era of globalisation, there are few issues that better demonstrate the confluence of politics and business than energy. from fuelling the economies of the rich countries to driving economic development in poor ones, it has an effect on almost everything that we do. consequently, ensuring the safe supply and distribution of energy has to be an important part of strategic state policy.

kiwis dominate day one

much ado about nothing
emergency executive committee meetings, a 'decisive' democratic decision making process, an animated press conference and a re-integration. bangladesh football has been busy, behind the scenes, in the last month. but nothing has changed as far as the national football side are concerned as shahidur rahman shantoo's boys slumped to a pitiful 1-0 loss to an indian national side only in name.

the world buddhadev bose inhabited
this sketchy analysis of buddhadev bose's (1908-1974) writings, the major poet and prominent writer of bangla literature of thirties, is a tribute to his centenary anniversary (which of course was observed last year). i write to focus on especially three autobiographical essays of the poet. i remember i had an opportunity to meet him at his 202 rash biharee avenue residence in kolkata four decades back on a cruel april morning in 1972 along with my friend serajuddin ahmed, a short story writer with whom buddhadev had intimate regular correspondence. even during those days of the military regime under the dictatorship of field marshal ayub khan, president of the then pakistan (1958-1969), there was no normal movement of printed material between two countries, india and the then pakistan.
an exclusive club . . . and passing time
1956 was another momentous year for me. it was the year i was inducted as a life member of a most exclusive club. i was giddy with pride at my self-importance of this unique distinction. i was the only life member. even those who conferred this honour on me were just ordinary members of the same illustrious organisation.
out of nature
i wondered lonely as a cloud --- the poet had laid down these words long ago, substantiating a feeling for intellectuals, scholars and literati to ponder on for many generations after him.
what is it that preoccupies you all so?
is it always bound to end in despair and sighs?
what makes people taste what must turn to ash?
in my eyes everything looks lovely and fresh,
all that i view appear to be pure and full of life,
the sky seems to me molten blue and fields green
i find buds blooming softly and moonlight serene
all that i behold seem to reflect my tranquility!
all that i see smile and sing even till death,
i feel no pain, know no tears, and taste no grief!
flowers shed joyously, moonlight fades dreamily
the stars sail in a sea of light into the horizon!
who can be this happy? come and join me,
friends, my happy songs will set you free.
even if you must cry forever taste bliss this once
at least once in life forget pain and sing joyously! view the page star health
catastrophic impact of climate change on health
climate change is now regarded as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. enormous health hazards ranging from large number of deaths through natural disasters to emergence of vector-borne diseases, water and food insecurity, vulnerable shelter and human settlements, population migration etc. are already evident. if timely action, appropriate public health policy to combat climate change is not taken, more human lives will be destroyed by frequent catastrophic events and health will be endangered severely.
ways to prevent uti in women
urinary tract infection (uti) is one of the common causes for which women visit physicians. women tend to get urinary tract infections more often than men because bacteria can reach the bladder more easily in women. the urethra is shorter in women than in men. so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel. but with little precaution and simple measures, women can prevent uti effectively.
alternative medicine
homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine developed by german physician and chemist, dr christian fredric samuel hahnemann (1755-1843). it is based on the principle “law of similar". it states that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people. dr hahnemann believed that by inducing a disease through use of drugs, the artificial symptoms empowered the vital force to neutralise and expel the original disease and that this artificial disturbance would naturally subside when the dosing ceased.

new troop deployment and obama's approval rating
almost a year into his tenure as president, obama is getting bogged with problems that are making it difficult for him to back his promise for change with results. one of the problems is in afghanistan where he is finding it difficult to finish the unfinished war of his predecessor. another major setback is the economy. a combination of greed of leaders of the financial sector, lack of government regulation and the hundreds of billions of dollars spent in iraq/afghanistan wars during the bush era (total cost of the wars is now getting close to us 1 trillion) has pushed the economy into the worst recession for decades.

emerging china and the bay of bengal
the mariners always feared the bay of bengal for its turbulence. however, the advancement of science and technology made the turbulent water the backyard of many powerful navies. the key to control of the waves is innovation. with the technological emergence of china, the bay of bengal is slowly gaining a different momentum. it still is a long shot for china to contest the international maritime order. however, if china emerges to its potential, the vitally important indian ocean will feel its presence. the maritime security of the narrow malaccan strait between malaysia and sumatra of indonesia will be the chokepoint of china's maneuver towards the indian ocean. the bay of bengal will provide the bridgehead of its westerly thrust.

realism, surrealism and everything in between
the word oshtorombha is in fact zero. it is papri rahman's third collection of stories and her fifth book. papri rahman carries the banner of a writer, an editor and a critic, quite comfortably. she doesn't write about the issues related to women which we commonly see in other contemporary writers, as she claims. whenever she finds a story that is out of the ordinary, she tries to colour it in the canvass of story telling. this makes her somewhat different from other female writers that we come across.
tales of familiar dilemmas
the ingredients of anita rau badami's tamarind mem are: an interesting theme (the relationship between mothers and daughters); an engrossing story (told, in turns, by a mother and her daughter), and recognizable characters with familiar dilemmas portrayed with insight and poignancy.
begunpora, fish jhols, chhana --- all yours
chitrita banerji makes us happy and makes us remember all the culinary traditions we are heir to in this gem of a book. indeed, it is at the very beginning of bengali cooking that you get to remember that certain cultural aspect of your being. as a host, you will likely implore the one visiting you thus: “do please grace my poor hovel with your presence and share our simple meal of dal and rice.” sounds familiar? you bet it does, for who has not heard of bengali hospitality? it is as spontaneous as is the manner in which a bengali loves to eat with his family.
what diplomats should, and should not, do
craig murray lives these days in quite pitiable conditions in london with his uzbek girlfriend nadira. in these past few years he has been a candidate for a parliamentary seat and then rector of a university. it was in blackburn that he took on jack straw, the man he considers his nemesis, at the 2005 elections. he lost, but then he actually did not expect to win. it was his way of getting back at the man who he believes linked up with the mandarins in the foreign and commonwealth office (straw was then foreign secretary) to deprive him of his job as british ambassador to uzbekistan.
