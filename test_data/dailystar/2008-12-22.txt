terror threat on political leaders
we are concerned at the intelligence reports of a possible terrorist threat on the life of awami league (al) chief sheikh hasina, who has been a target of the extremists a number of times in the past. to be specific, she barely escaped death on 21 august, 2004 when 22 people had lost their lives in a grenade attack on an al political meeting. even earlier, huji had reportedly plotted to kill her during her visit to tungipara. this time around the security and intelligence agencies of the country informed sheikh hasina of a possible attack on her life by harkat-ul-jihad-al-islami (huji) and jama'atul mujahideen bangladesh (jmb). in another report it has been said that a six-member suicide squad of huji has been trained by foreign experts to eliminate sheikh hasina, and that both huji and jmb have scores to settle with the bnp as well for banning the outfits following the countrywide series bomb blasts in 2005.

let's make it work
bengalis have always been renowned for their astute political conscience and activism. during the raj, bengalis formed the backbone of the political and cultural establishment that led the british to leave the subcontinent. and then came the pakistan era where politicians like sher-e-bangla, maulana bhashani, suhrawardy and the great bangabandhu had successfully challenged the might of an establishment made up of aristocrats, bureaucrats and a powerful military. the bengalis founded their own nation as a people's state that enshrined democracy and secularism as fundamental principles.
homage to martyred intellectuals
14th december is a red-letter day in the history of bengali nation. thirty-seven years ago on this very day the bengali intellectuals were brutally tortured and killed by al-badr, al-shams killers who were the agents of pakistani occupation forces. their barbaric and heinous atrocities are comparable only with the nazi killing of jews during the world war ii. it is a matter of great regret that these war criminals are not yet tried. it is the unequivocal demand of the people that these anti liberation forces be brought to justice without wasting any time.
unemployment issue
in a study of "the 2008 world factbook", it has been revealed that the total population of this country is 150,448,339 (july 2007 est.). but it is quite insightful to see that about 63.4 % of this country's total population is in between the age of 15 to 64 years. this larger portion of people could be an asset for this country. but because of unemployment, they are in danger of being a burden on the economy.
al's manifesto
your staff correspondent's front-page report on al's manifesto on 12th december appears reasonably pragmatic. however, completing it in their term of office, should they win, seems difficult. and if they are replaced by their arch-enemy bnp, come next election, then even the realistic goal of 5,000mw power by 2011 will disappear. the real life example is there when even their mou for power plant was summarily cancelled in a very foolish manner, as soon as they were succeeded by the bnp. to top it, after that the bnp could not even add 1mw of power when they were in office.
a disqualified fema
election observers play an important role during election and various parties related to the field are greatly served by it. in this regard, fema has always carried out the job sincerely from the very beginning. but unfortunately the ec has banned the organisation from observing the polls, accusing its president of involvement in politics.
sound pollution
sound pollution has reached an alarming stage. experts have warned that excessive noise can lead to deafness and create health problems, which can do irreparable damage to humans.
election commission
the election commission appears to be feeble. the simple answer is-- stand on your feet and take a very rational and befitting decision regarding the constituencies where the court decision might jeopardize the election. if i were the chief election commissioner, i would immediately reschedule those elections without disturbing the election of the entire country. this is the most logical and legally acceptable solution under the present circumstances. i hope the election commission will take this decision.
fema issue
that fema has not been allowed to observe the upcoming election really stunned me. the election commission has rejected the registration of fema on the ground of its president's connection with politics. but it is well known to all that he was associated with politics for a short period of time and resigned from politics more than one and a half year back.

subcontinent
india was divided into two separate independent states under the 'two nations theory i) india for the hindus and ii) pakistan for the muslims.
leadership
we are an overcrowded nation, [and urban society]; therefore it is not unusual that we have surplus 'leaders' -- no unemployment at the top levels of the society. labelling is no problem these days. there are too many political parties [to have a piece of the pie]: and too many mass media organs [daily newspapers and tv and radio channels]. why corruption is so popular? the antidote: extremist muslims, using a wide range of cosmetic effects for social display [dress, mannerism, poise, motivations.....].
obama and the world
mr obama has been elected (or selected by pentagon, fbi, republican -- democrat highest ups, limited topmost people in the usa) as the 44th president of the usa. it is definitely creditable, especially for a black to be elected as president of the usa. in fact, it is much more creditable if he has been selected by the tops of the usa as selection is totally on complex hard calculation, and no emotion at all.
bush and iraq
president bush's final trip to iraq to say goodbye may not have been fairly the fond farewell he had in mind. not everyone was greeting bush as a great knight in shining armour during his secret visit. one iraqi journalist muntazer al-zaidi decided to hurl his shoes at the decider during a joint press conference bush was holding with iraqi premier nouri al maliki. the surprise visit was planned to commemorate a security pact between the u.s. and the iraqi government. but, at the end of the day, the president wound up having to dodge a pair of shoes thrown at him. this brave journalist has acted on behalf of billions of people worldwide. it is an irony that bush wanted to leave office with a bang as the liberator of iraq has to slink into iraq and hide behind the green zone. on top of that he got a sent-off with a shoe!
