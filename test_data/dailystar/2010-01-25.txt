help haiti
haiti, a small caribbean country, was hit by a dangerous and devastating earthquake on january 12, 2010 with intensity 7--9 on the modified mercalli scale (mm). killing thousands of people, the massive tremor destroyed almost all the infrastructure including hospitals.
municipal waste
i have gone through the unb report on the subject published in the pages of a local english daily on january 9th. an expert from iubat talked a lot about recycling of municipal waste; however never mentioning a word about "waste concern", a private organisation, which had pioneered and is still recycling municipal garbage, since about a decade back in dhaka city.

the lady next door
when the two dignitaries were exchanging pleasantries, it occurred to my mind why can't the two ladies learn from her.
disappointed
a few months ago, there was a news item published in the daily star on how prime minister sheikh hasina declined to sit in a royal chair at a function. such austerity gesture was praised by the media including the daily star.
mr alamgir's comments
i am surprised and very upset that such characters who violated all government rules are accusing other people of corruption.
bcl and al
from the moment sheikh hasina's al came to power, her party's youth and student wings have been very busy with all sorts of ugly business. their latest victim is the leader of another student wing, bangladesh chhatra moitree. they bring shame to our society and they insult our culture. but more importantly, they have been sending us a message and the message is this: we are invincible and we will do absolutely anything we like. and every time this government makes announcements like “stern action will be taken against bcl men...” the government simply proves that point.
private universities
the article which was published in the daily star on january 8, 2010 with the title “universities” forced me to write this letter. obviously, the govt did not approve private universities to be certificate selling centres.
pm's india visit
sheikh hasina visited india to improve relations, understanding and mutual trust. but it appears from bnp chairperson and secretary general's version that she was perhaps on a tour of invasion. they should understand that these days countries cannot be invaded rather their heart can be won with sincerity. a new door of co-operation has been opened in many fields. people of the entire sub continent will be benefited if the opportunity can be fully utilized. bangladesh is an equal partner in the road of development. sheikh hasina went to india to strengthen that partnership. our main opposition party should shun the mentality of begging, bringing or giving. we want trade and co-operation not aid and humiliation. thanks, sheikh hasina, for heralding a new era of relationship.
too much celebration!
it is reported in some dailies in dhaka that the roads from all directions leading to zia international airport were occupied by the cheering supporters of the al govt to welcome the prime minister at the airport on her arrival, after what they called, "a successful state visit to india". the processions chanting slogans of "joy bangla" warmed up the dhaka city which looked like, as if the prime minister had conquered india and was returning home with her heroic forces. well, there is no harm in celebrating for wining a war or big games but anything excessive is bad. the celebrations created a huge traffic jam.
bnp and bjp
our prime minister's visit to india has been a much talked about phenomenon both in bangladesh and india. the heated debate still continues in our media and public sphere about the pros and cons of the visit. many believe the visit to be a promising one considering the unresolved issues lingering for the last three decades. the prime minister of bangladesh herself has termed her visit to india and done deals as hundred percent fruitful and the scale is obviously much more lenient to bangladeshi side. on the other hand, the opposition has accused the government that it has not seen our country's interest.
indian cargo transit
much is being written in our dailies about the matter; precipitated more by the unnecessary drama(natok) about smuggling and security by the bnp our "boro natokio party"! lest they forget since they do not mention it, it was during their government that the dramatic import of illegal arms took place. are they now therefore allergic about it? if not then why this senseless talk by them, every time, everywhere!
children's rights
the kid, for the complete and pleasant growth of his or her traits, ought to grow up in a family atmosphere, in an environment of cheerfulness. the child should be entirely ready to live an individual life in society…in the strength of tranquillity, self-respect, lenience, liberty, parity and harmony-- all these promises were derived from the un convention on the rights of the child. each youngster has a right to upbringing an optimistic survival free of mistreatment, aggression, disregard, and acute deficiency. kids require learning, health services, steady support systems plus care for, expectation and support; all these things and more are necessary to facilitate children to grow up.
free books?
i am a student. we are facing a big problem. i know that the government is giving books to primary students free but the teachers of chandpur primary school don't give books without money. at the moment, we do not understand what should be done. please help us. we
visa
