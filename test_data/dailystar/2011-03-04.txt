'removal' rolls into hc
professor muhammad yunus yesterday went to court challenging the central bank order that removed him from the post of managing director of grameen bank, while the wider international community showed its displeasure at the way the nobel prize winner for bangladesh was treated.
border wait gets longer
when thousands of bangladeshis are crowding the tunisian and egyptian borders to escape the libyan conflict, and international agencies are struggling for evacuation, the bangladesh government is still “assessing its capacity” to bring the bangladeshis home.
is this the way to treat our nobel laureate?
so after all the talk of “blood sucking” and “siphoning off billions” the real guilt of our one and only nobel laureate and globally admired microcredit pioneer and grameen bank (gb) founder, is that he is too old to continue as the managing director and that his reappointment was not endorsed by the bangladesh bank. did he become too old yesterday or in the recent past? prof muhammad yunus is now more than 70 years old. so what was the bangladesh bank, the finance ministry and the several governments that came and went in the meantime, doing for all these years? why was the so-called irregularity in his reappointment not corrected earlier? why the process was not challenged either administratively or in the court of law? why something that was not an issue for ten years, has suddenly become one?
us deeply troubled
foreign diplomats in bangladesh have sharply reacted to the government's move to remove nobel laureate prof muhammad yunus from grameen bank and none of them took it positively.

sarwan back where it all began
the last time ramnaresh sarwan came to bangladesh was in 2002 when he was a young man burdened with a huge load on his shoulders. at that time, the impressive guyanese hadn't scored an international ton for two years after his debut and promptly in his second game in dhaka, sarwan struck a sublime 102, touching the magic figure with a last-ball four off tapash baisya.
now part of another west indies side, sarwan is one of only two players to have been part of that tour. this time too, the classy right-hander has to share the burden of the middle-order. he spoke to the daily star sport's mohammad isam yesterday during training at the sher-e-bangla national stadium.

well not quite, since the match on wednesday was totally to the contrary. england against india was like a golfer cruising along with a two shot lead on a sunday, till the 17th, when the unspeakable happens; in the rough off the tee, then barely managing the safety of the fairway, following up with a shank into the bunker and not quite up and down from there. three putting the 8 footer downhill, a classic case of being bit around the ankles when least expecting. against ireland, england were scandalous to the extent even tiger woods's indiscretions would have been forgiven.
