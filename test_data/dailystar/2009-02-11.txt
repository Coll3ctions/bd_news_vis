pranab mukherjee's productive visit
a good degree of significance was attached to the just-concluded visit to dhaka by indian external affairs minister pranab mukherjee. it has been lived up to by the fact that two agreements were signed by india and bangladesh during the minister's visit. of course, one of the two deals is basically a renewal of an old one. it is, however, the new agreement, the bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement (bipa), which can be considered as a distinctly forward-looking move in relations between the two countries. the benefits that will accrue from the deal will be of a mutual nature. but what is certainly important from bangladesh's perspective is that bipa allows dhaka to invest in the indian market, particularly in the northeast of that country. for a nation that has for years been endeavouring to have its goods gain a market in india, bipa should make a difference. besides, bangladesh's need to have india cutback on the negative list involving dhaka's exportable goods to delhi may finally be met, hopefully a good part of the way. the reality is that from here on, india and bangladesh will enjoy most favoured nation relations with each other. that is surely a good augury.

of books, of proximity to power

transit issue with india
