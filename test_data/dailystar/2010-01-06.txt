a year of bold initiatives and timid implementation
what truly separates an awami league government from others is its emphasis on agriculture and food self-sufficiency. this probably comes from the party's grassroots base, a totally committed minister like matia chowdhury and sheikh hasina's own personality. sheikh hasina naturally inclines towards the poor when formulating her own priorities. as in her first term, so also now, from day one sheikh hasina's government made food security and agricultural productivity its foremost priority. starting from availability of agricultural credit, fertiliser, seeds and power for irrigation to ensuring a reasonable price for the farmers, the government deserves full credit for ensuring a healthy performance in this vital sector. one decision testifies to this priority as none else. when the rest of the country was reeling from load shedding, uninterrupted power was ensured for irrigation throughout the growing season.

pakistan caught in a maze
pakistan remains in a state of siege from a number of quarters. in these past few weeks, conditions have deteriorated on essentially two fronts. on the one hand, the spate of bombings which has been a regular feature in various areas of the country in the last one year has continued, with explosions occurring on and off. the latest of these destructive occurrences have been the blasts at the ashura procession in karachi, which has left scores of people killed and hundreds injured. that the pakistani authorities have so far been unable to identify or nab the perpetrators of the grisly incident and that people have been pointing fingers at one another demonstrates the sense of panic pakistanis today happen to be going through.
the bnp, a year into democratic renewal
a year into the awami league government, the bangladesh nationalist party ought to do better than act as petulant as ever. its grandees, none of whom made us happy in their days of power and glory, are these days the very emblems of stubbornness. in politics, if not anywhere else, stubbornness does not pay. more to the point, being stubborn does not help political parties which have lost elections badly. in politics, being sore losers is almost always counter-productive. and yet that is not what the bnp appears ready to accept twelve months after it saw its hold on the electorate loosen dramatically, for all the right reasons.

the pace headache
it was refreshing to watch the bangladesh batsmen get off on the right foot in the first match of the idea cup tri-nation tournament against sri lanka at the sher-e-bangla national stadium in mirpur on monday. there had been a lot of negative talk about the tigers' batting in the recent past but it seemed that they have gained confidence after a successful 2009. there is, however, still a long way to go to match the character of the modern day's limited-overs game where almost no score is deemed safe.

beautiful beach, but…
it is often said that cox's bazar has great potential to be a leading tourist destination for foreign visitors to bangladesh. recently some business contacts of mine, who are europeans, visited the area but left with a sour taste in their mouth.
greenhouse gases
many of the challenges we face, from poverty to armed conflict, are linked to the effects of global warming and climate change. now we are finding solution to the climate change problem. some scientists are now warning that the sea level could rise by up by two meters by 2100. we must cut emissions of green house gases (ghgs) as well as carbon dioxide (co2). according to the kyoto protocol (1997), the combination of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydro-fluorocarbons and per-fluorocarbons sulfur hex fluoride is called green house gases (ghgs).the carbon dioxide accounts for more than sixty percent of total green house gases(ghgs) emissions.
global warming and warning
many attempts, suggestions and speeches have been made at copenhagen in order to decrease global warming around the world. it is a common issue today. the intellectuals from different corners of the world have interacted on the issue of changes going on in the world's atmosphere. my plain question is, are we all aware of these issues? i mean, why the nature changes, why temperature rises etc. it is due to globalisation, deforestation, urbanization etc.

fake phensidyl?
the news, with the headline "fake phensidyl factory in city busted", was published in the front page of your newspaper on 25 december, which drew my attention.
traffic rule violation
a comment on the subject was published on the last day of the last year, which was a matter of shame. hopefully, it was the energy adviser's last 'sin' of 2009! illogically, however, one may say in his defence that as a conscientious energy adviser, he was conserving energy and saving fuel by taking a short cut by driving on the wrong traffic lane! maybe, he was also saving valuable time, knowing fully well, that "time is money".
one-eleven in retrospect
like many, i welcomed the change on january 11, 2007. in spite of lot of criticisms, i don't repent my support. one-eleven was not a political adventure of any ambitious army official, rather it was a reality stemming out of the political arrogance of the bnp reflected through unconstitutional moves of the then president mr. iajuddin ahmed. had there been no such change on that day the country could have remained in a state of constant political agitation. hawa bhaban style plundering coupled with complete politicisation of the administration could have put the state in total disarray.
bnp's role in copenhagen
yet another ds editorial today, 26th december, after the editorial last week on bnp's attendance in parliament. the ds is one of the most neutral dailies and we sincerely value its comments. i hope the chairperson of bnp and the party's top leaders will at least read the editorial, even if they do not agree with the paper.

taliban slaughtering pakistanis
it is said that in a madhouse, sanity is the most hated behaviour. in this sense, pakistan is essentially a madhouse where everyone is trying to out do each other in madness. the taliban claim to be muslims and yet they are slaughtering pakistanis who are supposed to be muslims as well. the pakistan army is supposed to protect the people. and yet it is not capable or even unwilling to stop daily bombings by the taliban as its eyes are fixed on fighting a war with india. but the greatest madness is that pakistanis continue to blame india and america for the mass murders by the taliban.
dst
digital time that means daylight saving time (dst) which started on 19 june 2009 has given a new lease of life. this means office and business start and close earlier than they used to. the system was introduced to save electricity for the evening. so far, the government has not informed exactly how much benefit has been achieved by introducing the dst. so, the dst timetable since its inception spelt a lot of suffering for the ordinary people.

drug resistance is a familiar term to many of us. the drug resistant bacteria develop or acquire techniques to bypass the action of antibiotics. when the bacteria develop this protective mechanism against many antibiotics, they are generally termed as multi-drug resistant bacteria. but a certain type of bacteria usually doesn't have resistance mechanism against all available antibiotics, rather this mechanism is developed against most frequently used antibiotics.
