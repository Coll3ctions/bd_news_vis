on independence day
thirty-seven years ago, on this day, the call went out to the people of bangladesh and to the outside world that this nation had opted for freedom. even as the pakistan occupation army went about its genocide in dhaka and elsewhere in the country, the bengali nation could envision that there was light at the end of the tunnel for them. it was surely a long tunnel and as yet there was little to show that freedom would come any time soon. but that the bengali political leadership had taken a decisive step in guiding the nation towards freedom boosted the collective morale of seventy five million bengalis and conveyed to them a sure sense that the attainment of freedom was but a question of time.

fleming 'just' satisfied
had stephen fleming's final test innings been scripted for a film about his life, it would have been deemed too boringly realistic to make the final cut. he entered with the stage set for heroism and sparkled briefly as new zealand began their long and unlikely trek towards salvation. by tea he had achieved his first aim, the 54 runs required to nudge his career average past 40, but within minutes of the resumption, he was gone -- not to a sublime piece of skill from the bowler, monty panesar, but to yet another wafty, half-conceived flash outside off stump.

us presidential election
the democratic party will choose a candidate to run for president and the candidate would be either a woman or an african american. is there anyone in the democratic party worried that come election day their candidate would find it difficult to cart off the “stigma” of belonging to the african american and “women” category, two of the more resourceful, successful and ever powerful yet “minority groups” who perhaps would not convince or inspire the war weary electorate that the time has come to elect a “minority” candidate, and not a male white politician.
the month of march
fiery march is a memorable month in the history of the nation of bengalees. on the night of march 25,1971, the pakistan army pounced upon the unarmed bengalees. they killed millions of innocent people. but the bengalees had the courage and undaunted spirit to face the challenge. and after nine months of war, we became independent.
cricket
one test cricketer has exposed his level of temperament recently while passing through the fans. he does not have the capacity to control his temper. what a shame! i am a cricket lover from the very early days of pakistan, and used to follow cricket on radio and tv and also attended matches in the field at home and occasionally abroad. i can definitely place myself with the cricket fans of today. they are enjoying endless opportunities to watch cricket all over the world and almost all the year round. these fans are lifeblood of our cricket they support the good performance and look critically at bad performance of the team and individual players. this is a normal pattern of relation between the players and the fans. i strongly feel that the players who showed bad temper and manner in public should get punishment from the appropriate cricket authorities as provided in their laws.
unused overbridges
i would like to thank the daily star for printing a photo of pedestrians crossing the street (march 24, 2008, star city) right under the new foot overbridge at bangla motor. this is a picture that can be seen anywhere in the capital where there is a foot overbridge. traffic police, though present, act like helpless spectators. this increases the death/injury risk to the pedestrians, causes disruption of the traffic flow and also add to the pollution as the engines have to run longer than necessary. thus, the final impact comes on the fragile economy which has to bear the burden of all the associated additional costs.
women's rights
about a week back we were suddenly stuck to a big headline carried in almost all the dailies of the country. the meaning of the headlines was the same, but some looked at first sight extremely worrisome.

passengers of titanic!!
i am not only shocked but alarmed as well when i see newspapers describing how bangladeshi citizens are dying in seas, deserts and prison camps. they are fleeing this country as if they are onboard a sinking titanic. why is this happening? are we so much after money that we don't hesitate to take the risk of death.

indian visa hassle
for two consecutive days, i have unsuccessfully stood in queue for submitting my application for indian visa at the indian visa application centre at gulshan, dhaka, and returned home disappointed and sick. i joined the queue very early in the morning but found hundreds of others in queue since midnight. being an elderly person it was a torture for me to stand in queue for hours and then return home disappointed. adding to my woes while in queue was pestering of brokers who were asking for tk. 2500.00 for getting you a visa or tk. 1000.00 for placing you forward in the queue!

flights from sylhet
there are thousands of passengers travelling from sylhet to the middle east and london. many a time they do not get tickets at the time they want to fly. moreover, the present fares of biman and other airlines are too high. recently, the civil aviation department accorded permission to a foreign airline to operate cheap flights from chittagong to the middle east which has proved to be highly successful. there is no reason why the same type of flights should not be operated from sylhet to the middle east. apart from being convenient to passengers, this will boost manpower export.
constant exasperation
nowadays, my mom seems to suffer from constant headache and grumpiness. why? well, it's not actually easy being in her shoes and run around with me to the coaching centres each and every day. also that includes having to stand in the middle of the road for like hours and shouting, "aye cng! dhanmondi sathas number road jabe?". it's unbelievable how i have to get out of my house each day almost one and a half hour early to reach the coaching centre due to the traffic jams that increases the time of the route by twenty to thirty minutes and bless the "cng-wallas" who refuse to go wherever you ask them to.
a freedom fighter's thoughts
i was there on 7 march, 1971 in the race course ground. as a young medical student of dhaka medical college, i went there to hear (frankly)as to what would be the future course of events, i wanted to know, if i could finish the first professional mbbs exams that were postponed after march 1. i had a dream like all middle class young men to have a prosperous future, but by the time i heard him out, all dreams were overtaken by only one dream, that is to fight for a free, democratic, and exploitation free bangladesh. with that end in my mind, i later traced my way like millions of my countrymen to freedom struggle. view the page international

qayyum's spirited liberation war artworks
sitting at the bengal gallery and reminiscing over the liberation war days, veteran artist qayyum chowdhury recounts his participation in 1971 with the activists from the then art college -- with shilpacharya zainul abedin and quamrul hassan. he takes pride in his paintings and brush and pen sketches that he made after 1971 delineating the freedom fighters and the portraits of the tortured and abused. he brought in the river and the boats too in the backdrop, at times, clinging to his penchant for the idyllic. however, the focus of his artwork on canvas and paper were the bold and driven freedom fighters -- both men and women.

at long last, let justice be served
for a long time, war had been a way for conflict resolution in society. many rules have been formulated in support of war for the protection of states and their interests whenever the issue of sovereignty has come up. since ancient times, discussions have abounded regarding theories for and against war and just wars; on questions of differences between military and civilian targets; on a difference of situations between the warring and non-warring. view the page star city
