no effluent treatment!
as river pollution around the city has already turned critical, it should be stopped immediately for the betterment of this mega city. most of the industries of dhaka are located near the rivers and 70% of them have no effluent treatment plant (etp) to treat industrial wastewater. as a result, factories are disposing of effluents without any treatment to the nearby river. since industrial wastewater possesses high amount of heavy metal (cadmium, aluminium, zinc), non-biodegradable compounds, high alkalinity, high suspended solid, high biological oxygen demand (bod), the river ecosystems are becoming critically endangered. data from ngos and other monitoring authorities show that buriganga, shitalakhya, turag, balu receive about 1.9 million cubic meters of untreated water on daily basis which is alarming for aquatic life and human health.

don't ignore them
imagine, a boy equally talented, has two eyes, one nose like you but there is only one difference--he is poor and you are rich and only for that reason he cannot study. around me, there are many students who cannot go to school. so, i took a step. i have distributed most of my bengali books to the unfortunate boys. i discovered that they also like to read and have a very good ability to understand a subject. the young boys who are about only five or six years old were very happy to see the colourful story books that i gave them. they need money but more importantly they need proper education. so, i urge the whole world, please donate books (especially colourful ones) to 46 flora pass road (beside a.k. khan group head office) ambagan, chittagong, so that i can distribute those to the unfortunate children.
everest story
i think your newspaper was covering musa's everest success story a bit too much. in one word “news blitzkrieg” was going on now in both ds and the prothom alo. there is no denying the marvellous achievement of musa, kudos to him. i express my heartfelt congratulations to him. every bangladeshi should be proud of this achievement. it is an occasion for celebration too.

menacing trucks
in sylhet city, at daytime, hundreds of trucks move recklessly through the main roads. certainly, it's very risky for city dwellers, especially the school going children and their guardians. at least after the unanticipated death of a buet student, the authorities should be more careful in this area. for example, from kumargoan bus-stand to amberkhana point (only in four kilometres) there are many educational institutions like shahjalal university of science and technology, ragib-rabeya medical college and hospital, bdr school, sylhet ideal school and college, muslim model school, west point school and college, pathantula primary and high school, blue bird school and so on.
tobacco cultivation
while the whole world is aware of the harmful impact of tobacco and tobacco related products, here in our country cultivation of tobacco is increasing day by day. initially, cultivation of tobacco was confined to greater rangpur. but, now it has spread in most areas of our country that is very detrimental for our food security, health, environment and socio-economic stability. for cultivation of tobacco very fertile land is needed and tobacco plants take away a huge quantity of nutrients from top soil. as a result, the land becomes unsuitable for cultivation of any agricultural crop for next two years.
rajuk and developers
if we look at the buildings of dhaka city, it becomes evident that these were not constructed according to the building code. i have hardly seen 8 feet (4 feet from either side) distance between two houses which is a rule set by rajuk. hundreds of thousands of buildings have been constructed illegally but rajuk did not take any action against the people who made them and claim that they do not have sufficient manpower. to me this is a lame excuse because it takes 2 to 5 years to construct a multi-storied building. if rajuk has 20 engineers they should have sufficient time to inspect them (at least the distance between two buildings). experts repeatedly warned that if there is insufficient space between the buildings, fire may spread from one house to another. see what happened at "nimtoli" of dhaka city. a building collapsed at "begunbari" as it was not constructed following the code.
undermining islam
at present anti-islamic forces of the world are trying to offend muslim ummah in multiple ways. they have already adopted internet as a medium to pour scorn on islam and propagate false, baseless information about the religion. even they are opening many a website in the name of islam and trying to create confusion about islam among those muslims who have little knowledge of it. view the page international
