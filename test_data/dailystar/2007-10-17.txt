b chowdhury's national government idea
the suggestions from former president aqm badruddoza chowdhury regarding a government of national consensus for a decade have predictably generated widespread comment. professor chowdhury would like the nation to know that such a government can take shape after the general elections promised for end-2008. while one is already to welcome new political ideas, especially in such fraught conditions as those in bangladesh, one notes that the suggestion the former head of state has put forward lacks the details that might have lent it a little more substance. we, at this newspaper, have been following carefully the debate arising out of chowdhury's formula. we believe however, the idea of a government of national consensus runs contrary to the letter and spirit of the constitution.

a consensus government -- and no opposition?
in a season brimming over with some novel ideas about governance and statecraft, professor aqm badruddoza chowdhury's suggestion that, once the elections of 2008 are gone through, a government of national consensus might be put in place (for a decade!) only adds to the excitement. you only have to recapitulate everything that has happened in these past few months to get a sense of where the country is going, or trying to go.
the rumpus over indo-us nuclear deal

sleepwalking to sanction, again
the burmese government's grotesque crackdown on pro-democracy protests will have one certain effect. the united states and the european union will place more sanctions on the country. its economy will suffer, its isolation will deepen. and what will this achieve? sanctions are the energizer bunny of foreign policy. despite a dismal record, they just keep on ticking. with countries like burma, sanctions have become a substitute for an actual policy. view the page sports

dhaka metro
recent news about the construction of metro or monorail system in dhaka city in an attempt to ease the traffic congestion has brought a sense of hope and relief to the dhaka's road users and pedestrians. we were tired of the false promises and hopes given by the past governments. bullet train, metro, monorail etc etc were promised by the communications minister. everything has turned out to be bluff and cheap election propaganda. we would like to believe that the present caretaker government would keep its promises. although the government is expected to be in power for a little more than one year, the communication ministry can at least start the foundation work of the metro or/and monorail system so that the future political government will just carry on the rest of the work. we are so unfortunate that we have got little confidence in our political parties. i think the metro system would suit dhaka better than the monorail system because the monorail would occupy much of dhaka's free passage and spaces. there will always be the need for the extension of the transport system in future.
business in ivory coast
bangladeshi garments sector is in dire straits. the 74% export market depending on rmg is an ominous sign and we must look for diversification of our exportable products base in order to keep our competitiveness in the international market. to add fuel to it are the conspiracy theories and vested interest groups who are constantly trying to take away our market to the other countries vying for the share of the export pie. it's indeed a shame that we are not adding value to our products and not looking into product diversification and we are paying the price by being tied to a single product. a t-shirt can get a manufacturer may be a paltry 3 dollars whereas the same t-shirt is sold at 10-20 dollars even in the discount stores in the us or in the eu countries.
role of usa
when someone jumps into a decision without knowing the consequences, then that person or, for that matter, that nation can be likened to a fool. the stance that the us has taken to police the world is failing miserably on their faces and they are getting slapped left and right in iraq and afghanistan; however, their moronic attitude is really stopping them from realising that they are into slow poisoning the world and most importantly, themselves.

save our jute industry
the condition of jute in bangladesh is deteriorating day by day. jute mills are being closed down one after another. it is an undesirable situation for the industrialisation of the country. the terrible news is that world bank and some other international authorities are exerting pressure on the present caretaker government for closing the other govt. owned jute mills. jute mills are flourishing in our neighboring country india. then why pressure is being exerted on us to close the jute mills while there are many reasons not to close them? we should at least keep the existing mill running.

police and colonial past
police in the subcontinent was not raised for the benefit of the people of this land. police forces in this land emerged as an anti-people organisation since their inception. police of the british bengal used to do the notorious jobs for their colonial masters. police were being trained in those days in tune with the desire of the colonial administrators. police very often came down heavy on the poor peasants. they used to arrest and detain innocent indigo cultivators. they robbed the people of their little belongings who lost the ability to pay the land revenue. even if the poor farmers had no harvest due to flood or draught, they were not spared. police were the instruments of collecting money for the white shahib.
detained du teachers
in connection with the august 20-22 du incidents, some du teachers are detained now. i passed from the cu but when i see du teachers are moving in prison van under police custody i feel bad. we know the allegations against them. we also know the teachers. especially, prof. anwar hossain and his family's glorious past is known to all conscious citizens.
political parties
some of the political parties including the 'name only' ones are clamouring ahead of holding dialogue with the ec against the measures reportedly adopted by the ec in the registration process of the political parties. but we the general public strongly believe that some kind of regulatory obligations should be there for the political parties to fulfill and ensure financial transparency before they can become eligible for registration to participate in the general election. there should be a clear-cut policy guideline on prevention of nomination trading. the ec should be authorised under the provision of the constitution to act as the regulator with adequate legal power to deal with the offenders. this is absolutely necessary to keep the political parties on the right track. the ec should go ahead with the formulation of the regulatory legal framework after seeking public opinion (if felt necessary) on the proposed provisions and thereafter place the same before the ctg for adoption. it will not be wise to let the politicians have a free hand in the registration process in view of their adverse past records. the political parties and the politicians will ultimately govern the country. therefore, some mechanism for screening should be there at the initial stage to encourage and induct patriotic, educated and honest persons in the parties. this may not be hundred percent possible but an awareness can be created at all levels to discourage musclemen, criminals, terrorists, extortionists etc. joining the political parties, who under the umbrella of high-ups in the party consider themselves above the law and use their political platform as a safe heaven to continue with their criminal activities as noticed in the past. effective check, therefore, must be there to prevent entry of these elements into the political parties as far as practicable with an obligation on the parties to expel them at the instance of the ec. in the past we saw persons with those “qualifications” even became ministers ! the country's future depends largely on establishment of a patriotic, healthy and honest democratic institution. today, in general the politicians are looked down by the public as 'munafiqs' , meaning those who are liars, misappropriate public properties, breach trust and do not honour their promises. that is why the country is in a mess today. we have got a unique opportunity now to weed out these elements. the country would plunge into the same turmoil, lawlessness and uncertainty if those people are allowed to enter the political arena once again. view the page international

some difficult truths
in the 1992 movie a a few good men, when confronted by dashing navy lawyer tom cruise in a probe about a crime (as it happens, in guantanamo bay naval base) jack nicholson, a marine lt. colonel said: "you can't handle the truth." i want to ask the same question today: "can we handle the truth?" handling the truth is often more daunting than discovering it. what kind of truth do we need to establish, and for what? do we need to find out whether our businessmen, at least those who are accused of dishonesty, are actually honest? could it be the case, as they claim, that they were bullied into corrupt practices? i always thought that it was only our bureaucrats who set the standard of innocence, to the extent that some of them cannot even flip a fried fish on their plate, and that they were the ones bullied into taking bribes by the politicians. now our business community is asserting the same level of innocence. their alleged innocence or guilt can be established by an investigating officer. you do not need a truth commission for that.
