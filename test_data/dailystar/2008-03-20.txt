protecting consumer rights
the consumers' rights need legal protection in a society where their rights are conspicuous by their absence. but the draft of the consumers' rights ordinance that has been prepared contains certain provisions which do not go far enough to underpin or protect consumer rights. it has been proposed that the affected consumers will have to lodge a complaint within 10 days of being aggrieved. clearly, the consumer's interests are not sufficiently underpinned because in some cases it may take a longer time for the consumers to realise that they have been swindled. secondly, the aggrieved consumers won't be allowed to file a case directly to the court. it has to be routed through a government agency to obtain the right to file a case in the court. in other words, the bureaucracy will practically decide the fate of the consumers' complaints. it is not at all clear why the consumers' right to seek legal aid all by themselves has not been recognised. after all, nothing can be more effective in protecting consumers' rights expect through the law of the land. like artha rin adalats or loan courts we may have a separate legal setup for redressing grievances related to consumer rights.

listen to wendy
ref: - kashmiri leaders should also approach usa.
this recent media reported statement of former ambassador to pakistan, wendy chamberlin, who now heads a washington think tank, is well intentioned and deserves to be taken seriously . wendy has proposed the appointment of a us envoy and said that it was this dispute only (disputed state of kashmir, one part of which is ruled by india and the other divided part by pakistan and china) which had brought the two countries on the verge of a nuclear war. she said this issue is also coming in the way of restoration of peaceful relationship between pakistan and india. wendy added that if the kashmir issue is resolved then extremism could also be curbed down. this will ultimately lead to peace in south asia.
investment in transportation
i would like to see the government building some power plants and improving public transportation as a priority for bangladesh. we need the funding to come from outside as i'm sure the effects of sidr have somewhat depleted our government funds for such projects. i think that the underground system was the incorrect choice and that the sky train would have been much better, easier and cheaper for us right now. bangkok has both systems, but they did the sky train first, it requires little land and problems of flooding do not affect it. kuala lumpur also has both including a simple sky train system covering key areas and upcoming areas. they charge 15 baht a ride in bangkok (around 30 taka), in bangladesh it would have to be around 15 taka to make it feasible. i read that some local company has been given the contract for its completion in 4 years. this does not sound realistic.
biggest “failure”
the biggest failure of this most successful govt. is their inability to project properly and extensively their tremendous success in so many areas, to the people of bangladesh in particular and also to the world at large. this govt. is definitely the best, sincere govt. in the last 36 years. this govt. could arrest two former prime ministers who were also two leaders of the opposition along with a number of senior ministers, the son of a former prime minister, a number of top businessmen (better to say land grabbers, manipulators, extortionists) a number of bureaucrats all at a time. probably no govt. in the world would dare to touch so many powerful demons in political, bureaucratic, business, circles at a time. this required great courage and great moral strength. view the page international
