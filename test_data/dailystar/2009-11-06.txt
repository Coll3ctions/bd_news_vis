hamid karzai's new term in office
hamid karzai should have no reason to feel complacent now that he has been given another five years as afghanistan's president. after what has clearly been a flawed election followed by a decision for a run-off followed by the withdrawal from the race of his rival abdullah abdullah, the president's hold on power does not look promising. the fact that the election commission has given him a walkover does little to make people inside and outside afghanistan feel that things will now fall into a pattern. and just what sort of compulsions he might come under has come through the warnings sounded by the united states and other western nations engaged in the war against the taliban. they have given him six months to clean up the mess that has accumulated over the last five years in afghanistan. else they will pull the rug from under him.

education policy
i welcome any new education policy arrived at after due consideration by the experts to improve it in our country as education is the key element for any nation. i also note the objections of the bnp and jp in this matter. such objections really point out the root malaise of all our education policies which needs urgent attention. the necessity is to make partisan politics illegal and irrelevant in all our educational institutions (for both students and teachers), and in all official recruitment agencies and promotion boards. political parties can have 'young' or 'retired' groups ( as they have in uk and other countries), but their activities must be outside any educational institution, and they must not use the label 'student'. genuine student politics should be restricted to representation and activities of students for their own welfare.

films and censor board
okay the title is as straight forward as it can be, but has anyone really checked out the website of the censor board of bangladesh. to put it in a word, it's simply hilarious. why ? - look around, in fact the next time you see a commercial film poster in the streets of bangladesh, take a moment and think...look closely at the poster...beyond the half naked women and the "over dramatic" heroes- what lies beneath you ask? - everything and everything that needs to be censored !!!
abolish quotas
the country of bangladesh was liberated 38 years ago. and we are still bestowing undue privileges on the family members of freedom fighters! it is discriminatory. soon after the liberation war ended several top army commanders, civil service stalwarts, politicians et al worked together to upgrade themselves. hence, was the 'two years antedated seniority' in service and unprecedented 30% percent quota for freedom fighters in all government jobs. it means thirty percent quota in all fields - admission in medical colleges, public universities, education, govt. jobs, armed forces etc. for 150,000 persons and seventy percent for more than sixteen crore people! what are the faults of the 'shaheed' families and crores of indirect freedom fighters who helped the ffs, supplied information, intelligence, food and rations, or prayed for the victory? how did we reward them?
attack on reporter
the rapid action battalion (rab) was created as a temporary measure to quell the menace and insecurity created by the rise of extortion by petty robbers and thieves masquerading as political activists who were often protected by “godfathers”. while society breathed a sigh of relief when these extortionists were brought under control, many feared that this elite force one day would also turn against the very citizens of the country where the justice system is too antiquated and bureaucratic to be effective. when a police force loses the respect and co-operation of the people it is paid to protect, it no longer serves its purpose. between failures of the judiciary and the politicised law enforcement, common people are left to fend for themselves. is this what an elected government promised to deliver?
