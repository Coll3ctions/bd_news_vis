a tense hartal passes off

chittagong election
the city election of chittagong was held by and large peacefully. i find the efforts of the ec to deliver a free and fair poll have been appreciated. there was also the contrary view and criticism that the ec has robbed this democratic exercise of franchise with the citizens' committee, stripping the festival of democracy of its vibrancy, does the commission deserve this reprobation? i am afraid not. so a stringent law is enacted perhaps with full knowledge that like others this would fall by the wayside at the time of implementation. this syndrome is aptly called the 'culture of impunity.' no wonder, there is consternation, a cry of anguish, and an accusation of throttling of democracy, as the stringency of the law hits home only when the ec asks for and monitors its implementation without exception!

dap and some questions
i have followed the articles in your paper regarding the protection of wetlands which i find a very responsible thing to do, but my concern is that by closing these private developments we will further the gap between the rich and poor in our country, if dap is implemented the prices of available land/houses will go up three times. and those people who already have one or to houses in dhaka city will become richer, (including those who are adamant to close down these private companies). then who will listen to the plight of masses of middle class?

death of a newspaper
the country's oldest english newspaper - “the bangladesh observer” died after prolonged legal and financial illness on june 08, 2010 following shutting down of its operation by the owners. it was 60. starting its publication as “the pakistan observer” in 1949, the prestigious daily broadsheet encountered so many problems including ban on publication. the bangladesh observer left behind numerous reputed journalists (whom it brought up), ardent readers and subscribers, writers and admirers to mourn its death. they expressed profound shock and sympathy at the sad demise of the well-circulated newspaper. they prayed for the re-birth of the newspaper.
former pm and money whitening
the finance minister quite rightly refused to disclose details about the possible whitening of money by the former prime minister and her two sons, under the income tax ordinance of 1984, preventing the disclosure of such information about taxpayers' whitening of undisclosed money. (the bnp insisted she whitened white money. why would she want to do that? does she also send her fresh laundry out for further laundering?)
the 'average' american
in my experience, the general consensus amongst people i have encountered and the countries i have visited, the 'americans are fat and not that intelligent'.
education and teachers
how many times do you need to change the education policy of a nation to get it right? i simply can't understand why every ruling party thinks that changing something is the solution to all sorts of problems. you are changing the syllabus, the curriculum, the question patterns of the board exams, but what about the teachers? are they comfortable with the new system? i don't believe. and who are being affected by that? the students, the feet on which the future bangladesh will stand.
“a” level exams
the "o" and "a" level exams are patently very important for the students who have a dream to go abroad for higher studies and intend to build a bright future. the british council bears the responsibility to conduct those exams by itself and nominating some other institutions and centres in dhaka and other cities in our country. achieving a good result in those exams is a mandatory requirement for admissions in foreign colleges and universities. seemingly the standard and authenticity of the exams taken by the british council are highly praised and accepted worldwide.
the great prophet (sm)
according to our rasul (pbuh), there is no hermitage in islam.
negative politics
in bangladesh there are more than one hundred political parties, out of which two major political parties namely the bnp & the awami league (al) come to power alternatively since 1991 after restoration of the democratic process . all other parties rally behind these two just to get a small share from their leading parties. the al is the oldest one and led the liberation war in 1971. the bnp was born after assassination of the father of the nation in 1975. anyway, this party founder was a freedom fighter who took control of the country during a turmoil which was going on after the assassination of the country's founding leader.
vocational training
our country's educational systems are not well-planned like the other developing or developed countries. we have systems such as bangla medium, english medium, madrasa education, vocational education etc.
burden of unemployment
an unemployed person knows best how much burdensome life can be. this stage of life begins at the end of one's institutional education. guardians tend to expect these boys or girls to stand on their own. they seem to be reluctant to bear his expenses any more. the unemployed person starts running after a job which hardly comes within his reach. he offers his toil, sweat even blood in pursuit of this. he finds himself in more difficulty when he has to pay tk 200--300 or even 500 or more as pay order/bank draft/invoice/postal order per application, especially for the govt. jobs along with other hard-to-manage documents. sometimes it is felt that he has to be involved in another job to collect this money. because of these shortcomings, the helpless job aspirants miss some good offers and thus fail to appear at the interview though he might have qualified for the post.
selfish genes!
though there are divergent views about the budget, its emphasis on the power sector is welcomed by all. on the other hand, if anybody expected even a few innovations in budgeting this year, they must have been rather disappointed. the budget has proposed to impose value added tax/vat on all services. this reminds one of the remarks made by sir winston churchill.
why coaching centre?
nowadays coaching centres are growing like mushrooms around the famous schools in dhaka city. most of the teachers who teach math, english and science have individual coaching centres or batches. guardians and students are not actually interested in going to coaching centres but the teachers persuade them to go there by providing notes, sheets and short suggestions before exams. finally, the teacher gives them more marks. as a result, students and teachers cannot concentrate fully during class time. view the page international

making the twain meet
