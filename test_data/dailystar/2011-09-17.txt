e-waste: a growing concern
rapid progress in science and information technology, growing manufacturing activities, expanding urbanisation and increasing globalisation have elevated consumption and production for newer, better and faster electrical and electronic devices. with the growing use of these devices by businesses and households, the rate, at which people are constantly rejecting outdated product, is rapidly rising. many of these are having short lifespan and not costlier to throw the old and buy the new one. these escalating obsolete and rejected electrical and electronic equipment, known as electronic-waste or e-waste, have become a significant concern to the society.

prologue:
tagore poetry in english
rabindranath tagore (1861-1941) is considered to be the greatest bengali writer ever born. although a 'myriad-minded man', he was not much confident of his english language skills. he made a clear confession of this to ezra pound, william rothenstein, ramananda chatterjee, and his daughter bella and niece indira. he thought his english was not good enough to suit him fine. but the success of the english versions of his gitanjali poems and that of his speeches in the american lecture circuit even before he had risen to prominence by winning the nobel prize must have proved that his fears were groundless. researchers have explored many qualities of permanence in his english writings.

arab spring, libyan war, and exporting democracy
the recent arab spring truly renders the democratic aspiration of the people of the entire middle east and north african region. when it was sparked in tunisia and spread to egypt, it was just a matter of time for the other dictatorial regimes in this region to face the similar fate. however, for the usa and its allies, the democratic middle east has always been a hard choice to make. as the political and economic landscape of this region has attached much importance to the global peace and security, the usa and its allies never wanted to loose the grip over this region. therefore, although the initiation of arab spring has jostled the usa and its allies for a while, it did not take much toll for them to come back fine.

rehashing a rough side of life
“bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in asia, still has a serious child labour problem despite its commendable progress in terms of basic education” (ch. 1, “introduction: child labour in bangladesh”). thus does kristoffel lieten, editor of working boys and girls at risk: child labour in urban bangladesh , introduces the book, although, considering the social norms and stresses obtaining in the country, it is difficult to see a direct correlation between progress in basic education and serious child labour problem. he then proceeds to concentrate on the topic of child labour in bangladesh, beginning with a crucial observation: “the bangladesh child labour law 2006 primarily acts to prohibit hazardous work for children below 18 years old.... the implementation of the law, however, remains the key challenge.” indeed! true to form, laws abound on paper in bangladesh, but their practical application, more often than not, falls below par. lieten then brings up a fundamental problem that impedes scrupulous implementation of the law: “the un committee on the rights of the child, in its 2009 tri-annual assessment of the progress in bangladesh, reiterated its concern that there is no uniform definition of the term 'child': definitions and legal provisions vary between civil law, the convention, and sharia .”
