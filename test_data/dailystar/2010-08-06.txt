tagore and monsoon
dhaka metropolitan branch of jatiyo rabindra-sangeet shammilon parishod (jrssp) arranged a musical soiree, titled “borshar gaan,” at the main auditorium of chhayanaut sangeet bidyayaton, in the city on august 4.
tagore today
rabindranath tagore lived a long and extremely fruitful life. his literary output is simply colossal. what is more, it is of amazing variety and consistently of a high order. true, tagore himself had his doubts about much of his writings, and he admitted perhaps it would have been better had he been a little less prolific. but at the same time he knew it was in his nature to be prolific, and he could not deny his nature.
“raja…ebong onnanyo”: makeover of a tagore classic
theatre troupe prachyanat staged their 14th production “raja…ebong onnanyo” (king of the dark chamber...and others) on august 4 at the experimental theatre hall, bangladesh shilpakala academy. directed by azad abul kalam, the production is a contemporary, experimental theatrical presentation of the classic tagore play “raja” (1910). tagore's “raja” depicts a utopia where the presence of the king is felt only through the peace, harmony and disciplined life of the denizens; he is never seen anywhere in the country. without changing the original story, azad abul kalam treats the classic with a new approach and tries to portray the omnipresent king as a metaphor against the contemporary world of chaos, exploitation and imperialism.
rabindranath on stage
we all know that rabindranath won the nobel prize for his immortal works from “geetanjali.” i'm also almost certain that not many of us have read all his works from the “geetanjali.” indeed, his literary works are so vast and diverse that it is almost impossible for any one person to read and internalise all these in a lifetime. in “geetanjali” itself he has presented us with an array of literary output, each of which could be classified as an archetype and whole lot of new creations can follow from that. rabindranath is primarily known for his songs and poetry. his songs are almost an integral part of the bengali life. we sing them in our sorrow, we sing them in bliss, in our celebration of life or morose of death. after his songs and poetry, come his short stories. they have been popular with all ages of bengali readers. some of these are so popular that they have been adapted as plays and performed on stage. his “noshto neer,” “khudhito pashan,” “kabuliwala,” “shasti” and many other short stories have been made into brilliant movies by great bengali filmmakers. many of his novels have been very popular and were, indeed, made into successful films; the latest case in point being “chokher bali.”
nature as it appearsin tagore’s work
i am in awe of how rabindranath tagore has touched nature in every aspect of his literature. in prose and poetry, on subjects of love, nature, worship and even human relationships, the bard expressed himself in many respects through nature. in the words of the poet, “i have been overwhelmed by another feeling. the one inseparable link between me and the universe, nature -- this everlasting unity of soul has drawn me intensely. how often sitting on a boat i have emptied forth my soul over the land, the water and the skies radiant with the sun's light. i have not then considered earth, quite apart from me, the water with its flow had passed within my heart raising its outburst of joy.” (a tagore testament)
special tv programmes
on the occasion of the 69th death anniversary of rabindranath tagore, television channels of the country will broadcast various special shows, including plays, musical programmes, documentary and more. here is a glimpse of the special programmes: view the page op-ed
