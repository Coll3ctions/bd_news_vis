pest that feeds and grows on human body
four decades ago i visited a distant relative who was a cancer patient at the dhaka medical college hospital. a chain smoker, he was always chewing betel leaves containing all the available spices. his cancer was first detected in the tongue, which soon spread to the esophagus. i saw his throat was open from beneath the chin. in those days you could see flies inside a hospital ward, and i saw maggots crawling down his open wounds. then several years ago, i watched a documentary on a young girl's struggle to get out of the amazon jungle while a large larva was oozing out of her open wounds. i thought humans were good habitats for flies. i was wrong! only recently, i learned flies are rarely true parasites for human. i became curious.
peering into the nascent universe
march 30th, 2010, will always be a very memorable day in the history of physics. scientists from cern, the european organization for nuclear research, working on large hadron collider (lhc), the biggest physics experiment ever, managed to set a record for high-energy collisions by smashing two proton beams at a combined energy level of 7 tev (trillion electron volts). the collision took place after two failed attempts on that momentous day due to electrical failures; the two proton beams with record-high energy levels of 3.5 tev apiece were racing in opposite direction at nearly the speed of light (186,000 miles per second) around the collider's 17-mile-long underground tunnel before smashing into each other at 1:06 p.m. local time in geneva, switzerland. many are considering this historic scientific event as crucial to the understanding of the beginning of the universe. according to cern director general prof. rolf heuer, “it's a great day to be a particle physicist”. marking the start of the lhc research program, the moment of collision of the sub-atomic particles was greeted by tremendous applause and cheers by scientists both from cern and beyond. it is noteworthy to mention that, lhc project which worth $10 billion and took more than 15 years to construct, went back to service last year after a massive electric failure closed it down back in 2008 for about a year. but the recent landmark incident in the experiment ushered a fresh anticipation amongst the particle physicists. according to dr. fabiola gianotti, the atlas (a toroidal lhc apparatus) collaboration spokesperson at cern, “with these record-shattering collision energies, the lhc experiments are propelled into a vast region to explore and the hunt begins for dark matter, new forces, new dimensions and the higgs boson”.
scientist who made bengalis proud
satyendranath bose, eminent physicist and founder of quantum statistics, was born in kolkata on january 1, 1894. he passed the entrance examination in 1909 with fifth position from kolkata hindu college. he stood first in the f.a. examination in1911 from kolkata presidency college. from the same college he did graduation in 1913 and m.a. in 1915 with mathematics and secured first class first in both the examinations. in the same year, he joined the kolkata science college and worked with dr.meghnad shaha in the field of higher mathematics and physics. meanwhile in1921 dhaka university began its journey and he came to dhaka and joined the physics department at the dhaka university as a reader. he worked hard for the establishment of the physics department and devoted himself to research work. he worked relentlessly on the theoretical physics and x-ray crystallography, which brought him worldwide fame as a physicist. in 1924 his work entitled 'plank's law and the light quantum hypothesis' was published and it drew attention of albert einstein. einstein translated his research paper in german and published it with his comments, which afterwards became famous as 'bose-einstein theory'. in the meantime, in recognition of his work a kind of elementary was named 'boson.' here are two types of particles in our universe- one is 'fermion' having mass and named after the scientist enrico fermi, while the other particle is 'boson', having no mass and as noted before named after satyendranath bose.. he also solved some of the unresolved problems of the theory of relativity at that time. he worked at the dhaka university for 24 years. then he went back to kolkata and in 1945 he joined kolkata university as a professor in the department of physics. he became a fellow of the royal society of london in 1958. for promoting science in bengali language he founded 'bonggyo biggyan parishad' and published a monthly journal named 'gayen biggyan' from it. he was awarded 'deshikottum' by 'bishawbharathi' university and 'padmavhuson' by the government of india. he died in kolkata on february 4,1974.

fresh look at human evolution
“they, ladies and gentlemen, are potentially a rosetta stone into the past," lee berger, a paleo-anthropologist at the university of witwatersrand, told a press conference at the cradle of humankind world heritage site.
are we in a wormhole?
a long time ago, in a universe much larger than our own, a giant star collapsed. its implosion crammed so much mass and energy together that it created a wormhole to another universe. and inside this wormhole, our own universe was born. it may seem fantastic, but a theoretical physicist claims that such a scenario could help answer some of the most perplexing questions in cosmology.
