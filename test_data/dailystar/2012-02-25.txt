developments in the maldives and india's options
the sudden resignation of president nasheed in maldives on february 7 took many by surprise. the media in india reported it as a coup, a military takeover, the president was forced out, etc. nasheed's description of the change as a coup gave it a particular flavour. india is allergic to coups in its neighbourhood. it has had to get used to them in pakistan and is wary of them in bangladesh. this reflex is rooted in its deep seated commitment to democracy with a supreme civilian authority. coups also imply surprises and india does not particularly care for them. in the instant case the association of the word coup with maldives set off a reflex and a chain reaction set in thereafter. india remembered the coup attempted in maldives in 1988 when it had to rush its forces there to restore the government's authority. an implied threat to its own security from an unstable situation in maldives caused the government to take the line of least resistance i.e., accept the newly sworn in president, dr. waheed and assure him support and treat the matter as an internal issue of maldives, to be sorted out by them. overall, the message that went out of new delhi was that while it cannot be unconcerned about happenings in that country, it is prepared to work with whoever is legitimately in power there. however, the issue of legitimacy has now come to the fore and many feel that this needs to be looked at closely. also, by being the first country to accept the developments there as an internal matter, india set an example for others to follow [witness the us position].

intellectuals are lonely warriors
the people of bangladesh have a rare heritage behind them of the golden history of the language movement and struggling in the face of colonial cultural oppression. the very idea of linguistic identity has shaped the politics of the post-british era of east bengal, resulting in the birth of the country called bangladesh. however, fayaz alam, in his latest book buddhijibi, tar dai o bangalir buddhibrittik dashotto successfully grabs our attention with some factual information about the fact that the colonialist cultural aggression and religious sectarianism had not just started in the pakistan era. it was rather a continuation of a trend which started at least a hundred and fifty years earlier, at the beginning of british colonial rule in bengal and through a so-called modernization of the bengali language and bengali people.
old cultures in primeval beauty
bangladesh's indigenous people deserve a good deal more importance, a lot more respect than they have got thus far. the unfortunate truth remains that for over fifty years now, and that takes you back to the times of ayub khan in pre-1971 pakistan, they have been subjected to indignities of a kind that puts you to shame. and even as we observe, on an annual basis, the anniversary of the 1952 movement for bengali to be established as the language of the state, we do not quite recall, or deliberately ignore, the fact that the cultures, traditions and languages of the tribes inhabiting bangladesh also need to be emphasized in the interest of promoting an inclusive state.
