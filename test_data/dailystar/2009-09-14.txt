the bane of child labour
if pictures speak a thousand words than the photograph appearing recently in this newspaper of a boy pulling ropes at a rope factory have spoken more than a thousand words and very poignantly so. to any sensitive person the sight of an underage boy, labouring in hazardous conditions, and that too for a pittance, must evoke the most contemptuous reaction, as it does in us.
the baul's passing
he was truly a monarch in his realm of melody. for baul samrat shah abdul karim, music was all. it was music that welled up in the soul and remained evocative of the soul. now that he is dead at ninety three, the music becomes a memory and the man rises to a crescendo of transcendence in the human consciousness. it would be superfluous to suggest that shah abdul karim is now set to become a legend, for legend is what he rose to being in all the years of his striving for the creator, for his land, indeed for the universe. there is something about baul music that takes its notes, its inflections and its nuances toward a wider space; and doing so, it resonates in the hearts of those who feel it brought to them on the waves of the wind. karim sang in the fields, under the trees and on the banks of the river as an adolescent. as time lengthened itself in his life, nature became part of his being. it expanded and widened his reach. for those who heard him, they felt their own world taking on a larger dimension.

untapped sites
while tourism continues to grow at a rapid pace the world over, it has not been able to gain much ground in bangladesh. over the years there has been so much talk over the 'tourism potential' of bangladesh. it has become a cliché. it is the absence of serious planning and execution, coupled with the unprofessional approach of the government authorities that has been a perennial stumbling block in the realisation of the region's tourism potential. mere observance of the world tourism day is not going to make any difference unless the irritants plaguing tourism in bangladesh are addressed. since bangladesh has diverse attractions to offer to the tourist in the form of its pristine natural beauty, forests and wildlife, rivers and mountains, and a unique multi-cultural heritage, it is indeed baffling that tourism continues to be a non-starter amidst such potential.
unfair fares
three-wheel human haulers are one of the most popular means of transportation in our country. but these have become a tragedy for the people depending on this transportation system. during the holy month of ramadan the service that the citizen is getting from them is a matter of real concern. not only in the capital city but also in metro cities like chittagong the residents are getting robbed by the drivers of these three wheelers. the government has set rules that the drivers of such haulers are bound to carry passengers wherever they want to go. meter has been set too so that the passengers can pay a certain amount of fare. but in chittagong none has ever seen any taxi driver going by the rule. they always show excuses like their owners force them to take extra amount of fare or they cannot cope with the heavy traffic jam. today i had to go to probottok shoroni from halishahar h/e and i had to wait for an hour to get one cng baby taxi. the vacant one that i got was asking for 100% extra fare and was showing excuse that it's the month of ramadan or there is a huge traffic jam ahead. but the fact was that the traffic was like a regular day. seeing no option, i had to pay an extra tk 40 to reach my destination.
oil and gas issue
police attack on the activists of the national committee to protect oil, gas, mineral resources, power and ports is really very unfortunate. people who want to protect the resources of the country should not be treated in such a way, rather the government should have co-operated with them. i am shocked to see prof anu mohammad in the hospital and asked myself whether we live in bangladesh or in east pakistan. this al government always claims that it is a pro-people and pro-independent force but in reality the government has awarded an ireland-based company the shallow water block ss-08-05 and a us oil company deep sea blocks ds-08-10 and 11 in the bay of bengal for oil and gas exploration with agreement, empowering them to export 80% of the gas at a time when the whole nation is facing serious power shortage. many african countries have huge gas and oil reserves but still they are poor because of the anti-people agreement between their corrupt governments and multinational companies involved in the exploration of oil and gas.
saifur rahman's death
mr. saifur rahman was a very respected senior politician and a witness to the development of our economic progression. he had always been sober in his appearance and had always been careful about his image before the public.
standing committees
our constitution (article 67) has the provision for forming parliamentary standing committees. successive sub-articles describe its formation, function, authority etc. the aim of parliamentary standing committees is to establish transparency and accountability of government institutions.
two questions
all the newspapers including the daily star headlined, on september 11, almost the same with the two ladies' photographs on the front page. at the iftar party, the prime minister also urged the opposition leader to return to the js.
overflowing osd pool
lgrd and cooperatives minister disclosed in parliament that 81 government officials including 20 secretaries and additional secretaries have been kept as officers on special duties (osd) for various reasons. on 07-09-09, the government also promoted 494 senior civil servants and asked them to join as osd at the establishment ministry as there is shortage of the required posts / jobs for them. it is learnt that this large-scale promotion is a part of a major reshuffle plan of the government and these promoted officials were mostly overlooked in the last seven years.
don't allow it
this govt has made noticeable progress in allowing indian access to our ctg port and also in the transit issue in the name of asian highway. but can the port fulfil our requirements, is the road network good enough for our traffic? the answer is no. then why our govt should allow access to a neighbouring country when they have large number of ports of their own. this is regrettable that the govt is doing so much for india, without getting much in return.
promotion en masse
your editorial on the impetuous promotion of the civil servants of the republic (on 09.09.09) should be appreciated though the language was soft in consideration of the impacts it would have on the civil service as a whole. how could we make the honourable prime minister understand that this sort of unscrupulous decisions would plummet the credibility of the present government. it's no secret that the bnp alliance government did the same thing before. but what is the difference and where is the change then when the vaunted activities remain the same or even worse?
oblivious bangladeshis
let us not say, “let bygones be bygones” rather say, “let not bygones be not bygones”. in fact it was the all out driving force generated by the last ctg against venality in order to drive out evil spirit from venal human soul and psyche.
our problems
some problems are created in bangladesh because of ignorance. i can give you two examples:
things going wrong
despite all efforts, traffic jam in the city-dhaka is still an endless source of bewilderment as well as harassment for almost all those who have to go out for work or shopping. the cops seem to be fighting a losing battle and yet not giving in. it appears as though the city will heave a sigh of relief only during eid-ul-fitre and not before that. that implies the authorities couldn't come to the rescue of the suffering public at a time when they needed help very desperately.
tv and radio
recently, the indian information minister said that they would soon form a committee to look after the programmes of the television channels and the fm radio stations as allegations are rife that sometimes these television channels and fm radio stations broadcast such types of embarrassing programmes which go against the indian culture and tradition. in the present context of our country, i also truly believe that we too need to form such a tv-radio censor board because these days most of the private television channels and fm radio stations are airing programmes with vulgar words and gestures which totally go against our culture. if we have a censor board to control the cinema, if we have the press club to look after the activities of the print media, then definitely we also need to form a committee to look after the activities of the tv and radio stations. there seems to be a culture of impunity prevailing in these sectors and therefore many radio jockeys these days are misguiding the youths with ill advices and tv stations are copying programmes being inspired from the west.
follow their example
the inspirational report on the contribution of the blinds of nilphamari to our society published in your daily has made me abashed. the blinds have shown us the path. (blind, yet they set green mark: the daily star: september 4, 2009). they showed us that we should do something big or small for the well-being of our country. they have shown us that every individual has some responsibility to society, to the nation as an individual and as part of society. if we are sincere to our responsibility and have commitment to the country and its citizens we can contribute something positive for the nation.

vat on commercial space
in the last budget the govt imposed 15 percent vat on commercially rented space, establishment and machinery. vat or value added tax introduced by late saifur rahman was aimed to collect more taxes from the business people. it is a different form of sales tax. it really baffles us all how a commercially rented space adds value to the business of the tenant or the owner. the owner is already paying ats (tax at source), city corporation tax, income tax at increased rate, an amount which eats up a major portion of the income. the tenant engages in business and pays vat again on products sold, his or her turnover, income tax etc. the owners have been directed to collect vat from the tenants and deposit it to bangladesh bank. if they fail to collect vat from the tenants the owners have been ordered to deposit vat from their own pocket. what a mad, desperate, illogical, illegal and sick directive !! how our tax people can justify vat on commercially rented space? in their bid to expand the vat net the overzealous tax people have taken undue liberty. this is a totally illegal tax imposed on persons concerned.
