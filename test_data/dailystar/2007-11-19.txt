post-hurricane relief
harrowing facts and figures of the devastation of hurricane sidr are beginning to emerge with rescue operations going on in some of the worst affected areas. understandably, it is still too early to determine the extent of fatalities, as many remote areas remain impenetrable to the search parties. nevertheless, it is comforting to note that various government and non-government organisations, voluntary organisations and the armed forces have already launched relief and rescue operations to reach succour to the affected people. yet, we feel, the enormity of the disaster and its aftermath demand more energetic and well-synchronised relief operations, and this can be best done through prioritising the immediate, mid-term and long-term requirements.
whipping up anti-iran frenzy

devastating cyclone
the horrendous cyclone has struck, leaving behind a devastated coastal belt. all the details are not yet known the actual loss of human lives and properties is yet to be ascertained. we have watched glimpses of the devastation on of our national and international tv channels. these are the occasions when bangladesh is better known to the west. this is the time when the army-backed caretaker government is required to prove their efficiency in crisis management. the damage to life and property is definitely very high, although immediate reports do not give a complete picture. one would urge the government not to down play the actual situation- a traditional governmental attitude. this is a national crisis and should be faced as one nation. the affected people need our help first before any external assistance comes.
shortage of fertilisers
farmers are laying siege to the offices of the uno, dc or agro-offices very often. the government is repeatedly stating that there is no shortage of fertilisers. this appears to be a big joke and travesty of truth or there might be big gaps in understanding of the situation every time there is an acute shortage of urea, pesticides etc. when farmers are agitated, they are arrested and even fired on.
suhrawardy uddyan land for golf course ?
recently, the government decided to hand over 25 acres of land of suhrawardy uddyan to dhaka club for golfing. but suhrawardy uddyan is a place of huge importance. it is witness to our liberation war. we can't let this historic place to be the personal property of any club. this should be a public place. everyday a lot of people go to suhrawardy uddyan, especially in the evening. the government can't take away this breathing place of public. so this poor decision must be withdrawn immediately.
bush appeases americans!
oh, no! us president george w. bush has not accepted his defeat at his terror wars in the middle east. he surely thinks the americans do admire him and his republican party for protecting the energy and other economic concerns of “his country” across the globe. intermittent wars are considered vital to protect the national and global interests of the usa. the trumpeting by the democrats about a sure coming back to white house seems to be in jeopardy, going by his attempts to get back the hearts and minds of the people of the us to his side by wooing them in all possible ways. maybe, he is right, they appreciate the terror wars being fought in the islamic world.

whither the ultimate truth?
i recently stumbled on a book titled 'the borderlands of science : where sense meets nonsense' by michael shermer, published by oxford university press, 2001, that i found awfully interesting and i feel an urge to share the core issue with you and the readers. the rift between scientific materialism and pure metaphysical and spiritual thought stream grew deeper with darwin's discovery of the evolutionary theory and natural selection. since then there have been two distinctly identifiable schools of thought, each zealously clinching its own ideas but one interesting feature cannot escape notice. some renowned scientists and positivists took keen interest in the activity of the opposite camp and some of them even started believing in the duality of fundamental concepts thus seemingly creating two pathways - science and pseudo-science. they were the travelers of the shadow-lands of science but by no means science dropouts.
mass transit system
much has been said and written on the subject - some of which are highly scholarly and beyond comprehension for the laymen like this scribe. however, i would like to mention a few points: some time back, the japanese foreign minister (who later became prime minister) while visiting bangladesh remarked that the climatic and topographical conditions of dhaka city are not suitable for an underground metro system. the report of the experts' committee headed by dr. jamilur reza chowdhury also did not favour the metro system. view the page international

challenges in our sanitation sector
international statistics (who and unicef 2000; who and unicef 2004) indicate that over 2.6 billion people in the world today are without any form of "improved sanitation." the real situation is even worse: the statistics include toilets that are so bad, or shared by so many people that it cannot be regarded as "improved sanitation." over a billion of the 6 billion people in the world are served by sewerage systems, but much of this sewerage is discharged into rivers, lakes and seas with little or no treatment. only about 30 % of 1.1 billion people connected to the sewer system have their sewage treated in an environmentally acceptable way (matsui 2002), which effectively means that the excreta from the remaining, which is 5.7 billion people, are discharged directly into the environment -- on the land and to the receiving water bodies!
