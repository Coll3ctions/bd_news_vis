in the last fiscal year inflation in food price was about 11%. when 40% of the people of a country live bellow the poverty line, this trend of food price inflation becomes an unbearable headache for them. though productivity in agricultural sector is gradually rising these days, it will, perhaps, not be sufficient to control food price. the upcoming days for us are not good as there are a number of crises to fight against.

it happens only in dhaka

sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
the last few days it has been overcast and cloudy in boston, with the sun playing a game of “hide and seek” with massive patches of clouds, trying to break out of the cover of clouds, but losing the battle more often than not. cloudy days are not my favorite ones, and during fall and winter, when days are short and nights are long, i am not eager to jump out of bed and start my daily routine if it's cloudy and dark outside. on any given morning, before i get out of bed, i make sure that the sun has made its appearance on the eastern horizon. why? because if the sun is not up yet, i feel very little urge to get up myself. during the winter months, when it is dark by 5 pm, and the night sometimes lasts almost 14 hours, i feel the sun gets more rest than we do. i hardly ever get more than seven hours of sleep, whereas the sun has at least twelvetherefore, i don't see why the sun can't be up in the morning before i do. also, i need the sun to get me started. nothing wakes me up and energizes me as much as the sight of the rising sun in the morning.
saying goodbye . . .
the wind chime was a melancholy window from which a choir of sadness filled my heart to the extent of non-existence. it was a beautiful day. an old, familiar breeze, in a tremulous fountain of colour hissed and whispered silently on my mulberry red ears. droplets of rain danced on the window silt like bricks on a lane. i remembered auro. view the page star health

key health issues in focus

palestinians are non-entities everywhere
on 11 august 2008, peter clark writes in a guardian obituary that as a poet, author, and politician, mahmoud darwish 'did as much as anyone to forge a palestinian national consciousness.' while clark's comment is undebatable, it is also true that darwish's poetry transcends its national boundary by reflecting on universal humane values through the mirror of the palestinian experience. it is one of the major reasons why darwish now is a great name in world literature. memory for forgetfulness is his exquisitely written prose-memoir. ibrahim muhawi's adept translation brings out the delicacy of the piece. it is based on israel's invasion of lebanon in 1982 that was aimed at wiping out the plo's base from southern lebanon. the fact seems most startling when one reads the memoir containing evocative details of beirut under siege. darwish, however, lifts up the sufferings of the invasion to an aesthetic level through his musings on reality, belonging, history, resistance and the role of art involving these. the entire book is an extended internal monologue (the poet's thoughts in his mind) about which robyn creswell writes in harper magazine's january 2009 issue:
