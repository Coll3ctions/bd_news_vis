fuss about solar energy
there have been several letters in your column on solar energy as a solution to bangladesh's energy crisis. as a photonics device engineer working in the uk and us industry for the last 14 years, i would like to make a few points to clarify the apparent misconceptions of those who seem too eager to jump on to the bandwagon of solar power without fully appreciating the technology, the costs and the eventual benefits to one of the most densely populated countries of the world where real estate comes at a premium price. many have cited the growing trend in the usa, a country that is 60 times larger and has only twice the population, to use solar power as a reason to embrace it in bangladesh.

a great man, a humble man
the last time i met dr. m.a. wazed miah was when he made that final trip to singapore for medical treatment. he looked rather frail. but then, there was no absence of enthusiasm in him. as i sat beside him on the plane, he held my hand and we talked. i was acutely conscious of the fact that he did not need to be disturbed, that he needed all the strength he could muster to pull through. it was i who did the talking. i recalled in my mind the brilliant career wazed miah had travelled over the years, the niche he had carved for himself in the arena of nuclear science. view the page startech
