civil service reforms
there is little question that the country's civil service has been declining performance-wise. a round table discussion on the draft civil service law has highlighted this truth once again. the round table has focused on those issues related to the civil service that have regularly been talked about without much follow-up action being taken. it is now time for a full, concentrated approach to the question of civil service reforms. one notes, though, that over the decades a good number of moves were made toward promoting administrative reforms. unfortunately, though, nothing has come of all that enthusiasm.

nature at your service
on 5th june, the world environment day was observed all over the world. this year's theme “forests: nature at your service” calls for collaborative global efforts for increased investment in forest management and forest resources to increase employment, reduce deforestation and help tackle climate change. the government of bangladesh along with ngos and different socio-political organisations arranged various programmes on the day to make people aware who are directly involved in the act of deforestation. they stressed the importance of tree plantation, reducing felling of trees, etc., because trees trim down floods and droughts. it is not possible to eradicate all the problems overnight as we have limited manpower and logistic support. awareness is the main way to come out of this problem.
please put a stop to mindless hartals
hatals are taking place at the worst of times. ordinary and advanced level candidates are now taking their examinations - international examinations, nonetheless - and have to suffer as much as even having to wait six months to re-take the exams if the hartals continue for a long period of time. issues like budget or caretaker government will not be solved with hartal. please attempt to put a stop to these strikes, as their ineffectiveness has been proven time and time again. it's about time our 'leaders' understand that. why should we be caught in the middle of a pointless power-play?
why this discrimination?
there is hardly any doubt that rmg sector is the highest foreign currency earner in bangladesh. nowadays in this sector industrial engineering department is playing a vital role to enrich its productivity. but it is an irony of fate that some so-called industrial engineers coming from different institutions are entering rmg sector having no knowledge about garment manufacturing. the engineers during their study only concentrate on heavy industrial machineries like those in the pharmaceuticals, cement factories and food & beverage factories. yet these engineers are being hired with huge salary. on the contrary, some highly experienced persons are being hired with low salaries. why is this discrimination? i would urge the government as well as bgmea to look into this matter seriously, if they really want to improve this sector.
replace the word 'shood'
i entirely agree with the letter by dr s n mamoon(13 june). in old days when there was no official or regulated banking word 'interest ' . what existed was 'usury' or 'shood', always with manipulative exploitation of the poor and needy and extreme hardship of those who took loans from unregulated lenders. similar transactions unfortunately still exist in england and other developed countries, believe it or not. this is what is forbidden in islam i.e. such exploitation and hardships; and 'karje-hasana' i.e. interest free loans to the needy in the community is encouraged. so, the word 'shood' is inapplicable to regulated banking context and the word 'interest' on capital, whether deposited or loaned from a bank.
reading films with great care
it was a fortunate event for me to participate in renowned film critique and writer john w. hood's workshop on 6-10th instant, titled “aesthetics of satyajit ray's movie: four classic films” at bangladesh film institute, dhaka. he wrote many books on indian/ bengali classic films. among them two are highly acclaimed. those are: the essential mystery: major filmmakers of indian art cinema and beyond the world of apu: films of satyajit ray. john hood's style of reading a film is not biased to any person, or any society. rather, he is much more devoted to the distinct art of films. to analyze ray's movies, he uses such an investigative approach which catches not only the context of the story but also the camera/cinematic elements, the filmmaker's emphasis and most importantly, the comparative analysis of ray's particular work to his other works.
marketing guru prof.philip kotlar
marketing guru prof philip kotlar visited bangladesh for the first time and made his deliberation on different aspects of marketing at different seminars in dhaka attended by marketing professionals, academicians, executives, company bosses who got rare chances to renew their ideas, innovativeness in marketing. he said “brand of a product is the name of the story of the product and marketing of the product is telling the story.” what an easy way to describe the two most complicated issues of marketing. like human being every product has a life cycle and unless it is given new lease of life by “entrepreneurship” the product will not exist any more. this is done by the brand manager of the product. with the new message of prof philip kotlar our local companies will give new lease of life to their products through new ideas and will start the culture of “branding” their product. prof. kotlar said some of our bangladesh garments are sold at “mark and spencer' without any brand name except it is tagged “made in bangladesh”, which is working temporarily as brand. had it been properly branded after continuous product development, diversification, product improvement and new production method and procedures, the product could have been sold in foreign market under strong footing of brand name and the country would have been highly benefited.
unstable edible oil market
it is now apparent that the powerful oil mafias are playing a cat and mouse game with the government by breaking the promises they made to the prime minister, that they will not increase the prices of oil during the month of ramadan. it is also heartening to know that the prime minister has also agreed to the importers' demand of slashing down the vat on oil from 15% to 10% in order to keep the price to tolerable levels. however, despite government's compromising attitude, the importers seem indifferent in their attitude and keep on increasing the prices whimsically showing their high handedness on the matter. the government must form a taskforce to see why the prices of oil are going up almost every day. government must also appoint more importers to break the monopoly of a few handful importers. it is also suggested that if the taskforce finds any anomalies or wrong doings in the business, let their license be revoked immediately. government should also direct the authorities concerned to monitor imports and mills that are refining oil strictly. moreover, govt. must assign substantial powers to the trading corporation of bangladesh and put them at the helm to quell the manipulators by importing oil in large scale.
our mohoram bhai
iron heart and endless hope are the two essential qualities of a hero. mohoram ali of crp is blessed with these two qualities and now getting ready for the world tour. he will prove that a wheel-chair user can also roam throughout the world. being his colleague, i am really proud. i honestly confess, i got tremendous mental support from him while writing any letter or article. he is very popular among all his colleagues because of his pleasant cheerful personality and a very simple lifestyle. his mission would definitely motivate all physically challenged people to change their attitude towards life. his adventure will make a history and definitely bring glory to our country. at present he needs some money to meet the cost. the affluent persons of this country should stand beside him. we all pray for his safe and successful mission.
decentralisation of dhaka
traffic jams have become an everyday event for us living in dhaka city. if one would like to go to motijheel from gulshan, s/he would have to wait for hours on a busy working day. this certainly has become an annoying problem. a few years ago i read an article in the daily star about decentralising dhaka's industrial sectors and making dhaka a complete residential city. i think this particular idea is very good indeed, as most of the developed countries around the world have decentralised capitals. i believe that considering the idea of a decentralised dhaka will be pretty much helpful for the general public. if the government does consider changing the location of different sectors and relocating them outside dhaka or to the suburbs of dhaka, we shall see reduction in traffic jams in our capital. if the government is confused about taking a particular decision regarding decentralisation, then it must hold a referendum. and a reduction of traffic jam will trigger a reduction of pollution as well.

maturity, if not statesmanship …
the comical irony of our politics is something of a stand-out. we are second to none perhaps in making issues out of non-issues and non-issues out of issues. in the process, political dynamics are caught up in circles as the garrulity of talks in constant motion tends to show a lack of creativity. we cannot simply think or work ourselves out of the box.
narri: a national platform for disaster risk reduction
although the americas were gravely affected by natural disasters in 2010, especially in terms of fatalities, the number of disaster victims remained by far the highest in asia. as much as 89.2% of global disaster victims in 2010 were from asia, compared to 5.6% from the americas (adsr, 2010). realising this, six international ngos in bangladesh (actionaid, concern universal, concern worldwide, islamic relief worldwide, oxfam-gb and plan bangladesh) with two technical partners (helpage international and handicap international) have come up with a consortium named national alliance for response and risk reduction initiatives (narri) with the financial assistance of the european commission humanitarian aid and civil protection to have a better output of the intervention by a good coordination among the partners and economies of scale. this initiative will also ensure that there is no overlap or duplication of any activity.
towards a knowledge society
