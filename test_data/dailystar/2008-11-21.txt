election drama must end
by the time this editorial appears in print, we expect that the issues centering on the holding of the december general elections will have been resolved to the satisfaction of the political parties and the caretaker government. it is our hope that the bangladesh nationalist party will have decided on a course of action that will take account of the long-term future of bangladesh's democracy. we have always believed that a principle of give and take should take centre stage in politics. a spirit of mutual accommodation should prevail in order for the national interest to triumph.
corruption in government health sector
the anti-corruption commission (acc) in its drive against institutional graft has revealed many a skeleton in the cupboards of public health care and family planning sectors. the scale and depth of corruption and malpractice encompassing 27 areas in different institutions under the health ministry that have been revealed make a sad tale of disservice to public healthcare. this is an eye-opener, if one were needed, to the deteriorating state of heath service in the country. this is not to say though, good, honest work is not done, but that seems rather outweighed by the price corruption exacts from the system.

those chaotic days
it will be an interesting exercise to go back to the period prior to 1/11. the political atmosphere was charged with extreme confrontation, injustice and intolerance. the bnp appointed justice aziz as chief election commissioner. the ec embarked upon the 'solemn duty' of election engineering. thirteen million false voters were registered and 500 crore of taxpayers' money was reportedly ill-spent by them. the scenario was set for sure victory of the bnp-jamaat alliance. driven to the wall, the awami league and other tormented and aggrieved political parties acted in the interest of themselves, country and common people. they formed an alliance and started agitation. the political sky was filled with high octane and we witnessed the rest of the events.
lesson for bangladesh
“after barack obama's win it is now statistically more probable for the child of a decent bangladeshi citizen to be president of the united states of america than to be prime minister of bangladesh.”
election and voters' list
the sky is gradually getting clear. the ec is not fully ready to hold the election . their prestigious voter listing with foreign aid has become a big hurdle now as reported in the media. right from the day one i was sceptical about the success of the preparation of electoral rolls and national id card. nobody could speak about its limitations due to the state of emergency. the foreign sponsors never told us about the problem we might face. they told us about "gold standard" of the voter listing with photos. not to speak of the nid, the voters' list with photos will not be available to all participants in the election. nobody knows what is in store for us and whether this voter list would become redundant when the election will be held (?) the ec is talking about their affidavit to the sc. but there is no real basis one can stand on.
morality and materialism
zakaria's letter on the subject published on 14 november is thought provoking. he quoted pope benedict's warning against materialism, and the extremist nature of modern culture, which was subsequently analysed, giving zakaria's interpretation of it.
mobile phones
nowadays cell phones are a part & parcel of modern communication system. people, obviously feel very easy to communicate with others, if necessary. in our country we are fortunate to have some very good names in mobile telecommunication sector. a number of mobile servicing points have also been established under the supervision of mobile companies. people are to visit these points if they find any trouble with their mobile. but the role of the most servicing points is simply not reliable. they make customers one way, but act quite differently. as a result, customers don't get proper service.
hide and seek!
the whole nation has been waiting for a non-violent and good enough election for more than two years. after the creation and reformation of the caretaker government(s), we considered genially that it would conduct a fair election. in the primitive stage, providentially, the government was stronger than the working political parties. but for unknown reasons, especially in the last few months, the government seems to be weaker or even helpless. besides, the bargaining power of the political leaders is increasing tremendously. they started to impose conditions, one after another. now the nation observes a 'hide and seek' game between the government's (implicit) spokesperson and party's representatives. it is not comprehensible to us what they want to make us understand, or really what's going on behind the screen. the stand of the parties should be clear; their agenda should be explicable to mass people.
unsuccessful ipo candidates
i appreciate the letter of mr. sikander ahmed, niketon, gulshan-1, dhaka published on 14 november 2008. being nrbs we have also applied for ipos, but we do not find any way to know our ipo status. the ipo result which is published shows some code nos. displayed by the computers such as lottery serial, bank-branch code, bank serial no. i could say it is incomplete as it is unable to meet the requirements of the applicants. obtaining information in any way is troublesome and time consuming even sometimes impossible if the authorities do not make it simple, easy and proper. allotment is uncertain; refund is unknown as if it were the mercy of the authorities to offer these services. i would like to suggest some points to the authorities concerned:
prices of bread & biscuit
a few months back price of wheat rose sharply in international as well as local markets. we experienced the same phenomenon in case of sugar and edible oil. these are the basic ingredients of making bread and biscuit.
news headlines
very often we find some deceiving headlines in some bangladeshi bangla newspapers.
parjatan and barisal
surprisingly and unfortunately, barisal a divisional headquarters and gateway to the south-- does not have a state owned parjatan hotel. there is hardly any hotel of international standard worth mentioning. the only hotel in the heart of the city is not up to the standard and lacks all the basic amenities. the importance of barisal has increased manifold over the last couple of years. the flow of travellers has increased significantly. the govt. circuit house always remains occupied and cannot cater to the needs of the growing number of visitors. it is really disappointing and a shame that the city is yet to have a modern hotel. the land of sher-e-bangla, ashwini kumar, poet jibananda das and poet mukund das is a land of mesmerizing and stunning beauty.
arsenal disappoints
arsene wenger was full of confidence that his team would do very well this year before the start of the epl, much to the doubt of millions of fans. chelsea, manchester united, liverpool and even a few mid-level clubs bought some very famous players to add to their club's strength, but arsene wenger decided to stick to his young team without any big star.
do politicians understand ?
our respected and venerable intelligentsia are screaming nearly for 24 hours on tv and writing hundreds of articles foretelling that we are at a crossroads; passing through a critical time; moving towards the darkest phase of our history etc. whenever my good luck prevails i take the opportunity to listen to some of the dire forewarnings about the bleakest future of our country.( i am not sarcastic but after listening to them for a while future seems to be really bleak to me). the problem is i have an uncanny feeling that whatever the host and guest of these talk shows predict, the people concerned--the politicians --do not bother at all. may be they do not have enough time to watch tv or read newspapers. but their deputy-cronies (cronies of cronies) should have informed them about what these respected people are trying to pass on .in the holy quran, allah has termed some people as deaf, dumb and blind since they would never take the right path. unfortunately, i find a lot of similarity between the people mentioned in the holy book and our politicians.

vital reforms ignored!
in his interview published in the daily star of november 18, sirajul islam chowdhury, professor emeritus of dhaka university, has urged reduction of the government tenure from 5 years (as it is now) to 4 years. this is a vital electoral reform that the caretaker government missed introducing during the interim period that it got since 1/11. this missing out is unfortunate, because this very simple and easy-to-implement reform could have had a very significant positive effect on the country's politics.
emerging priorities
bangladesh is no longer the marginal, poverty-ridden basket-case on the global economic stage as it perhaps was three decades ago. it is the 9th largest country in the world in terms of population, and the 58th largest economy in the world in terms of nominal gdp.
