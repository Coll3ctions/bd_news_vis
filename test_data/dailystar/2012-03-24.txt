the utte-rance of clearly unprintable words by members of parliament not only saddens but also disappoints because the august house of lawmaking is a place of dignified business by elected representatives of the people. so when parliamentarians stoop low there is cause for concern. is it time, therefore, to make concerted efforts to restore politics to its edifying status?

why poetry matters . . .
poetry is always about the human condition. or you could say it is the story of the individual in terms of a broader connection with the collective body of men and women going through the pains and passions on which life comes as an offering to them. yes, poetry is often a happy reflection of the turns and twists of the heart, of the rhythms which inject meaning into existence. more often than not, though, it is the breaking heart which reveals itself searingly through poetic imagery.
lasting impressions…
my ideas are not rushed when i account my thoughts on paper with a fountain pen. there is a balance in coordinating the pause and etching the final words on a page. i can be as extravagant or as stringent with words at my heart's will. today that art of penning seems to be on its way to complete oblivion. we live in a world of quick notes and abbreviated messages that leave behind many unsaid thoughts. the pen and ink are lost to time and have become collectibles. today's hurried age is an age of instant information, disposable sensibilities and thoughts abandoned midway.

an insulated literary voyage
february 2011the latest issue of kheya , a literary magazine with a fairly prolonged lifespan, was gathering dust on my shelf, being placed quietly underneath my recently bought english and a few bengali titles. as one corner of it uneasily jutted out, i pulled it out from under the stack. its cover, stripped of any glitz, is unadorned with a cluster of pale leaves and gives off gloomy light in the foreground of which is put a vertical portrait of the versatile author abdul mannan syed. he died in 2010. nearly half of the issue is dedicated to his life and works. as i kept browsing through the pages, i met writers and poets who are barely known to readers but seem to have taken up writing as a calling, as an end in itself.
semantics and the bangla language
why something is called aam (mango), something else called pata (leaf) and another boi (book) seemed to be arbitrary, accdidental, so long to linguists in the world. it was for long believed that people of a certain community accepted the meaning of these words as such. it seemed those people could have accepted the same words to mean something else like aam (mango) for books and so forth. modern linguists have discovered a common structure of sentences in all languages in the world. but to them all seems arbitrary beyond the structure of sentences.
the magic in poetry
the combination of thoughts, feelings and imagination tinged with appropriate light and shade go into making a real poem, a poem which evokes interest and provokes thoughts of readers.
