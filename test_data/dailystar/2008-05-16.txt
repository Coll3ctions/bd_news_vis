lgrd step on access to information
the local government and rural development (lgrd) ministry has taken an appreciable step towards providing citizens access to information in various local bodies operating under it. such a move is in consonance with democratic principles and practices everywhere and we believe the lgrd has only done what we in a democratic dispensation should have had much earlier. the draft provisions in question relate to the city corporations and municipalities, providing for citizens to ask for and be given information on issues of public interest. we would like to think that it is the first, positive step in what will be an expanding field of rights citizens will eventually come to enjoy. what matters now, in these early stages, is for the government to ensure that the measure is implemented in full without any bureaucratic or political impediments coming in the way.

our wobbling democracy

the rise of the rest: a new nationalism
global growth is also responsible for some of the biggest problems in the world right now. it has produced tons of money -- what businesspeople call liquidity -- that moves around the world. the combination of low inflation and lots of cash has meant low interest rates, which in turn have made people act greedily and/or stupidly. so we have witnessed over the last two decades a series of bubbles -- in east asian countries, technology stocks, housing, subprime mortgages, and emerging market equities. view the page sports

sizzling sanath
sachin tendulkar's return dominated most of the pre-match buzz but it was the eruption from sanath jayasuriya that mumbai toasted at the end of a comfortable nine-wicket win, their fourth in a row in the indian premier league, at the wankhede stadium on wednesday.
his best day
sachin tendulkar's return from injury was the biggest draw in the build-up to the clash between mumbai and chennai. he was expected to bring further luck to a team that had strung together a hattrick of wins after enduring four straight losses and his partnership with sanath jayasuriya at the top of the mumbai indians' batting line-up was a much awaited spectacle. however, he was completely overshadowed by his partner jayasuriya, whose scything blade cut chennai down swiftly.

fcc: half a century of excellence
thank you for the article “faujdarhat cadet college: half a century of excellence” by fakhruddin ahmed (the daily star internet edition, april 28, 2008). it's an interesting reminiscence and deserves appreciation. many of those who attended cadet colleges would agree that most of the points in the article reflect their own views. but those who didn't may argue that the success of various professionals and the country as a whole should not be judged by the excellence of a few cadet colleges attended mostly by the affluent and bright students (the name 'cadet college' may be a misnomer, since a college is known to offer degrees; even in neighbouring india similar institutions are known as sainik schools). it is the uplifting of the educational levels of general mass students - a challenging task indeed - that largely determines the image of bangladesh.
first identify, then buy
the cultivation of predatory fish is increasing day by day. almost all of the predatory fishes are exotic and carnivore in nature. they survive well in adverse conditions and the growth rate of these fish is higher than that of other fishes. so, fish farmers are cultivating predatory fish species. but some of the predatory fishes, especially piranha (serrasalmus niger), is very dangerous for living beings and also the aquatic environment and the ecosystem of the water body.
hasina and election
shiekh hasina has rightly said that she must contest in the upcoming election. hold a minute and remember when an ominous uncertainty was looming on the horizon right before 1/11 last year, people under the bold leadership of sheikh hasina thwarted the evil design.
israeli atrocities
a pathetic news report with a picture published in your daily on 29april drew my attention. the picture carried the news that a palestinian 15-month old boy, mussab, was killed along with his mother and three siblings by israeli tank fire outside their house in beit hanun, as they prepared to sit down for breakfast.
governance crisis
the 21st century is playing games with civilisation. crisis governance is the style of the decade. start with the superpower us. the theme for the coming presidential election is change; plus two new formats: a woman contesting; and a minority leader. add a big deciding factor: the no confidence in the usd, world's only global currency.

safe(!) drinking water
your daily of the 9th may carried a clear photograph of some criminals in the garb of businessman filling cans with tap water before sealing and labelling them as "safe drinking water". i think as a citizen i have the right to know what (if any) action the authorities concerned have taken against these killers. they are putting at stake the lives of thousands of citizens across the country for making profit.
why blame him?
recently, sheikh hasina was trying to prove dr. kamal hossain as black money holder simply because dr. hossain did not try to save the corrupt politicians. in fact, dr. kamal hossain is the greatest threat to the black money owners and if anybody calls him a black money holder, he/she is not serving the truth. do not forget that hasina's al and khaleda's bnp made bangladesh the number one corrupt country in the world. the corrupt prime ministers appointed corrupt ministers and high officials. politicians and a vested quarter are openly trying to free hasina and khaleda and their corrupt collaborators without any trial.
duration of this government
can you presume how long this caretaker government will go on? i can! no specific duration of this government is mentioned in any law. though the constitution has given the direction, but this government does not care for any constitutional order or provision.
technical education
technical education holds the key to the tangible development of a country. some 45 polytechnic and a few mono-technique institutes have been established for imparting technical education in diploma engineering level. it is a four-year course after ssc which is conducted by the collaboration of the directorate of technical education and bangladesh technical education board.
