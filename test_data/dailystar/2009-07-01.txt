budget implementation realities!
your correspondent's front-page headline report on june 13th about the huge task of budget implementation is a natural forethought that many of us feel! one wonders if the programme is too much for our conservative bureaucratic work mode usually tied up with endless red-tape, which is our norm of work! side by side, in the next column by tushir; there is the talk of a "supervisory body" being set up. will it add more red-tape, or curtail it? that is the fundamental issue. it all depends on the determination of our political government, whether they have the will to take pragmatic unpopular decisions when needed, and take it quickly; and hopefully not get mired down with too many "stay orders" and "injunctions" from the courts.

ashraful's foolish words!
mr ashraful, just after our team's loss to ireland you said that you needed to visit an eye-specialist. you did not accompany your team on returning home and stayed back. people say you thought it was a smart idea to cover your poor (silly) batting performance. they also say that it was nothing but a foolish, shameful excuse to avoid the media. let's analyse a few of your statements you made after coming back from your mission t20 world cup 2009:
toxic effect of vitamin - a
the nationwide programme of administering vitamin a & deworming drug in children created huge controversy about the safety of drugs in children. in the national dailies many reports said that children felt sick after taking medicines during the programme and some children even died soon after. meanwhile, a government committee investigated the incidence and claimed that no toxic effects were observed in children taking these medicines. this statement directly contradicts the reports published in the national dailies and broadcast by the electronic media. despite the claim of the government committee, the fear of the local peoples has not vanished yet. if this is not clearly removed from people's mind, similar programmes will not succeed in future. but the success of these programmes is crucial for improving the health status of the children. so it's very important now to go through a more extensive and creditable investigation so that the truth can be found out clearly.
drug addiction
presently, drug addiction is not only a national but also a global problem. this addiction gives rise to social crimes. when the addicts cannot afford to buy drugs, they commit many kinds of social crimes.
story of a new dawn
it is heartening to learn that aktel-the daily star “english in schools' programme has started its voyage towards ensuring a brighter future for the students across bangladesh through correct english learning in their own school premises. this is indeed a pragmatic step towards preparing our future generation in a competitive world of limited resources and opportunities.
daylight saving
it is good to see that like 70 countries of the world, bangladesh has also decided to advance the clock by one hour to save the day light in an effort to minimize the prevailing power crisis. it is definitely a historic decision. the countries which have adopted the dst (daylight saving) system could manage to save on power consumption and we also believe that our country will do the same.
big talks
the statement of state minister for science & technology that the rooppur nuclear power plant would hopefully start generating power in five years adding 1000 mw of electricity to the national grid is big news for the nation that is suffering from crippling power crisis. this would-be nuclear power plant was established about half a century ago on 260 acres of land at rooppur in pabna. even today i cherish the fond memory of participating in precession demanding the construction of this nuclear power plant during my student life at buet in late sixties. responsible ministers of this government are also telling that the first padma bridge at mawa and the second one at paturia will be completed within the next 3-5 years. the prime minister herself told that whatever it costs, the government would retrieve the country's complete river system. view the page international
