playing foul with the report?
we cannot but express our serious concern about the controversy over the share market scam probe report, whose fate, going by the reports in several newspapers including this one, has become very uncertain. it seems there are very well orchestrated moves afoot to not only divert attention from the report but also to damn the report as well as the head of the probe committee by deliberately discrediting him and questioning the veracity of the findings.
middle east ferment
large swathes of the middle east remain in ferment. the newest sign of that reality comes from syria, where president bashar al-assad has assured syrians that the emergency laws in place for nearly half a century will be lifted within a week. the gesture is not spontaneous but is a reaction to the gathering restiveness in the country. in egypt, the move by the present rulers to detain and question deposed president hosni mubarak demonstrates the willingness of the authorities to heed popular demands for substantive progress to democracy. egypt remains a work in progress. view the page sports

the stock market scam

has crime really gone down?
my heart bleeds every time i pick up the daily star and read news on rape, murder, muggings, torture, maiming, acid-throwing and an endless list of other crimes. nowhere in bangladesh is safe, though the home minister and police top brass claim. the home minister even has the audacity to tell us that crime has decreased since awami league assumed power. isn't this claim making us completely fools? bangladesh's well-wisher sir frank peters demonstrated inarguable logic when he questioned on our behalf how authorities could claim crime had decreased when the majority of crimes were not even being recorded as the police demand baksheesh.
threat by the rickshaw-van pullers!
i have been writing to this newspaper for years to influence our thoughts towards the danger of rickshaws. we did not pay proper attention to this epidemic of a problem sooner. now perhaps, it is almost out of control. rickshaws must be controlled immediately before the pullers/owners threat and force everyone in this country to ride rickshaws.
reduce doctor's fee
at present doctors are taking taka 400-500 as fee from each patient. it's impossible to pay such amount to the doctors by day labourers, rickshaw pullers, garment workers and other low income people. there is no treatment in the government hospitals. most of the specialised doctors are government doctors. doctors see the patients in his private chamber in the morning, in the lunch break and in the afternoon. but the main business starts in the evening and it finishes at around 11 p.m. to see a patient, a doctor takes at the most 4-5 minutes. doctors are just running after money. some doctors visit around 50 patients a day but they enlist only 10 patients.
crush the criminals
it is unpleasant but worthwhile to note that mugging and murder in different parts of the capital for a couple of months have been on the rise. the reports in the dailies from various sources say that several killing incidents in the hands of the miscreants have occurred in last few months. it also points fingers at the failure of the police forces that are liable for providing people with security. the most heart-rending fact is that a number of law enforcers are known to be involved in favouring the criminals for their personal interest. we hope the law and order maintaining authorities should take the occurrences into their consideration and award the criminals with the utmost punishment in order to hold the wheel of crime.
is it 'customer service'?
the last page photograph of the daily star published on 7 april of the bus stopping to let off passengers; raises this interesting question. yes, it is illegal for parking, as the sign states; but stopping for one or two minutes, to pick up or let off passengers; is in that sense does not mean parking, by definition of the word! surely stopping on the road for a minute or two; to pick up or drop passengers; is in that sense not 'parking' it could be called as stopping for 'customer service'! logically it can not therefore be called 'illegal' or 'prohibited' as stated in the sign; which states 'no parking'
daughters are privileged
according to islamic law a daughter gets half the inherited property that a brother owns from their father. by this law the female actually gets more than a brother. if a father died keeping one lakh and a fifty thousand taka for his single son and a daughter, the islamic law suggests that the son will get taka one lakh and the daughter will get taka fifty thousand. now, if the daughter wishes to save her share, she can. but his brother has to bear all the family expenses. also, the brother has to pay denmohor to his wife from his share. while his sister will once again receive denmohor from his husband. again, islamic law imposes economic liability to the shoulder of a male and that's why he is given double the amount of a female so that he can bear that liability better.
father's unkind act!
as reported by agence france-presse (afp) a 37-year old australian man named arthur freeman has killed his four-year-old daughter darcey by throwing her from melbourne's west gate bridge into the river on january 29, 2009 amid a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife over their three children. what an unkind and brutal act! reportedly the day was supposed to have been darcey's first day at school. her two brothers aged six and two had witnessed their sister drowning. this is the curse of broken marriage. the man has been convicted of murdering her daughter by an australian court and jailed for life.meanwhile i would like to suggest the australian authority to erect a pillar near the bridge in the memory of darcey inscribing the unkind act of her heartless father.
why show cause?
recently jahangirnagar university authority show caused a teacher to explain why action should not be taken against him under 'ju staff efficiency and disciplinary act' because of his write up against irregularities in the administrations of the country's public universities and their vice-chancellors, including the ju vc in a national daily. around 60 teachers of the university already formed a human chain on the campus to denounce the show cause notice. our country is a democratic country. each and every bangladeshi has the right to express his/her opinion, then why a university's associate professor have to show cause to the authority on his opposite opinion?
when schools become obstacle
recently, south breeze school has opened a junior section just at the entrance point from satmasjid road to zikatola, renting a private house. many cars are parked near the school thus blocking the main road. as a result heavy traffic congestion takes place everyday and compels commuters to sit on the rickshaws or other mode of transportations for hours to get to the satmasjid road. as an old resident of zikatola, i have never experienced such congestion until the school was established. i believe it is the duty of the city corporation to consider many aspects before issuing a school license on a busy intersection. it is my request to the school authority as well as other concerned authority to shift the school from that place considering its importance and the hazards that the commuters face everyday.
abide by holy sayings
our dearest rasul (pbuh) says, âpeople can hardly fulfill their acts due to the short of time before the destruction of the earth.â it is indeed one of the signs of the 'kiamat'.
interim election
the chief of bnp very often demands interim election in bangladesh. she knows it very well that her demand has no merit because the present government is in firm footing with 3/4th majority and no such interim election ever happened in the past in bangladesh so the only way to remove this government is through âno-confidenceâ motion in the parliament. why is she then talking about interim election in the country? how does she know that if there is an interim election the people will vote for her? instead of demanding an interim election she should campaign for a free and fair election next time. only free and fair election will bring permanent democracy in bangladesh.

an employee interacts more with his office colleagues than that of his family member during his service tenure. so office atmosphere is an important factor for sound living of an employee. obviously it should be congenial. in reality, in most of the offices irrespective of government or private, congenial atmosphere does not prevail. the power exercising positions must be knowledgeable. otherwise, misuse of power creates antagonistic environment in the office. the top boss of the office must be unbiased. again, there are some people in every office who scandal mongers. they should be detected and trained up professionally. if only a colleague would be considerate to his other colleague, the hostile situation in any office can be turned to friendly situation.
musa ibrahim in school
a few days ago, musa ibrahim, the first bangladeshi to reach the summit of mount everest, visited the aga khan school, dhaka as a guest speaker for a 7th grade physics project. it was undoubtedly a remarkable experience to meet him in the school premises. the man who actually conquered the highest peak of the world had inspired and encouraged the students to challenge themselves. as a guest speaker, he had transformed the monotonous and tedious school hours into an exhilarating, interactive and engaging learning opportunity. i strongly perceive that if schools provide their students with opportunities like this, they will be more motivated to pay attention to their studies as well as to develop our whole country.
bangladesh in australian news
rarely does bangladesh get a mention in the news and on radio and tv talk shows in australia, except in the form of political unrest and embarrassing law and order issues. like a breath of fresh air recently the subject was different, positive, and literally had everyone here talking about it.
modesty and character assassination
by any definition, the ruling government has presided over a character assassination of dr yunus. our politicians indulge in character assassination as standard operating procedure. now, suddenly, the government is concerned about the possible character assassination of its wealthiest supporters. what false modesty! who are they trying to fool? simply being able to say something at a press conference does not make it true. it seems our politicians think that the public lives in another country with no knowledge of what actually goes on in bangladesh! the public knows the ugly truth but the public is, as usual, helpless in the face of the cabals that have a stranglehold on our politics.

pahela baishakh in our urban context
the first day of the bengali new year, pahela baishakh, drew a sea of people on to the streets of dhaka. it was people, men and women of all age groups -- youths, parents with children, middle-aged men and women -- walking all around wearing traditional dresses. women were clad in white sarees with red border, while men wore punjabi, pyjamas and chappal (sandals) or nagra shoes. but they were loitering as if aimlessly under a mostly gloomy sky. the sky overcast with cloud was a blessing in disguise, because on previous other pahela baishakhs the scorching sun would beat down mercilessly on the celebrants.
corruption: the deadly bug
corruption is a death-trap for any nation. it does the same thing to a nation as does a bug to timber. it eats the vitals from within and makes it a hollow shell ready to crumble into dust any moment. bangladesh has surely been in the death grip of that vicious bug for long and now seems to have reached a stage where from it might seem almost impossible for any government to save it from total collapse.
