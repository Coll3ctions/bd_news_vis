religion based politics
thanks to the daily star for one of the lead news reports about the huji political party today. we are really concerned about the ctg's attitude towards religion based politics. many might not agree with me, because this particular ctg has no popular or constitutional mandate to govern the country the way they are doing, there is every possibility that they would prefer to support religion based politics in bangladesh for reasons beyond their choice.

party registration
liton's front page headline news on september 28, about political parties' registration should never have been an issue. the ec must be firm, and draw the line somewhere, and adhere to it strictly. it now appears that the holding of election which is truly democratic is beyond them! mixing of religion with secular political activities must be avoided at all costs.
