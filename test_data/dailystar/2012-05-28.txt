assaulting teachers

stop sick politics!
no need to explain why people consider present politics as 'sick politics.' people are frustrated over the politics of confrontation. every sector like education, health, police, judiciary and civil administration are on the verge of ruin because of partisan appointments. presently, forced disappearances have become a grave concern among people. it has also become an issue of political confrontation between the ruling party and the opposition. the opposition blames the government for the disappearances of their leaders. on the other hand, the ruling alliances blame the opposition for intentionally making it a political issue. recently rashed khan menon and hasanul haque inu, two lawmakers of the ruling alliance, made a valuable comment that jamaat-e-islami had started the politics of killing and disappearance during the liberation war, which later got institutionalised by the law enforcers under different governments. no doubt, people want to get rid of this sick politics, but how?

recruitment in bangladesh railway
bangladesh railway is recruiting around 12000 people in different categories of job. this recruitment should not be like the previous one where millions of taka were taken as bribes from dishonest job seekers. i hope this time only the qualified and honest people will be selected for the job. i would request the railway ministry to conduct the whole process of recruitment online so that everything remains transparent. all the high officials of the railway department including the general manager should be vigilant so that no one can take a single taka from the job seekers. it is known to all that railway is the most corrupt sector in bangladesh. if this corruption cannot be curbed, then the day is not far when railway communication will not exist in bangladesh.
