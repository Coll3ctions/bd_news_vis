tsunami warnings
there is a palpable sense of relief all over the country that the tsunami threat has passed. one hardly needs speculating on the immensity of the damage to life and property as also to the environment it might have caused. we thus consider ourselves fortunate that the worst did not come to pass and life in the coastal regions has remained unaffected.

more than a grocery store
for the first time in many years nobody irked the businessmen of this country like the national board of revenue did, and it seemed that at some point of time it had put ants in their pants. the nbr men sniffed around asking a lot of questions, and the businessmen didn't like it. they got upset for being squeezed within a short time for the juice which was gathered in thirty-six years. then of course, one can't rule out the possibility of harassment. the tax collectors are famously known for their absence of scruples. given a yard of authority, they can go a mile on arrogance.
limited presidential options
in an article, "presidential options," on june 28, i took the liberty of saying: "the acid test for pervez musharraf will come on oct 8, when the present chairman jcsc and vcoas retire. the president has to take 'the calculated risk' of appointing a full-time coas pakistan army, advancing the date will be a sign of good faith and will go a long way in defusing the present situation. thereafter, the aim should be the conduct of free and fair elections, it making least difference as to who the genuinely elected representatives of the people are and which party they belong to as long as they have sworn allegiance to pakistan before entering the electoral process. unless governance of the country is in the hands of those chosen by the people, this will eventually descend into the violent hands of those who control the streets." view the page sports

the narrow export basket of bangladesh is likely to face stiff competition as the eu restrictions on rmg export from china will be withdrawn from day one of 2008 and us restrictions from january 1, 2009. in this new competitive scenario, sustaining the current high export growth will be an uphill task in the coming years. therefore, adequate and special dispensation to our textile industry should be given to meet the demand of the country's garment exporters, thereby avoiding import of yarn and fabrics from competitors.

lux superstar 2007
it was fascinating to watch the competition sitting thousands of miles away from home, and get an idea of how a positive social transformation is taking place in bangladesh. thanks to all the participants, especially the five finalists. the final session of judgment was an iq test, and well done by all respondents.
top two
sheikh hasina and khaleda zia have caused irreparable damage to our country. with their arrogant and corrupt practices, they have destroyed our education, culture, social harmony, economy, law and order, religion, environment everything! nothing escaped the wrath of these two ladies and their corrupt parties. they both had plenty of time to apologise to our people. they didn't. so now it is time for them to pay the hard way.
piranha!
it has been reported in the press that the carnivorous piranha fish is being cultivated in ponds and sold in open market in some parts of our country by calling it rupchanda as it looks like rupchanda! piranha causes serious damage to aquatic life and the environment.
du flare-up
it is very clear that the dhaka university teachers, who are said to be highly responsible members of our society, are the key people who added fuel to the fire. the government solved the problem very promptly, but the teachers led the students and sent them to the path of violence.
an appeal to chief adviser
at the international level, bangladesh is today known as one of the countries with heaps of records of human rights violations. as an unfortunate nation, our country has suffered tremendously with lots of political killings and torture of opponents, frequent use of police and other law enforcing agencies in victimisng innocent people.
intel’s assistance
it has been reported that the top microprocessor and semiconductor chip manufacturer of the world, the intel corporation, will assist bangladesh with tk 700 crore in information technology education.
english medium education
internationalisation is a mandatory way of developing a country. for this, learning english is necessary. needless to mention, the "english medium schools" are doing a great job in this regard. but these students have to take equity certificate of their o and a level for admission to medical and engineering university or colleges. this is not fair, to say the least.
du reopening
the vcs of the public universities met the educational adviser. we, the students, kept our fingers crossed that something positive might come out of this meeting. but the du vice chancellor did not hint at resuming our academic activities very soon. now, you know how we are trapped.
power conservation initiative
an eye-opening and pioneer news report came in a local daily (sept:05) that agsuail, a village in pabna, has taken the lead in bangladesh by introducing the use of energy-saving lamp at the initiative of the local reb. this is momentous news of national significance and a step in the right direction, given our acute shortage of power everywhere. it should be introduced all over bangladesh. it was reported that the village earlier consumed 27.5kw, using normal filament lamps. by using compact fluorescent lamps(cfl) there will be a saving of over 20kw!. assuming that the average bulb was of 40 watt, it represents that nearly 700 (seven hundred) filament lamps were replaced by cfls.
british council
british council is an eminent organisation which aims to help the students of bangladesh to get acquainted with the english language. it also provides scholarship for meritorious students who can't afford to study in foreign universities to acquire a better degree. british council acts as a helping hand to solve these problems and eventually, its contribution in bangladesh is an eye-striking one. besides, being a helping aid, it has well-equipped library facilities and every year some courses are organised to give tips about good english spelling, learning and most importantly, free-hand writing. but the astonishing thing is that it has branches in dhaka, sylhet and chittagong but not in rajshahi. rajshahi, as a divisional town, is regarded as the city of education. ruet, rajshahi university and the outer campuses of different private universities substantiate the claim. as a result, thousands of students are missing these facilities. english medium schools like paramount, blue bell, etc. could have made excellent progress if there was a little back-up from british council. british council can also develop those who want to take teaching as a profession so that they can teach the o-level and a-level students. the o-level and a-level exams are usually taken in teachers' training college (ttc) but it would have been better if there was a permanent office of british council. i, as a student of an english-medium school, would request the british council authorities to consider my point.
anti-corruption drive
first, i must mention that there is a need to crack down on corruption, and people rightly supported the anti-corruption drive. but what is most important is to establish institutional reform at every level so that nobody is able to indulge in corruption. the most corrupt areas as we know are thana and local government bodies. the present caretaker government's beginning was ok, but now after 8 months what we are witnessing is terrifying as in the name of anti-corruption drive they are actually hitting at the bnp and the awami league. sensible people know that arresting begum khaleda zia and hasina with most of the former lawmakers will not eradicate corruption. of course, we need reform in the parties and the minds of the politicians.
tax on saving instruments
a mere trifle on the du campus that was subsequently made to spread over the entire country is a matter of grave concern for all. it has been confirmed by several reliable sources at the highest level that within hours crores of taka were poured in to fan the fire for political gains. this is the type of money, the nbr and acc need to track down and take appropriate action. instead, what we see is that the middle and lower class people are under the continuous threats of the nbr.
bnp's demand
the latest demand by the bnp is outrageous and ridiculous, and certainly, reveals the hero-worshipping and leader-centric culture that is endemic in the party. the bnp's new secretary general has made it clear in a press conference that the party will not sit with the ec, until and unless their leader begum zia is released, a leader who is charged with some serious crimes affecting national revenue. the very fact that a political sycophant could come up with such a bizarre, preposterous and outlandish demand, does suggest yet again how sick and corrupt our political parties are. the word “shame” is alien to them! after so much talk for so many months (about minus-2, familocracy, reform etc) , we are still observing the same old leader-centrism, which was the very reason the country fell to pieces.
build an overbridge
the mirpur road, one of the busiest highways in dhaka, is not only a route of daily communication but also links the two sides of dhanmondi, mostly the school areas. due to the location of their residences and lack of transportation, a great number of children and their guardians are forced to walk to their schools and back home. many of them have to cross the mirpur road almost every day to go to their schools and return home.
unemployed
i passed bsc in electrical and electronic engineering 6 month ago from a public engineering university. but still i am unemployed because i have no connections!
suspension of ru teachers
i am deeply disturbed by the news that the ru authorities have ordered the suspension of the teachers arrested on suspicion of instigating the violence on campus. the investigation is currently under way and the suspension slapped on the arrested teachers in such haste smacks of very harsh treatment by the current university administration. view the page international

balancing rice price
rice is our staple food, and it has always been a tough job balancing its price in a way that neither deprives the growers nor pummels the urban consumers. ours is an agrarian economy and rice is the mainstay of the total agricultural output. as a result, the slightest of variations in rice price has a cascading effect on the overall economy.
ex-pats in the country's development
as an expatriate bangladeshi, i very closely follow developments in bangladesh through bangladeshi tv channels (which are now available throughout the world), newspapers on the internet, and regular visits to my home country. a news item which caught my attention recently was the coverage in the daily star of a high level government and business leaders' dialogue held on september 5. while i am in general agreement with what ca dr. fakhruddin ahmed and finance advisor mirza azizul islam had to say, i was quite fascinated by some of the bold ideas put forward by general moeen u. ahmed.
sadeque bhai as i knew him
mr. a.s.h.k. sadeque, former civil servant and education minister, was my sadeque bhai. he passed away on the september 9th. this reality is difficult for me to grasp. memories of him are vivid, and all attributes of this remarkable man come to mind. perhaps this testifies to the quality of the man himself. view the page environment
forest crisis and wildlife conservation
the iucn regional conservation forum being held (10-14 sept) in nepal brings together conservation experts from across asia to talk about protected areas and biodiversity. in bangladesh, as the forest cover has fallen in recent decades, the quality and health of our system of protected areas -- created initially as refuges for wildlife -- has suffered even more grievously. in this writeup, ishtiaq u ahmad and philip j decosse identify the evolving challenges to conservation and propose a practical roadmap for harmonizing national wildlife conservation needs with the aspirations of rural populations living in and around protected areas.
