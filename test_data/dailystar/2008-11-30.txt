rio conference on children's exploitation
the third world congress against sexual exploitation of children has ended in rio de janeiro on a decisive note. this much becomes obvious from the declaration adopted at the conference. it is to be noted that a strong team from bangladesh took part in the congress and indeed made a number of points about the theme that needed to be debated in the larger interest of children not only in bangladesh but elsewhere as well. what the congress has done is simply to focus on the many ways in which the rights of children are systematically violated, to a point where they are not allowed to become part of creative society.

the 26th of november
the power of fear is immense and intense. it is axiomatic that evil of the magnitude perpetrated in mumbai, through a collusion between pakistan-based hate-filled terrorist organisations like lashkar-e-tayyaba and indian fifth columnists will have a direct impact on the political mood of the nation. it is inevitable that the mood will reflect on polling in an election season. but we need to understand the nuances of this impact carefully. the hyperinflation of knee-jerk analysis can be toxic to the truth. view the page sports

hussey the rock
michael hussey is probably the world's most organised cricketer and in an australia team so unsettled that they haven't picked the same xi in consecutive tests for 11 matches, his reliability is invaluable. hussey has become so good at stabilising potentially worrying situations that he could get a job straightening the leaning tower of pisa.

sources of power generation
from various reports and comments it is clear that nuclear generation of power is not a safe option for our country. this leaves natural gas or coal as only available prime fossil fuel sources (not requiring import from abroad), which although polluting can nevertheless be used with refinements. however, the supply of these fuels are also not unlimited and in a few years they would also run out.
champion in adulteration!
the businessman of bangladesh are said to be the champion in food adulteration. most of the businessmen of our country are unscrupulous. they have no conscience and morality. the main objective of the business is maximization of profit. in order to achieve their prime objective they often choose the shortest path, which is unethical as well as illegal. an unscrupulous businessperson can make money by killing innocent people. business ethics may be found in the book but in reality we are far away from this practice. according to the weinrich h & koontz h “business ethics is concerned with truth and justice and has a variety of aspects such as the expectations of society, fair competition, advertising, public relations, social responsibilities, consumer autonomy, and corporate behaviour in the home country as well as abroad.” but what we find in reality is odious business practices. no one is concerned about consumer's health or welfare. one can easily find the redundancy of proof about my statement if we look around the following matters.
maradona's debut as coach
football legend diego maradona had a fine debut as the coach of argentina's national team when argentina won a friendly game against scotland at hampden park, scotland -- 1-0. interestingly, maradona scored his first international goal against scotland at the same venue in 1979 when he was 18-year old. argentina won that match 3-1 and the current scotland coach george burley played against maradona in that game. maradona fielded a strong line up based on all europe based players except one player, emiliano papa who plays for velez sarsfield in argentina's domestic league. maradona appointed liverpool's hard working midfielder javier mascherano as the team's new captain. it seems that the most capped argentina veteran, javier zanetti of inter milan, italy (he is the captain of italian giants inter milan for the last few years), won't lead argentina under maradona.

politicians and pledges
with the election date drawing nearer, we see the politicians pledging to curb terrorism, establishing peace in society, even wanting to do everything for the betterment of the countrymen if their respective parties are voted to power.
pmr departments
i admire “bangladesh association of physical medicine & rehabilitation” (bapmr)'s proposal (source: the daily star; 16-11-08) for establishing pmr departments, thereby increasing the number of physiotherapists. i very much agree to and request the respective authorities to implement the recommendations . yes, all the medical colleges should have the department. the necessity of respective manpower production, that is, physiotherapists is increasing. it is essential for our country due to gradual increase in the number road traffic accidents.
talk show experts
just tune in to a deshi tv channel, you will find them sometimes at loggerheads and sometimes trying hard to salvage the country and the people from all junks and pains overnight. they are the talk show experts, the jack of all trades. they delve into the faults, mistakes, lacks and lapses of this caretaker government, meticulously analyse them, severely admonish the advisers and the election commissioners and then put up their valuable advices what should have been done but not what should be done next. they never tread the path by mistake even where this government has done commendable jobs. who are they? not all but few vainglorious media persons, retired government officials and ruminant politicians who stood hat in hands before the party governments in power and their 'netries". they did not do any such thing at that time when the party governments openly committed big blunders like corruption, terrorism, plunders and all evils, rather they endeavoured tooth and nail to prove them clean and even. the consequences were seen by the people of the country and of the world.
banning hartal
while talking with me, a turkish friend at du very recently expressed his concern about the possible misery of hartal, which was a terrible experience for him when he came across this as a first year student at this university. i believe, the people, during the reign of emergency, also have forgotten this phenomenon.
lawyers and police
recently i had the opportunity to observe the debate between two lawyers in a court. one of them was trying to save an innocent man and another was trying to prove the innocent man to be a criminal. fortunately, the magistrate issued bail to that innocent man and made him free temporarily. i am 100% sure that the lawyers and police knew that the person who was in jail was innocent. this incident raised lots of questions in my mind. such as 1) should police be given the power to arrest anybody just on the basis of allegation or suspicion? 2) if yes then can we live in an independent country with freedom of honest people?, 3) should not our government take any action against those police personnel who arrest innocent people after getting bribe from a criminal? 4) should not the lawyers who try to prove an innocent person guilty face questions regarding their professional ethics?
pinki and sharna
pinki and sharna are two friends from their childhood. they were born and brought up in the same environment and same culture. they face similar social problems almost every moment because they are girls. girls of their age are married normally at minor age in their society. but they don't want to marry at this stage, rather they want to continue higher studies with the expectation of being famous scientists. now sharna and pinki are classmates at the khairunnessa memorial technical school at ikrail located in a river island (char) of bangladesh and they are supposed to appear at the s.s.c (vocational) board final examinations under bangladesh technical education board in march 2009. they are students of pre-engineering group under civil engineering courses. both are exceptionally talented and meritorious. in recent (test) exams, both of them have obtained equal marks occupying the first position.
what are they doing?
i am an inhabitant of north halisahar, ctg. i got my national id card in the month of august before ramadan. i found some mistakes over there & gave it back for correction. after one month, i went for collecting my id from the board office but i was told that it was yet not prepared.
an appeal to govt
ninety-five percent people of this country are suffering due to inflation, growth reduction and political instability.
drug quality control
your staff correspondent's eye opening report on the matter published on 19 november, particularly the response from the manufacturer, clearly reflects the relaxed attitude to quality control of the manufacturer!
icu unit
a hospital cannot be called truly a hospital without the presence of some basic units in it. the intensive care unit (icu) is one such inherent but basic part of a hospital. our medical college hospitals do not have this life-saving unit. it is quite explicable that the government cannot provide everything for free where a big population of the country does not pay taxes. but setting up an icu at medical college hospitals is a demand of time. many local private hospitals in bangladesh now have the know-how and they can help training nurses and technicians to run an icu.
indian visa
i went to apply for indian visa in the indian embassy at dhaka. it was a unique experience. the applicants' line for visa extended from the embassy gate of road.137, gulshan to the end of shooting club and beyond. thousands of people thronged for visa. i interviewed a few. most of them were young people in the thirties and from normal middle class background. at first they lined up at the bridge-head near 'arong' outlet in gulshan -tejgaon link road from the previous day evening. after midnight police allowed them to 'run' and again line up near the shooting club. during this procedure the 'dalals' or brokers reigned supreme .they occupied most of the front positions. the visa section opens from 8:00am and they accept applications till 12:00. brokers sold the places later on. the asking rate varies from one thousand to two hundred taka depending on the place and time of sale. police is also a party to this business. the brokers, guards and police work in tandem in sale of places. there are three lines- for women, 'specials' and hapless 'men'. preference is given to the women and 'special' applicants. every day at least a few hundred 'men' return without being successful. as demand is more than the supply some 'corruption' is bound to happen. a solution needs to be found. view the page international
