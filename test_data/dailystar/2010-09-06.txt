it has never been a matter of surprise that a large number of government as well as private schools and madrasas at the primary and secondary levels have operated at a poor level. apart from the quality of education imparted in such institutions, there have been the questions relating to the basics which underpin their working. these worries are now once again borne out by a survey carried out by young people themselves. the child parliament, in association with save the children australia, informs us of the pitiable conditions in which 512 schools across the country happen to be trapped. one could be sure that there are hundreds of similar schools in bangladesh. these 512 schools simply happen to be symbolic of the bad way in which we educate our children. view the page sports

education sector
i would like to thank the pm for taking the steps to make a digital bangladesh. to implement your dream for digital bangladesh at first you should recruit skilled teachers at school and college level for computer learning . at college level every teacher is skilled in their respective subject without computer. in computer, a teacher can come from other subjectst after doing a three-month course or one year diploma in computer. it is funny that in other subjects, honours and master's degrees are must in the respective t but in case of computer it is not applicable. most of the lecturers recruited for computer are not experts.

pakistan cricket
pakistan cricket has been going through some turbulence for several years now. they haven't won a rubber since 2006. after the retirement of skipper inzamam-ul-haq who was apparently the last of the mohicans the team became imbalanced. leadership kept changing and whenever there was a sign of consistency players' internal brawl ruined it. when these miseries were not good enough terrorists took over by attacking the sri lankan cricket team, which cost pakistan the right to co-host the upcoming world cup.
joint power project
two 1320mw coal fired power plants are to be set up in chittagong and khulna. that is indeed good news for the power starved people of bangladesh.
poor israelis
i feel sorry for the poor israelis who have been driven so far from him by their pride and stubbornness of heart. it is so easy to harden your heart and hate and curse those who curse you and those you love. but the lord way is not one of anger and hatred. he will use him to judge this people and cause them to forcibly live in peace with their neighbours. the ways of this world are not the lord ways, but he will use them to institute law and order and bring an end to oppression.
global warming
global warming is one the biggest problems the world is facing these days. the solution is only planting trees . still bangladesh can do so as many trees are cut down for use and many houses which once consisted of huge trees are dismantled and apartments are built.

pakistan's cheating
good things happen when the souls express them. similarly, when cheating tendency is deep-rooted in a society -- all forms of evil express on a constant basis. (as feared by many) after the long history of association with match-fixing, doping, murder probe (2007 world cup), injury feigning, ball-biting, ball altering, betting, pitch damaging, religious exhibition during games, organised crimes, corruption and cover-ups -- now a new 'spot-fixing' cheating allegations are investigated by british police against visiting pakistan test cricket team in england. secretly filmed footage exposed one british-pakistani bookmaker majeed - who has 'managed' pakistani cricket players over two years - accepting £150,000 (bangladeshi taka 16 crore) from a undercover journalist for guaranteeing 'no balls'. the allegations are related to 'no balls' delivered by mohammad amir and mohammad asif. icc (international cricket council) and scotland yard are now investing the matter. no players or team officials have been arrested yet.
for a better society
“only the wisest and stupidest of men on earth never change.”-confucius. and as bangladesh is neither the wisest nor does it possess the desire to prove itself the stupidest it has ultimately taken the initiative to bring in some change and do some good to the country at last. and that very initiative is the introduction of 'e-governance' concept.
overhead cables
recently, bangladesh ranked 88th amongst 100 best countries of the world. is it a joke or fun? i cannot guess. if we look above our head, across the dhaka city roads, we shall see a cables jungle, electric 440/1100 kv lines above the roads. we came to know through ds that about 600 cable tv operators and 92 isps are using heavy weight of black wires illegally in the poles. we urge and hope that the authorities would take action to remove the wires and also to avoid tragedies like nimtoli.

bleak future
the fact that only two out of some 702 chemical shops and stores in the old parts of dhaka have valid fire safety licences represent the decades long mismanagement of the city by the previous governments. the present government has got to free the city from all kinds of congestions. to do this some ministries must be relocated outside dhaka. the lakes and the rivers outside dhaka must be freed from unauthorized occupation. all the residential areas should be drastically freed from commercial activities to avoid fire hazards. to evade the cataclysmic destruction of city in case of earthquake, all badly-constructed buildings should be demolished immediately.
shining government
we all should come to know that three of our national leaders bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, shaheed president ziaur rahman & alhaj hussain muhammad ershad while in power dealt more with the citizens and could discharge their duties on practical grounds based on proper verifications and thus the overall citizens could see the progress in the infrastructural works.
digital parliament
all laws are framed in parliament. laws are passed in parliament by voice vote. simply by hearing the sound coming from the floor the ho'nable speaker declares three times that ha/na joijukta hoyachey. that means sound is the ultimate medium or indicator for passing a law in parliament. in a turbulent or a noisy situation in parliament, a common scene, it is difficult to hear the sound correctly creating confusion in making decisions. in this day of modern digital world, an old system based on hearing sound for taking a vital decision for passing law is not tenable.
ban on veil
very recently a law has been passed prohibiting the compulsory use of veil in public places, i am concerned when a ban is imposed on the use of veil in this country whose majority of the population are muslims, while the honorable prime minister and the leader of the opposition are both women and are muslims too.
misery of an ordinary man
last friday a group of policemen came to my residence at gopibagh, dhaka for arresting me. they said that a cheating case was filed against me with rajbari magistrate court (though my home district is at chandpur) and accordingly the court issued warrant against me. i was not at my house at that moment of police raid. my wife who is a gynaecologist was surprised and panicked to see the aggressive attitude of the policemen. however, as per the information of the police officer i have collected a copy of complaint petition from rajbari. surprisingly, i do not know the complainant and other accused of that case. policemen again came to my residence to arrest me but i was at my office at that time. then i have talked to a lawyer of rajbari regarding bail. he says, “rajbari court may not grant you bail well you should go to the high court.” but the regular work of the high court is closed now due to one-month-long vacation and these sorts of anticipatory bail-cases do not get priority in the vacation-chamber-judge. as a result, i am moving under an arrest warrant and it disturbs my normal life in the office and in the house as well. who can help me and where should i go?
people and leaders
how long our politicians will continue playing the game of making laws? it is now an established practice that, one party while in power makes law according to their will and later on when their opposition comes to power reverses it. is it the duty of politicians? clearly, it is a sign of divide, which is very much unfortunate. the proverb goes 'united we stand, divided we fall'. there might be difference of opinion, but it should not be so fatal leading divisions. people expect politicians as their friends. politicians should consider them as the servants of the people. delay in realizing this truth by our politicians shall delay our progress.
bcl activities in ru
activists of the bcl in ru are committing many crimes on the campus like throwing a student from the upper floor of a building, inserting nails in legs of students. law enforcers are not taking adequate measures about these crimes resulting in their continuation. bcl are perpetrating these crimes using the backlash against the shibir. it seems that they are provided clemency when they brand the victims as shibir men . but it is the law enforcer not bcl who should take action against the bad elements. the government should take the matter seriously. view the page international
