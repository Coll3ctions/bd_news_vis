getting back into the rhythm
the near deserted look of the capital city certainly conveys a sense of placidity in what is normally a life of hectic activity for us. realistically speaking, though, this is a welcome lull which will soon be overtaken by the normality we are so accustomed to. but the sheer delight of inhaling fresher air, because of the holidays, should enthuse us into a new realisation of how important it is for us to have a cleaner environment to live and work in.

weakness in political system makes it un-democratic
there is perhaps no universally recognised definition of democracy, but it generally means 'government of the people by the people for the people' and a system which is governed by the rule of law where all citizens irrespective of caste, creed and colour have access to government and all citizens enjoy freedom and liberties. the government is accountable to people and transparent in governing the country. where freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of press incorporated in the constitution are supposed to be strictly followed. view the page sports

disgraceful!
i was not born in 1971, but that doesn't mean that i cannot have any say in matters pertaining to our liberation war or cannot represent those who fought for our motherland. bangladesh lost hundreds of thousands of lives in the liberation war in 1971, fighting the pakistani army. in losing so many lives, few of our own so-called bangladeshis helped the pakistani army whom we call razakars. however, they used to call themselves member of the peace committee where their manifesto was to provide help and support to the pakistani army to capture the freedom fighters, rape their wives, mothers or sisters and take over the possession of their land, houses and other assets. i live in australia, far away from bangladesh, but my mind is always with my country. we always hear about the war criminals facing trials worldwide and getting the justice they deserve, unlike bangladesh where it's a different picture. we reward our war criminals in many ways!
approved textbooks
sometime back in the “the star campus”, the daily star published an article on the “state of science education in bangladesh: current status and future trends.” the material for this write-up was generated from a round table conference jointly organised by the daily star and the bangladesh academy of sciences. while agreeing with most of the viewpoints expressed in that conference by the eminent scientists of the country, i will focus on one major factor; i.e., lack of good textbooks that, in my opinion is one of the reasons why the students are gradually losing interest in science. to illustrate my point i will discuss about one textbook that i came across the other day. the name of the book is: “paribesh parichiti bigyan,” prescribed for class v by the national curriculum and textbook board.
outdated traffic system
everybody living in bangladesh faces traffic jam throughout the day and in almost every place. although we have reached 21st century where technology is progressing everyday and new innovation has captured the whole world, but bangladesh is nowhere in this race.
political prisoners?
both the big parties are demanding release of all "raj bandis" before election i.e. the leaders belonging to those parties who were arrested and charge-sheeted for corruption, extortion crimes like murders, helping murderers from prosecution, siphoning of state wealth to foreign banks etc. if those arrestees are glorified as "raj bandies" meaning "political prisoners" then what should we name others who are not members of any political party but involved in the same kind of activities like our so-called "raj bandis"? i think, our writers should find some new definitions exclusively for the latter to differentiate with the former.
cricket going the wrong way
it is worth mentioning that bangladesh has been introduced with the countries of the world in the last couple of years through cricket. bangladeshi football cut a sorry figure on different occasions while they were given ample opportunity to prove their mettle and carry the flag of red -green in favour of our beloved country.
2008 olympics
we, bangladeshi people, heartily congratulate the beijing 2008 olympic organising committee, for holding the "beijing 2008 olympic games, which started on 8 august and ended on 24 august 2008, with a most attractive and colourful ceremony in the bird's nest in beijing.
the cave in iraq
ancient human beings used to live in caves. they had no knowledge and essential instruments to construct houses. but hilly caves, for them, were just like houses, which saved them from hot, cold, rain and wild animals. one hundred thousand years ago the human beings were a bit different!
poor students
after the results of the ssc exams were published, we saw some news-reports containing pictorial illustrations of a good number of brilliant students belonging to the extremely poor families in the national daily newspapers. even after facing grinding poverty and having no facilities at all and remaining totally deprived, their excellent results cannot but surprise us.
two years lost!
the present political scenario in our country has turned out to be a good one for reasons more than one: i) the ctg is heading towards elections. ii) the major political parties are reforming their parties and going to sit with the ctg on election issues. iii) two major leaders of the major parties are preparing to sit face to face, of course not with indignation, but with a view to reaching a harmonious co-existence politically and thus enhancing the mutual thinking for the welfare of the country.
unbearable load shedding
i live in sonagazi upzila under feni district. i am a student. but it is a matter of great regret that at night we get only one hour or at best two hours of electricity supply here, which causes serious problems for the students. this situation persists during daytime also. we can't say or do anything.
be discreet
we congratulate our caretaker government, the election commission and all concerned on the wise, conciliatory and unanimous decision that the parliamentary election will be held before upazila election consistent with the demand of our two major political parties -- the awami league and the bnp--and also host of other political parties.
low birth weight
the health situation of children in our country characterises that of a developing country. more than 1 (one) out of every 3 (three) children or 1.03 million babies each year are born with low birth weight according to unicef. the survey reveals that low birth weight is a major public health concern in bangladesh. children born with low birth weight are likely to suffer developmental impairment and have risk of illness and premature death.
andrew jameson's remarks
the letter “parochial politics” by andrew jameson from london, uk published on 22 september 2008 has drawn my attention. i am really astonished how he had been frustrated seeing developments in our bangladeshi politics. is he a bangladeshi national? i think certainly not. he may be the citizen of a developed country like the uk. till now, britain's collaboration with the usa is killing millions of innocent civilians in afghanistan and iraq in the name of cleansing the taleban activists. in bangladesh, people face natural calamities like river erosions, floods, cyclones, climate changes, drought etc that occur due to global warming. ecologists say the developed countries are responsible for global warming. nevertheless, britain ruled over and exploited our country for about two hundred years and left it with skin and bone only. we became independent in 1971. but after 38 years of our liberation, we are not free from financial control--“a ghost ruler” like the wb, imf, and other donor agencies which are always imposing various plans and policies on us. there is a saying in our country, “those who deserve criticism, should not criticise others.” have a look at the mirror first!
a conspiracy against our cricket?
why are the bangladeshi cricketers behaving the way they are? returns are important in life. there cannot be one-sided love. a big politician's love for his party ideology inspires the activists of that party. the big politician is dedicated to the party. but he becomes a rebel when he is not properly evaluated, does not get nomination for election, or is left out of the cabinet. the same thing might have happened to the country's cricketers.
better resource management needed
we are the inhabitants of a developing country, whose natural resources are very limited. due to the growing population and fast dwindling land resources, we are facing serious problems. the only open source to meet our increasing demand is the least investigated bay of bengal. most of the islands and maritime nations are largely dependent on the exploitable resources, primarily on seafood. during this crisis, we should give priority to our exclusive economic zone (eez) of the bay of bengal for exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of its living resources.
