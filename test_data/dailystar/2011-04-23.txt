climate change and neglected tropical diseases
recent investigations attribute more than 150,000 deaths per year and a global disease burden to climate change. an area that has received particular attention is the potential impact of global warming on shifts in the spatio-temporal distribution of disease vectors, and hence the frequency and transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases. vectors, pathogens (parasites), and hosts survive and reproduce within certain optimal climatic conditions. changes in climate will alter the transmission of vector-borne diseases in different ways, such as changing the survival and reproduction rate of the vector and of the pathogen (parasite). view the page literature

the bard has no equal
the world of literature, indeed of arts and aesthetics, observes today the birth and death anniversaries of william shakespeare.
he was for all time . . .
there are reasons why you cannot ignore william shakespeare. in a larger dimension, you cannot stay away from literature, the pursuit of it. for literature speaks of life, more pertinently of what life ought to be or could be. in shakespeare, you come by all these images, perspectives if you will, which speak of existence. he delves into the soul in all its manifestations. think here of arrogance, that common human frailty. view the page star health

good news about bad foods
certain foods we know as bad have now been proved to be healthier than we thought. foods like eggs, chocolate, coffee, potato are wrapped with bad rap though new research suggests that they are not as bad as we know and consuming in moderation, they can be good for us. here are some of such foods you need to reconsider before you cut them from your diet:
sleep on your side
chronic snoring can be more than a noisy nuisance. up to three-quarters of nightly snorers also have sleep apnea, which causes breathing interruptions throughout the night. sleep apnea raises the risk of heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure.
prevent bathroom slipping and sliding
it is easy to suffer an injury in a slippery bathroom, but taking some precautions can get rid of potential hazards. follow the following list of suggestions to reduce slips and falls in the bathroom:
foods and drinks that trigger heartburn
if you are prone to the painful burn of heartburn, do not just pop an antacid — watch what you eat to avoid getting heartburn in the first place. the american gastroenterological association lists these foods and drinks to avoid, as they may trigger heartburn:
aspirin cuts heart attacks, not deaths or strokes
small doses of aspirin can lower the risk of heart attack in people who never had heart disease, a new look at the medical evidence shows. but the blood-thinning drug does not appear to cut the chances of dying from the disease, at least not enough that researchers can say for certain. view the page strategic issues

one for the recondite
you want to know about the weavers of bengal and their famed (in history and folklore) products during a particular period? then go to hameeda hossain's the company weavers of bengal: the east india company and the organization of textile production in bengal 1750-1813. the title and subtitle are a dead giveaway of the period covered, although to get a detailed, illuminating and extensive description of the weavers (male and female) at work and their products, you have to pay close attention to almost every page of the close to two hundred pages of text and appendices. however, be warned, it is anything but light reading, one, in fact, that the serious scholar or aficionado of the subject matter would probably find the greatest interest in, and most out of, but the casual reader could find it evocative of tales heard from (often with suitable, and pleasantly excusable, embellishments) parents, grandparents, and other golden-agers of the glory and prowess of the bengal weavers and textiles they magically wove and produced. but the company weavers of bengal is also about murky tales of corruption and exploitation, committed by both europeans and locals, and a vivid portrayal of what the british east indian company presaged: full-fledged colonialism engaged in by the government of great britain in what was easily the jewel in her imperial crown: india.
loneliness stretching into the sea
i wanted to read a serious book, but constraints of time made me scan my bookshelves for one that i'd be able to finish quickly. among the several as-yet unread books, i happily found marquez's the story of a shipwrecked sailor. besides its thinness (106 pages), what prompted my choice was the title. i've always enjoyed tales about the sea and seamen (robinson crusoe and swiss family robinson being childhood favorites, and later, the old man and the sea). moreover, the blurb said it was the author's first major work; this was another feature i found interesting. then there was the fact that this was a true story.
j. c. jack's faridpur
people interested in faridpur find anandanath roy's (1856-1926) work faridpuere itihash (history of faridpur) as a most helpful book. published in two volumes, one in 1905 and the second in 1915, the book is regarded as the most ancient resource to know about the land and life of a fertile district of the country. the recent editions of that old book have added much meat for interested literati. two editions from dhaka, one edited by the renowned journalist abu sayeed khan, comprising the first volume only, in 2005, and the other edited by dr tapan bagchi, comprising both the volumes, in 2007 drew many to the century-old historic document. in between those two editions, another one, edited by kamal chowdhury and comprising two volumes as well as some more old articles on faridpur, came out from kolkata, and drew proper praise. in respect of the research on faridpur, the name of prof abdus sobhan, an author of some anthologies on faridpur, could be a worthy name to mention. with its many merits, the tilted arrangement and writing of anandanath roy's book could be surpassed by another one which is hardly mentioned. a laborious and truly researched work, the economic life of a bengal district, is, to speak frankly, a great study on the district in particular, and on the whole of bangladesh in general.
