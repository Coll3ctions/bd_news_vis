durban pledges
the 17th conference of parties (cop17) of the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfcc) has ended on a note of agreement towards a legal deal covering all countries. the process, beginning next year, is to be completed by 2015 and put into effect by 2020. while the action has been hailed as a “historic breakthrough” by some, others have criticised it for not being aggressive enough, and as containing a loophole which may be exploited by the major polluting countries to get out of a legal binding.

tipaimukh: a plea for rational and scientific discussion
in the last few weeks a controversy has been raging about the impact of the proposed construction of the hydroelectric project in tipaimukh on the environment, economy and security of bangladesh. we cannot afford to take this lightly and we must do whatever it takes to ensure that our national interests are not compromised in any way. we have to make sure not only there is no diminution in the flow of waters in surma and kushiyara rivers but also there is no adverse environmental or ecological impact, no aggravation of the floods during the monsoon, and most important of all there is no diversion of water from barak river. these are non-negotiable and lie at the core of our national security concerns.

mystery of gravitation
early in the seventeenth century rene descartes proposed a mechanistic approach to physics, asserting that all causal influence is transmitted by direct contact between material entities. like aristotle, he rejected the idea of vacuum, believing that there can be no space (extension) without substance. in accord with his philosophy, descartes denied the intelligibility of weight as a primitive quality of matter, and argued that material bodies are impelled toward the earth by the impulse of particles of a “second species of matter” continually arriving at the earth from all directions. galileo, in his dialogue concerning two new sciences (1638), chose not to commit himself to any particular cause of gravity, indicating that he thought such speculations were premature at the present state of science. he wrote

uncertainty principle
a fundamental principle of physics, especially of quantum mechanics, is heisenberg's uncertainty principl. it states that one can never know for sure both the position and the velocity of a particle. that means the more accurately one knows about the position of a particle, the less accurately one knows about its velocity. the uncertainty principle, also known as indeterminacy principle, was developed by german physicist werner heisenberg in 1927. the concept relates to the inherent indeterminacy in the simultaneous measurement of the position and velocity of a particle. and once the velocity of the particle is precisely known, the knowledge of its position in space becomes completely indeterminate.

what's the death star?
there is a current scientific hypothesis that the sun has a companion which is currently about 1-1.5 light years away. it is believed that it has an elliptical orbit which, every 26 million years, sends matter towards the earth causing mass extinction events. it was the discovery of these seemingly regular events that gave rise to the hypothesis in the first place. the star is predicted to be most likely a red or brown dwarf and has been named nemesis or “death star”.
