ca's interview with bbc
in a first ever question-answer session with any media since he took over as chief adviser to caretaker government dr. fakhruddin ahmed elaborated to bbc bangla service on his government's position on wide-ranging national issues on friday. before we make our comments on his observations, however, we are somewhat constrained to ask why our leaders choose to speak to foreign media in the first place when they have important messages to deliver to the people. most government leaders around the world would have preferred to give such an important and exhaustive interview to the local media with some international media representatives being present. somehow our government leaders -- we had expected the ca to break the pattern -- had shown a proclivity towards speaking to the foreign media when the public hungered for listening to important leaders first hand and the local media would go all out to cater to such a pressing need. we saw the practice before and we are seeing it again. this we feel is not a very complimentary attitude to the local media, and it is time to change it.
anti-terror cooperation
it is good news that saarc officials are going to meet in new delhi this month to deliberate on the necessity of getting to the roots of funding of terrorist organisations that operate in the saarc countries. in a meeting of the saarc finance secretaries in the indian capital last week the issue of countering terror-funding came up with due seriousness. we feel it is a burning topic that has to be addressed in a focused manner without losing further time. since there is an agreement in place on sharing of information among the saarc countries, having some kind of mechanism installed to find out about how huge sums are being transferred through banks should not be a difficult proposition.

neutralising politics of the corrupt
i have always carried a peculiar fascination for political clowns. i enjoy watching them embarrass themselves as they shamelessly court public's favor. but the acts of the two condescending politicians, hannan shah and delwar hossain, and their emergence as ardent loyalists of khaleda zia are no amusing matter -- they want dynastic rule and reign of the corrupt back again. what's wrong with them? view the page sports

floods
the world has now developed technology to warn in advance the advent of the flood & also the countries where it will strike using the satellite system. bangladesh, being a low-lying country, all sorts of natural calamities including floods strike frequently. from our long experience we can see a permanent signal, warning us that flood will come to bangladesh on a routine visit. we watch floods coming in, staying for a few weeks or a month causing what floods usually do, that is damaging everything that comes their way, and then go back leaving a warning to visit again. so it is no surprise for the people of bangladesh and low-lying countries.
police behaviour
chowdhury's observation about police behaviour (sept:10) is the bitter reality in bangladesh; possibly inherited from their old pakistan days tradition! the unfortunate fact is that most of us consider police as something to avoid. we never go to them; unless and until it is a very serious and pressing matter, that has to have their involvement. the reason is that, any police help even for a right reason; involves "hidden costs", failing which the full power and authority of the police can be against you; both judicial and extra-judicial. fortunately, there are some exceptions, which as the poet said "a few, a few, too few for drums and beat".
public universities
currently, dr. kamal hossain is giving some sense of direction to the nation regarding socio-economic and political issues facing the country. his recent
bhuiyan and saifur
i am appalled at the invitation (and the bad judgement) of mannan bhuiyan to saifur rahman to head the bnp. the former finance minister reportedly failed to pay his income tax when his personal taxes had become originally due.
university teachers
in the case of the recent turmoil in the universities, the government could have sat down with the vice chancellors, syndicate members and honourable teachers of the universities and chalk out a peaceful solution to bring back a congenial atmosphere to the campus. while the chief adviser's speech demonstrates a forward looking approach to matters that have been causing public concern, substantive actions should be initiated to bring back normalcy to the highest seats of learning.
the sea
science-fiction writer jules verne in his epic work “20,000 leagues under the sea” focused on the untapped vastness of the two-third area of the mother earth comprising the sea, while the rest one-third being the land on which the possibility of changes of lifestyle and living could be achieved in the future.
a proposal
we observed destruction of public property by our students. we don't want to see such kind of vandalism in future. so, some steps should be taken into consideration by the govt. and law enforcement agencies. i would like to propose the following.
leaders and teachers
it is an addition of another page to the tragic as well as shameful chapter of the history of bangladesh being written, a cause of no pride and joy to us, bangladeshis, both native and expatriates. those eminent teachers entrusted with the responsibility of shaping the minds of the future leaders of the nation are within their rights to show their indignation. but their choice of leaders, for whose cause they are taking a stand, cannot be condoned. those two ladies have failed to serve the nation, an opinion that needs no explanation.
public expenditures
a report that appeared in your daily highlighting the necessity of forming an adhoc public accounts committee is an eye opener to the present dynamic regime. the matter is of great public interest due to the accumulated huge backlog of unresolved government expenditures.
ambulance and fire brigade vehicles
ambulance and fire brigade vehicles cannot move from one place to another quickly enough when other vehicles are not helpful to clear the road. the roads are always busy. most of the drivers of our country are not well trained. they drive recklessly. the drivers are not willing to obey the traffic rules and they want to drive at their sweet will (whimsically). the number of traffic policemen is insufficient. the tendency of overtaking is also responsible for these problems. most of these problems occur in the congested areas where the roads are very narrow.
28th bcs
as a developing country, bangladesh is entering into the vortex of globalisation. bangladesh is changing very fast in all sectors. for ensuring an efficient civil administration, the psc has contributed towards developing it but nowadays we see that the psc is not concerned with those who are exceeding their age limit. as citizens of bangladesh, we have the fundamental right to get the due opportunities in the country.
mobile re-registration
the btrc has ordered the mobile phone operators to register all their subscribers. it's fine and we respect this consciousness, though it's coming a bit late. mobile phone operators are encouraging their users by advertising the same. users have to go to the service centres for registration with their photos, sim card, photo identity and necessary papers. but there are some problems. if the user has to go to the service centre himself, then why should the user take the overhead of printing their photos again. one user may have several operators' sim, almost everyone has. then if one has 3 sims, each sim needs 2 photos which takes tk 8 each to print; then how much one has to pay only to print his/her photos? is it the customers' responsibility only to get re-registered?
statement of assets
it is a welcome decision that the govt is going to introduce the system of submission of statement of assets and properties possessed by the govt servants .
nuclear power plant
recent newspaper reports indicate that bangladesh may have asked russia for help in setting up a nuclear power plant! this (highly knowledgeable?) move is totally wrong and dangerous. we are approaching the only country who managed to have the largest and most dangerous nuclear reactor accident in the last half a century of nuclear reactor operations! the very idea is mind boggling!
politics
there is no last word in politics. but there is! the nation has hailed the decision of the government to lift the ban on indoor politics. during the process of absorbing the announcement of this decision, i could not but think that we should wait and see until the last word is heard. we have heard it. the decision to lift the embargo is limited and subject to 11 conditions or clauses of clarification in the perspective of the emergency rules as mentioned by the respected law and information adviser to the bbc bengali service.
