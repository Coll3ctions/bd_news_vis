views on caretaker government
it is highly appreciated that the enlightened people are coming up with suggestions to enrich the caretaker government (ctg) concept. i agree with most of the suggestions given by abu shahjalal azad in your esteemed daily on 24th june 2011. i would like to share my viewpoints too.
hartal: a lose-lose situation!
there are three categories of a situation. these are: win-win, win-lose, and lose-lose. in the win-win situation, each side of the deal feels that it is not loser and this situation is the best for any deal. when one side feels winning and the other side feels losing, the deal never succeeds. the devastating situation is created in lose-lose situation because both are losers in this deal.

the result of the 31st bcs preliminary exam has been published recently. one lakh and sixty four thousand candidates appeared in the test but very surprisingly only ten thousand two hundred and twelve candidates have qualified for the written test. this is a negligible figure in the context of the number of examinees. bcs preliminary exam is the most important public exam in the country. the preliminary test is not the only test by which a candidate's quality or eligibility can be measured. so, psc should allow more candidates in the preliminary test who can sit for the written test. this is our expectation from the authorities.

war crimes and uncertain justice
this is reference to your op-ed titled ' war crimes and uncertain justice' of june 28th. i was really fascinated by mr. syed badrul ahsan's closing sentence that 'you ponder all this. and you wait to know if some men in sri lanka will answer for their own crimes committed in the course of the war against the tamil tigers' and his frustration about why the pakistani military officers were never tried in pakistan for killing many bengalis in the 70's. well, that is exactly what the three member expert panel report and the recently released channel 4 documentary are commenting about the sri lankan government appointed 'lessons learned and reconciliation commission' to serve justice to the victims of the war.
pay scale of govt. banks
private banks offer very attractive salary for recruiting brilliant persons. the employees offer good service to the clients because they get good salary. but unfortunately, pay structure of govt. banks is very poor, although they have been turned into limited companies. for improving the performance of govt. banks, the finance minister promised them a separate pay scale about a year back. although the minister is sincere in his intentions, he could not materialise the plan due to protests by finance ministry officials. but at least what he can do is to give them five or six increments in their existing pay scale to mitigate their sufferings.
