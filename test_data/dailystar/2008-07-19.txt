the unites states is in a position to consolidate a long-term relationship with india, edge pakistan away from chaos, prevent another regional war, and address such important issues as the spread of nuclear weapons, terrorism and china's regional role. united states looks at enormous economic profits. india has a population of more than 1 billion, which means a big market. india has already become the third largest economy in asia after japan and china. then, the “china factor” is a strong boost to us- india relations. a us think-tank carnegie endowment for international peace, recently issued a report on the us agenda with regard to the rising power of india namely india as a new global power: an action agenda for the united states. similarly, the opening of the indian economy has also encouraged india's civil society to expand its interactions especially exports with the united states.
obama's trip to iraq
the editor of newsweek international has categorically spelt out "what obama should say on iraq." this is necessary as zakaria prophesies that 'were he elected, the war would be his biggest and most immediate problem…..he….will need to implement a serious policy on iraq…..that is…. informed by the conditions on the ground to-day.'
difficult time for pakistan
hope for peace and progress under emerging democracy in pakistan is being increasingly mired in violence and uncertainty. the afghan inferno is sucking the neighbourhood. fighting terrorism continues to be the top agenda of the ppp government. the latest bombing in karachi, islamabad and the offensive in khyber area to evade insurgent pressure on peshawar, the capital city of the frontier province, are the signs that containing terrorists through war and ceasefire is far from achieved. that americans have advised pakistan to concentrate on antiterrorist operations and not to waste energy on the removal of president musharraf is the strongest indicator of the ground reality. the continuation of president musharraf and failing to allow the judges to get back to the courts within 100 days are signs that corrections of the military regime may have to wait longer. view the page star books review
across a landscape of memory and timeless poetry
aide-memoire is quite a few strands of thought coming together. and with hasnat abdul hye's telling of the tale, or tales as the case may be, there is a feeling that readers will get to enjoy vicariously the experiences he relates in these accounts of his life. ah, but then the writer, or perhaps a reader, might protest. whoever said these accounts relate to hye's life as he lived them between 1943 and 1954? there is --- isn't there? --- a narrator here, one who speaks impersonally, in third person singular? you do not get to spot hye anywhere. it is always a 'he', always 'his' world of experience. and there lies the charm in the tale.
in search of new storytellers
sometimes bangladesh seems like a literary wasteland. no time-winning fiction gets published. no new writers are promoted. despite being a pro-stalwart literary area, none of the established novelists makes it a point to write in such a way that people read them, get back their lost reading habits. too many people here exhaust themselves wrestling with poetry. or is it? do they find composing poems easier than writing short stories or novels? writers who show potentials of writing good fiction spend most of their time writing newspaper columns on politics.
making a case for new, democratic politics
in democracy, the institution of election is held in high esteem. democracy theorists consider this institution greatly essential not only for political legitimacy of the rulers and stability of the political order but also for integration of societal arrangement, system capability, participatory behavior and above all political institutionalization. it is through the means of election that the politicians bolster their assurance to deal with the crises involved in the process of nation and state building. the essence of this commitment is general agreement on the rule of the game of politics that in turn establishes trust in the election process and peaceful transfer of state power.
general zia brought back still again
it is never difficult to lampoon a particularly flamboyant politician. in the united states, richard nixon was the subject of numerous novels, both while he was in office and shortly thereafter. bill clinton was the hero of primary colors , published anonymously early in his presidency. george bush has been satirized on stage in two devastating dramas--and certainly more are in the works. american (and western) writers certainly have no lock on the tradition. one thinks immediately of nigeria's greatest writers--chinua achebe and wole soyinka--both of whom have borrowed lead characters from real life. the list is actually endless, once it is opened up to latin america and asia.
