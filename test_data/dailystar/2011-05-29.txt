mullah omar reluctant
united states have started desperate moves to make a peace deal with taliban after the death of al qaeda leader osama bin laden. many people in pakistan are raising this question that if washington can talk to taliban then why not islamabad? fact is that pakistan can start talks with their taliban only if afghan taliban will start formal talks with us otherwise washington can sabotage talks between pakistan and taliban anytime. pakistan tried its level best to push afghan taliban for talks with us recently but till today there is no concrete outcome. very few people in media know that neither the top leaders of afghan taliban nor the pakistani taliban are interested in talks right now with kabul or islamabad because they think that summer is not a “talking season”. this hot weather is always a “fighting season” for them. afghan taliban killed many us soldiers in last few days but us administration is still running after some people who can facilitate their peace talks with taliban.

law catches up with mladic
the arrest of ratko mladic on thursday brings the prospects of justice for his victims remarkably closer. his capture ends a sixteen-year period in which the once swaggering bosnian serb general evaded the justice that was, and is, his due owing to the murder he organised of tens of thousands of bosnian muslims in the three-year period between 1992 and 1995. in tandem with slobodan milosevic and radovan karadzic, mladic inaugurated, with no qualms of conscience, a pogrom now considered to have been the worst in the history of europe since the outrages committed by the nazis before and during the second world war. view the page sports

generate rural employment
dhaka is now overloaded with a huge population. many people came to dhaka from the rural areas in search of cash earnings as the rural settings miserably lack employment opportunities. under the pressure of over population, dhaka is rapidly moving towards bankruptcy in respect of housing, transport, water-supply, civic amenities and most importantly its environmental status. perhaps it is the time when the government should attach special attention to generate employment opportunities in the rural setting by establishing agro-based small industries. at the same time, easy access of the farmers to cold-storage and marketing facilities has to be ensured for agricultural produces so that farmers may not sustain losses and lose interest in agricultural occupation.
make post offices useful
once post offices were the only institutions we used to depend on for communication. in the past, post offices were always crowded with people. now-a-days, our post offices give a reverse picture. not many people are there. only a few visit the place for sending official documents. this has happened only because of a sudden change in the communication technology that is widespread availability of cell phones and e-communications like e-mails, facebook, and also availability of courier services. our post offices should now change their strategy. they should come out of their traditional services and timing. post offices should now remain open on weekends and they should render some other services like collecting all utility bills, selling train tickets, banking, selling land revenue stamps, etc. we request the ministries and departments concerned to review these proposals and bring a big change to make our post offices profitable.
grievances of our police force
it is known to all that the police force of a country is assigned with the arduous task of keeping the law and order situation at a tolerable level to ensure peace and stability. and to do so police have to go through lots of difficult situations. however, in return, what do they get? they don't get a better pay, comfortable place to live in, or better meals, let alone other promised benefits enjoyed by the officers. i was saddened while going through a local daily which gave a very sorry tale about the condition of low ranking police personnel. government must take immediate actions to address their plight. if the police don't get enough to live a decent life, how will they perform their duties properly? obviously, they will resort to other means to make some extra bucks. our police force should also be adequately equipped with all required logistics to combat crimes effectively.
obama's sacred duty
on may 24, 2011, i listened to israeli pm's speech telecast live by cnn. he was speaking to both the houses of congress about the peace plan with palestine. but the israeli prime minister did not budge from his stance, he rejected the idea of a palestinian state to be created based on the borders that existed before 1967. he declared that jerusalem must never be divided, it would remain the capital of israel, there would be israeli military presence along the jordan river, in short, everything in favour of israel. one can easily imagine the hold israel has over the us.
hospitals or death centres?
two weeks ago my nephew who was a month premature, died in a renowned private hospital in gulshan. although his condition was improving he was given high antibiotic without our knowledge. as a result, he died the next day of kidney and lungs problem. two weeks later, the same thing happened to another premature child. is this what we get in return for paying high amounts of money to these hospitals for our treatment? i would request the authorities concerned to stop this brutality. if this carelessness goes on, we will not be able to trust any doctor.
japanese generosity
i was touched by the article published on 24th may in your daily that was so appreciative of the generosity of the japanese to bangladesh in the face of their problems, and, on the same page, the humorous article by jamal khan, about the chaos in a bangladeshi public sector workplace. i think the best way of saying thank you to the japanese for their donation for the building of the padma bridge is to be careful that the work is not spoilt by corruption. i heard that the british consultant for the building of the pakshey (now the lalon shah) bridge - also funded by the japanese - got up at 2.00 am to check the quality of the cement going into the uprights……
bad condition of dhaka-chittagong highway
i was pondering deeply on the issue of approving transit to india. no doubt that transit might appear as a blessing to the country's economy. but the question is whether appropriate infrastructure is available in our country or not. transporting goods from the port towards north through dhaka- chittagong highway is the only option available to the govt. but the condition of the road is so dilapidated that this cannot take the huge load of traffic. govt. must rethink on the issue prior to giving transit to india. otherwise this will terminate into a mess.
what is wasa doing?
in dhaka hundreds of high-rise buildings are being constructed. but there is no coordination of work and planning between wasa and rajuk. as a result, the suffering of the people due to acute shortage of water knows no bound. it is reported that most of the owners/developers of the high-rise buildings have illegally installed water pump and connected those with the wasa water pipeline. these pumps divert the water from the wasa's pipeline to their buildings depriving the people of the surrounding buildings of water supply. would wasa and the authorities concerned kindly look into the matter and take disciplinary action against the dishonest persons and employees of wasa?

let's be humans, not robots
the students vomiting the most amount of information get the best results, under the current bangla medium education system. it doesn't matter if the person's analytical ability or his reasoning power is poor, because he can memorize and reproduce well. these types of students, in my experience, get the shock of their lives in the university levels. every good university in bangladesh has an education system based on reasoning and analyzing, case studies, journals, presentations. these students can't present, can't analyze, can't reason, and suddenly, they are completely lost. it is not their fault that they are lost, but it is the fault of the system. let's be humans, not robots.
pm pledged jobs, but …
i would like to remind the honorable pm that one of the pledges made by her party before the election was to create job opportunities for at least one member of every family. obviously, young people were inspired by this pledge and cast their votes in favour of change, but in vain. it is reported that 35 thousand first class non-cadre gazetted posts are vacant in different ministries. but it is a matter of frustration that only 300 out of 2700 candidates of 28th bcs were appointed before the final result of 29th bcs was published. we hope the honorable pm would immediately intervene to solve this problem.

four cases against khaleda zia
i wrote in this column of ds several times in the past about why bnp is boycotting parliament. finally moudud ahmed has come out with the main reason, because the bnp leadership failed to convince the media, other political parties and our intellectuals. all are blaming the government for failing to bring the opposition in the parliament. according to the intellectuals, it is the duty of the government to bring them in and make parliament functional, as if the opposition has no responsibility to attend voluntarily. now the time has come for the government to make the parliament functional by withdrawing four cases against khaleda zia. the government should act quickly but with conditions as the new york court has done to kahn, the imf boss. the government does not need to compel the bnp leadership to wear monitoring devices. but khaleda should vow that she will not demand withdrawal of cases against her sons and other top leaders like moudud, sirker, abbas and many others.

ragging- an inhuman practice
university is the highest institution of education where students get access to the world of excellence in terms of humanity and professionalism. students come here to make themselves enlightened. but it is very appalling that in some universities, in the name of 'ragging', the newcomers are tortured by their seniors! of late, a leading daily reported that freshers at chittagong marine academy were severely tortured by the seniors. the level of torture was so high that some of the students were admitted to the emergency units of the hospitals with acute physical and mental problems. some of them even died! though ragging is prohibited, this is going on unabated!
