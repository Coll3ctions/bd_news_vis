rice price record high
prices of all varieties of rice have soared taking up a huge portion of consumer budget with its diminishing purchasing power, as it is. of particular ordeal is the price of coarse rice consumed by lower income groups forming a vast majority of the people. the low quality rice is selling at tk 32 per kg and likely to rise to tk 35 per kg.
positive changes in bhutan
bhutan has lately been making history. when its people went to the polls the other day to elect a national council, it was a sign of how meaningfully the kingdom means to align itself with the rest of the world and carve a new niche for itself in the global community. indeed, it is to the credit of the former king, jigme singye wangchuk, that bhutan's people find themselves on the threshold of a new era. without any prompting and absolutely on his own, he sent out the message that bhutan needed to change. and change was to come through people being given the right to vote for their representatives in the national council as well as the national assembly. moreover, by abdicating in favour of his son, jigme khesar namgyal wangchuk, the king established a rare precedent of a monarch voluntarily walking away from power and glory.
dynasties and the law of diminishing returns
political dynasties make a mockery of democracy. and they do that through keeping power, or the possibility of arriving at it, limited to a self-chosen few. you might now want to explore the issue a little deeper. you can do that easily through observing the way matters have lately been shaping up in pakistan. a nineteen year old young man has just been imposed on the pakistan people's party as its new chairman. his father, notorious for all the charges of corruption levelled against him not only in pakistan but in switzerland as well, will be the party's co-chairman for as long as the son does not finish his education at oxford and return home to take charge of the organisation. it all reminds you of the old days when monarchies were the rule rather than the exception, when kings too young to exercise authority were guided by regents until they reached the first rung of adulthood. so what we now have in pakistan, following the tragic end of benazir bhutto, is a very young king named bilawal bhutto zardari, who will for quite some years be in the shadow of a regent called asif ali zardari.
an assassination most foul
it appears benazir bhutto fell to an assassin's bullets and/or the bomb blast meant for her. passing away of a charismatic leader is always tragic, and an unwelcome surprise. it always leaves behind a trail of bitterness. even so, this was exceptionally so. what the country has to grapple with is its consequences, that may become trends.
blind faith
if you want to understand pakistan today, try and imagine this scenario in india. it is 1984, sant jarnail singh bhindranwale escapes during operation bluestar and disappears into an inaccessible range of the himachal himalayas. the indian armed forces cannot find him; although delhi will never admit it, bluestar is a failure. the militants, operating under the command of general shabeg, regroup, their loyalty to the ideological leadership of bhindranwale reinforced by success in battle. anger against bluestar arouses the sikh peasantry to the kind of fury and passion it displayed during banda bahadur's war against the mughals. the young take up militancy in self-generating numbers, making casualties irrelevant to the insurgency. bhindranwale remains in regular touch with the insurgents, who now have safe sanctuary in certain gurudwaras, since the indian government is hesitant to invade sacred space after the counter-productive calamity of bluestar. view the page sports

can windies continue?
without putting too fine a point on it, west indies' 128-run victory in port elizabeth was one of the major surprises of 2007. they hadn't won a test for 19 months and, more significantly, had beaten major opposition away from home only once since the turn of the millennium. now the question is whether they can continue to turn the tables on south africa in the new year test in cape town and complete a series triumph no one really thought was possible.

benazir's assassination

“make internet a commodity"
thank you very much for your interview-based article on the "high internet tariff" in december 17, 2007 on the star business page. this issue needs mass awareness and campaign to make internet a commodity for the public and businesses in bangladesh. internet is the most important component of this highly interconnected world. it is like blessings from the almighty to countries like us, which can catalyze our developments and export growth in this global knowledge economy. as the basis president aptly put “high internet pricing is seriously holding back our ict exports growth in bangladesh.”

knowledge-based transport planning
the truism “history repeats itself” applies to those who ignore the lessons of the past and insist on forging ahead, committing the same mistakes, and experiencing the same results. it is hoped that city authorities will learn from the mistakes of the mirpur road demonstration project and try to assign due importance to fuel-free transport. given the small modal share of automobiles and the many problems they cause, there should be no provision for creating more auto-only roads within urban areas, and all existing auto-only roads should be converted into mixed-use roads by properly integrating public transit, fft and fuel-dependent transport (fdt). if the mirpur road project is indeed a demonstrationin a sense an experimentthen clearly the lessons should be carefully learned before proceeding with transport planning. in this case, the lessons are startlingly clear, and point in a very different direction from that of current transport planning in dhaka. view the page international
