“conquest” of the bay!
i always read brig gen shahedul anam khan's articles, as in today's ds. i have been nauseated by the new benchmarks of adulation that the sycophants have reached and in recent days wasting huge sums of money (whose?). i wonder what pleasure was derived by the recipient(s), when the real facts and the balance sheet of the 'victory' remain obscure. does anyone know what our nation will gain in practical terms?
