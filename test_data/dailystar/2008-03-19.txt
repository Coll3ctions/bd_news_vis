come on, cricketers
everyone is becoming frustrated with the pathetic batting of bangladeshi batsmen. in my opinion, the defence “we have the talent. give us 5 more years then we can show the world what we can do”, should no longer be valid. five years has long passed by. now is the time to consider whether we need to improve as a cricketing nation or just stay comfortable where we are.
"collared" tigers
i am writing this letter in response to the recent article by mr. sirajul hossain, published in your daily concerning the collaring of the sundarbans tigers and some of the subsequent responses in this section, (letters to the editor). in my opinion a thorough investigation should be initiated concerning the death of the two collared tigers. mr. sirajul hossain's article uncovers some serious issues regarding the drug used to tranquillise the tigers. also the method of snaring the tiger before tranquillising should be strongly opposed. there is more than enough evidence in the film by bbc to initiate and pursue a legal proceeding for the neglect shown to the collared tigers. after the death of the first collared tiger, the reason given for death was old age (the tiger died after seven months). if old age was the reason for death, then why was an old tiger collared in the first place? the fate of the second tiger according to the people involved in the collaring process is unknown, but the fate of the second tiger is clearly visible in the bbc documentary "ganges". it is dead. why is the collar being removed by re-darting a very sick tiger in the film?
iran election
on 14 march, parliamentary elections took place in iran. from all evidences, it is clear that the election was a phoney one which has been stage managed by the shia mullahs to tighten their grip on power. iranian president mahmoud ahmedinejad, who came to power in 2005 on a populist platform that promised a better life for iran's poor, has, three years later, failed to deliver. despite iran's enjoying a boom from rising oil prices, unemployment and poverty remain extremely high, while the government has been diverting funds for military and nuclear energy. if discontent over the economy is the only visible sign of opposition to the iranian state, it is because all other forms of opposition, be they political, ideological, and religious or social, have been brutally silenced.
oic's call
islam, unlike other religions, strictly adheres to prayers being offered in a totally peaceful atmosphere and in complete silence signifying voluntary surrender to almighty and it cannot be a religion that would promote violence and terrorism, as propagated by the west. rather, islam preaches and follows a peaceful propagation of the tenets of the religion and peaceful co-existence right from the days of the prophet muhammad (pbuh).
uttara plot allotment
it is very heartening to hear that the caretaker government is making all out efforts to undo the irregularities associated with allotment of plots in rajuk's 3rd phase of uttara. it has already cancelled allotment of plots that were found to be allotted beyond lawful means by the previous government. i would like to urge the present government to consider the following while re-allotting the plots in uttara:
poor postal service
i refer to the recent letters published in your daily on the above subject. go to any post office in dhaka or any other city, you will be appalled to see the situation. generally, the post offices are over crowded with people standing in long queues. the staff at the counters work with a glum face and it is clear that they are ill fed/under nourished. therefore, they are just doing their jobs reluctantly.

there are many street boys in our country. they don't have any identity. their identity is the street. they are called street boys or tokai. it's a great social problem . many of them become hardened criminals in due course of time.

traffic jam
we the common people of the big cities have to suffer a lot because of unbearable traffic jam. as we start for our workplace early in the morning we get stuck up in long rows of vehicles. the huge line of vehicles inches onward, causing irritation to the commuters who travel by bus or cng run baby taxies. in some thoroughfares it is the rickshaws that are responsible for traffic congestion. private cars also add to the already aggravated traffic situation. again drivers often disregard traffic rules, giving rise to a chaotic situation.
clinton campaign
what the clinton supporters are saying makes no sense at all. how can you lose the race and still say, "oh, i think you should be my vice president..." secondly, why would the clinton campaigners even want obama as a vice president...a vp will take the president's spot if something happens, so that person should be able to run the country in case of emergency. if obama, according to them, can't be the commander-in-chief, why would they think it is all right for him to be the vice presidenthypocritical! i have been watching the race very closely. it's not rocket science. the sooner the majority of america realises that, the better!
rent hike
it seems that the newspapers do not consider high rent of apartments a burden for the ordinary service holders staying in dhaka. recently, all the house owners in dhaka increased the house rent by almost 50 percent and there is no report on this matter in the press. only the rise in price of essentials is reported but this aspect of cost of living is not at all reported. now an ordinary service holder spends more than 70 percent of his salary on rent only. the existence of the middle class in dhaka will be threatened by house rent increase, if no remedial measures are taken immediately. view the page international
