in defense of v.s. naipaul
few literary figures in recent memory excite such passionate invective as novelist sir v.s. naipaul. his public figure, his work, his personal life, all examined in tandem, tend to inspire a uniquely tortured rhetoric. he has been caricatured as a monster, and will never be a darling of the politically correct. few other writers are judged as completely as a moral failure in the way naipaul is, and this tendency is baffling. the insistence in popular imagination on naipaul's "life choices" reveals a prurient, amateurish fascination with him as a celebrity. joan didion summed up this attitude: "it is hard not to note a certain turning in the air when v.s. naipaul is mentioned, a hint of taint...one catches the construction 'brilliant but': brilliant but obsessive, brilliant but reductive..." out of the murk of commentary that threatens to drown the author's fictional voices, one grudging admission rises without fail: naipaul is a hugely talented writer. i'd suggest that last phrase be said simply, without a 'but' or an 'although' appended.

who will lead her in the prehistoric forest

i won't send you a garlanded message.
but if you don't find out what i have to say
how will you know the truth about me?
i'll never know your response then, o absent-minded one!
when the time is right and evening lovely and quiet
when your eyes become spellbound in the fading light,
let me soothe you with soft tunes.
will you listen then to the message i've strung
in languid and mild measures?
just as a firefly flitting through shal forests,
weave in hushed darkness a rosary of light,
in a lonely corner of your soul's courtyard,
all alone i'll go on composing my songs for you,
completely rapt in homage,
o absent-minded one! view the page star health

read, learn and be salvaged
the night flight to the seventh sky and then to sidratul muntaha (last frontier) was the most significant event in the life of hazrat muhammad mustafa (peace be upon him) after he had been graced by the almighty with prophethood. he was made the most knowledgeable human being as he was taken on a physical tour of heaven and hell and many other places which are beyond the reach of anyone else. bishshanabir meraj has been meticulously written to ensure that no subjective likes and dislikes distort the facts about the miraculous event. the translator has made all possible efforts to present a true picture of all that was narrated in the original version, and also the narrative has been made reasonably easy for the faithful to comprehend it with little effort. the book is, therefore, indispensable for believers to further cement and consolidate their faith and belief in the ultimate authority of allah.
