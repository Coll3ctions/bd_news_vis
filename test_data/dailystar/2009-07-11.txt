how the bright came to quick confusion . . .
the quiet, almost unnoticed death of robert s. mcnamara at the age of ninety-three is hardly any reason not to recall the times he lived in and influenced to a degree not many are capable of. he belonged to that exclusive club of the best and the brightest that came to be symbolic of the kennedy administration in the early 1960s. as john f. kennedy would famously tell his people and the world beyond the frontiers of his country, the torch had been passed to a new generation of americans, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace. mcnamara was part of that generation. only a year older than kennedy and having served for quite a while as president of ford motors, he almost breezed in to take charge of the pentagon once the president-elect asked him to. but, then, nearly every member of kennedy's charmed circle was breezing in -- theodore sorensen, mcgeorge bundy, kenny o' donnell, robert kennedy, pierre salinger, dean rusk -- and sending out the clear message that after years of eisenhower-era stupor, government was in the process of re-energising itself. view the page urban

admittedly, this is a niche book, for those who read cricket books - not to be confused with the crowds to whom cricket is part spectacle and part national flag-waving, or celebrity sports stars and outsized contracts, but definitely not books. cricket magazines perhaps, or the sports pages of the dailies, or nowadays, blogs with their coffee-fueled wisdom and instant insight, but not books. like the long form of cricket, hardly anybody really reads cricket books anymore - both take up too much time. it's a shame, for good cricket books (and not the formula ones on bestseller lists), can be savoured like test matches where a whole day can go by with an arcane, fascinating battle being fought by a wily spinner against a class bat.

not much imagination, not much inspiration
taking stock of a book at the end of going through interviews of thirty eight persons could range from being an uplifting emotional experience to a real downer. others may wholeheartedly disagree with me, and they have every right, maybe even reason, to do so, but for me, the experience hovered near the depressing end of the spectrum, even if, mercifully, i had to go through only 106 pages of shakhkhatkar.
