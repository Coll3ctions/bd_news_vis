du admission tests
i would like to draw your kind attention to the revised du admission guidelines 2008-2009 of kha and gha units. along with the existing three departments bangla, english and mass communication and journalism a few more departments have imposed some admission prerequisites, which go against the fundamental rights of a large section of students of the country. the revised admission guidelines 2008-2009 of kha and gha units have stipulated that only those students will be eligible for admission in the departments of bangla, english, linguistics, international relations, public administration, women and gender studies, and mass communication and journalism who had 200 marks in bangla and english each at the hsc level. as students from the madrassa education system do not have 200 marks in bangla and english each, this precondition will obviously bar them from studying these valued subjects. it is worth mentioning here that alim students of the madrassa system study the same bangla and english books prescribed by the nctb that are followed by their college counterparts.

islamic political parties

going back to square one ?
one adviser is shuttling between the two ladies for their blessings to hold a free, fair and credible election that the present ca has been promising since his assuming power. as the election date is nearing the atmosphere of holding an election itself is becoming uncertain and more and more people are getting sceptical about it. the so-called dialogues are ending with new demands from the major political parties. while one major party want election under any circumstances, the other wants election as per their own style and prescription. this means that the latter wants an election letting free their musclemen and using money to create a level-playing ground, where their men can help them win. view the page international
