razing hills
the news item titled “hill cutting on in khagrachari defying ban” published in the daily star's january 12, 2008 issue has drawn my attention. it is mentioned that two hills were razed and trees were axed. the news described the fact in such a fashion that the work was a heinous crime. it was also stated that the hills were erased for making 70 new housing plots. i have been observing with concern for the last couple of years that newspapers and electronic media have been mentioning the razing of hills as detrimental to the environment. but no one has so far explained scientifically the pros and cons of cutting hills and developing plain lands in bangladesh, at least i have not seen such rational explanation.

as if to give a twist to the peace move by us president bush, a hawkish faction in prime minister ehud olmert's coalition, yisrael beiteinu's 11 lawmakers pulled out of the government on 16 january, leaving olmert with a majority of 67 in the 120-seat parliament. this unexpected step has weakened olmert at a time when he needs broad support to reach a peace deal with the palestinians by the end of the year. the ruling coalition still has the majority in the house. "negotiations on the basis of land for peace is a fatal mistake," avigdor lieberman, head of the faction, told a news conference. however, ruhama avraham, a member of olmert's kadima party, said the government would overcome this. olmert had tried to persuade lieberman to stay in the government in a meeting with him on tuesday. but yisrael beiteinu decided in a meeting to leave, lieberman said. "nothing will come of these negotiations," he declared. view the page international

over and over again we are plunged into confusion by words. words are used in contexts not only to provide information and truth but, probably most of the time, to stir up images and emotions also. view the page environment
an alternative way of livelihood and environmental protection
agriculture is traditionally associated with the purposeful production of food and fibre commodities in rural areas. agriculture in the 21st century, however, is actually much broader than this -- it also includes such diverse items as environmental horticulture, planning the use of green space, control of insect and rodent pests, wildlife management, and even food production by city dwellers. urban agriculture is a broad term to describe agricultural activities and livelihoods in an urban setting. it means more than maintaining farms or gardens in an urban environment. it also includes livestock raising, water management and organic waste management. after all, it includes small- and large-scale activities in horticulture, livestock, fodder and milk production, aquaculture, and forestry -- where several activities may be carried out within one enterprise.
global worries for environment
the environment includes both biotic and abiotic factors and they depend on each other for their existence. so they are equally co-existence components and distortion of one affects the other. what is happening in the world from the environmental point of view is really horrible and dreadful to think environmental are hazards causing much problems to mankind as well as the flora and fauna of the whole world. so time has come to think over the matter and to face it successfully. first it is necessary to know what are the factors responsible for these devastating actions. natural disasters are recurring incidents and almost every year causing serious damage to both mankind and its resources. the recent sidr and two times flood in the same year are the best examples. both the man made and natural factors are responsible for these natural disasters.
