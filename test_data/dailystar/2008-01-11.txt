initiate a political dialogue
it is becoming a fashion to blame the politicians for any failure in the affairs of governance, although the country is under the rule of the military-backed caretaker government for the last one year, and not any political party. the politicians and the political parties are showing full respect to the state of emergency rules and obeying the order of the government. the most powerful political spokesperson of the government, the law and information adviser, and the so called popular talk show hosts of tv channels very often express their opinion that there is no change in " mon- manoshikota" of the politicians which is the biggest hurdle for positive thinking in granting political freedom to the politicians and the people as well. i was so amazed to hear a tv talk show host asking a question to a politician guest: “you talk about every problem of the country, why didn't you protest the government decision to send the artefacts to a french exhibition?” the inherent message is: if you had protested, this could have prevented the situation that has arisen, as if the politicians are responsible for what happened to the stolen artefacts. the ball shall always be in the court of the politicians, and the government is not accountable and will not take any responsibility. this was well demonstrated by the statement issued by an adviser to the press that the government had nothing to do with regard to rising prices of rice, and the people will have to accept this.
bangladesh 2008
last year was a surprise year for bangladesh. many impossible things became possible in the year 2007. it will be a memorable year in our history. as a nation we have many historical events that we can be proud of. we have 1952, we have 1971 and both of them have their permanent places in history.
inflation
inflation in any country has some characteristics of a market economy, is quite normal. but when prices of essentials like rice and edible oil soar three or four times in a couple of days and the people's income remains the same as that of five years ago, e have reason to doubt how efficiently our administrators are running the country. an adviser could not make things better by uttering that the government had nothing to do to reduce the prices of rice. people are quite disappointed; a government that can easily incarcerate corrupt politicians with or without substantial evidence is periodically failing to keep prices of essentials from soaring out of people's affordability. it doesn't seem that the market is always plagued by a lack of supply; some unscrupulous traders are pointed as the main culprits every time and the task of bringing them to justice and restoring normalcy in market prices seems to be a daunting one, at least for this government.
assassination of benazir bhutto
political assassination is a professional hazard for politicians. it has happened from time immemorial in history of all civilisations and many notable and apparently insuperable leaders have suffered this fate. julius caesar, abraham lincoln, mahatma ghandi, liaqat ali khan, john f kennedy, all these come to mind.

the presidential election in lebanon has been postponed again. 'again' would be an understatement as it is now the 11th postponement of the election.
thrust sector, but…
our government has declared ict as a thrust sector. but the irony is that the whooping tariff on internet bandwidth contradicts the government's position. just as the central bank devaluates our currency periodically to discourage import, so has bttb set such a high tariff line giving the impression that it also discourages internet usage. bttb's current capacity is 24 gbps but utilization is merely about 20%. undoubtedly, it is the high tariff rate that is holding back the entrepreneurs in the software industries from leasing bandwidth from bttb resulting in such a poor utilisation. it is to be noted that foreign investors will not invest in ict sector if they find cost of supporting infrastructure more than those in the neighbouring countries. we have a talented pool of ict graduates with about 4,000 fresh students joining it every year. the ict sector is different from any other typical service sectors. as the industry matures with time, the revenues increase manifold with its maturity as evident from the recent experiences in india, china & singapore. the sector does not require intense mobilisation of resources, nor does it put heavy pressure on national energy reserves. it requires a steady supply of skilled human resources, which we already have, and uninterrupted internet connection, which can be considered as the backbone of the total system. joining submarine cable and then keeping it idle serves the purpose of none. bttb should take lessons from the recent revolution taking place in cellular companies in bangladesh. revenues can be earned from scanty users and a high service charge or from a huge user base and an affordable service charge. since bttb is the lone player in this service sector, we hope it will choose the latter voluntarily, unlike in the cellular sector which needed a host of competitors to make that happen.
dhaka metro subway
i have read with interest the proposed dhaka metro subway route plan. the plan confirms that the dead ends in the northern part of the metropolis are the places that need further attention. a 7th subway route connecting gabtoli, pallabi and airport would cover the metro more effectively, providing faster services and allowing leverage for potential rail-traffic congestion in near future. this new route can again be part of one or more northern loops.
nrbs
nrbs were telling us: “shun path of the west, be proud bangladeshis.” it is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard! who are you to say this? for god's sake, look at yourselves, probably a lot of you were born and initially educated here, and many of you went to a public university- at our expense. off you go to some other country and serve that society for years and then come back here, hold a high profile conference and tell us to be bangladeshis! if you really want to do something, come back and show us that you really care, otherwise go back to your adopted countries and stay there and don't bother us with your advice!

remembering justice syed mahbub murshed
rabindranath had said that it was possible to find a person worthy of seeing, but it was not easy to find a worthy place to see him. i realised the truth of it at a wedding in 1938. i was then a student of class ten. i saw the groom, turbaned and donned in a light cream sherwani under a 'choga' embroidered with real silver work. tall and erect, bright eyes and slightly tanned complexion, that was the first sight i had of barrister syed mahbub murshed. i had then such an age when in the rich juvenile imagination, and i was trying to figure out whom he resembled. i first thought it was indranath of srikanta, but indranath had a few marks on his face, but murshed had a perfect unblemished face. i got it -- it was shibnath of "shesh prasna." yes, shibnath has donned the groom's dress or may be, it was, othello -- tall, dark and handsome --- but his eyes lacked the hardness of a soldier. murshed's eyes were electrifying. view the page environment
climate change: a threat for bangladesh
climate change is the greatest environmental challenge facing the world today. human induced changes in the global climate and associated sea level rise are widely accepted with policy makers and scientists. the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) concluded that “the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate”. rising global temperatures due to climate change will bring changes in weather patterns, rising sea levels and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. climate change poses significant risks for bangladesh. the exact magnitude of the changes in the global climate is still uncertain and subject of worldwide scientific studies. it is broadly recognised that bangladesh is very vulnerable to these changes. indeed, it has internationally been argued that bangladesh, as a country, may suffer the most severe impacts from climate change. a new report called climate of disaster, published this month in bali by tearfund shows that, based on past experience, bangladesh is going to continue to be one of the worst-hit places on the planet.
