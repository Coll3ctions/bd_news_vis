rmg exporters navigating a rough patch

the crossfire culture

kamala das: a tribute
kamala das, aka madhavikutty, aka kamala suraiya, b. 31 march 1934, d. 31 may 2009. multiple names; two faiths; two mediums of creative expression - painting and writing, the latter in two languages and several genres; many interests; many controversies. her name will long resonate in our consciousness, thanks to her bold assertiveness, whether in confessional verse or self-revelatory prose.
an afternoon at the asia house: part i
it was built up as an afternoon of literary davids from pakistan, writers who had emerged relatively new on the horizon of south asian english fiction and were fast beginning to catch up with the entrenched goliaths of india. pakistan appears often in the global media for issues ranging from its institutionalised support of violence to its undisputed talent in terms of both cricket and corruption, and yet, here they were veiling the violence with an artistic cover. so, what were the new pakistani literati really like, i thought, as i navigated the swell of the great unwashed over the bank holiday at regent's street.

extract from my story
often, from behind the house and from the dirty seashore, the smell of rotting fish would enter our back verandah, from which i watched a municipal school's children parade in the morning, singing a patriotic song and the huts of the bootleggers who buried their wares in tins at night and slept on charpoys in the day, while the sun climbing over them, burnt their skin black. the bootleggers were full of distrust for strangers and once or twice when i went strolling past their colony, they turned their hostile eyes towards me.
an introduction
i don't know politics but i know the names of those
in power and can repeat them like days of week or
names of months, beginning with nehru. i am indian,
brown, born in malabar. i speak three languages, write
in two, dream in one. don't write in english, they cried, english
is not your mother tongue. why not leave me alone, critics,
friends, visiting cousins, everyone of you? let me speak
in any language i like. the language i speak becomes
mine, its distortions, its queernesses all mine, mine alone.
it is half english, half indian, funny perhaps but it's
honest, it is human as i am human, you know…
it voices my longings, my hopes and is useful to me
as cawing is to crows or roaring to the lions,
it is human speech, the speech of the mind that is here, not
a mind that sees and hears and is aware. not the deaf
blind speech of trees in storm or of monsoon clouds or of rain
or the incoherent mutterings of the blazing
funeral pyre. i was child and later they said, i grew,
for, i became tall, my limbs swelled and one or two places
sprouted hair. when i asked for love, not knowing what else
to ask for, he drew a youth of sixteen into his
bedroom and shut the door. he did not beat me but my sad
woman-body felt so beaten. the weight of my breasts and
womb crushed me. i shrank pitifully. then i wore a shirt
and a black sarong, cut my hair short and ignored all of
this womanliness. dress in sarees, be girl or wife,
they cried. be embroiderer, a cook or a quarreler
with servants. fit in, belong, said the categorizers.
be amy or be kamala. or, better still, be just
madhavikutty. it is time to choose a name, a role.
don't play pretending games. don't play at schizophrenia
or be a nympho. don't cry embarrassingly loud when
jilted in love…later, i met a man. loved him. call him
not by any name, he is every man who wants his
woman, just as i am every woman who seeks love.
in him the hungry haste of rivers, in me the ocean's
tireless waiting. who are you, i ask each and all. the answer
 - is, it's i.
anywhere and everywhere i see him who calls himself
i. in this world he is tightly packed like the sword in its sheath.
it is i who drink a lonely drink near midnight at hotels
of strange towns, it is i who make love and then feel shame,
it is i who lie dying with a rattle in my throat,
i am the sinner, i am the saint. i am both the lover
and the beloved. i have no joys which are not yours
no aches which are not yours
we share the same name, the same fate, the same crumpled
- dreams… view the page star health

will "alter-egos" serve our interests better?
an air of despondency is prevailing among our professional diplomats because of the way this government is appointing ambassadors and high commissioners. all these appointments have not yet been announced because the respective governments have not yet given the agreements. but then secrecy has never been a strong point in our governance and hence most of these appointments have found their way to the press. in fact, a member of the parliament, who is also a former career diplomat, has responded to these appointments in the media as if they have been announced already.

not the casuarina tree
as travelogues go, kuala lumpurer pathe pathe is rather humdrum. as a book that highlights the importance of archives to a nation or country, however, sharif uddin ahmed's work carries some weight, an aspect that should have a far greater impact on the people and government of bangladesh than its contents in one hundred pages and small change. according to the new american desk encyclopedia, archives, which are documents of a public body preserved in an organized manner, began in 1789 with the french archives nationales as the systematic collection and supervision by a central government agency. quoting the director general of the malaysian national archives, ahmed brings out the significance of archives to a society: “archives are not only important for heritage preservation but also as means of transparency in a government…. they can be the reference to our past strengths and weaknesses, and guide us to move forward….” however, the author laments, there is little public awareness in bangladesh about the important role that archives can play in a country's development.
