what caused the recent quakes?
lately the earth has been quite active as far as her seismic behaviour is concerned. let's have a look at the recent earthquakes since the beginning of this year. on january 12th, a magnitude-7.0 quake devastated haiti and on february 27th, a 8.8-magnitude tremor hit chile, shifting her largest city, concepcion, at least 10 feet to the west! and a similar earthquake struck japan on february the 26th, thankfully causing less damage. then again on march 4th, a magnitude of 6.4 quake hit taiwan followed by a 6.5 one on the very next day in indonesia. and on march 8th a pre-dawn 5.9 magnitude earthquake rocked south-eastern part of turkey. the recent surge in the frequency as well as intensity of the quakes, a calamity that comes out of the blue, has sent leading experts in the field worrying. however, the string of quakes over the last three months might well be a matter of mere coincidence. prof. bob holdsworth, an expert on tectonics at durham university, england says, “i can definitely tell you that the world is not coming to an end”. it is important to note that according us geological survey, on average there are 134 earthquakes a year that have a magnitude between 6.0 and 6.9. and this year experienced a hasty start, with 40 of such so far, more than in most years for that particular time period. but there is no geological connection between these recent earthquakes as these tragic natural events involved different tectonic plates.
