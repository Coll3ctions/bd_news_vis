thanks for the tip!
when it comes to breakfast in dhaka, i enjoy the eggs benedict at the westin as much as the parata ghila kolija from a nameless street-side restaurant. i usually leave a tip at the westin, knowing that the price tag of tk 800+ includes a 10% service charge. but, i rarely tip for the tk 45 breakfast at the street-side restaurant because the server makes me feel like he is doing me a favour. however, i don't feel too bad about it when i notice that no one else leaves a tip, and the waiters don't expect it either.
