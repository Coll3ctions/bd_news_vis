changing gene’s expression
suppose, you are a poet writing or thinking of a poem sitting on a boat in a river and your genes are helping you to do so. but is this everything? the answer is no. some experience may have been imprinted into some of your genes helping to boost your imagination, creating a simulation of an experience that might have been experienced by your great grandfather. your great grandfather might have had an experience of similar type, in a similar river, on a similar boat, and had probably created similar imagination. this is nothing but epigenetics. epigenetics is the study of the interaction of genes, experience, and environment in the expression of a trait.
jurassic crocodile
in an interesting turn of event in the field of paleontology, scientists very recently discovered the fossils of, what they are referring to as, an ancient crocodile with mammal-like teeth! discovered in the rukwa rift basin, south-western tanzania, which's details have been published in the august 5 issue of the journal nature, paleontologists believe that this newly discovered species, named pakasuchus kapilimai, lived between 65 and 144 millions years ago during the cretaceous period and in the region what is now known as sub-saharan africa. traditionally what is understood about crocodiles is that, all species of such kind surviving today look, as well as behave in similar fashion. that is, they live mostly in water, ambush their preys of various kinds and eventually swallow it either whole or in sizable chunks. but the discovery of the fossil of this relatively lanky, cat-sized animal with skinny legs, dog-like nose along and mammal-like teeth features only supports a growing consent that crocodiles, as species, were once far more diverse than they are today. it must be mentioned here that the fossilized remains clearly indicate that pakasuchus (even though at only 50 centimeters or 20 inches in length) has many trademark features that clearly categorizes it as a crocodilian. but its land-based lifestyle on the african floodplains far removed from its aquatic descendants and preying on dragon flies, lizards as well as other animals only point out its distinct mammal-like characteristics which make it a stand-out one in the history of crocodile community. according to patrick o' connor, lead author and associate professor of anatomy, ohio college of osteopathic medicine, “if you only looked at the teeth, you wouldn't think this was a crocodile. you would wonder what kind of strange mammal or mammal-like reptile it is”. it is him who named the species after kiswahili word for “cat”, the greek word for “crocodile” and in honor of the late prof. saidi kapilima, who was an important member of the expedition which was funded by the u.s. national science foundation and the national geographic society.
