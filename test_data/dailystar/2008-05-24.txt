of history and memory
there seems to be a great spurt of cultural activity in the city from literary, music and other events at the t2 café, i had written about earlier and last weekend, there was a well-attended panel discussion on fault lines: stories of 1971 edited by niaz zaman and asif farrukhi. this is a really important and groundbreaking collection, because it brings together, for the first time, so many different, moving and often, unflinching stories of that war, told by writers in both pakistan and bangladesh. i cannot presume to imagine/comment upon what anyone from bangladesh might have to say about this, but from this my own perspective i think the book can go a long way towards generating a meaningful dialogue.
taxes, the caretaker government and upl book sale
one of the areas that the caretaker government has not turned its reformist glance at is the exorbitant taxes imposed on imported books by bangladesh, as well as the indiscriminate way various governmental agencies apply it. it results in untold miseries for booksellers in terms of customs clearance and confusion about categories of books liable for taxation (textbooks on shakespeare, for example, may be taxed by one not-too-bright customs officer while let go under a loophole by another). it also has resulted in an ever-diminishing supply of quality books into bangladesh and a consequent pauperization of its intellectual and literate bases, never too strong to begin with. good foreign books are in short supply. they have become hideously expensive, a situation that causes outrage when one reflects on the fact that bangladesh has the highest tax rate on imported books in the whole of south asia. how can the nepalese and sri lankese (both in far more roiling national turmoil than us) pay less for the same book? and why? additional outrage is fueled by the knowledge that such taxes were originally imposed by unscrupulous elements in the domestic book publishing industry by lobbying past governments in order to have a captive market for their products. while their protectionist efforts were directed at books from west bengal ('if you can't match them, ban them' is the motto here), the indiscriminate application of such a duty meant that nearly all categories of imported books came under the ax. no amount of appeals to previous authorities, indifferent to issues of books and literacy, held hostage hand and foot by publishing lobbies, managed to have it even reviewed, let alone rescinded.

shaping fantasies to depict reality
shaheedul zahir suddenly died of a heart attack on march 23, 2008. he was only fifty four. his death left us speechless in grief. a writer of rare quality, he was perhaps the most gifted storyteller of his generation. in fact he was one of the all-time best bangladeshi writers of fiction. like james joyce, manik banerjee, kamalkumar majumder, syed waliullah and syed shamsul huq, he was a writer's writer. writing his fiction in the trend of magic realism, he emerged as the pioneer of this latin american genre in bangladesh. he was a bachelor. poet golam faruq khan, who was quite close to him, compares him with a tree of flowers which has fragrance but has no fruit. let me assure khan that zahir the writer bore fruits which will live for a hundred years or more and fascinate writers and readers for many, many years in the future.

writing in english is no longer the patrimony of the anglo saxons. under british colonial rule, english travelled almost the whole world, producing lots of writers in that king's language. the number is multiplying with the rise of postcolonial/diasporic consciousness. the situation is as if coloniser prospero (the tempest) is being rewritten by colonised caliban with the same language the latter was taught by the former for utilitarian purposes. the empire is writing back to its centre (rushdie). and thus is the number of writers in english rising across the globe. bangladesh too is not lagging behind. the trend initiated in india by raja rammohon roy and enriched by r.k.narayan, mulk raj anand, nirad c. chaudhuri et al has naturally flowed down to bangladesh. this can quite justifiably be called 'english writing in bangladesh' regardless of any nomenclature. adib khan, kaiser haq, razia khan amin and tahmima anam have emerged as the vanguard of this trend.

interpreter of people's lives
this is a revealing biography of amrita sher gil, who has remained a symbol of modern indian art since the early twentieth century. sher gil's passionate intensity and devotion to art placed her at the core of aesthetics in the indian sub-continent in the early 1930s. in her unfortunately short life, she blazed across the indian art scene and challenged the landscape of indian thoughts, feelings and imagination. she gave a touch of the modern to and a fresh look at indian modern art. the book deals extensively with the ins and outs of the painter. one can easily finish reading it in one sitting owing to its soothing and alluring language. the writer has tried to draw on all aspects of sher gil's brief life in her engaging work.
