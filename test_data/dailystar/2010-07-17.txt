bettering the scores at hsc
the results of this year's higher secondary certificate examinations are a clear cause for happiness. the reason is obvious. there has not been only a rise in the pass percentage but also an increase in the number of gpa-5 achievers. with the overall success rate of all the eight boards of education being 71.82 per cent and the number of gpa-5 achievers going up by 7,290 over the figures for last year, we think that the results augur well for the future of education in the country. there can be no denying that the standard of education at the school and college levels has been growing, with both teachers and students clearly ready and willing to put in their best efforts for maximum achievements at the exam. as for the system of teaching and examinations, it must be said that in the past few years the weaknesses which at times were noticed in them are gradually being removed and progress is really on track.
revenue collection up
this is for the third time in the last ten years that the national board of revenue (nbr) met the revenue collection target it had set for itself -- for the fiscal 2009-10. the amount collected stood at tk 62,007.47 crore reflecting a growth of 18 percent over that of the last fiscal. in fact, it has exceeded the target by a margin of tk 1,007 crore plus. this is not to forget, however, that part of the increase in revenue is due to tk 121.2 crore collected as tax on whitening of tk 923 crore in black money. the point to remember is also that poor collection from undisclosed incomes persists as a problem, partly legalistic and partly political, perhaps. view the page sports

'see how we shared beautiful time and space?' that was what she said, as i played with the raindrops on her cheeks, with the dew that glorified her lips, in our own pristine woods of grace and beauty. i caressed her nose.
