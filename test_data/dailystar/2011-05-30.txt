positive national attitude
i was proud to see the golden girls, our garment workers, who saved us from the recent worldwide recession. but how much respect do we pay to them? today a bookseller in nilkhet taught me the ethics of bargaining. though his way of teaching me shook my prestige, it opened my mind to the fact that we are all the diplomat of our culture. a rickshaw puller realizes 500/- taka fare from a foreigner for a short trip, he also fleeces thousands of tourists everyday.
israel's defiance!
most local english dailies on 20th may, reported the strong and uncompromising attitude of netanyahu (nothing-you-can -do) the israeli pm. that too against the head of the only global super-power; the president of usa! obama may be the president; he may have the votes of most americans; but netanyahu; or for that matter; any pm of israel holds more power than that in usa; on all matters that is jewish! yet that is the bitter reality, about the jewish power base in usa! these are the silent, powerful and committed american jews; who control the us government not to speak of the us president! even obama needs his thoughts and ideas to be cleared by his advisers (as reported in us weeklies). these powerful jews decide what us can say and do on matters that concerns jewish interests. hence obama was ticked off; straight from the proverbial 'horses mouth'!
the beast gets stuck
the car in which the us president moves around is nick named beast. the beast is usually air lifted in air force one, to where ever the us president travels. recently the us president was on a tour of europe/ england.
eliminate the difference
grade or divisions are nothing but the measures of merit of a student. there should have been no discrimination between the marking criteria between these two. unfortunately, some of the institutions do not maintain proper equality between grade and divisions. in division system, a student gets 1st division (highest rank) if he secures 60% marks. on the contrary, any student securing 'b' grade is understood to get 60% marks. nonetheless, many public or private institutions describe b+ or a- as 1st divisions! this is a great discrimination. because, a student must secure 65% and 70% marks in order to get b+ or a- respectively. due to this factor, many of the candidates do not qualify for better jobs though they are eligible! the education ministry should pay attention over this matter.
gentle dress for teachers
teachers are our mentors and role models. the parents are only the biological origin for the children but teachers are the initiator of the inner talent and enlightened character development of the students. everything of a teacher is likely to be followed by his/her learner. it is unfortunate that, basically in universities, the dresses of the lady teachers is so objectionable that sometimes it goes out of the limit. wearing gentle dress is no barrier to modernity. besides, the students of the universities are adults and concerned about every aspect around them. so, wearing dress in abhorrent manner can bring no good for the students as well as for the society as a whole. everyone must know that the moral and ethical degradation is an integrated factor of such occurrences!
telling lies
many of us tell lies to prove ourselves innocent, free from crime and punishment. this has become a common phenomenon in our life and society. most of the time whenever there is a theft or crime of any small natured the poor and people suffering from poverty are caught and given punishment. but whenever a rich influential or powerful person is found guilty of squandering or stealing a huge amount of money or committing a big crime he is treated differently, he is hardly given a small punishment, arrested or put into jail. this differences and discrimination always remain in case of judgment of a poor and a rich person.whether our law and order situation? whither our judiciary? justice delayed is always justice denied.
sound knowledge
a degree is a burden without sound knowledge. it is true not only for school, college and university but also for all the sectors of our life. our students always get good gpa but at the same time it is matter of shame that they cannot do well in the admission tests or in their job interviews. what is the reason for such failing? may be bookish knowledge is the main reason. so i request to all concerned to deeply think about the matter and point out how we can overcome this problem.
make impartial recruitment
the recruitment program of senior officer and officer govt. of janata bank is going on. written exam result has been published. the date of viva voce has been settled for june 3, 2011. 2500 candidates will face the viva voce. however, the daunting news is that the nbr personnel's have started verification process of personal assessment before the completion of exam formalities. consequently, whoever will be anti-govt. party will surely fail at last because the examiners will judge candidates based on local partisans' information without considering quality. it has created low spirits among the examinees. i hope that the authority will take necessary steps to recruit employees by a corruption free process.
who should be new md of imf?
the executive board of the international monetary fund said it intended to select a new managing director by the end of june as a successor to dominique strauss-kahn, who resigned this week after being charged with assaulting a maid at a new york hotel.
would professors lose job?
professors are considered as knowledge banks and experts of the society. they through their knowledge and expertise produce new theories and impart education to the students through careful and appropriate screening of the learning materials, book being the basic unit. but with the development of the internet now anyone can gather knowledge by search engines from among thousands of notes and references and can become expert. books are also losing their necessity and appeal among the learners. what professors do is to collect references from the internet and make them fit to the actual need for learning and learners by adding their own knowledge. now a student with minimum foundation knowledge can pursue higher education in any discipline. even the practical for science subjects can be done using the internet and other computerized teaching machines! is this an encouraging trend?
