rising dangers in afghanistan
how dangerous a place afghanistan continues to be has just been demonstrated yet once more. president hamid karzai has escaped assassination at the hands of the taliban and that too in the capital kabul. the incident proves the volatile nature of politics, or the lack of it, in the country. a number of global leaders have meanwhile condemned the incident and some have even lauded the brave work they believe karzai has been doing in his country. we, like everyone else, are happy that the afghan leader has survived the onslaught. at the same time, like everyone else, we feel that there are some intrinsic problems in or with afghanistan that need to be handled if a semblance of normalcy is to be restored there.

speculators welcome too!
a stunning blonde in a sharp business suit was announcing an early session rally in the djia (dow jones industrial average), the benchmark index for us markets, as i turned the tube on to cnn on a monday evening few weeks back. the rally, as the blonde continued, was driven by a rising general motors (gm) stock, a major component of the djia, on announcement of fy2007 financial results. most of us would assume, naturally, bumper profits in 2007 pushed the stock higher. but actually not so, gm made no profit rather a staggering us$ 38.7bn loss in 2007, the largest in the history of the auto industry! so why is the stock going up on heavy volume?

bangladesh and ict
ict plays a vital role in economic and social development of a country. it not only develops the communication technology but also increases the productivity of a country. but it is a matter of regret that bangladesh is lagging behind in the ict sector. the world economic forum has issued 'the global information technology report' 2007-08 on the basis of the following things: quick internet facilities, poverty alleviation, ensuring national activities through maximum utilisation of ict, inventions and e-skills, business network, transmission for it generation etc. in that report bangladesh has been given the 124th position out of 127 countries, our it ranking and the score is 2.65 which is very shameful for us. in south asia, computer came first in bangladesh. yet we are lagging behind other nations in the region. the position of other countries are nepal 119th (2.88), pakistan 89th (3.37), sri lanka 79th (3.58), india 50th (4.06). on the other hand, some poverty, hunger, war affected countries have done very well. but it is a very interesting development that the present government is issuing licence for call centre. it is a positive sign of improvement in the it sector. bangladesh needs a definite plan. it has a lot of potential in this sector and also a bright future.
research and wildlife
years have lapsed since we spoke against the aerial seismic survey in the sundarbans that was envisioned by shell company in september 2003. now it's chevron's turn to take steps to conduct aerial seismic survey (ass) in lawachhara forest and in addition we hear there will be small charges of seismic explosives (biodegradable they claim). lawachhara is a forest very rich in flora and fauna. our concern is why are we heading for this survey in the first place? if a better prospect of gas is found in the area, will the next step be to start digging up the forest to claim the gas fields? in the past during the bnp government, the pipeline was laid through the lawachhara forests and announced when it was nearing completion. can our forest department or for that matter moef take decisions without public opinion? the first lesson in democracy tells us to seek public opinion for state owned property.
national id
i was awfully shocked when i received my national id card. i could not recognise my photograph in the card. those who came to collect their respective national id card were flabbergasted to see their photographs. they could not, like me, recognise their own pictures. not a single person was satisfied with the distorted photograph in the identity card. crores of taka have been spent by the government for the national id card. the photograph in the identity card is neither colour nor black and white. it is simply an irritating and confusing picture.
water crisis
we read very frequently about the drinking water crisis in dhaka city. how can the consumers expect safe drinking water when dhaka wasa does not use sufficient doses of chemicals to kill the bacteria, but they pay the bills to the suppliers of chemicals!!
fare hike
the news of government fixing fares of cng-run autorickshaws and ac/ non-ac taxicabs published in the daily star on 04/2008 has not had any impact on the situation.
food crisis
bangladesh's poor people are bearing the brunt of the food price rise as part of the global food crisis. according to a large number of critics the cause of the present food problem in bangladesh is the inefficiency of the caretaker government. if we do not try to understand the problem in the global context, then the government or the public will not be able to solve or alleviate the food problem to reduce the sufferings of the poor.
eight-year old accused!
it was a news report in the daily star that an 8-year old girl was arrested for drug peddling. i cannot understand why the law enforcers did not apply their common sense and work out that an eight-year old could not commit such a crime. they should have understood that even if an eight-year old girl is found with drugs, she is to be treated as a victim of the circumstances. however, she was freed eventually. i would like to thank the reporter and the ds team.
national women policy
after reading the daily star report on the ulema council's review comments on the national women policy, i feel it necessary as a citizen of bangladesh to put in my "two cents" on several of the issues debated by the ulema council as presented in the ds report.
commuter's life
this objective oriented diagnosis is for finding a solution-- so i studied my daily commuting experience in dhaka metropolitan city (dc) roads. we need a turnaround or i call it “branding” to make the road management effective. this does not require 'rocket science software', as deming's plan-do-check-act pdca cycle - a world class execution recipe, can do it effectively.
love for animals
our treatment of animals should be full of sympathy. but not all of us show sympathy. animals are often mistreated or killed unnecessarily. they are subdued for man's pleasure.
working women
in our country, a high percentage of non-working women have husbands with a high level of income. another important finding is that less educated women have more children than more educated women, regardless of their working status. the level of education and work status of women would determine the variation in their performance in different areas at home. as expected, non-working women are found to spend more time in child care, personal care and other activities at home than working women. on the other hand, working women are found to be more efficient in raising mentally- developed and well- adjusted children. working women take greater control in decision making at home than non-working women. husbands seem to be more satisfied with the non-working wives than the working wives. a greater percentage of unhappy wives are also working women. job satisfaction of working women can only make up partially for their discontent regarding child care and house care.
people in trouble
due to the whimsical actions of the present government and especially due to the abnormally high prices of essential commodities like rice, oil, pulses etc, the common people find themselves in a very difficult situation.

“babu” english
the interview piece on babu english by ahmede hussain on bangladeshi writer in english tabish khair (ds star weekend magazine, 14- 3- 08) was interesting, but ticklish for the lay readers. the questions were of intellectual level; but it is encouraging to note that bangladeshi writers are appearing in the world of global english (latest t aman).
