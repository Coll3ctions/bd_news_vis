bangladeshi workers in distress
bangladeshis employed in saudi arabia are in dire straits. that is the truth which comes out in the media. over the past few months, saudi policemen have been hunting down bangladeshis and sending them off to deportation centres despite many of them possessing perfectly valid papers. as a number of anguished bangladeshis now in the kingdom have made it clear, the saudi police pay no heed to the fact that those they go after are legally permitted to work in the country. in many cases, when our workers show their absolutely genuine papers to the police, the latter commit the sheer outrage of tearing them up and hauling these hapless people off to the deportation centres as a step towards sending them back to bangladesh. amidst such grossly unacceptable behaviour, the workers are unable to collect their belongings or call their employers.
diarrhoeal pressure grows
let's get one thing straight: the diarrhoeal situation is not frightening, but its incidence at this time of the year is certainly higher than recorded previously. diarrhoea usually breaks out at the beginning and towards the end of the rainy season. but somehow there is a departure from the pattern as the affliction is noticeable much ahead of the rainy season, at least six weeks too early. why so? the experts are yet to find an explanation for the early appearance of the water-borne disease; but we think, the precipitation of the malady can be put down to deteriorating sanitary conditions together with acute scarcity of potable water in the city.

changes from within
"could you please bring a cup of tea for the guest?" -- this was the starting point of a conversation photographer saiful huq omi recorded. omi was interviewing nazmun nahar mukul, president of a water management association in patuakhali. the request does not sound unusual, yet in our country -- particularly in rural areas -- we do not hear a wife asking her husband to make tea that often. this was a sign of change, the photographer observed. a change from within.

kali o kolom
the march 2008/chaitra 1414 issue of the country's premier mainstream literary magazine is especially strong, sadly enough, in its in-memoriums to a scholar, an artist and a poet. gulam murshid writes an engrossing eulogy of writer-academic-essayist shibnarayan rai, who died on 26th february, which pens a portrait of a superior mind and a generous individual. he recounts an amusing story about the late professor ahmed sharif of dhaka university enquiring of the author whether shibnarayan was a cia agent since the latter had abandoned his youthful marxism. shamarjit rai chowdhury writes about artist debdas chakravarty, while shouvik reza charmingly recalls the fifties poet pranabendhu das gupta, one of whose most well-known poems sadar street verandah. there is a translation of a short story by american author jay mcinerney, whose novel bright lights big city was a phenomenal success. this is the first time perhaps that a contemporary american author has been translated in kali o kolom and mcinerney is a good choice to introduce the journal’s readers to current american fiction and authors. among other notable articles are a short story, chaka bhangar golpo, by jahanara nausheen, an essay on the french poet/enfant terrible arthur rimbaud, a travel piece on a vientiane market by mainus sultan, and a look, informative if sometimes repetitive, at our poets of the seventies by mamun mustafa.

bypassing the malacca straits
the straits of malacca, the shortest sea route from east and southeast asia to the indian subcontinent, the middle east, africa and europe, has increasingly suffered from congestion as asia's integration in international trade has deepened. today, around 1,300-1,400 ships per day cross the straits, while 600 dock at singapore daily. less than two miles wide at its narrowest, the straits can easily be locked during a conflict, thus interrupting the flow of trade and, more importantly, of vital resources such as oil. in addition, piracy and terrorism are a constant threat in the straits. therefore, in order to secure sea-lanes and facilitate east-west movement between the indian ocean and the south china sea, concretizing alternatives to the straits of malacca - some of which had been thought of as early as the 18th century - has now become an imperative.
