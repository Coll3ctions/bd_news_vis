red rug to a local al leader?
the only 'fault' of shamsunnahar dolly, the vice-chairman of dasmina upazila in patuakhali district in the eye of the local organising secretary of al iqbal mahmud, seemed to be that the former raised a legitimate concern at a coordination committee meeting over graft suspected to have been committed behind the collapse of an under-construction local college building. she could barely finish proposing formation of a committee to probe the incident including alleged misuse of 30 tonnes of rice allotted to the development of a college playground, when an enraged al leader swooped on her. he hurled abusive language at her, and adding insult to injury, she reportedly got manhandled, too. view the page sports

technology and environment
a paradox of technology is that it can be both a cause for environmental damage and again our best hope in repairing such damage today and avoiding it in the future. actually, the present environmental problems call for more environmentally benign technology. in the context, many believe that the solution of today's social and environmental problems is possible through more and better technology -- not from less technology. however, it requires achieving a radical change there like a shift away from hydrocarbon-based energy technologies to greener options like renewable energy source, or innovative technology to treat pollutant or adaptation technology to adjust to the climate change impacts.

of abantikumar sanyal and romain rolland
romain rolland (1866-1944), the french nobel laureate for literature in 1915, was one of the pioneering western philosophers who played a role in disseminating indian spiritual philosophy in the west. he developed links with many bengali figures, such as rabindranath tagore (1861-1941) and jagadish chandra bose (1858-1937). his biographies called vie de ramakrishna (1929) and vie de vivekananda (1930) promoted indian spiritual ideologies across the world. all such facts have meticulously been researched by the bengali writer abantikumar sanyal (1926-2007), who was born in tradition-rich village korokdi in district faridpur and who has two books on rolland and two translations of rolland's books to his credit.
memories of old dhaka: thoughts after visiting pogose school
last summer, my wife informed me that she was planning to take some of her students to bangladesh. “interesting!” i remarked, and went back to the newspaper story i was reading about a new archeological discovery in the valley of the kings in egypt, an area we visited a few years ago. i am not sure if it was my apparent lack of interest in her project, or my total immersion in my new passion, egyptology, that prompted her next remark. “well, if you join us, you will be able to travel in bangladesh almost for free.” that added attraction obviously tipped the scales for me.

karzai promises to take charge by 2014
afghanistan, the frontier of president bush's "war on terror" that his successor president obama has embraced fully, continues to remain insecure and victory in the war is still as elusive as it was when it started 9 years ago. the main objective of that war was to destroy the taliban that held power and had given sanctuary to al qaeda for its operations against us and western interests and capture osama ben laden for allegedly masterminding the 9/11 attacks. although the talibans have been driven out of power, they have found new and impregnable sanctuary in the no man's land between pakistan and afghanistan. osama ben laden is still free and the talibans are on a resurgent mode in afghanistan.

questions of faith and travels in poetry
a major problem involved in dealing with emily dickinson is the essentially reclusive nature of her individuality. in death she has been what she was in life, a symbol of obscurity and distance for those who would study her poetry and with it her personality. and then comes another problem. and that is fundamentally the difficulty in an understanding as well as appreciation of her poetry. scholars of american literature, and not just in the united states, have gone to various lengths in attempting explanations of her poetic works and yet, in more instances than one, have quite been unable to present dickinson in clearly outlined dimensions before readers. that has been quite a tragedy.
on stage, playing various roles
autobiographies are generally interesting for the obvious reason that they deal with graphic and narrative accounts of different events and that often range from the early days of the individual to the last ones. when the writer has varied experiences professionally and otherwise finding an opportunity of traversing in different occupational fields at times in somewhat conflicting ones an autobiography may be even more exciting. mosaic of memories more or less falls in this category as the autobiographer seeks to bring the readers to the changing pattern of six decades that cover the period between his initial schooling and the last of several professions he has been in including a politician contesting national elections, despite the fact that this stint has not been very fascinating as far as electoral success is concerned. but the bottom line is that the author had the unique opportunity of working as a teacher, civil servant, international bureaucrat, lawyer and last but not the least politician. whether politics is a “profession” or not like the earlier professions of a.t.m.shamsul haque may be a subject of intense debate, but this in the nearly last phase of his career definitely provided enthusiasm and stimulation to a person whose student life especially during prime time in college and at dhaka university was not devoid of student politics that was also somewhat inextricably linked with the national political psyche.
a quietly charged tale
human life can turn tragic corners without any notice and yet leave traces on the cycle of eternity, leave stigma that refuses to go away. nicky dillon and her father stumble upon a new born baby left in the snow in the woods. they take the baby to the nearby hospital and save the infant. however, the hospital authority notifies the police and the inquiries begin. from this moment nicky and her father's lives change and overnight they become the hot news of new hampshire, the place where they live.
criminal men
mario puzo's classic work the godfather was immensely popular when it first hit bookstores throughout the globe. based on the saga of the corleones, the topmost crime family of new york, the much acclaimed novel and probably the best known work of puzo wowed the readers . so it was not a surprise when it got its exposure on the silver screen of hollywood. but the book in review, the godfather returns, is not a sequel to the original puzo masterpiece or the script of any hollywood flicks with pierce brosnan in the leading role. so godfather enthusiasts are likely to be a little bit disappointed by the feat of mark winegardner, who has incorporated new characters and made experimentations with some characters in the plot of the story. but on the whole, winegardner deserves kudos for this brilliant piece of work.
