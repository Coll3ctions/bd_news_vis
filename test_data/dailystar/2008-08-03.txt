providing false, incomplete information to ec
it is obvious that the election commission is in a state of helplessness. that happens to be so because a number of candidates for the city corporation and municipal elections are taking part in the polls despite their non-compliance with mandatory provisions regarding furnishing some specific personal information to the ec. the non-compliance is of two sorts. the first relates to their submission of false information about themselves in the affidavit, while the second concerns incomplete information they have supplied to the ec. it is quite understandable, therefore, that as election day approaches (and that is tomorrow), the ec will be perturbed without in any way being able to do anything at this late stage to prevent such people from taking part in the elections.
stuttering fp programme
we are concerned at the slow progress in containing the baby boom for which the millennium development goal (mdg-5) is likely to be difficult to attain by 2015. mdg was set at reducing total fertility rate (tfr) to 2.2 percent by 2010. according to bangladesh demographic health survey 2007, the tfr in the period 1993-94 was 3.4 percent, which came down to 2.7 in 2007 but did not come down any further. poor management of the programme is widely considered the main reason for the stagnancy in achieving the target.
gateway to gas
i had the privilege of participating in a very recent workshop on "gas sector reform roadmap and gas demand -- supply balance" of the gas sector development program, organised jointly by the asian development bank (adb) and technoconsult international limited (tcil). frankly speaking, "reform" and "roadmap" are the key words that drove me to this workshop. usage of the terms reform and roadmap are so common nowadays that they cease to be nouns, but noises. what then are the roadmap and reforms regarding our gas sector -- the linchpin of growth and development?
the woes of our migrant workers
the unwarranted violence and arrest of our migrant workers by the kuwaiti police for staging strikes in demand of promised pay and other facilities, is an extremely shocking piece of news. this was front-page news on the daily star and other national dailies on july 31, accompanied by a picture of a deported worker in bandages and wearing a bloodstained t-shirt, who was reported to be dragged out of his residential camp and was mercilessly beaten up by the police though he did not take part in any protests.
taliban resurgence in pakistan
despite president bush's description of pakistan as a "strong ally and vibrant democracy" during the recent visit to washington by prime minister yousuf raza gilani, a suspected us missile attack inside pakistan that reportedly killed a top taliban biological and chemical weapons expert underscores us suspicion that pakistan is not doing enough in the fight against extremists and terrorists and afghan president karzai's accusation that pakistan military intelligence is not doing its best to prevent cross-border militancy by afghan talibans from their sanctuary in some areas of the federally administrated tribal areas (fata). view the page sports

business ethics an oxymoron?
the other day i was invited to give a guest lecture on 'business ethics' to a group of bachelors of business administration (bba) students at north south university. as i opened the talk i posed the question whether based on our day-to-day experience the phrase is a contradiction in terms. of course with the arthur andersens, enrons, parmalats, and bdfoods of the world fresh in our memory, it is hard to imagine that businesses can be anything but self-serving amoral institutions devoted to mindless profiteering.

dying forests
once our country was noted for its lush greenery. people from all over the world would call this country the “daughter of nature”. but the matter of great regret is that over the years our country has lost its beauty. for example now if we go to madhupur we will see that most of those sal trees of this area have been demolished. only a few sal trees can be seen in the madhupur forests. the same appalling situation can be seen in the cht and in the greater sylhet district. unlawful encroachment, illicit trade in forest-produce, incompatible use of forest land, lack of conservation initiatives to protect the flora and fauna, increased salinity, lack of accountability of the forest officials, absence of people's involvement in forest managementall these are the main reasons behind deforestation. this deforestation has severely affected our economic and ecological stability, forest dwellers and wildlife. we know well that a country needs 25% forest on its total land mass. but we have only 8% or 9% forests. so from this we can easily realise that very soon our country will turn into a desert, unless we, the citizens, do something to protect our forests.
election monitoring
the lead news in the daily star internet edition is that "5500 local and international observers to monitor polls". there might be lot of people in bangladesh who would be delighted to see the news and at the same time disagree with my opinion on the question of observers monitoring the elections in bangladesh. firstly, i am totally against any foreign or local observer doing the work: and, secondly, i find it disgraceful to the nation. these events have so far successfully managed to demonise the role and authority of the election commission and grown as "orchid " bodies to deter the growth of the ec as an independent and neutral institution, fully capable of conducting and monitoring the entire electoral process.
water logging
it is a sheer disappointment to see the water logging of dhaka city after rain. it makes me wonder whether our engineers are aware of the fact that one of the most important design considerations of road construction is drainage. this is needed to remove water efficiently from the surface of the roads to provide a safe passage for all vehicles and pedestrians. drainage of rainwater minimizes road maintenance cost and hence maximizes the operational lifetime of the roads. it is a simple math.
worldwide poverty
i very much enjoyed the article by abdul bayes, professor of economics at jahangirnagar university, on poverty traps. we in the united states are watching the middle class consumers dropping into the poverty ranks. americans are losing their homes and their jobs and the situation is becoming most unpleasant.
missing children

upazila elections
the government is holding the upazila elections before parliamentary elections. it is one of the good initiatives by the military backed caretaker government. but the political parties have opposed the plan. their attitude is undemocratic. the local government is constitutionally non-partisan.
razakar issue
one of your writers stated that it was not befitting for a party founded by a valiant freedom fighter like ziaur rahman to include jamaat in its folds.
a mute ec ?
after so-called 1/11, this government has taken different initiatives to reform some statutory bodies. ec, acc, psc, ugc etc. the motivation behind this venture was to strengthen the bodies, so that they can introduce and implement the rules for the welfare of mass people. we became very optimistic over their verbose expressions. they have arranged so many discussions, seminars, dialogues, campaigns or even finally 'road show' to form public opinion in favour of them. but what is going on in their 'test case'? in city corporation & municipality elections, are they being successful? the answer is 'no'. absolutely not.
a terrorist's stand
"to kill the devil you need an evil, i want to be the one"...this is what came out of the mouth of the renowned terrorist khondokar tanvir islam (joy). most interestingly, while he was released from jail on bail and taking treatment from a calcutta hospital under police surveillance, he spoke freely to the local media about some ground realities. there are a group of people namely opportunist groups of politicians, who are part of our society, same are a big group of bureaucrats and religion based fundamentalists, looting the country for long time...joy wants to expose these groups of people. i think our government should welcome his return and facilitate his activity, so that he is able to perform those noble duties which the government could not!
muslims and followers of other religions
it is an unpleasant truth that the muslims in this subcontinent (and in the middle east as well) are generally 'taught' to hate the jews. dr. syed ashraf ali, the renowned islamic thinker, is perhaps the only islamic scholar in the subcontinent who over and again reminds the muslims that the holy prophet muhammad (sm) always considered islam to be the only deen chosen by allah, but he never hated the jews or the christians. dr. ali has cited a historic incident in numerous television discourses and write-ups. when a bier carrying a jew's corpse was passing by, the holy prophet of islam (sm) stood up to show respect. he also urged his disciples to do the same.
water resources
bangladesh is a plain land of alluvial soil. we have canals and water reservoirs ( on the sides of roads and railway) owned by the govt. these water bodies/reservoirs can be developed to a high potential water resource for agricultural irrigation in dry season, fisheries etc. it will also contribute to environmental development to a great extent.
ssc results and second shift
going through a daily newspaper on 02-07-08, i learned that the education ministry had asked the principals of established colleges at dhaka to open second shift in their respective colleges, so that they can accommodate the surplus students who will not be able to take admission in those colleges for want of seats, though they have got a+ in the public exam. the chairman of the dhaka board has also urged them to introduce second shift. i disagree with them in this regard. at the same time i would like to request the government to turn the colleges at upazila headquarters into model college.

biman's new captain
an ad appeared in your daily that biman needed an md to be recruited. this is for the first time that open invitation to fill in the post has been made. traditionally appointment to the post used to be made by the government mostly by selecting a civil or military bureaucrat without any aviation background, airline operation knowledge and experience in business affairs. they ran biman like a government office and naturally cut sorry figures. a cost accountant and an infantry officer were the md for a good number of years. efficiency and commercial considerations were sacrificed at the altar of favouritism.

two roads in bad shape
the road at 47/3/d saatnagar, jigatola, left , is flooded with dirty water as its sewerage line is blocked with garbage. besides, tannery effluents from nearby hazaribagh mix with the water to make it stinky. most pedestrians have to hire a rickshaw or a rickshaw-van to avoid dirt. in spite of informing the authorities several times no measures have been taken to fix the situation till now. the picture at right shows a road lies just 100 metres away from ward commissioner's office at ward 27 near the busy madartek bazar. the road is riddled with stray pieces or uneven bricks for months. but the authorities turn a blind eye to the sufferings of the people.
