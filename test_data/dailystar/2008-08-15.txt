murder most foul . . .
we observe today, as we have for the last so many years, the anniversary of the assassination of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and his family members with due solemnity. it remains our belief, as well as that of everyone else who believes in decency and a sense of morality, that the murder of the nation's founding father was a terrible blow to our self-esteem as a nation and to the fabric of our national politics. the question of politics apart, the fact is that throughout his life bangabandhu symbolised for us the struggle that needed to go, and indeed did go, into the emergence of a people ready and willing to make supreme sacrifices in defence of collective national dignity. when he was cut down on august 15, 1975, it was not merely the fall of an individual but the collapse, however temporarily, of a symbol as well.
ec should pursue the matter till the end
the ec's move to have tax, wealth and police records of the winners at the city corporation and municipality polls probed by the nbr and the police department for their veracity is a move we support. set against the backdrop of a universal public demand for a break with the past in terms of having public representatives with clean records and reported apprehensions that persons with dubious distinctions might have crept back into reckoning, this measure by the ec should be helpful in clearing the air of any misgiving. in fact, this step will strengthen newly elected leaders to carry out their task, assuming that they come clean.
august 15, 1975 -- and the long darkness after
bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, with most members of his family, was gunned down in the pre-dawn hours of august 15, 1975. when daylight broke, it was an eerie scene at 32 dhanmondi, the spot that had been witness to so much of history in the lives of the people of bangladesh. bangabandhu's body, as also those of everyone else, lay where they had fallen the whole day and the night that followed. soldiers swarmed everywhere. cameramen, all serving the government at different points, were brought in to record what remains the most gruesome episode in the history of bangladesh. it was not until the next day that most of the dead were buried in banani.
the day they killed bangabandhu
it was friday, august 15, 1975. it was one of the most tragic days of our history. it reminded us of the dark night of march 25, 1971. the father of the nation, loved and respected in bangladesh and the world over as a great hero, lay dead on the stairs of his famous residence at road number 32, dhanmandi residential area. he was only fifty-five. we were twenty-year-old sophomores of dhaka university.
the remorseful day
"after the torchlight red on sweaty faces
after the frosty silence in the gardens
after the agony in stone places
the shouting and the crying
prison and palace and reverberations
of thunder of spring over distant mountains
he who was living is now dead ..."

on the 15th of this month, when my daughter-in-law and her son came back from abroad, a heartrending incident occurred. their arrival at zia international airport was after midnight. my son went to receive them, and the driver was on the wheel. since the driver lives in gazipur and we live in gulshan, my son decided to drop him near the bus stop a little distance away from the airport, thinking he would reach home quicker. there the driver got into a baby-taxi ready to leave with three other passengers for gazipur. hardly the taxi was in motion when our driver lost consciousness, only to discover himself the next day lying in a field and so were the other two passengers, with their money and belongings gone.

english language skills
in the mid-sixties, during my short stint as a lecturer in one of the premier colleges of our country, what i experienced is worth remembering in retrospect even after a lapse of about half a century, particularly in the present social context. in those days, except the vernacular subject, teachers used to deliver class lectures in english. students generally were comfortable with the language. their verbal presentation of the subject matter in english was quite satisfactory. in the educated segment of society a good number of people used to read, write and often speak english. civil servants, especially those at the helm, were at ease with the english language. their conference speech, press briefing etc were a matter of treat, often punctuated with wit and humour.

august 1975 was a transitional time in bangladesh. mujib was making radical administrative changes and adopting measures that would have a tremendous social impact. there was only one political party in the country now -- the bangladesh krishak sramik awami league (baksal). baksal on which all sections of the people, including the armed forces and the police, were represented, would be an integral part of the administration. the importance of bureaucrats would diminish, when the governors-designate of the districts took up their new offices on 1 september 1975. the army was to be split and made to join in productive work at the district level. it was a revolutionary step.
memories of bangabandhu
