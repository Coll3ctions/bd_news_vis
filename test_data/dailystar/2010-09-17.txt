national child policy a positive move
the draft national child policy 2010 makes much sense given the realities attendant on the conditions of bangladesh's children in the last many decades. children in this country have generally been at the losing end of any meaningful deal, especially in terms of policy and governance. besides, even if there have been moves to ensure the welfare of children, few if any follow-up measures, such as implementation, have come into play. this truth is borne out by the pitiful conditions in which children at the ultra-poor level continue to live, with little access to health safety measures and education.

vulture and anthrax
the other day a report in atn news on vulture has admirably awakened my feelings while the country has been threatened by anthrax (a highly infectious animal disease, especially cattle and sheep; it can be transmitted to people). according to the news item, vulture, an ecologically vital bird, helps stop germs from breaking out after it eats dead cattle and sheep. in their absence if some other animals like dogs and cats or any other birds eat the dead cattle, it opens the road to dangerous diseases like anthrax. because they do not have the resistance power to kill the germ even after digestion.
rmg workers
recently, the government announced the new wages of the garment workers, though it has been rejected. as a result , the workers vandalised the garment factories and commercial buildings in gulshan, banani and tejgaon. the aggressive workers also set fire to many vehicles. the demand of increasing their wages has been there for many years.
unhygienic

iraq war
the most tragic incident during this decade is iraq war that ended with the declaration of barrack obama, the president of the usa. the last us troops have left iraq. the us vice president was present at that moment. generally, the question arises in our mind -- what is the outcome of this war where the us govt. lost 3 trilion dollars. today barrack obama could not say that the mission was accomplished and they are victorious. in the name of establishing democracy, the then us president bush started the war against iraq but his mission has failed miserably.
tortured boy
your dinajpur correspondent's report of september 2 is disgusting reading. is the 'madrassa' teacher(?) a man or a beast? he should be taken to police custody, and criminally prosecuted; and punished in an exemplary manner; to set an example. to begin with; he should be immediately sacked from his job!

osds
an editorial was published in the ds on 31.08.10 on osds, containing a few logical arguments in favour of the osds which in some ways may console them. the daily star deserves thanks for bringing the important issue to the knowledge of the citizens of the country so outspokenly. outwardly, the arguments are partial and inadequate to describe the predicament of the incumbents. there are some posts of the republic which some people have to fulfil or serve either on pursuance or diktat of the concerned ministry like: directors/director generals (dg) of he prime minister's office (pmo), deputy commissioners (dc), divisional commissioners, private secretaries (ps) to the ministers or top brass of any government etc. generally, bureaucrats of capability, knowledge, honesty and repute are chosen or selected for those positions. though sometimes partisan people also get those honourable positions, thanks to their political tilt, but in most cases honesty, reputation and efficiency are the main considerations for these postings.

during daytime hundreds of overloaded trucks enter sylhet city which make the lives of commuters hazardous.
poor performance
the planning commission's extension by two more years of the project implementation time for shifting the hazardous tannery industries outside the capital city exposes the government's wanton disregard for public health. this decision shows the government's negligence to ensuring affordable health service to poor and rural people. the ngos and the private clinics are capitalizing on the poor health services in the public hospitals that suffer a lot from shortage of doctor. the doctors find no time to attend the rural health centres as they are busy making money working in the private clinics in the upazila towns. but who is there to monitor them? heath being one of the major human rights, the government cannot look the other way while the teeming millions wallow in ailments.
princess diana
we lost diana in 1996. this loss can never be compensated for. her death got massive media coverage which raised several questions. some people say that to escape the journalists, her car faced the accident. if so, journalists must be more tolerant in their attitude towards the celebrities. it is regrettable that some people were unduly interested in her personal life.
ensure quality
some companies by dint of quality of their products and service prove themselves qualified and acceptable to all concerned and become branded. in this way they earn confidence of the people. if the products of the companies fail to give desired results it goes against the name of the company and earns bad name. as for example ge, siemens, abb etc. likewise educational institutions also get branded. students coming out of these branded institutions are obviously good and subsequently are also found good while performing in their respective fields. as for example, dhaka university, buet etc. the branded companies further upgrade their products and the institution takes pride in their students when they are found performing as per expectation. when they fail the companies and the institutions are blamed for their bad performance. after getting the feedback they try to correct themselves to improve the quality of their products so as to maintain the quality as before or better.

tony blair's memoir
with respect to prime minister tony blair's new memoir "a journey" i would like to offer the following comments.
“judicial overreach”
i could not agree with ahrar ahmad as to his contention of "judicial over-reach", published in the daily star on september 04, 2010. constitutionally, the supreme court has authority to interpret or declare any law unconstitutional, if it so appears. mr ahmad may minutely go through the verdicts regarding 5th and 7th amendments. the court has not passed any law. the parliamentary commission has already started to work towards re-writing the constitution as per the judgments. yes, it's parliament which enacts law or amends constitution, but the apex court has the inherent authority to interpret or correct the same in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, as it is also in the united states and other democratic countries.
billion dollar loan
in his letter of august 16 mr. ali wrote that the billion dollar loan provided by india's exim bank is on the key condition that 85% of all commodities purchased through the loan money will have to be from india. this means that 85% of the billion dollar, i.e. 850 million dollars, will go back to india. i quote from the letter "repayment of a billion dollar loan will severely deplete our foreign reserves. bangladesh could've spent the billion dollars internally to develop its infrastructure, which would have positive effects on the local economy, instead of spending 850 million dollars in india." if it is so, i must say that by this so called loan of friendship, india is simply strengthening its market in bangladesh.
