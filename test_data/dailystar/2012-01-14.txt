farewell to lovely time
a wintry breeze is towing my soul somewhere
i go out for a drive to see
how my city looks when winter emerges
and roll down the window glass of my car
to feel the chilly light wind beat in . . .

you suffer desperately, weighed down
by the parting with your beloved
somebody belongs to none

cyber-terrorism: truth or hyperbole?
the debate on cyber-terrorism ranges from predictions of an 'electronic pearl harbor,' where chaos and destruction resulting from cyber-terrorism attacks on critical infrastructure and communication systems would result in riots, panic and death, to the dismissal of any genuine threat and attributing the media and government as contributors to the hyperbole. to derive a pragmatic opinion on the contemporary threat posed by cyber-terrorism, a non-partisan analysis of definitions, perceptions and facts must be undertaken. view the page star books review
tale told by an unusual heroine
war really does strange things to otherwise ordinary human beings. in 1971, the bengalis of east pakistan were caught up in a bitter armed struggle to rid itself of west pakistani hegemony to realize the sovereign independent nation-state of bangladesh. the rest is history. snippets of that history are recounted in accurate details in niaz zaman's novel a different sita. but it is a fictional story that is interspersed with actual political events that led up to the burst of hostilities that the west pakistani military visited on the bengali nation on 25 march 1971. almost the entire novel is restricted to the close to nine months of the conflict that formally ended with the surrender of lt. gen. aak niazi to lt. gen. jagjit singh aurora on 16 december of that year.
the rocky ascent of condoleezza rice

(colin powell decided it was the better part of valor to let a sympathetic biographer give his version of how he was circumvented and, finally, sidelined.)
