an indomitable spirit
azam khan, the pop legend who had been ailing from cancer, passed away on june 5, 2011. earlier, after having been diagnosed with oral cancer, the singer went to singapore twice and had undergone chemotherapy and tomotherapy. but khan didn't complete the full course and returned to the country. cancer spread all over his hand and body, resulting in his sudden collapse. renowned artiste sabina yasmin and her husband, singer-musician kabir suman, visited khan just a few months ago at his residence in kamalapur. khan was looking confident to stage a recovery and come back to the music scene to entertain millions of his fans once again. but fate had other plans. the void the “pop guru” has left is irreparable. i was there when sabina yasmin, kabir suman and noted cultural personality and lawmaker asaduzzaman noor visited azam khan and managed to speak to the ailing artiste. this is the last interview (to my knowledge) given by azam khan to the media. the interview was taken on march 27, 2011. excerpts from the interview:

police state accusation
the markedly suave mirza fakhrul islam, secretary general of bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) was visibly angry on june 5, 2011, while reacting to police actions during hartal . according to the bengali daily prothom alo , he said that there is no democracy in the country, which has now turned into a police state where the police obstructs a peaceful hartal . he further added that their workers were not even allowed to stay on the footpath and warned that such actions would compel them to resort to longer hartals.
prime minister is fed up
the terrorist and the policeman both come from the same basket. this was proved again at delhi this week when a religious leader, baba ramdev, was fasting before thousands of his followers. policemen of different organisations belonging to the centre and the states came like tons of bricks on the sleeping crowd and dispersed them, using even tear gas. the baba was physically removed, leaving many injured, some seriously.
hyperactivity syndrome
some people holding high positions in society and the government often behave and talk most erratically and irrationally, lowering the image of the office they hold. their public manner sometimes borders on stupidity. in our country, these types of people are not too few. they are always espousing policies they consider most viable and hold on to them, defying public criticism. they are always fulminating about enemies they perceive to see surrounding them.
bcs examination: an afterthought
let me start with a question: what are the candidates tested on in the bcs examination? a few days ago, a preliminary test of the 31st bcs examination was held across the country. i happened to look at the test items, which were all multiple-choice questions. i was wondering about whether or not the knowledge and skills required to pass the exam were worth knowing. i was not sure about how they would be useful in the "real-life" contexts in which the participants would need to perform in the future.
13th amendment and future of democracy
throughout history, important constitutional cases have had far-reaching and, at times, disastrous consequences. in 1857, in dred scott case, the us supreme court declared slavery lawful. the result was the american civil war. in 1955, in tamizuddin khan's case (pld 1955 federal court 240), although the chief court at sindh declared the governor general's decision to dissolve pakistan's constituent assembly unlawful, the federal court (with justice cornelius dissenting) reversed that decision. chief justice munir was suspected of complicity with the armed forces. it is however widely believed that without that judgment, democracy would not have suffered that terrible fate in pakistan.

stories behind 1913 nobel award
in 1913, rabindranath tagore (1861-1941) was awarded the nobel prize for literature. he was the first non-european to receive it. his coming by the nobel created much excitement not only in india but outside it as well. rabindranath, not at all known outside india before the publication of his gitanjali in its english version in november 1912 from london, made millions of people sit up and take notice of him through the prize. william butler yeats (1865-1939), a reputed irish poet even before 1913 and eventually a nobel laureate himself, in 1923, was a great admirer of rabindranath during his gitanjali days, though he did not rejoice at the declaration of the nobel committee on november 13, 1913. a study of nobel nominations will perhaps give us an idea of the process involved. on 10 december every year the year's laureate has to receive the prize and deliver a lecture. very recently the web site of the nobel committee released a wealth of information that gives us a fresh perspective on the nobel process itself.
nazrul and tagore: two contrasting offerings
my mother often used to say that when you don't have a choice, “dudher shad gholey mitao”, i.e., satisfy your yearning for the taste for fresh milk with the taste of buttermilk. my wife rumi and i would have loved to be in kolkata or dhaka to celebrate rabindra and nazrul jayanti this year, but since that is not an option, we decided that we might as well take my mother's advice and celebrate these twin birthdays with gusto here in boston and connecticut, even if that leaves you with the taste of buttermilk. my letter today will offer my dear readers a glimpse of our efforts and i hope that you will see what we lack in scale and extravaganza we make up with our zeal, creativity and a little bit of bravado, not to speak of our boundless love for these two literary giants. view the page star health

new decade of vaccines launched
vaccines are undoubtedly one of the best investments in health. immunisation programmes have contributed enormously to reducing the burden of infectious diseases, and are responsible for much of the falling rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. in december 2010, global health leaders committed to making the next 10 years the decade of vaccines — to ensure discovery, development, and delivery of lifesaving vaccines globally, especially to the poorest countries. this series looks at every aspect of this medical technology, including the developments expected over the coming decade and what we can expect from translation of the latest vaccine science. improving vaccine coverage and financing of both existing and newer vaccines together with how we communicate the benefits of vaccines and ensure public trust and confidence, are also examined.

a shift in the balance of power?
as the events are unfolding in the north african and middle east region quite dramatically, there are talks as to whether the balance of power in the region would mark any shift. the changes and developments were so sudden and unexpected that it left little room for maneuvering; and intelligence agencies hardly had any clue whatsoever about what would happen in the next few moments. no one apparently imagined that a mere protest in tunisia, which led to the collapse of ben ali's empire, would spark and engulf the whole middle east. and the fall of mubarak regime in egypt marks the most striking development with huge strategic significance. this single incident may lead to further equations as to the future geo-politics in the region.
washington-islamabad security dilemma
the end of the cold war naturally expedites washington to put on the crown of world politics unilaterally although a set of actors were mounting up from asia especially china and india with their soft power i.e., the power to attract culturally and to get something done with attraction rather than compulsion. the intention of super powers is, as it was and perhaps will be, to stretch out the ascendancy all over the world and indubitably the us is no exception who sets a policy strategy for asia fetching pakistan closer both politically and diplomatically.

gathering pebbles on life's turbid shores
amitav ghosh puts it succinctly. 'we are a riverside people', says he. the obvious reference is to bengalis. that bengalis have dwelt, like any other historical civilization, beside their rivers is a truth made all the more poignant by an awareness of how constricted those ageless rivers have of late been getting. for ghosh, bengal is home, india is home. but america? it is a place where he lives, a spot he is nevertheless in love with. he opens his heart to sunil sethi, speaks of the dispersal of people, of the indian diaspora he has always been keen to write about. and out of that sense of alienation-cum-belonging have come such works as the hungry tide and the glass palace and sea of poppies . in his words, he is a girmitiya , a term used for 'indentured labourers who left in the nineteenth century because they signed agreements which they call girmits . . .'
of things changing. . .and being the same
it was a pleasant surprise to find nighat gandhi's evocative article, 'landscapes of the heart', in the literature section of the daily star. this was because i had just happened to finish reading her book of short stories, 'ghalib at dusk and other stories'. i loved the article as much as i did her stories.
