asking for democracy?
the national election will be held on december 18, 2008. the two leaders of the two major political parties want a guarantee that they will win the election. i will not be surprised if they suddenly demand that the chief election commissioner resign but i hope i am wrong. the meaning of democracy covers something more than holding an election. in the last three elections, we saw the elected prime minister as the centre of all power. the defeated party collectively punished the whole nation with hartal and violence. i am not a politician, i've never been involved in politics in my life. maybe that's why i don't understand the language of bangladeshi politicians, but i do understand that a strong democratic institution is far more important than this type of election.

education system
the letter from as islam, retired professor of botany of dhaka university, illustrates yet another reason why a 'unified system of education' could be a disaster. thank you, sir, for exposing the awfulness of at least one of the 'approved textbooks' in your subject and chilling us to the marrow at the prospect of not only the pupils in one type of school but all bangladeshi pupils being exposed to the ghastly mistakes, the outdatedness and the sheer boredom of some badly written, illustrated and printed school textbooks.
