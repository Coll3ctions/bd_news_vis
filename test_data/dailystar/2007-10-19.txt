separation of judiciary from november 1
it will certainly be a historic moment for the nation when the process of judicial independence gets underway on november 1. the long-felt need for separation of the judiciary from the executive now looks about to be finally met. indeed, we can reasonably say here that the fundamental and necessary changes being brought about in the way the judiciary will work from now on are an outcome of the long and sustained struggle put up by the nation over the years for the supremacy of law and fairness and efficiency of the justice system. under the new arrangements, all control over the lower judiciary will pass into the hands of the supreme court. the system of executive magistracy that has so long operated in the lower courts will give way to one of judicial magistrates working under the direct supervision of the supreme court.

what's in a name?
you just can't make this stuff up. when i first read about it in maureen dowd's new york times column earlier this week, i wasn't sure whether to take it seriously or not. surely this was just hyperbole on ms. dowd's part or she must have gotten hold of the wrong end of the stick or somehow misunderstood. right?
force and form
let me introduce the shakers to you before i tell what i like about them. they are a protestant religious denomination, which originated in manchester, england, in the 18th century. but that isn't why i like them. i like them for their celebrated proverb, which goes like this: "every force evolves a form."
loyalty to leader versus country
my friends often ask me if my column has created any impression among the top policy makers of the government, as if it is customary to receive feedback from them. how would i know if they even read my column? i always told them: "no -- not yet." but last week, i could say: "yes -- i did." view the page sports

buy bangladeshi products
i am appealing to all from thousands of miles away to buy bangladeshi products when you go shopping. this will save our hard earned foreign currency and create jobs in local industries. you may not see the benefits right away but it has long term implications which a country like india is enjoying now--within a short time we may see them in the position of a superpower but this fortune has not come to them very easily - only with their determination and belief in themselves.
gordon brown's 100 days
as hollywood or bollywood people do, if one evaluates the 100 days of british premier gordon brown, the scenario is not quite impressive for him, though his labour party seems to be better placed than the conservatives compared to the final days of tony blair.
use of toxic chemicals
it has been reported in the daily newspapers that a large number of “fruit traders” near dhaka city and some other places are using dangerous toxic chemicals regularly to ripen local “fruits” quickly. this is very injurious to the health of the people.
taxi, scooter drivers
taxi cab/cng scooter drivers continue to undermine and defy government orders and instructions.
ngos and corruption
we have recently been regaled with the spectacle of one ngo calling the rest 'corrupt' and exempting itself from the accusation!
power ministry's power
sharier khan's report (oct:3) gives the pen picture of how the bureaucrats milk the various power companies. may be that is the main reason for their interest in having different companies as a smoke screen; basically for satisfying their greed for more management clout and a wide range of perquisites. they simply love their multiple roles.
truth commission
no doubt truth is stranger than fiction. we are a nation where most of our people who can influence others are corrupt. common people are the ultimate victims. we can find corrupt people in every sphere of our populace. but can a truth commission cure this infectious disease? perhaps not, unless we install a functional system in the society to combat corruption relentlessly. does it mean that we don't need such a commission? definitely we need a truth commission for our politicians, where they will make confession and rectify themselves. they will have to make commitments like:
mobile users
at present mobile is an important device (except some bad aspects) to communicate with each other. it has made our life easy. for this reason, the number of users is increasing rapidly. so any deal between mobile operators and users is to be fair and square. but in some cases users have to pay more than what is due. for example, we have to pay at least one extra taka in case of recharging. it is also applicable for purchasing card of that amount. my question is why shall we spend our hard earned money without getting due value?
the blame game
mr. badrul ahsan, the eminent columnist and one of the finest political analysts, in his column on august 21 referred to law advisor mr. mainul hossain's reported complaint that the economists of the country did not give them appropriate and necessary suggestions for economic management. why the law adviser makes such complaints since the chief adviser himself as well as the finance adviser are all economists.
setting the record right
i saw a news item in your daily paper of aug 16 entitled “remembering palmer” on the sports page. mr. hubert arun rozario in this article gave the news of mr. francis donald palmer passing away on aug 8, 2007 in california. mr. rozario then went on to reminisce about him and ascribed some of his sporting achievements which in some ways were very incorrect. mr. rozario, of course out of his friend or colleague's admiration and his good will wrote, “francis palmer captained the first east pakistan provincial basketball team” he also wrote, “in 1960, brother thomas popularised basketball in east pakistan.”
simplify banking procedures
recently, i went to a local ncb for a pay order. while i was waiting, a women came to the same officer to open a new account with duly completed application form (filled by someone else, signed by her) with introduction from another account holder. after checking the application form thoroughly the officer gave her 2 more forms (1) transaction profile (2) know your customer {kyc}-for filling. the woman, not educated enough, was baffled and requested the officer for help who bluntly refused. the woman then protested saying he could give these forms with the application form so that she could arrange to fill them up by her relative. then, i offered to help her and while filling these forms, i understood that her brother had recently gone to dubai and would send tk 25000-30000 pm for family expense. i wonder, why could not this system be simplified for a small account opener by single statement that “transaction will not exceed (say) tk. 7 lakh pm.” in the application form instead of filling 2 additional forms.
crimes
there has definitely been an improvement in the crime situation. but still the law enforcers have to go a long way to ensure the safety of citizens.
motorbikes on footpath
everywhere a footpath is only meant for the use and convenience of pedestrians, and not for any type of wheeled transport. however, sadly it is observed that motorbike riders come to the front of cars and buses waiting for traffic light at busy intersections, drive onto the footpaths to take an illegal shortcut and come in front of the traffic lights. sometimes a few cyclists also do it, but rarely. mostly they push the cycles while walking alongside, which is not so objectionable. but the motorbike riders do it in a reckless and frightening manner.
pacu and piranha
these days a debate is taking place in the electronic media and print media regarding pacu fish or thai rupchanda, which has wrongly been identified as piranha.
job opportunity in canada
canada is the largest country in the world. it is one of the prime western nations for immigrants. the canadian province of alberta is currently looking for skilled and unskilled workers to meet the labour shortage largely driven by the oil and gas reserves. every year over 90,000 foreign workers enter canada working temporarily to help canadian employers. alberta is on the top of the list of locations with economic boom. for additional information visit: http://www.alberta-canada.com/immigration/albertaimmigrationpromotion/files/pdf/hiring_fw_alberta.pdf.
bangladesh cricket team
we have been playing cricket for the last forty years or so, test cricket for around ten years. it is quite natural that once in a while we would win a match. whenever we win a match, the media blows it out of proportion and start using words like greatest hero, mahanayak etc. i think this kind of euphoria spoils the boys. and again when we lose (which is the normal regular thing we do), we say we are learning, i think we should put a stop to this kind of exuberance and excuses. encourage the boys, but don't spoil them. they lose their head and think themselves as 'ami ki honourey'. view the page international

prava: a shooting meteor on the horizon
her name is sadia jahan prava. 'prava', in bangla, means radiance and her name seems to do justice to her appearance. prava's enthusiastic expressions and infectious smile made the tv commercial (tvc) of meril beauty soap one of last year's most popular ads. overnight prava became a familiar face to millions. her appearance in the subsequent tvc of meril powder (2007) also proved to be a success.

three under-rated factors in decision making
conventional wisdom has it that decision making is a function of policy based acts, rules, regulations, instructions and guidelines applied in a scientific manner. we are conditioned to visualising an ideal environmental framework for decision making. the decision makers are supposed to be rational agents free from human inadequacies and fallibility.
maintaining the momentum on burma
the world has reacted with horror to the burmese regime's brutal crackdown against its own people. monks, nuns and ordinary citizens took to the streets peacefully in protest at the deterioration of the economic situation in the country. they were met with guns and batons.
does aid reduce poverty?
hollis chenery and alan strout are proponents of the "two-gap" model of development. which is: savings determine investments -- and per capita income determines savings. since poor countries have low incomes, and, accordingly, low savings, they are caught in a "vicious circle of poverty." thus, it is argued, investment financed by foreign aid will break this vicious circle and connect ldcs to the virtuous circle of productivity and growth.
online shopping
online shopping is growing rapidly in most developing and developed countries for obvious reasons. better price, open 24 hours, no dress code, no transportation cost, or time wasted going to and from market, many sellers and choices, tools available for comparison, are just a few of the benefits to a consumer. view the page environment

gulshan lake: an ecologically critical area
exchange of energy between the aquatic environment and its adjacent terrestrial ecosystem is a continuous process and thus, they are influenced much by each other. land-based activities around the aquatic ecosystem have a crucial effect on energy inputs to it. for proper functioning of an ecosystem, there must be a balance between inputs and use of energy. exceptions to this would be damaging for both the ecosystems.
