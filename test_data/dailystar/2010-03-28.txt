israeli defiance on settlements issue
the impunity with which israel has regularly defied world opinion over the middle east crisis is by now a truism that much of the world responds to in utter exasperation. over the years, its encouragement of jewish settlements on occupied arab land has stalled any move toward a settlement. add to that its erection of a wall designed to keep arabs away from the settlers. overall, the delaying tactics it has regularly adopted in the matter of arriving at a two-state solution have kept emotions alive, to a point where its own backers in the west now find themselves in a state annoyance. and matters are not helped at all by clear israeli complicity in the murder of a palestinian politician in dubai recently. the recent expulsion of an israeli diplomat in london by the british authorities over a forgery of british passports that would camouflage the killers is a broad hint of the levels to which israel has stooped in defence of its questionable national interest.

unliveable city
dhaka city is beset with many problems. recently, this has been labelled as one of the most unliveable cities in the world by 'the economist'. the common problems of dhaka city are traffic jam, load shedding, water & sanitation, air pollution, accommodation crisis of increasing population and many more. most of them get media coverage from time to time. regrettably, some get little attention when the problem is acute. of them accommodation problem has been severe over the past years as house rent has been doubled & in some cases tripled causing immense sufferings to the low & limited income people. since the income of maximum people is not increasing keeping pace with ever soaring price of essential commodities and house rent, it is getting so difficult to survive for the poor city dwellers in the increasingly expensive dhaka city. hence, the number of slum dwellers bears the testimony to soaring house rent.
sea level rise
the geographic location and geomorphic conditions of bangladesh have made the country highly vulnerable to sea level rise. it will increase salinity in the coastal areas. as a result, agricultural productivity will be decreased and coastal economy will break down. not only this but also coastal people have to suffer due to lack of fresh water. world bank (2000) showed 10 cm, 25cm and 1m rise in sea level by 2020, 2050 and 2100; affecting 2%, 4% and 17.5% of total land mass respectively. as a result, we will lose sundarbans (the largest mangrove forest in the world) which is rich in biodiversity and five lakh people will lose the means of income. there will be 20 million climate refugees and the bangladesh government has no capability to resettle them.
save the shrimp industry
it is known to us that the country's second highest foreign currency earner is the shrimp industry. through this industry the government earns a huge amount of money each year. this sector not only earns money but also employs 12 lakh people in ten thousands shrimp farms.
rationalise bus fare
in bangladesh hardly anything is in order. we are living in a highly disorderly situation. but there are areas where order can be restored by putting in small efforts. and the gain will be fabulous, as it will solve the problem of a larger section of people and that too for a considerable period of time. one such disorderly area is discriminatory "bus fare" charged by the bus operators in some routes. one such route is "azimpurbanani /beyond route". on this route several bus companies operate under different names. the prominent ones are--"vip 27/a (mini-bus/coaster)", "anik","suchana" and suchana-a/c".

essence of bangabandhu
any discussion on sheikh mujibur rahman gets weighted down with superlatives. his unrivalled contribution to the birth of bangladesh has established sheikh mujibur rahman as the father of the bengali nation. the moment the grand figure of bangabandhu rises before us, the question presents itself: what is his relevance today and for the future of bangladesh? what inspiration can we draw from his life? what radiance can his thought and wisdom shed on our problems? how does his way of life affect our course of action in public affairs? that bangabandhu is relevant today and for centuries to come is not in doubt at all.

civil aviation
it has been reported in a national daily that 4 private airline operators have eaten up the passengers' travel tax, which was supposed to be paid to the govt.
why this silence?
it is a matter of grave concern as we read reports of harassment, killings of bangladeshis and intrusion by bsf into our territory while the government remains tight lipped. sovereignty and territorial integrity are matters of great importance. rather than replying to a question from a mp on this matter, the home minister should have been proactive in briefing countrymen on the status of negotiations, protests and actions being taken in this matter. i can not help but notice that these incidents have increased in frequency recently - when we have high hopes and enthusiasm about our relations with the good neighbour india. let us not prejudge or mistrust any incidents, but, we need to be vigilant as history is full of examples where good deeds have been followed by great acts of betrayal. i am not old enough to forget munich 1938 and nazi-soviet pact 1939. a treaty is only as good as the underlying intentions of parties behind it. good neighbours do not need treaties between them. i request the government to explain when these actions from our neighbour are going to end.
export diversification
our industrial sector is facing a critical period at this moment. this sector needs to be diversified. export should not be dependent on a few products and services. we have ample opportunity to develop our agro-based industries as we have an agrarian economic structure. it will help absorb our large unskilled and semi-skilled workers. we have achieved great development in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, rmg, shrimp, leather etc. we have a very large workforce which is the most important ingredient for our economic development. the world is turning into a more knowledge based, technology oriented economic structure. all the outsourcing and manufacturing activities are shifting to the developing countries like india and china. as we are the neighbour of india and china and we have the same cultural framework like india, why will we not be able to grab those opportunities. so, the govt. should provide proper guidelines, required infrastructure, power and energy. proper planning and management programmes should also be undertaken and implemented by the govt. so that more employment opportunities are created which will ensure productivity and economic development. view the page international
