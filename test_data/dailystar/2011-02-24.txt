wigs on pages of history
in ancient egypt, both males and females wore wigs made either from human hair, sheep's wool or vegetable fibers, depending upon their social status. there were a number of benefits for egyptians from shaving their heads. first it was more comfortable in the hot egyptian climate not to have hair. secondly, a baldhead helped avoid the danger of an infestation of lice, which was a problem at that time. however, it appears that egyptians preferred having “hair” which resulted in the creation of wigs that gave the appearance of hair. the new wigs also protected the egyptians' baldheads from the brutal sun. wigs became part of daily wear for the egyptian people indicating a person's status as well as their role in a society or politics. in women's wigs were adorned with braids and gold, hair-rings and ivory ornaments making them more stylish than men's wigs. ultimately, the more elaborate and involved the wig was, the higher the social rank.
