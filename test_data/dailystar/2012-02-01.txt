bangla or urdu?
february is and will forever be a reminder of the sacrifices made in defence of the bangla language in 1952. what has come to be known as ekushey was, however, already in the making even before the establishment of pakistan in august 1947. in july 1947, barely a month before india was partitioned by the british colonial administration into two independent states, several leading muslim scholars rather inexplicably suggested that urdu be the lingua franca of the new state. that view was, however, opposed by reputed bangalee scholars, whose view was that since the bangalees of pakistan's eastern wing would constitute the majority segment of the country's population, it was only proper that bangla be adopted as the language of the state. for his part, dr muhammad shahidullah, writing in the daily azad published from calcutta, stated that having urdu as the only language of the state and pushing bangla into the sidelines would only undermine the interests of the bangalees of pakistan.

secret of iran's power
while dealing with iran one thing must be taken into consideration. it is that iran's existence as an islamic state is a miracle, given the repeated aggression and embargo imposed on it. another miracle is that unlike iraq iran is not becoming an easy target of the imperialists. enjoying relative political stability, iranians are united under one imam inspired and directly guided by imam mahdi who they believe is in occultation. though these religious facts are beyond comprehension for western writers and thinkers, it is very much there. i cannot resist the temptation of quoting the famous line from shakespeare: “there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”

bangladesh cricket team's pakistan tour!
