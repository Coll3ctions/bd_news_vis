govt to closely monitor service delivery in districts
the government's initiative asking the deputy commissioners to file reports to the establishment secretary by the 10th of each month elaborating on anti-corruption activity, state of education and service delivery at the district and sub-district levels instantly strikes a responsive chord in us. these are not meant to be proforma reports, something that is refreshingly revealed through some excerpts of the letter which the establishment secretary had dispatched to the deputy commissioners.
boycotting ahmadinejad in geneva
the conference on racism that the united nations has organised in geneva has run into trouble. it should not have, considering that the issue on the table is of grave importance to the international community. but that does not appear to have been taken into account by the western, largely european, nations which chose to boycott the conference because they did not approve of iranian president ahmadinejad's criticism of israel. the boycott has obviously left un secretary general ban ki-moon feeling justifiably embarrassed. his ire shone through his remarks, in which he clearly notes that nations that could help to forge a path to a better future were not to be seen. and among those nations have been the united states, canada, australia, germany, italy, new zealand, poland and the netherlands.
history and the search for scapegoats

kkr's inside news leaked?
things just aren't going right for the kolkata knight riders. after the captaincy controversy and a disastrous first game, they now have to deal with bouncers and googlies of a different kind - the writing of a mystery blogger, who claims to be a member of the team and seems determined to out every team secret, warts and all. the jury's out on the blogger's identity he blogs as 'fake ipl player' - but the writing indicates a keen knowledge of the team's working and the typical daily grind of an overseas tour. few players are named but the nicknames are unambiguous the blogger's “team-mates' include a former india allrounder called kaan moolo, an opener called calypso king, a former captain in lord almighty and an opening bowler called little john.

no showdowns!
as with the kolkata captaincy issue, the showdown between england's two big beasts, andrew flintoff and kevin pietersen, did not quite live up to its billing. the pair did come face to face, but not as everyone had hoped: it was pietersen, with his lesser-spotted offbreaks, who ended up bowling to flintoff, with his well-disguised fear of getting out to his international colleague, not - as had been hoped - the other way round. and even then, curious onlookers had to settle for a pulled boundary and a couple of bunted singles. as pietersen said after claiming he had got an inside edge to the ball from muttiah muralitharan that removed him for a golden duck, such is life.

trial of war criminals
reading syed mohammad ali's letter entitled “stories of war criminals” published (april 10, 2009) in the star magazine, i cannot but thank him for his observations that will help the authorities conduct the trial in an appropriate way. it is really unpleasant to think that the war criminals will not be punished for the crimes they committed. without their trial, the sacrifice of martyrs, who laid down their lives for liberating people from slavery of pakistan, will not be respected, even not upheld.

water crisis
dhaka is facing a new problem in the form of water crisis because of continuous dry weather condition. still the people are not paying much attention to this problem. water is being wasted continuously in household activities and sometimes even water taps are kept open unnecessarily. but time has come to use water in the most judicious manner. everything in our earth is limited. water is also limited. if this dry weather continues dhaka will soon become waterless. nobody can survive without water. and if we do not take any step to preserve our most precious resource then dhaka will become a desert. everybody will have to cry for a drop of water.
decimate student politics
no doubt, student politics is a nuisance for us at present. it is a threat for the smooth progress of bangladesh. most of the educational institutions of bangladesh are vulnerable to this epidemic. the recent decision of our pm sheikh hasina to jettison the responsibility of overseeing bcl has perplexed all of us. by quitting the post of the organizational head of the bcl, she has tried to eschew the liability. actually, she should be more progressive and forward-looking in taking decisions about student politics. we know about the bright credentials of student politics and the people of bangladesh are thankful for its contribution to the language movement and the liberation war. i was proud of being a resident student of zahurul huq hall of du, as this hall produced many student leaders like asm abdur rab and tofael ahmed. we know that bright students do not join politics any more. some hooligans use the banner of student politics, that is a win-win situation for both these so-called student leaders and the political parties. political leaders use these student activists for their personal gains. i am not against student politics. but student politics must be for the students, by the students and of the students. the existing student politics is hindering the normal functioning of the educational institutions. the general students are the victims of this social malady. so, i urge our honourable pm to rethink about student politics. please ban student politics by promulgating new laws for the greater benefit of the nation. you know what bcl activists are doing across the country. are they enhancing the party image? do they have any contribution to your landslide victory? will they ensure your next triumph? do you think that they are really students? they may be, but they are diseased and perverted.
khaleda's house
i am not sure what is playing in the minds of the opposition leaders regarding the cantonment house. the role of the party is more like an adventure of "bhumi dosshu". why they are eager to hit up the street when two other most legitimate and civilized options are opened for the leader to choose from-- the moral and the legal step. i doubt there is any sensible person in the bnp or its think tank to advise the leader to take a moral stand and leave the place to its rightful owner. we know that it is the most difficult decision for her to take. the simple reason is that the bnp is born to oppose the al as a political power and would go to any length to undermine their services to the nation. our political history is very clear in this respect.
cyclone bijli
it was a stroke of genius naming the latest cyclone bijli. whoever named it so, deserves a medal because approaching the shores of bangladesh it fizzled out, bringing cooling breezes to the despairing citizens vigorously waving hand fans and much-needed rain for the parched fields. bijli was even a boon for boro because now reb's anaemic bijli would not be required for a few weeks.

wrong priorities!
i have just read a ds report on the formation of three sub-committees by the government to investigate all the 'misdeeds' of the former speaker, jamiruddin sircar. do we really need three sub-committees for that? the new al-led government seems to have gone mad about forming panels, committees and sub-committees, allegedly, to investigate all the misdeeds that took place under the previous government. my personal opinion on this is that, all these investigations by the newly elected government are absolutely pointless. after wasting a lot of money and time, all these committees and probe-bodies are going to let us what we already know: the bnp-led government plundered our country like never before in our history. unfortunately, and predictably, khaleda zia will deny everything and instead accuse the government of launching a smear campaign against the bnp!
erratic rainfall
as the world is getting warmer, the pattern of rainfall is likely to change. it is believed that some of the areas of the globe will become arid owing to a decline in precipitation. on the contrary, some other zones will become wetter because of more rainfall. simply put, the earth is likely to face erratic weather patterns --a fallout of global warming.
true muslims
the word “muslim” refers a person who submits his will to the almighty allah, follows the commandments given in the glorious quran, and runs on the path shown by our prophet muhammad (peace be upon him). but presently the meaning of muslim has been altered. our creator has certainly forbidden all the evil acts [2:60] “….and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth”. our beloved prophet (pbuh) showed the art of living through his prophetic teachings. but some criminals are committing malevolent acts, using the name of muslims and islam.
