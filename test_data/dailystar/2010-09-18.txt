containing anthrax outbreak : some suggestions
as a bangladeshi-american and a microbiologist, i am following the recent anthrax outbreak in bangladesh with a concern. to my knowledge, this is the largest outbreak of human anthrax in the world since 1978-1980 anthrax epidemics in zimbabwe (which involved 6,000 reported cases and 100 deaths). more importantly, there is no indication of a slowing down of the outbreak. authorities in bangladesh, according to the information published in some daily news papers, stated that the government has sufficient reserve of anthrax vaccine. however, it is not clear what the authorities have actually done to contain the outbreak. it was also stated in the news papers that the citizens should not be concerned about the outbreak since the disease is not dangerous and can be treated easily. and stated that even village doctors (lacking modern medical training) and pharmacists are able to treat the disease.

anti-muslim chauvinism unleashed at ground zero
president obama has seriously failed to imagine that his support for the muslim cultural centre near ground zero would create such repulsion and hatred. since the president's support based upon the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom for all religions, conservative groups and the families of 9/11 victims have raised hell to stop the proposed centre. it has led to renewed hate campaign and attacks on muslims. a priest in florida has called for burning of the koran to mark the 9/11 anniversary and led general petraeus to warn that such an act would seriously harm us efforts in afghanistan and president obama to describe it as a “recruitment bonanza “ for al qaeda. another group has called for denying muslims the right to build new mosques unless they renounce the koran!

books, writers and their enemies
books have been burned and writers have been persecuted through the ages. and yet you would expect that in these present times, which are often described in glowing terms as post-modernity, the savagery which in earlier phases of human existence sought to destroy all the good that man could bring forth would have drawn to a close. not so. think of the brutality visited upon baghdad through the anglo-american invasion of iraq in 2003. in the days immediately following the fall of baghdad, for yet one more time in history, all the libraries and all the museums in the city were systematically looted. vandals and thieves simply walked away with the books or put them to the torch. it was but the beginning, for over the next few days and weeks, books all over iraq would go missing even as american and british soldiers stood by, their job ostensibly to ensure security in a soon to be 'democratic' iraq.
