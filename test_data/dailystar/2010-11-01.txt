bnp's mid-term election ruse
the opposition bangladesh nationalist party is talking of mid-term elections in the country. as a political party and especially if it is convinced that the ruling party has failed to meet the expectations of the people, the onus is on it to substantiate such a claim and try to carry the people with them. the bigger and more potent reality, though, is the question of what the bnp itself has done in these nearly two years since the last election to inform people that it has played its due role as a parliamentary opposition. there might be reasons to think that the awami league-led government has not performed well in some sectors, indeed may have actually failed to demonstrate the competence expected of it in certain areas. that is no indication, however, that the bnp is the alternative the nation can fall back on, at least at this stage judging from its performance in the opposition.

collapsed buildings
in our capital city there were many incidents of building collapse, killing and injuring people and property loss. the last one and the most ridiculous is a just finished three-storied building in a jheel at norda in the capital's dakkhinkhan area. it was a miracle that the collapsed building toppled on a tin-shed house but none was injured or missing. but what is seen from the photograph of the collapsed building is really unbelievable and tells the sadly poor management of the concerned authority.
adulterated food
i cannot purchase any kind of fruit for my loving kids! as a father, this is so painful for me. the unscrupulous traders use poisonous chemicals in fruits and other food items. they use calcium carbide to ripen bananas, heat the papayas to make those look red. fish and vegetable traders use formalin in their products to keep those fresh. milk is also not pure. these adulterated food items pose serious threat to public health. people are suffering from various diseases like cancer, heart disease and kidney failure. the number of cancer patients has increased alarmingly.

gas supply to steel factories
an absurd front-page report on the subject was published in an english daily on 26th october, which was illogical and shortsighted. it seems that there is no technically qualified person in the natural gas sector management who has even some basic knowledge of physics and the heating and rolling of steel materials! i am surprised by their idea; since for steel rolling mills this will only increase rolling costs and wastage of natural gas! rolling temperature of steel sections varies from about 900deg.c to say 1100deg.c, depending on the chemical composition of the steel, and the stage of reduction and the section to be rolled.

deceived and deprived
the per capita income of bangladesh, i think is between us$ 600 and 700, yet in many ways the people have to pay more for goods and services than a country whose per capita income is above us$ 40,000. i really fail to understand why this is so. is the government responsible for this? to some extent yes.
learning english
today the world has become a global village. thanks to the advancement of communication system and technology. every country is dependent on others for trade and commerce, education, etc. third world countries like bangladesh have to depend on foreign aid because they are not self-sufficient. in this situation, we have to learn other languages, especially english, to communicate with foreigners. view the page international
