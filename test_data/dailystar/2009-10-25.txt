in the face of evil syndicates …
the cng-driven auto-rickshaws are perhaps becoming still costlier for the hapless passengers. their owners are pressing the government to agree to another bout of increase in the auto-rickshaw fares. the cng-owners and drivers have their reasons to charge higher fares. but the users of the service (!) provided by these motorised, freewheeling three-wheelers do not enjoy any such privilege to get a better deal. they are, as it were, destined forever to be at the receiving end. they may flail about in despair, they may protest, curse and cry! it would be a cry in the wilderness. and at long last they will have to take it all lying down -- and literally so!

garage your car!
the ds of 12 oct was a milestone of sorts. my letter “dhaka's traffic mess” was printed without a comma being edited out and then on the adjoining page, dhaka university's prof k siddique-e- rabbani's masterpiece “taking rickshaws off increased traffic jam”, in which he has summarized in a short article what i have been barking at in the wilderness in 51 letters over the last two years as the best and immediate solution to our traffic problems. mr fazlul haque's letter “traffic in dhaka” on the same page is also couched in the same vein. so madam prime minister, concerned ministers, mps, experts on traffic management, traffic controllers, down to the humble, over-worked traffic cops, put away your 5 or 10 years and eternal plans for the freeways, monorails, maglevs, stps, dutps, and all other tps, because now you have a blue print for the immediate solution that can be implemented tomorrow and which is equitable, just, fair, profitable and environmentally beneficial for all dhakabashis and not just the privileged few.
international rivers
as reported in the press, the govt. of the indian state of assam is seriously concerned over the construction of a dam by china on the yarlung tsangpo river in tibet, the source of the river brahmaputra. if this dam is constructed and commissioned, it will terribly affect assam and dry up the river brahmaputra and other water resources downstream.
cox's bazar
cox's bazar is one of the largest sea-beaches and most beautiful spots in the world. millions of foreigners and bangladeshis visit this coastal town every year. the sea beach, cox's bazar town, and its adjoining areas have a lot of things to attract the tourists. for example, there are places like himchhari, maheskhali and st. martin's. miles of golden sands, surfing waves, colourful pagodas, delicious seafoods-- these are the specialities of cox's bazar.
nobel peace prize
“congratulations, obama!” everybody is saying this now, but not from the heart. whether the prize has been awarded to the right person or not, it doesn't make any sense to those people who are dying in sudan, pakistan, or in afghanistan. obama himself realises that this prize is meaningless and that's why he said, “i don't deserve this”. his outstanding effort for planning extraordinary diplomatic practices and establishment of peace are yet not enough to achieve a nobel prize which has been achieved by nelson mandela and aung san suu kyi. if the nobel committee had determined that they would award the peace prize to those who have some potential to bring peace in future, then they were supposed to give it to every person in this world because there can hardly be anyone who doesn't want peace. now there is no doubt that the nobel committee and its prizes are deeply influenced by international politics. this is really disappointing and it proves that nothing is going to change.
ssf protection
we only hope that the government and their well-wishers have deliberated quite extensively before making such a law. we can see reason for two living daughters of founder president sheikh mujibur rahman to be given the ssf cover. but their children live abroad, even have foreign wives. how the family is defined and to what dimension geographically and extended family wise over the next decades. this is not clear to us. therefore, this law can be challenged in the court which would be most unfortunate because this might raise the question of security of sheikh hasina and sheikh rehana, when away from power, but they deserve to get it as long as they are alive.
foreign minister's comment
it is absolutely shocking to hear our foreign minister quote the burmese ambassador and take the situation lightly. of course the burmese ambassador and government will say the situation does not pose a threat to bangladesh. but where on earth do you see a country mobilising troops on such a scale along its neighbour's border for "exercise" alone? has burma run out of land to carry out military exercises?
business schools
the current economic crisis is a transformational moment for business schools worldwide. the fact is that business schools have been off track, chasing precisely those wall street innovations that led to the current crisis. we need to get back to the basics of providing well-rounded education that emphasises real value and wealth creation, rather than focussing on areas that only propagate illusions of value.
performing hajj
hajj or the pilgrimage is the fourth basic 'ibadat'. it is obligatory only on those who can afford it and that too only once in a lifetime.
another failure?
we are passing through a very difficult time, the country is in total disarray, nothing is going as it should, oblivious to it, the government is busy experimenting with new ideas.
dst misunderstood
the daylight saving time decision to advance the bdst by 1 hour could have been a good decision for which it was intended. many countries of the world, especially the countries of northern hemisphere, do that from last sat/sun day of march by advancing 1 hour and revert back to normal time on last sat/sun of october.
barren js
it looks very pathetic that the mps are busy gossiping. sometimes when we watch the js proceedings we find that the arguments and counter arguments are so weak and irritating that we are forced to change the channel. the roles of the senior parliamentarians are very important here. but we don't see them joining the debate.
why now?
a dhaka court has recently issued a warrant to arrest former awami league general secretary abdul jalil on charges of tax evasion. this came only nine days after he was dropped from the post of chairman of the parliamentary standing committee of the same party (for whatever reason).
first ten months
it was the crucial time before the ninth parliamentary election when the countrymen were very much anxious being unable to guess what would be the future political condition of the country and the future of their own.

road communication from tongi level crossing to bscic industrial area almost came to a standstill because of its deplorable condition. anybody using the road with his vehicle for the first time will think twice before venturing for the second trip along the road for safety of his valuable transport from premature damage. as one of the busiest outlets from the mega city towards narshingdi, bhairab, ashuganj, maulvibazr, sylhet, every day thousands of transports ply this road through tongi bscic industrial area towards different destinations. there has been an under construction flyover over tongi railway level crossing for the last three years, delayed completion of which now poses a great threat and risk to the road users and pedestrians. who knows when the construction of the flyover will be complete to the great relief of commuters, pedestrians and vehicle users? work progress on the flyover is going at a snail's speed but the authorities do not bother about the deteriorating condition of the road under the flyover which is the only alternate way to go to bscic and other places. serious traffic gridlock is a regular phenomenon in this damaged road under the flyover. incidents of breakdown of transports on the path holes of the road is also a regular feature which make the situation go from bad to worse every day. instead of reducing public sufferings from traffic congestion with the construction of flyover, inordinate delay in completion of the same added more sufferings to the public.
mobile operators
according to the recent statistics of the btrc ( bangladesh telecommunication regulatory commission), over 50 million people use mobile phone at present, which is more than a third of the country's total population. anyhow, it cannot be denied that the cell phone operators are trying heard to serve the subscribers since their operation began. they often make special lucrative offers and it is notified via media blitz. however, it is a matter of great regret that when those offers are called off, it is not notified even by a single sms or any notification.

ads infringing on our values
we would like to voice a joint protest to a new trend in advertising, billboards, magazine and newspaper features that is becoming increasingly prevalent and common these days. that is the new trend of showing female models- or even male models - in increasingly revealing and provocative clothing and images. we would like to ask the promoters of this new culture what exactly it is that they are trying to advocate in way of values, mores and philosophy to our new and young generations. view the page international

how much is a human life worth?
a few days ago a news item caught my attention. it was reported that workers in the ship breaking industry receive little or no compensation for injury or death at the workplace. i also read on a website on bangladesh that, "only a nominal amount of compensation is given and often only when there is public pressure." if this is the state of affairs in this large industry, one can surmise that the situation is not much better in other medium and small-scale industries in bangladesh. most of us would probably agree that this needs to change and the sooner the better.

now pakistan -- the sequential destruction of muslim nations
a conspiratorial view of the world is frequently inaccurate, exposing more the paranoia of the view rather than the reality of the world. the sequential destruction of muslim nations -- palestine, iraq, afghanistan, pakistan (and iran is on the list) -- may or may not be a conspiracy hatched in washington d.c., but it is becoming an international reality. it is no secret that the united states and europe, with varying degree of mutual cooperation and some make-believe internal discord, superintend the sequential destruction of muslim nations. this war of sequential destruction (wsd), despite nobel-laureate barack obama's denials, refuses to go away.
