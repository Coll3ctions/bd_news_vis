the way us viewed khaleda, her close ones

khaleda failed by saving 'corrupt' son

"messi, messi"
lionel messi put the ball down patiently, before taking three marked steps back. he wiped his brow and eyed the mass of players lined up jostling for position inside the penalty area a few yards away. he took a deep breath and around him, the ten thousand strong crowd at the bangabandhu national stadium all reciprocated.
messi mania grips dhaka
the look of pure unadulterated joy in mirza ahmad's face said it all.
just another match for sabella
even though the historic argentina versus nigeria friendly in dhaka today has been billed as a revenge mission for the albiceleste, the newly appointed argentina coach alejandro sabella tried to diffuse the hype by calling it just another match. in that rather infamous match on june 1 at abuja, the former world champions were treated to a 4-1 drubbing by the super eagles.

journo from another land
it is not quite often the case that you get to see lionel messi with your own eyes. even if you do get a glimpse of the superstar once in a blue moon, you hardly ever manage to get near him, let alone talk to him. in such a desperate situation when you see a living legend walk by so near you yet you have to make do with mere eye contact or a smile in return. but when the man is messi, that too is a distant dream, for his introvert yet humble nature.
snippets
the match will start at 7pm instead of previously scheduled 6pm due to the fatigue of the teams. the nigeria team, who flew 12 hours after playing an african cup of nations qualifier against madagascar on monday, asked fifa to consider the deferral, and fifa in consultation with argentina team officials decided to defer the match.

q: dhaka has extended its supportive hand to new delhi to deal with its north eastern insurgency. bangladesh also agreed to provide transit facility to india. but bangladesh is yet to receive reciprocal steps from the indian side. don't you think this kind of situation will prolong barriers to improving bilateral ties?

oceanic bacteria to help
understanding the flow and processing of carbon in the world's oceans, which cover 70 percent of earth's surface, is central to understanding global climate cycles, with many questions remaining unanswered. between 200 and 1,000 meters below the ocean surface exists a "twilight zone" where insufficient sunlight penetrates for microorganisms to perform photosynthesis. despite this, it is known that microbes resident at these depths capture carbon dioxide that they then use to form cellular structures and carry out necessary metabolic reactions so that they can survive and reproduce.

what is software entropy?
the tendency, over time, for software to become difficult and costly to maintain is known as software entropy. a software system that undergoes continuous change, like new functionality added to its original design, will eventually become more complex, losing its original design structure, and may even become disorganized as it grows. in theory, it may be better to redesign the software in order to support the changes rather than build on the existing programme.
