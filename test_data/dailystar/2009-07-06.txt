six months of grand alliance government
it is now six months since the current government took office, and we would like to take this opportunity to both commend it on reaching this milestone as well as to assess its performance during this time period.
six months on, the state of the opposition
six months into the inauguration of the awami league-led grand alliance government and our evaluation of its performance, we believe that we should take stock of how the parliamentary opposition has performed so far. we are constrained to say, as we have said on earlier occasions, that the bangladesh nationalist party has failed to demonstrate the sagacity the nation expected from it after its debacle at the december 2008 elections. its defeat notwithstanding, it was able to win the support of no fewer than 38 per cent of the electorate. that should have been good enough cause for it to make its presence felt in the jatiyo sangsad, through speaking for its constituents. unfortunately, the opposition has shown a degree of irresponsibility that can only raise questions about its ability to play in the near future a positive role in parliament.

the dangers of political capitalism
power is the pre-eminent value in delhi's value system. i was tempted to write "only" instead of "pre-eminent," when some passing sympathy for exceptions interfered with the syntax. a sidelight of this week's main event reminded me of this basic principle of what might be called political capitalism (how else should we describe the culture of a capital?). view the page sports

michael jackson's legacy
michael jackson, the greatest music legend, the most popular star of modern times passed away quietly in his la home. most tragically, no one would ever know his last wishes and dreams. but surely he dreamt of yet another comeback with musical nukes to conquer the world once again. his comeback concert was to be held in london for which he and his team were preparing. but destiny cut his life short.
go ahead, mashrafe!
it's surprising to see the audacious comments made one after another by the ex captain of the national cricket team, mohammad ashraful, since the early exit of the tigers in the just concluded t20 world cup cricket. the anger which the bangladesh cricket board director gazi ashraf hossain lipu expressed to the media the other day was not only a reflection of the his own sentiments, but also of people in general, those who love to see their team perform like tigers. under the captaincy of mohammad ashraful, the performance of our national team had deteriorated a great deal to say the least. as a captain, ashraful miserably failed to lead the team from the front on most occasions.
make parliament effective
our honourable members of parliament are the voices of our nation. parliament sessions are broadcast live. people have the right to know what they are doing for the nation. the speaker allocates a fixed time for every member for his or her speech. but they don't finish their speeches in time.
dst implementation
i refer to the letter by sharif haque from new zealand who would have liked to see it implemented on midnight of thursday, june 18.
city bus service
in dhaka bus services are simply horrendous. the buses are in dilapidated condition. most of them have not been painted for years. some of the seats are broken. the seat cushions are worn out. the floors are strewn with peanut shells and sugarcane rubbish and what not. the fans are not in operation even in these hot days. passengers are herded like poultry. there are all types of ads pasted on the seats and windowpanes. there is no uniform code for drivers and helpers. and the reckless driving and crazy competition to overtake other vehicles add to this.
black money
after the declaration of the budget different organisations protested the opportunity given for whitening black money. somebody has commented that this opportunity is the demand of the time and it will help industrialisation. on the other hand, we have also heard that this opportunity will discourage honest taxpayers. are the tin holders paying genuine tax on their income? in our country nobody wants to pay direct tax willingly. previous governments also gave this opportunity but they did not get a good response. so, i do not believe this time people will stand in queues to whiten their money.
swine flu
swine flu has become a pandemic and is making the whole world panicky. in bangladesh we don't see enough necessary arrangements made to protect our people from such deadly diseases. the authorities took a little initiative at the beginning, especially in the airport area, but no more activity was seen later.
a right decision
the government has correctly taken the decision to develop overpasses at different railway crossing points in the city but the construction of these structures is cumbersome and will involve a lot of money. by the time these overpasses are built, the government can deploy traffic sergeants at the rail crossings to ensure stringent implementation of traffic rules and ease the gridlock at those points as an immediate measure to prevent traffic accidents, like the one which occurred at moghbazar.
militancy syndrome
while the investigation of the bdr carnage was still on, the commerce minister told the press that militant connections with the carnage had been found.
civil defence
we are the poorest of the lot in this part of the world and probably we rank in the top 5 of the poorest country worldwide. as a nation we have all the necessary arrangements on paper as far as civil defence is concerned and the required infrastructure. but can our fire department and health care sector really support the needs when there is an emergency? probably not. the fire at bashundhara city and frequent fires at the slums and in old dhaka have failed to make our policy makers open their eyes.
regional issues
two very important regional issues need immediate attention from the government today tipaimukh dam and demarcation of maritime boundary in the bay of bengal. both issues have far reaching consequences, particularly for the people of bangladesh. our experiences of farakka and tin bigha corridor do not give us hope of negotiated and fair solutions to the bilateral issues with our big neighbour. we are no match for india militarily or economically, but that does not necessarily mean we have to give up our rightful claims to the use of the waters of international rivers flowing through our land or the territorial and economic jurisdictions of the bay of bengal. i believe our prime minister is a patriotic lady and she will do everything in her power to safeguard our national interest.
gimmicky politics
the recent political developments in our country show that we are heading towards new political turmoil and unrest. the opposition party seems to have taken the oath to oppose everything for the sake of opposition. boycotting parliament seems to have become its main mantra. on the other hand, the ruling party seems to have forgotten the people's verdict in bringing it to power. the different wings of the ruling party are behaving in such a way that they are placed above the law.
power and privileges of mps
whether constitutionally allowed or not, the mps of bangladesh exercise unlimited and sometimes unwarranted authority anywhere, in almost every matter in the country. as has been listed by mr. ataul hoque in his letter in the ds on june 17, so far such parliamentarians have been involved in nine such activities for gaining undue advantage. they have been involved even in interfering in the performance of the duty of public servants like the law enforcing agencies, and other activities like extortion, grabbing contracts, and govt lands, etc., as if they are elected to break the existing law and modify it according to their own will.
ashraful's comments
this is in reference to ashraful's comments on june 19 in the daily star. how can he say that the team showed signs of improvement? this comment just does not make any sense. at the post match briefing he himself admitted that the top order batted poorly which also included himself. the simple fact is that the team lost to a bunch of weekend cricketers and he failed to lead from the front. the worst part is that md. ashraful does not seem to be even the least bit ashamed about it.
regarding tipaimukh dam
it is a serious matter when the bangladesh foreign minister says that if tipaimukh dam is erected, india won't do anything which is pernicious for bangladesh. this is very ludicrous. staying in london, we cannot do anything but let people know about the severe consequences of building the tipaimukh dam. gandhi once said that the next world war may be due to water. india is penetrating the arena of developed countries gradually, like china and brazil. water is indispensable to bring about development in any country. india is going to divert river water towards it to control it for its usage whenever they need.
our army chief
recently some politicians and partisan intellectuals have been spreading calumny against general moeen u ahmed, the recently retired chief of army staff. most vocal are the people who were convicted for amassing wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income, tax evasion and for keeping illegal liquor. recently begum khaleda zia also joined the bandwagon. view the page international
