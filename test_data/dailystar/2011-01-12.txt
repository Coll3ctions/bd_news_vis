framework deal on teesta waters
a good deal of hope will certainly be generated by the deal on a framework of agreement on the teesta waters reached by bangladesh and india on monday. the secretary-level talks of the joint rivers commission stipulate an agreement that will cover a fifteen-year period in which the two countries will share the waters of the river. the significance of the deal, which will be followed by ministerial level talks in order to fine tune the details of the eventual agreement to be initialed by the prime ministers of india and bangladesh, cannot be lost on anyone. although this breakthrough comes after more than two decades of negotiations between dhaka and delhi, it must be pointed out that the teesta waters have been high on the agenda since 1952, when the governments of india and the then pakistan first tried hammering out a deal on them. in the post-1971 period, with the emergence of bangladesh as an independent state, the teesta took on a seriousness that was as critical as, if not more critical than, the need for a sharing of the waters of the ganges.
