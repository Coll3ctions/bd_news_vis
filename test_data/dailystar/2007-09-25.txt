there are reasons to think that world leaders gathering in new york for the un general assembly session might bring pressure to bear on the myanmar junta to introduce democratic reforms in the country. the united states and the european community could be taking a lead in drawing attention to the latest development in myanmar. there is little question that this new interest in what happens in the isolated country has been sparked by what has been happening over the past several days in yangon. thousands of monks have marched, in pouring monsoon rain, in the streets, first to protest the abnormal, sudden rise in fuel prices decreed by the junta and then to demand a return to democracy. even the detained aung san suu kyi, the symbol of the democratic struggle in her country, has watched the monks march before her residence.

oh misbah not again
poor misba-hul haq found himself facing the fire once again in an india-pakistan match. like their last encounter, he kept pakistan in the match by playing intelligently, and picking the right balls to hit. a huge six in the last over, which started with pakistan needing 13, seemed to swing the match decisively in favour of pakistan, but with only one wicket in hand, and fine leg in the circle, misbah went for that scoop which, not for the first time, ended in tears for the batsman. sreesanth would have never taken a more important catch in his life. but for misbah, who has been pakistan's surprise star of the tournament, it will take some forgetting.
