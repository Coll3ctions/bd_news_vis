ultimatum 90 days
addressing tens of thousands of opposition supporters who gathered in the capital defying government restrictions, bnp chairperson khaleda zia yesterday gave the hasina administration a 90-day ultimatum to announce the restoration of the caretaker system.
awami league's moral defeat
when does a government strangulate its capital city by preventing almost all modes of transport from reaching it? when does a government bring to a virtual halt almost all internal city movements? when does a government create such a panicky situation that traders do not open shops out of fear of vandalism? when does a government prevent its own citizens from carrying out their day to day activities? when do government leaders tell blatant lies on television while the truth is clearly the opposite? when does a ruling party let loose its goons upon normal citizens on suspicion that they might attend the opposition rally? when does an elected government adopt the most oppressive measure to prevent the opposition from holding a public rally?
promises for future
* two padma bridges
virtual hartal by government
the streets of the capital yesterday wore the look of a hartal tightly enforced, apparently by the ruling party, as almost all public transport remained off the roads.
js, not streets

no hartal please
business bodies yesterday urged political leaders to refrain from calling hartals and to resolve issues through discussions in parliament.
blame it on opposition
ruling party high-ups and members of the government blamed bnp for the public suffering owing to the suspension of road and waterways communication centring on the opposition's grand rally in the capital yesterday.
oops!
call it a slip-up or a blunder. but it was a hilarious moment for a crowd at yesterday's grand rally organised by the bnp and its allies. a political leader in his speech mistakenly branded khaleda zia as a tilak-wearing chief minister whom he does not want to see in power anymore. the remark was intended for khaleda's political foe sheikh hasina, the prime minister.
face-off on rally day

politics cared least for the people

blatant coercion to thwart bnp rally
yesterday we witnessed the naked and blatant use of not only the state's coercive machinery but also of the al's party goons to thwart the bnp rally by infusing fear and panic in the minds of the public. not only rab and the police but also its party cadres were found preventing free movement of transport and people on the roads and highways and on the riverine routes, by force. it was shocking to see party goons empowered to coerce, harass and assault political opponents.
substandard work at river ports
we are concerned at reports of alleged low-quality renovation and development work at barisal river port, not only causing losses in the crores through damage of vessels, but putting hundreds of lives at risk. as it is, a large number of passengers go missing or die in launch accidents every year, and one can do without faulty ports adding to the casualties. view the page sports

how did turkey fowl get its name?
guineafowl were also known as turkey fowl (or turkey hen and turkey cock) because they were imported to central europe through turkey. turkey fowl, shortened to just the name of the country, stuck as the name of the north american bird. when europeans first encountered turkeys in the americas, they incorrectly identified the birds as a type of guineafowl (numididae). in 1550, english navigator william strickland, who had introduced the turkey into england, was granted a coat of arms including a "turkey-cock in his pride proper".
