jam-free clean dhaka
we do not need to get advice from the phds to solve our daily traffic problems. what we need is simply some good intentions and sincerity. the initiatives may be summed up as below:
poverty and children
a unicef study reveals that over 30 million children in bangladesh are living below the poverty line. our authorities have been working for these children with the help of unicef for many years. but it's not understandable why the situation does not improve. what is the government doing in this regard? if we cannot improve the overall condition of the children, we can never improve as a nation. because it is the most important matter the govt. should pay attention to in the national interest.
rudderless bnp
local english daily on 21st october discussed this issue. normally, political party's agenda should have a national objective, giving the party's viewpoint on what should be done, or not done, objectively and logically reasoning. focus should be on national interest and not subjective personal or even party interest.
elegy to a younger sister
my younger sister loved me very much. she always prayed for the well-being of her elder brothers. she lived in a village with her 3 children, husband and in-laws. when she died (3 weeks back) at the age of 32, her youngest son was 5-months-old. she never expressed her pains and sufferings to anybody. she used to tell me on mobile, “i'm keeping well, don't be anxious about me. take care of yourself and take your meals timely.” i know that she was feeling helpless. her in-laws did not treat her as their daughter. i could not go there to see her because of my official duties. she did not insist on my going there, because she knew that taking leave would be harmful to my official image. she could read my mind.
secularism!
there lives a community of muslims in a place called dearborn, michigan, usa. they are demanding the introduction of sharia law there, probably it has already been granted. the majority i.e. more than 80 % of bangladeshis are muslims. it is a matter of wonder how such a vast majority of people goes for secularism.
conspiracy theory
it is my firm belief that if a competition is arranged on 'conspiracy theories', no one will be able to beat awami league or bnp. we have become tired of this trend and the latest ones are about the train accident in sirajganj and the army housing project in rupganj of narayanganj.
taxes on cars
i just want to address a few things regarding taxes on cars. if after reading mr. ayub's letter you thought that in texas or in the us people do not pay taxes when purchasing a vehicle, then you have been completely misled. in texas or us, regardless if it is old or new, you have to pay tax (which is based on the price of the car) at the time of purchase. and that is just the beginning of taxes.
a strong message
after a long time the cricket world has seen one of the cricket giants of the world (new zealand) struggling to save the series against the formidable bangladesh cricket team. probably this is the first time bangladesh has won a series and brushed aside the opponent. however, it is a strong message of the tigers to the stronger opponents before the world cup.
parks and playgrounds
playing is one of the important needs of the children. it is essential for developing their creativity. recently the pm directed the authorities concerned, to take immediate steps to recover all the children's parks and playgrounds in the city. we appreciate the pm's concern about our children.
help the cyclone victims
recently the pm promised to give plots and cars to the cricketers of bangladesh for winning a series. i think it is the duty of every player to try their best to win every series. so, they did their job. we do not understand why the pm is giving all the players plots and cars.
child labour
a couple of days ago, on my way back home i met a ten-year-old kid who works as a cobbler. his name is rabi das. i asked him why he chose this occupation at this age. i came to know that poverty had compelled him to do so. his father has died and so his mother and he has to work hard to support the family. view the page international

the questions around november 1975
november remains a potent reminder for the people of bangladesh of how much they lost in terms of collective self-esteem in 1975. it is also, when you reflect after all these years on the macabre incidents that pushed us down the precipice in the three months between the assassination of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and the murder of the four leading lights of the 1971 mujibnagar government, a moment for us to raise all those questions to which we have never received any answers.
