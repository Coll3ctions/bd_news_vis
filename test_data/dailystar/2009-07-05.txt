not just another brick in the wall
"so ya thought ya might like to go to the show.
to feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow.
i got me some bad news for you, sunshine.
pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel,
and he sent us along as a surrogate band."
-- from the song "in the flesh"

designing the beginning
sadarghat is where it all started, more or less. the city of dhaka began a love story there with the river, which became the social, economic and cultural foundation of the city. if an area in the city displayed some semblance of a "designed" or "decent" urban space linking the river, that too was sadarghat.
our rivers, our dreams
on the wall of the dhaka wasa's drainage circle at topkhana hangs an artist's impression of the dhaka flood protection embankment. drawn just after the great deluge of 1988, the image depicts the embankment in a most civilised manner.
the good, the bad, and the uncertain
the budget for the fiscal year 2009-10 (fy2010) has attracted a mixed response and has been termed since as bold as well as exaggerated, conservative as well as ambitious, and challenging as well as full of rhetoric by different quarters.
