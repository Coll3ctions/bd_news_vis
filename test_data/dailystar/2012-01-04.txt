building a better suntrap
to make electricity from sunlight you can convert it directly, using a photovoltaic cell. or you can use the heat of that sunlight to boil water, and then drive a turbine with the resulting steam. these are both established technologies. but there is, in principle, a third way: use heat directly, without steam or turbines. in this case, unlike a standard solar cell (which is sensitive to some frequencies of light, but not others), almost all of the incident energy is available for conversion. yet unlike the boiling-water method, no messy mechanical processes are involved. once set up, such a system could run with the minimum of attention. view the page metropolitan
