interference in duta affairs
the nation has of late been rather surprised at the way the government has interfered in the elections to such independent bodies as the supreme court bar association and the dhaka university teachers' association. such action has not gone down well at all and is in glaring contrast with the oft-stated desire of the government to introduce democratic practice and transparency in national affairs. the high-handed manner in which the authorities acted on wednesday in the matter of the duta polls has taken us aback. we believe that the action, at once inexplicable and abrasive, was uncalled for. we will not be surprised if citizens now begin to think that there is today an invidious desire among the powers that be to harass the teaching community. where politeness in dealing with university teachers should have been the norm, there now seems to be a clear intention to show them disrespect.

hr report: why from the us?
many countries have good, some have bad and some may have even worse records of human rights. somebody needs to look into the matter globally. is there any internationally recognized legal framework to see and deal with the human rights situation all over the world? yes, the world now does have the human rights council of the united nations! then who is the us to reveal other countries' human rights situation? isn't it a single sovereign state like our poor bangladesh, kenya or myanmar or the rich norway, japan or the uk?

passengers' plight at zia
this is a clarification of abm zakaria's letter published on march 19. i am grateful to mr. zakaria for his kind comments. the following lines will make the picture somewhat clear for the prospective passengers, as well as the public at large. the defra bulletin as stated may be ok in the uk, but not necessarily everywhere which is not a british colony. it may allow frozen fish (presumably raw fish?) or cooked food items in carry-on bags in the uk, but definitely not allowed in germany, the usa and thailand based on my travel experiences. just imagine the dripping water when the ice melts at the cabin temperature, particularly in a long flight! won't the smell of raw fish seep through and pollute the cabin atmosphere? a few days back, the thai delicacy that i had in my cabin bag, although allowed at the entry security check, was removed and dumped at the final pre-boarding check of hand baggage at bangkok airport.

jamuna bridge cracks
the cracks are developing on the jamuna bridge slabs very slowly. the cause behind the cracks is not definitely known. however there is definitely some kind of fault in the construction of this very big bridge. one striking feature of the bridge is the construction of the steel towers for the electric lines on the same side of the bridge as the railway track. whether this put the slabs on unequal stress is best known to the engineers of the bridge. if it does, there should be longitudinal cracks parallel to the bridge slabs. another important consideration is the geology of the site. it is now known that the jamuna river more or less defines the line of contact of the indian and asian tectonic plates. the plates are supposed to be on continual slow movement all the time. if the jamuna bridge spans these plates , there should be deleterious effects on the bridge no doubt, as the slabs are placed on the columns constructed deep underground.
truth commission
as reported in your daily, the proposed truth and accountability commission (apparently being set up by the ctg ) would let the possessors of ill gotten money off the hook if he confesses to committing the crime and deposits the sum to the government exchequer. independent of the question of commensurability of such a commission with the independence of the judiciary, a confession to the commission closed doors is unlikely to have the desired deterrent effect on the same or another potential offender. in this context it is worth considering an east asian practice, especially in japan and korea, where the repenting offender is required to appear before the national television to ask for pardon publicly. this requirement might be of interest also to the acc and the judiciary for enhancing the deterrence effect on the practice of corruption, especially by the "respectable" practitioners.

bangladeshi telecom engineers
mobile communication has experienced significant growth in the last couple of years throughout africa. to keep pace with this giant market growth, the biggest mobile companies of africa are relying mostly on foreign engineers. many bangladeshi engineers, those who were mostly working with different gsm companies in bangladesh earlier, are now providing the highest level of professional services in the african market and earning huge remittance. our motherland is known to be the place of natural disasters, political turmoil and other messy things. however, the days are not that far away when this stigma will be erased and our beloved motherland will stand with its firm, esteemed and glorious image to the international community. the huge amount of population that is often seen as a burden can make significant difference if we just turn them to manpower.
why blame the doctors?
case 1: a 50-year old man suffering from pain in the middle of the chest every night just before going to bed, which resolves after some time. he doesn't feel any kind of pain during daytime. he is moderately hypertensive and suffering from no other diseases. after consulting with his doctor the doctor prescribed him glycerol trinitrate to use when the pain starts. then the doctor gave him some laboratory investigation. after investigating the doctor prescribed him to continue the same drug life long for that pain. but, the patient again consulted some doctors and they also prescribed him the same medicine. although he is ok with this drug , he is still blaming the doctors, “the doctor told me to take this life long but why can't they cure it?”
election 2008
finally, we are going to have upazila election and general election at a time. the cec is considering that option.
essence of accountability
the long political turmoil that was brewing over bangladesh for decades finally ended up in the present fiasco. by now we know most of the covert and overt reasons of the gradual decline of our political system. the factor topping the dark list is the continual recession of government accountability in each fold of its activity. in strict sense, accountability means that public officials -- elected and un-elected -- have an obligation to explain their decisions and actions to the citizens. the absence of such a transparency mechanism gives rise to many an irregular action, the foremost of which is corruption. now that the closed vault has been forced open, we are appalled at the gargantuan volume of veiled misdeeds and corruption that got piled up over the years. lack of government accountability lies at the core of such massive fraud and deception. view the page international
