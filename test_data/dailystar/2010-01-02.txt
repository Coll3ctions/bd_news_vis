understanding special educational needs
do all students have similar cognitive styles and abilities to perceive and organise information? social and educational research says "no." learning styles and preferences vary greatly among students. it is then obvious that some students face difficulty achieving success at school. among them are those whom we categorise as students with special educational needs. they have learning difficulties or disabilities which make it harder for them to learn or access education than most other students of the same age. a student with special needs may need extra or different help at school and home because of physical difficulties, problems with thinking and understanding, emotional and behavioural issues, or a combination of these. due to a lack of awareness and sincerity, we fail to attend to their needs. however, we should properly accommodate students with special needs in regular classrooms and give them an equal learning opportunity both at school and home. view the page sports

crossfire deaths and exercise of power
the hon'ble home minister's apparently explanatory statement, describing the crossfire incidents as acts of self-defence by law enforcement personnel, brings into sharp focus the use and abuse of force by state organs. the question of proportionality in the use of force by those in authority has always been a vexing issue. cynics, however, say that in finding out the justification or otherwise of the use of force, the bias has been against people and in favour of the governments.
meeting the challenges after copenhagen
the copenhagen accord left key questions unanswered because it contained no specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by 2050. the pact called on developed nations to provide $30 billion to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change from 2010 to 2012. the text further says, by 2020 rich nations should "set a goal of $100 billion a year" for poor nations, especially the most vulnerable ones. with no specific binding treaty, the deal pledges to keep atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide low enough to keep average global temperatures less than two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels -- a threshold beyond which many scientists say dangerous consequences could result.
bangladesh also needs an edgar
how is an investor, living outside dhaka, chittagong, or abroad, supposed to get information about a listed company to make a wise investment decision? you might say that, to get information about a firm, an investor living in noakhali or abroad may visit the respective firm's website. unfortunately, most of the listed firms do not even have a website. very few listed firms, mostly banks, have websites with insufficient information. on the dse or sec website, there are hardly any audited annual financial reports of the listed firms. therefore, to invest in the stock market in bangladesh, one has to contact the respective firm's register office, or dse, cse or sec, which is costly, and sometimes, even impossible, given bangladesh's perspective. then, how do you make your investment decisions? is it that you invest based on what you hear on the media or from your friends who are also exposed to the same situation like you are? to solve the above-mentioned problem, i.e., lack of relevant information, and also to make the market more efficient and transparent, the sec must need to have an online database or archive like edgar, i.e., electronic data-gathering, analysis, and retrieval system. view the page environment

nazrul's protest poetry
kazi nazrul islam addressed the undying sense of self respect of the common man that persists, even as a hardly perceptible undercurrent, in the most trying of circumstances. he recognised that the weakness of the elitist centre meant a corresponding strength of the subaltern periphery, since through a series of strange binaries, the ebb and flow of the two mutually locked segments of our population shows each other's strengths and weaknesses.
lessons from a father

birth of the phoenix
it was the second time the white car passed us by. that was way back sometime in mid march 1985. my fourteen year old sister and i were in our father's car which had suddenly decided to halt right in the middle of dhanmondi road 3. no amount of pressing the accelerator or pulling the choke would make it change its mind. i had just got my british driving licence and had come to dhaka for a month's holiday. to be honest, i found it highly amusing when people used to stare at this pretty young girl (being myself!) navigating a car through the streets of dhaka. believe me, this was not a common sight twenty four years ago. but on that breezy evening the car was letting me down. this wasn't supposed to happen to a young and confident noveau-driver.! my cockiness began to somewhat deflate. the white car passed us for the third time. in the dark purple twilight i saw a tall, well built young man in a white shirt come out and walk towards us. “oh god!” i thought. i hadn't bargained for another problem. why hadn't i listened to abba and taken the driver?

chain up for cervical cancer awareness
although cervical cancer is the leading cancer in women of bangladesh, it is still a less spoken issue. the ironical thing about cervical cancer is that many women cannot access the free service to screen cervical cancer simply because of not knowing about the service. many women detected at end stage of cervical cancer when apparently physicians have nothing to do. unlike many cancers, we have vaccine and chap cancer test called via (visual inspection using acetic acid) to prevent and detect the disease at early stage. still it remains one of the top ranked killers. there is an urgent need to promote these services throughout bangladesh.

home truths from the great african moralist
the occasion of a new book by chinua achebe, africa's most celebrated writer and author of things fall apart, the great african novel, cannot be ignored. it's been twenty years since his previously published book and more than that since his last novel. much has happened to achebe and nigeria during those years, much of it not good. but even prior to those twenty years there was the civil war in nigeria (1967-1970), after the country's igbos succeeded and formed their own country called biafra. it took years for the scars of those events to heal (if they ever did). achebe and many other igbos were left in a state of emotional collapse and, if you talk to igbos today in southeastern nigeria, they'll tell you that a similar situation could occur again.
jinnah looked haggard, nehru lost his cool
in 1945, the president of the jamiat-ul-ulema condemned mohammad ali jinnah through issuing a fatwa, calling him the great heathen, or kafir-e-azam. it was a pun on the honorific quaid-e-azam with which india's muslims had honoured jinnah. in the days immediately following the partition of india in 1947, jawaharlal nehru was landed a resounding slap by a hindu refugee from pakistan at a camp in haridwar. the man, unimpressed by the prime minister's efforts to assuage the troubled emotions of the men and women in the camp, screamed, 'give my mother back to me! bring my sisters to me!' at the railway station in ambala, zakir hussain, a future president of india, miraculously escaped death at the hands of a hindu mob. the brother of rafi ahmed kidwai, a prominent congress politician, was stabbed to death. the daughter of ghulam mohammad, a future governor general of pakistan, was abducted. gandhi sat out the celebrations of independence, for all around him hindus and muslims were hacking away at one another in unimaginable fratricide. all across the indian subcontinent, in the weeks and months before and following the vivisection of the subcontinent, hindus and muslims were on the rampage, looking for men to murder, women to abduct and rape and property to loot.

it is these days quite fashionable to consider oneself politically correct. look around you. you don't have red indians any more, only native americans. though you might consider barack obama as america's first black president, you must be extra careful in avoiding using the old, denigrating 'negro' while describing him or any of his kind. it is african-americans that you have today. on a lighter level, do you realise that there are no housewives any more today? there are only homemakers, whatever that means. it tends to remind you of a rather pernicious term, home-wreckers, one that you associate with men and women who have nothing better to do than making a mess of other people's lives by falling in love, or lust, with other people's spouses. and then there is the way you describe a child whose intelligence is obviously of a poor quality. but, no, you cannot suggest by any means that he is unintelligent. he is merely one who has an attention deficit disorder.
ravishing beauty, sad life
madhubala, aged thirty six, died in february 1969. she had finally succumbed to the pains associated with the lifelong hole in her heart. and then there were all the other pains she went through life in the course of a career that was to etch forever her name on indian cinema. all these decades after her death, madhubala remains an icon. proof of that is to be found in the excitement with which today's generation has responded to the new, all colour version of the dilip kumar-madhubala starrer mughal-e-azam. it was the movie that raised the pair to prodigious heights of popularity. there are those who suggest that it was also a point when their real life romance was on the wane. remember the moment when dilip caresses madhubala's cheek with a feather, causing visible sensual thrills in her?
