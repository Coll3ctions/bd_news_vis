eid mubarak!
as we prepare to celebrate eid-ul-azha, we are reminded once again of the purity which comes of an observance of religious duties. for on eid-ul-azha we do not simply sacrifice animals as a matter of routine; we bring into that sacrifice a careful recalling of the spirit which must go into it. this observance of religious tradition brings with it the cardinal lesson of faith being a constant remembrance of the munificence which comes our way from the creator of the universe. and because of that munificence, the responsibility devolves on us to put ourselves in relation to our neighbours, our families, indeed to everyone in order for us to understand the sufferings and the various compulsions that people less fortunate than we are often victim to. our priorities on eid-ul-azha are, therefore, clear: on this noble occasion, it is for us to bear in mind the welfare, or the need for it, of others. and within that category of people come the poor, the destitute and the desperate. eid-ul-azha loses meaning when these men and women are forgotten or ignored.

special education
occupational therapy is a newly introduced health care system in bangladesh which works in special settings of special education. in many cases this special setting can be made at home for the disabled. special means that type of education, which meets all necessary things with special equipment, environment, management, techniques, aids and also methods for dealing with the special child. a child learns by seven senses that are tactile, visual, auditory, vestibule, gustatory, taste and proprioception when these senses are properly integrated. all sensations are properly integrated when they get proper stimulation and environment. an occupational therapist works with hypo or hyper responsive child who cannot learn in the normal environment. so an occupational therapist helps to make a special environment and a special education programme.
bangabandhu murder case
although i don't agree with our prime minister and her party on many issues (as a matter of fact with most of the politicians in our country), however my hats off to her for the way she and her government dealt with the bangabandhu murder trial. she has been in power for the second time and could have easily taken the path of revenge through military tribunal and hastened the trial. but instead of that she believed in the legal process and let things happen accordingly. at the end of the day this was a moral victory for our society and a sign that still the rule of law exists. it is true that corruption, nepotism and lawlessness are the permanent warts on our social fabric and it is questionable how much justice she could have gained had she been an ordinary citizen, but this is still a breath of fresh air.
a suggestion
since there are no immediate plans in the government's mind to start construction of new roads in the next 06-12 months to combat traffic congestion, what they can do is put barricades in different residential areas to control the entry and exit of traffic to the main roads. like they have in some areas (though not used). two of the gates/entry points will be used only for entrance and two can be used for exit purpose only. this can be implemented in all the so-called residential areas we have, including dhanmondi and gulshan with one way traffic in-between the demarcated area. for example if someone wants to enter dhanmondi, he can use road # 27 and take the 1st left turn (hsbc bank) or 2nd left turn (nandos point) from the eastern side (rapa plaza) to enter dhanmondi and go to different directions and leave dhanmondi from the southern side which is road # 2 going towards the mirpur road.
