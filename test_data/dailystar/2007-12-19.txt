niazi's book mocks jamaat's claim

commendable rab operation in the capital
the operation carried out by the rapid action battalion against suspected militants in the capital the other day appears to have yielded yet more information on what religious extremists in the country might still be up to. for rab, it was certainly commendable to have gone into such a crowded area as the one the alleged militants lived in and neutralise them. we occasionally hear of extremists being apprehended and nabbed along with a good amount of arms and ammunition. it is a sign once again of the degree of alertness that has come into the security forces. such a relentless pursuit of criminal activities must clearly continue with a view to ensuring peace and security in the country.
cash-strapped sidr victims
reports from patuakhali suggest that with suspension of disbursement of fresh loans by the ngos, sidr affected people are falling prey to the hands of money lenders known as 'mahajans'. small scale entrepreneurs are borrowing money from traditional lenders at interest rates as high as 15 to 20 percent a month. most of these borrowers are engaged in poultry, fish and vegetable farming and owning shops. with the coming of the ngo micro-credit operations, the mahajans were on the retreat. in current circumstances, however, money lenders are apparently coming to resurface by exploiting pauperisation in the affected areas. clearly such a state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.
pakistan, post-december 16 . . .
it is time to go back to a recapitulation of history. no, not ours, but that of the state of pakistan as it was in the days immediately after the emergence of bangladesh out of the ashes of what used to be east pakistan. as millions of bengalis celebrated the surrender of the pakistan occupation forces at the race course in dhaka on december 16, a state of understandable, perfect gloom descended on what had been till then west pakistan and was now all that remained of pakistan.
emergency's ugly children
emergency has ended, but not before it had done its work: amended the constitution further; the president can do without the usual indemnity act to validate his illegal and unconstitutional acts; the judiciary has been purged, and at least one troublesome judge has probably been exiled. such measures have completed the framework within which 2008 elections will be held.
gaining duty free access to the us market
for many years the holy grail of bangladesh trade policy has been to achieve duty free access to the united states apparel market. the attempts go back a decade but have not been successful. now there is bill in the house of representatives that, if passed, would provide considerable relief for bangladesh apparel exports. this bill is called the "new partnership for development act" and provides a partial solution for bangladesh, improving competitiveness by avoiding some of the duties charged on apparel. (in the language of the american congress a bill is a piece of legislation that has not yet been passed by the congress; an act is legislation that has been passed.) while the draft of the bill in its present form has several points that reduce its useful impact for bangladesh, there is room for negotiation and for adjustment of policies in bangladesh. first, consider how bangladesh might approach obtaining legislation that helps the exports to the united states. then some of the technical issues of the draft bill will be discussed. view the page sports

victory day
16 december is a day that takes me back to the day when i stood with other freedom fighters in the then race course, dhaka and witnessed the surrender of the last colonial commander on our soil. we believed on that day without any reservation that, hence the good people of this long subjugated country would be the sole owners of this land and shall govern themselves. with that hope, i returned to dhaka medical college to continue my studies to become a physician.

us game
america is playing complex politics and putting itself in an embarrassing situation with other nations who it calls its allies by issuing fabricated reports on countries of its dislike. recent revelations of american intelligence report on iran's nuclear ambitions and its build-up ridiculed it further. robert gates, us secretary of defence, in an international security conference held in bahrain said that everywhere you turn iran is fomenting instability and chaos. ms. rice, secretary of state, after drumming up support of a few nato states is now trying to gather support from her counterpart sergei lavorov of russia on sanctions to be slapped on iran. but the russian foreign minister didn't agree to her plan. we recall that after the twin tower attack, the united states was hell-bent on catching the bombing mastermind which is al-qaeda. however, it has since changed its strategy.
the prince and rupali bank
why is a saudi prince so adamant on buying the state-owned rupali bank? can you release more details about this prince? who is he and what is his rank in the royal family? does he wield a lot of influence? is his interest purely financial and to earn a profit or is it more complicated? i urge the government of bangladesh not to rush into this sale.
vcs
during the last bnp-jamaat rule, public university vcs were chosen or handpicked from the bona fide cadres of the party supporters. these party loyalists turned the public universities into party organs. corruption reports of crores of taka siphoned -off by these party cadre vcs appeared as headlines in the leading national dailies. but so far no investigation has been conducted by the anti corruption commission in this respect. perhaps the commission is busy with the political leaders!

remembering the valiant
in the month of december we gained our freedom. our well-deserved freedom was won after we defeated the pakistani colonial army. more than three million people were killed by the pakistanis. and a huge number of people lost everything in that war. the pakistanis committed crimes against humanity.
relocate kamalapur station
the idea of having a modern railway station at kamalapur was conceived in the early sixties and delivered in the mid seventies. at that time, the requirement suited to that of a growing provincial capital. at that time we were told that the kamalapur station would be the largest in asia. the bengalees believed whatever they were told. however, after independence, when opportunities came for us to travel abroad, we soon realised that the story was far from true. since independence, with the sudden transformation of the city into the national capital, the population increased more than twenty-fold. the movement of passengers as well as goods has increased tremendously. the railway runs through the heart of the city and traffic movement comes to a standstill at more than dozen crossings causing serious impediment to the city dwellers.
rangs bhaban tragedy
the very night when the rangs bhaban tragedy took place, i listened to the al-jazeera tv news. it said that in that pathetic accident 7 persons were killed and about 200 people had been missing. our electronic media at that time confirmed the killing of only one person.
‘tales of the biranganas'
the feature article 'tales of the biranganas' ( the daily star; december 14, 2007) again brought tears to my eyes and evoked a sense of rage. indeed, the pakistan army could not commit such atrocities without the active help of their al-badr and razakar war criminal slaves. on the other hand, bangladeshi people and governments in the last 36 years created the 'eighth wonder of the world' by not trying these killers and by rehabilitating them in every sphere of life.
bangladesh exhibition in paris
i have been shocked to see the protests in your newspaper by some well-known personalities about the proposed exhibition of bangladeshi antiquities in paris. i have recently attended a remarkable exhibition of ancient indian art in france and saw how others like me viewing these objects were moved and engaged by what they saw. it is a great pity that we are not giving the same chance to others to learn about bangladesh and our rich culture.
“bangladesh 1971”
it is immensely pleasing to see the successful holding of the first ever seminar held outside bangladesh on the genocide perpetrated by the pakistanis in bangladesh in 1971. it is even more satisfying to see that the whole idea of organising such a seminar and proposal for initiating the scope of academic research on bangladesh genocide and introducing the same as a post graduate course in holocaust and genocide studies programme at kean university is the brainchild of young bangladeshi arif rahman, born after liberation. i must thank and congratulate arif rahman and his team of young bangladeshis.
we need a change
what happened in our public universities after the emergence of the caretaker government? isn't the condition better than before? i don't like this state of emergency but as we see it works better to control those students and some of the teachers. 'student politics' it is nice to hear the term as it is representing the concept of democracy. but its consequence and effects are harmful. our parents' dreams revolve around our achievements. and when we lose our precious time in university just for some 'sick' people, we become frustrated. the private universities in our country do not have the facilities like the public universities, but they are doing well!
underground railway or elevated expressway
the letter on underground and elevated expressway by mr. o h kabir ( the daily star, 12/12/2007) does reflect the reality of traffic problem for commuters of dhaka city. i do agree with most of the points given by him. i would like to add a few more points in this regard.
du website
i have visited the website of dhaka university. but i was surprised to see the scarcity of information. though du is a leading university in bangladesh, there is a shocking scarcity of information. the website of du is still under construction!
fowl's post-mortem!
recently, in one of our national bengali dailies, an amusing as well as shocking piece of news was published under the title“murgir moina tadanta” (fowl's post-mortem).
martyred intellectuals' day
martyred intellectuals' day has become a part of formality. like every december we do not want to hear any more pledges. people now want to see justice. war criminals' punishment is now the demand of the nation. it is high time for raising voice and forging unity for the trial of the war criminals. the crime committed by them is unpardonable. they killed our eminent intellectuals . over the past decades, war criminals have been patronised by successive governments. as a result, after thirty-six years of liberation war they dare to insult the freedom fighters. no government bothered to take the initiative to try the war criminals.
our teachers
according to bertrand russell, the effect of aristotle's teaching on alexander was nil.
rajuk : deeply irresponsible
the deaths of the labourers in the rang's bhaban collapse were due to the fault of rajuk and they should be held accountable for their actions and given exemplary punishment, there should be a public trial over this issue as it amounts to death or murder through negligence. any tender which requires the demolition of a tall building would have to at the very least specify that the company must have previous experience in demolishing a high-rise. why did they hire a ship breaking company without any experience of demolishing a high-rise? this smells a little dodgy to me, did someone once again make a quick buck at the expense of the bangladeshi people? also, rajuk being one of the most corrupt institutions of the country, having extorted huge sums of money from developers and regular people for passing plans now has the cheek to ask these very people for help when they mess up. if i were a developer, i would turn the other way and fold my arms. some high ups in rajuk should be made to resign over this atrocity and cases should be filed against them. the acronym rajuk is synonymous with land grabbing, corruption, extortion, law-breaking and now murder. view the page international
