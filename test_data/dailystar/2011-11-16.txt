a young woman called farzana yasmeen
farzana yasmeen nipa has done us all proud. in a society of shrinking truth and declining heroism, this young woman from barguna has rekindled our self-confidence through her sheer, considered refusal to accept a man for a husband who has absolutely no shame in asking for a dowry. you hardly get brave individuals like farzana any more. more to the point, the instance is rare of a bride decisively walking off the wedding stage, changing back into her usual raiment and telling the man she has just married to get moving. in a social ambience where conservatism runs deep, despite all our emphasis on liberalism of belief and thought, farzana has achieved a feat. beyond an expression of this cliché, let us note that from her we have just learned anew the meaning of a principled attitude to life, a feeling that no one should take things for granted. the man she married and now will divorce, his aunt and the rest of the family ought now to be informed, from the point of view of both legality and morality, that they have sinned and have committed a criminal act and must therefore pay the price.
