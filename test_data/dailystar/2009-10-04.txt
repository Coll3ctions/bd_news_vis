the self-corrective approach is hope-raising
the likelihood of the ruling awami league preparing a plan of action to keep its members, particularly its wayward and unruly young elements, in check is obviously good news. we certainly expect it to come to pass. when indeed measures are in place for the party leadership to keep a watchful eye on the activists of the chhatra league and jubo league, it will be an acknowledgment on the al's part of the damage caused to its reputation by its very own. in these past many months, unceasing reports of chhatra league and jubo league men interfering with tender formalities and engaging in extortion have not only embarrassed the party and the government but have also led to growing concern about the state of democratic politics in the minds of citizens. the al's move to curb the misplaced exuberance of its younger camp followers has come rather late in the day, nine months to be precise. still, we take heart in the fact that it's coming to happen after all.

daylight saving time
daylight saving time (dst) was introduced in bangladesh a few months back. accordingly, the clock was advanced by one hour. but it is now widely accepted that whatever benefits, if at all, that might have been derived out of this experiment, could also be obtained by advancing the working hours by an hour without disturbing the clock!
human instincts
to protect himself from the attacks by the ferocious animals man had to invent and use some weapons at the primitive stage. they then began using such weapons to kill those animals for the purpose of using them as food. but at the same time man started using weapons and arms upon one another as enemy for various reasons.
neglected areas
it is known that lalmonirhat, nilpharmari and kurigram districts are the poorest districts in bangladesh and every year people of these three districts are affected by various natural disasters like flood, drought, cold weather, river erosion etc. since a large number of people of these areas fully depend on cultivation, the natural disasters harm them a lot and unemployment & poverty plague them continuously. for the well being of these ill-fated people, it is necessary to create alternative opportunities for employment by providing electricity to all for irrigation, bank loan, small & medium size agro based industries, manpower export after imparting proper training, allocation of high quality & productive seeds and fertilizers in time etc.
dependable power, delighted customers!
the other day i went to a bank booth of dhaka power distribution company ltd to pay my electricity bill. i saw the above words on the top of the main gate of the dpdc ltd office. it made me curious and i tried to read it again, but could not do it because of a sudden load-shedding at that moment. i was really delighted with the joke! the same thing happened in our village home a few months ago. when we started our dinner, the light went off. we had to use candles. the very interesting thing is that light came in only after we finished our meal. we all including our foreign sister-in-law were delighted! load-shedding brought both cities and villages together to share its burnt. i believe because of many odds the authorities cannot keep the power supply at the desired level. the people are not happy with the words only, they want action. so without any delay, the government should put all its efforts in this sector with which entire economic activities, industrial and agricultural, are directly linked.
report on fruits
i thank you for belatedly printing my letter. i am writing this letter as your reporting of 14 july 2009 has had a very serious effect on my food habits and has led to deprivation of essentials to my body. i am also requesting all the readers of this letter to please go through your coverage of 14 july 2009 and be judges of the matter themselves. who, after reading this, would dare to consume these fruits, etc? i did the same and have not been since taking at all the fruits abundantly available and displayed prominently in our markets all over.
magnetic levitation
the idea of magnetic levitation trains, mentioned in a letter published by you on 27th september, is very misleading. the statement, and i quote: "magnet trains run on power of magnetic fields created by electricity through wire, rather than electricity itself" is basically incorrect. the magnetic repulsion between the rails and the train eliminates friction, whereas motion is generated by friction between the wheel and rails in conventional electric trains.
rich and poor countries
the r&d in the rich western countries for cheaper applications of products used in the third world countries is not the current culture.
tax on vehicles
a notice has been published by the nbr in the daily star dated aug 13, 2009 on the procedure to be followed by taxpayers in paying vehicle tax. instead of making the entire cumbersome system of paying tax easier and trouble-free, they have added additional complications in the name of vehicle tax. some such irritating features are shown here. (a) a separate pay order is necessary for paying vehicle tax. it means additional payment of bank charges plus transport hassle. (b) a photocopy of the pay order has to be submitted to the it official stationed at the brta whenever the client needs to visit that office. (c) a 10-serial form has to be filled by the vehicle owners photocopy of which has to be submitted to the it official at brta. (d) all these are to be authenticated by the it return receiving office. view the page international

catalysing change
poverty reduction requires jobs, and productive jobs are created through investment. unless the climate for investment is conducive, investors will not be forthcoming. this much we all understand.
