month of purification
every religion enjoins fasting for achieving purification of the soul. fasting during ramadan is obligatory for every adult muslim. the muslims fast from dawn to dusk to please allah the merciful, and to obey his commands. but islam does not ask children, sick persons and very old people to fast. moreover, the musafir who travels very long distances may also not fast. fasting basically is an ancient form of prayer recognised by all previous religions. but islam introduced a new vision, a new spirit into the fasting system. for the first time in history, fasting was blessed with a systematic regulation, a scientific method, a noble justification. in the days before the holy prophet (pbuh) of islam fasting meant privation in the hours of mourning and sorrow.
