tongi garment worker violence
such a recurring spectacle, of workers attacking factories and laying siege to roads and halting traffic on the highway is clearly reflective of an ailment in the garments sector that refuses to be cured. in most of these instances it is the grievances of the workers stemming from arrear pay that have led to needless violence.
the threat to atir khal
the commandeering of lakes and rivers by unscrupulous individuals and organizations over the last many years is today a major public concern. the fact that much has been written about such nefarious activities does not seem to have resulted in any change of attitude among some quarters. the latest that we have on the issue is the bid to fill in an old, well-known water body in waaspur on the outskirts of the capital, known as atir khal. as reports have it, a housing society has been piling sand into the lake on the basis of what it claims documents allowing it to operate in the area. the amazing part of the story here is that, as an official of the waaspur garden city cooperative society has said, there is no mention of the canal in the documents the company has seen. it raises a mind-boggling question: since the canal has been there for ages and only five years ago a bridge was built over it, how is it that there is no mention of it in the documents?

as the bnp's political prospects brighten, with the awami league getting increasingly stuck with the incumbency and its concomitant answerability for anything called into question, the mood in the bnp camp is obviously buoyant and it stalwarts -- so long in hibernation -- are returning to the party fold in droves. many of its star leaders, not seen for months and even years, have started to show up in party forums -- an indication that the party is still left with a good deal of promise even after its fall from grace in the wake of one-eleven. in recent times, the media have also been projecting the bnp highlights with earnestness. also, a new assertion can be felt among the party's rank and file -- particularly in its junior echelons.

an indira gandhi moment
if so many male members of the delhi establishment were not irredeemably bald, the loudest sound in the capital would be that of hair being torn in frustration. those who have rescued their pates with american wigs (probably made with recycled hair from tirupati) or artificial implants are not going to risk their camouflage by an injudicious display of temperament. so the prevailing noise in delhi is the sound of gnashing teeth. the despair is over the upsurge of naxalite violence. view the page sports

warehouse fire
our attention has been drawn to the october 18 devastating fire of textbooks in the warehouse of nctb in mohakhali. it means that books will not reach the districts by november. so, the students will suffer. there will be discontent among the students, guardians and others. ultimately, they will be inspired or encouraged to go against the present ruling party (awami league led secular 'mohajote'). it appears to be an act of sabotage. we are curious as well as alarmed. there must be beneficiaries of the fire incidence, and there may be a political agenda behind it, or it may be a combined benefit-profit and political benefit. win- win situation for the devils!

real tiger!
what we need now is a player like shakib al hassan. a player like him is a real tiger. the way he played against zimbabwe is sublime. the temerity and the courage he showed was unbelievable. that's why i call him a tiger. not so muscular in appearance, rather lanky, but he nudges the ball to the boundary with great power. it showed clearly that he was the captain since he led the team home. but what other players like ashraful are doing is unjustifiable.
hara-kiri by al?
a realistic and detailed staff correspondent's front-page banner headlined report was published on 18 october in a local english daily. it reported on al's grabbing of things indiscriminately, left and right, based on the belief that "might is right". this will be the sure cause of doom for the al, whether they like it or not!
share market
wall street (us share market) was regulated and operated by many geniuses (educated in the best universities of the world). us fed was also headed by an extra ordinary genius like mr. greenspan. but what we witnessed is that the us stock market plunged in 2008. before that pundits predicted that the market would remain stable. the current bangladesh share market can experience huge decline because of 1.most of the share prices are very high (do not have support of fundamentals). 2. people who are involved in the market are trying to make quick profit by short trading only. most of them do not want to hold shares for long. 3. excess liquidity in the market is also pushing share prices without solid reason (only speculation). manipulators are active! 4. our banking and other financial institutions have exposed themselves to risk (by getting involved in speculative share trading now). when the market will crash they will be in serious trouble (bangladesh bank must see to this matter). which will in turn affect the whole economy.

the g20 summit was held at pittsburgh's david l. lawrence convention centre on september 2425, 2009. in reply to the global credit crisis, a g20 summit in one year was projected soon following the london summit in april 2009. announced shortly after the g-20 london summit, us president barack obama volunteered to host this summit, at the outset planning to hold it in new york city and coordinating it with the opening of the united nations general assembly. however, because of coordination issues, on may 28, 2009, the obama administration announced a change of venue to pittsburgh with the intention to highlight the city's economic healing following the breakdown of its manufacturing industry in the second half of the 20th century.
road to flattery!
mr. badrul ahsan's article clearly brings out the moral bankruptcy of our politicians. even thoughts of these hypocrites make us wonder about our value as human being who year after year is subjected to such insult on intelligence. i sometimes try to find solace in a different type of explanation which is:
border guards
after going through the recent serial reports on bdr and status of our borders in a vernacular daily, i was horrified, felt guilty. it speaks of the level of administration that we have since the creation of bangladesh.
vegetable production
vegetable is one of the essential food items for growth and maintenance of health. but in bangladesh people are facing a tremendous shortage of vegetables in different seasons. bangladesh is pre-dominantly an agricultural country with rich soil condition and climate. numerous types of vegetables are grown over here in different seasons. it is matter of regret that after four decades of independence we could not produce enough vegetables for the people.
effective solution
traffic jam can be significantly reduced even from tomorrow. the govt can introduce passenger train or shuttle train from airport station to kamalapur station during the office hours. there should be train stoppage on the route at banani, mohakhali, karwanbazar/moghbazar, malibagh rail-gate, khilgaon and kamalapur, so that passengers can easily use this train as city buses to reach their destination without traffic jam from different points of dhaka city. the bangladesh railway can adjust the schedule with other inter district trains giving priority to the movement of city dwellers. our existing rail line and railway property in the city should be used to minimise traffic jam. please think in a different way as we have many limitations.
first serial killer?
it's unfortunate to see that bangladesh has got its first serial killer. he has added a new dimension into the already extensive crime landscape of the country. i think the dramatic story of betrayal that this ruthless killer has portrayed as the motive behind his killing-spree must not be taken as a truth without conclusive evidence. it's quite possible that he made up this story that can be found in cheap bangla movies in order to conceal his original motive. it's apparent from the descriptions and nature of the murders that all of these murders are nothing but horrendous sex-crimes. all of the victims were raped before they were murdered and i think nothing but nasty sexual motivation was behind these killings. this guy is not psychologically disordered. he is rather a sex-obsessed maniac, who slaughtered innocent girls after raping and torturing them mercilessly. historically, sexually motivated killers (like ted bundy) were known as ordinary members of society until their gruesome crimes were exposed.
easing traffic jams
we have long been assured of steps like underground tubes, overhead expressway, link roads, circular waterways around the city to solve the nagging traffic problem. those steps are yet to see even the feasibility studies, only almighty knows when they will take off! we do not see any serious efforts to ease the traffic jams. only changes in office and school timings beget nothing. have the govt ever thought of double deckers replacing the mini-buses, and buses? if the govt goes ahead with the plan to completely re-organize the transport system with double deckers, it will cut down the existing number of public transports (mini-bus, bus) to nearly half. not only that, as a double decker takes longer time to get filled up so it decreases the frequencies of the vehicle plying. the city of london took it as one of the measures to ease traffic and it proved very effective. if the govt. plans it, it can be done within a very short time. the govt can think of giving soft loans to the existing transport companies to implement the project. we have huge liquidity in banks. we can not afford to go with this traffic congestion any longer.
obama wins nobel
the only positive side of obama's winning of the nobel prize, in my view, is that he prudishly reiterates the need for peace in the present world, although during his presidency he could add no feather to his cap which can be quoted as his achievement, especially in obtaining peace.
political killings
on wednesday 21st of october 2009, barrister fazle noor taposh mp, came under attack by what appears to be a bomb charged to the vehicle he was about to get in. he was lucky enough to survive the bomb attack which happened outside his office in the capital's downtown motijheel commercial area, but that left at least 13 other people wounded. what has happened has been disgraceful and very much damaging for our country. view the page international
