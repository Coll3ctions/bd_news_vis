when crafting foreign policy approaches with any country there are several strategies which can be adopted that can lead to success. but these same strategies can also lead to disasters. it is usual for policy planners to design and move foreign policies along commitments either received from a country or results they themselves are committed to. but if the future turns differently than predicted, a country may then have adhered to wrong strategies.

boundaries of friendship
friendship is always sweet responsibility, never an opportunity," wrote kahlil gibran. a recent incident set me thinking about the "responsibilities" and the "opportunities" that come with friendship. of course, the term "friend" is generic and doesn't always convey the true nature of the diverse relationships that one develops in the course of one's life. however, the most remarkable aspect of friendship is that it has undefined borders and is constantly evolving. a friend can assume any role: soul mate, confidante, mentor and, occasionally, just someone to share good times with. yet the ties of friendship are fragile because there are no strings attached. it's a relationship built upon mutual respect and love. also, one needs to work within self-imposed limits and boundaries and surf on a shifting tide, since life is in a state of flux for us all. but the most challenging part is that, more than other relationships, friendship tests one's capacity to accept, endure and make sacrifices.
