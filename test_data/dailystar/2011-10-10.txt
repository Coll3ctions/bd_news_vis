importance of extra curricular activities
renowned teacher mr. kaykobad in an article published in a national daily put emphasis on extracurricular activities like math olympiad. as a debater (i had participated in world universities debating championship) and a national champion in inter-college general knowledge championship, i agree with his points. it is the easiest and cost effective way to groom young generation by arranging knowledge fest, math olympiad, chemistry olympiad, debating championship, etc. it would discourage them to memorise their lessons and also improve their confidence level. both the government and private sector need to come forward to arrange such programmes on a regular basis to help the young minds grow.
withdraw ban on egg import
the price of eggs has again gone exorbitantly high. as a consequence, millions of consumers are suffering. we have been observing for a few months that the hatchery owners in connivance witth poultry farms are charging tk. 30 to 32 for a set of four eggs. if business ethics is followed, the price of one hali ( a set of four) of eggs could not be more than tk. 16. it has been observed in therecent past that when the government planned to go for open egg import on several occasions , the poultry and hatchery owners called press conferences and misled the public by saying that the indian eggs would bring bird flu and destroy thousands of poultry farms in the country. in fact, this is an ugly business tactic used by them. they convinced the government decisionmakers of imposing the ban and other restrictions on import of eggs. the cause behind the decision of the government of banning egg import is not understood by the people. a democratically elected government must not continue such ban resulting in price hike of eggs. the government should withdraw all sorts of restrictions on egg import - without further delay. this withdrawal of import restrictions will help lower the price of eggs. the poultry and hatchery owners should not be allowed to make extra profit at the cost of millions of consumers across the country.
executing bangladeshis in saudi arabia
it is with horror that we have watched the news of the beheadings of eight bangladeshi migrant workers in saudi arabia. what explanation does the foreign ministry have for this horrific act perpetrated upon our citizens in a foreign land? how come the international human rights groups have not uttered a peep? is it because a bangladeshi life is less valuable than that of others? the men were not given a proper trial, we believe, and what defense was provided to them was reportedly in arabic, a language not understood by the men being put to death. is it not about time that the ministry of foreign affairs called in the saudi ambassador and demanded an explanation? or are we too afraid to do that? what are we afraid of, i would like to ask the minister of foreign affairs? if the bangladeshis had committed a crime, couldn't they been deported? working in saudi arabia does not mean giving up all rights to a basic dignity.
political situation
the present political situation in bangladesh is not in a good state. rivalry among the political groups is increasing day by day. this is not at all a good sign. it seems none of the political groups have learned their lessons after 1/11. should the general citizens keep on suffering because of the activities of some politicians? rather than thinking about the economic growth of the nation, these so-called political parties think and waste their time on stupid issues.
please do something for the country
some political leaders in our country, either in power or in opposition, cry for the well-being of the common people. are they really crying for the people? or they are just trying to protect their ill-gotten wealth? some of the leaders are seen shouting in the meetings and processions ostensibly to protect the interest of the common people. though we know them very well what they are really up to, we cannot say anything about this. in the daily newspapers, we read many reports on grabbing of the rivers and government khas land by the mps and the influential political leaders of both the ruling and the opposition parties. but we do not see any action taken against them. such a report was published in the daily star on 5th october 2011. it said that one awami league lawmaker was filling khas land ands a part of the buriganga river for setting up a power plant and an amusement park.

bengali in english medium schools
although bengali is taught as a subject in the english medium schools, i have enough reason to believe that the syllabus they offer for bengali is not up to the mark. perhaps less importance is given to the learning of bangla and its literature. if my observation is correct, most students of the english medium schools are afraid of studying bengali. and their proficiency in bengali is not satisfactory. i have heard that some english medium students, who have passed a level and then graduated from private or foreign universities, are reluctant to sit in the bcs exams as they are not well conversant with the bengali language.
