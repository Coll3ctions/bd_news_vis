celebrating shakespeare . . .
almost 400 years after his death the works of shakespeare show little sign of losing their popularity. rather the reverse, perhaps, in a year when he is repeatedly both re-written and performed in his original state for television and radio, and produced in his entirety by the rsc at stratford, with a variety of movies in a variety of costumes and periods. love him or hate him, it seems shakespeare is still inspiring passion and firing debate not only in england and america but all over the world, including bangladesh. a discussion on the relevance of shakespeare in today's world is undeniable. a reader or a theatergoer does have to be neither a bardolater nor a shakesperoid or buff to have delight and wisdom while enjoying his plays or discussions on him.

i had the privilege of closely knowing professor jahangir tareque since 1965 when he joined chittagong college as a lecturer in bengali. i had joined the same college a year earlier. during those days chittagong college was one of the biggest and best colleges in the then east pakistan, having more than one hundred teachers at various levels and with honours courses in several disciplines. locally it was known as b.a. college. some fifteen fresh graduates from dhaka and rajshahi joined the college in 1964. some of those who had joined earlier two to three years back belonged to the same age group. thus, young teachers constituted a significantly large group with close and cordial relationship among them. during off-time we used to meet in the teachers' room. sometimes we used to go to the seaside or on picnics, no matter whether it was winter or summer. view the page star health

despite many challenges and much of a tense situation, the probable influx or intrusion of rohingya muslim minorities, coming to teknaf area following torture and threats, could have been barred by the bangladesh government. because of the fast tame-down of the violence in rakhine state, where most rohingyas live along bangladesh border, after nearly in two weeks amid the loss of over 50 lives and around 2500 houses burned, the number of intruders was less this time compared to the massive inflows of 1991, 1978-82 and earlier. the rohingyas are the most ignored and deceived community since they are denied citizenship and ethnic identity in myanmar, a country which had been ruled under military regimes for decades, and still, but now under a relatively liberal ruler who promises massive reforms.

the campus in our history . . .
the arrest of huseyn shaheed suhrawardy by the martial law regime of general ayub khan on 30 january 1962 sparked intense resentment among the student community in east pakistan, to a point where leading figures of the chhatra union, chhatra league, chhatra shakti and the pro-regime national students federation felt the need for action. the groups met the next day at madhu's canteen and decided that the students of the university would observe a general strike on 1 february. thus, for the first time in the more than three years which had elapsed since ayub khan's military takeover in october 1958, a decisive move had been taken by the students, which was an early sign of the troubles the regime would confront in the times ahead.
