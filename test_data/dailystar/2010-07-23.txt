js body on amending constitution
a fifteen-member special committee of lawmakers has been formed by the jatiyo sangsad to study the ways and means of putting the country back on constitutional rails in light of the judicial judgement nullifying the fifth amendment to the constitution. a nation's constitution is a crucial document responsible for helping it chart its course to the future. that is why we believe that the move to bring about the necessary amendments to the constitution vis-a-vis restoring its original form is a serious task that must be approached pragmatically. in its essence, the 1972 constitution, for all the changes that have been wrought in it over the years, remains a fine document for the country. the liberal democratic principles it enshrined through its various articles have by and large given us reason for hope about our future.
deaths during diagnostic test or treatment
death of a woman while undergoing diagnostic test at a private clinic at the dhanmondi area of the city has again raised the disconcerting question of safety standards in our hospitals. the mayhem that the unexpected death of the woman set off among her relatives leading to vandalisation of two clinics in the area and beating up of doctors was, however, an undesirable sequel to that tragedy. but there is also little room here to make light of the attending doctors' responsibility to come up with a satisfactory explanation for the unwarranted death. view the page sports

sri lanka win huge
at the start of his final test, he was eight wickets short of entering territory that no other cricketer had. he began his last day in test cricket needing two, and took one. his partner threatened to take everything else and he could do nothing but keep on bowling, and wait. the umpire denied him a palpable lbw. vvs laxman, who kept him at bay for so many hours, ran himself out and there was only one wicket left to take. he waited and perhaps even fretted. he nearly ran out the last pair himself, twice. after 23 wicketless overs, with perhaps growing doubt about whether it would come at all, the moment arrived, and muttiah muralidaran was there, where no man had gone before. the long wait for the 800th wicket only exemplified the toil that went into the preceding 799. and by the way, sri lanka won his farewell test too, by ten wickets for the seventh time.
murali's grandiose exit

the forlan supremacy
at the start of the 59th minute in the uruguay-germany play-off for bragging rights for the third place in the world cup, a strange thing happened. it was strange, because for the duration of the month long extravaganza in south africa, it had not been spotted, and if anyone cares enough to look through the archived footage one day, it is well worth a wager that claim will stand the test.

guidebooks
the govt. distributed nearly 19 crore textbooks among the students of primary and secondary levels at the very beginning of this year. those books were distributed free of cost with a view to ensuring education for all. moreover, most of the textbooks are now available as online electronic books. it is obviously a praiseworthy action of the present govt. but the fact is that the students aren't interested in reading textbooks. they pay more attention to reading guidebooks available in the market. hence, the creativity of the students is being greatly hampered. a textbook is a manual of instruction or a standard book in any branch of study. they are produced according to the demand of educational institutions. as the students do not read textbooks, they are not aware of the textual facts and they answer questions incorrectly. although the govt. banned all kinds of guidebooks and notebooks, the publishers did not pay heed to it at all.
river pollution and factories

damaging hartals
hartal does not solve any problem. rather it breeds more and new problems, confrontations and lead to sufferings of the people. hartal costs a loss of taka two thousand crore countrywide a day. how many hartals have we observed during last two decades? according to a national bangla daily (bhorer kagaj 26/06/2010) the awami league has enforced 311 days and bnp has enforced 295 hartals.
dress and religion
the daily star has published at least two letters referring to modesty and dress code for women, which might reduce the incident of teasing (?). the dress code of any nation is inherited by cultural practice and is part of social norms and changing style. it is not necessary to challenge the freedom of choice of an individual as long as it conforms to civility and is publicly acceptable.
erl's expansion costs
the report on the matter was published in most dailies on 11th july. the cost figure was indicated at around us$867 million in total, covering both foreign exchange needed and also the equivalent local taka, that is needed. this comes to taka 606.9 crore (based on 1$=tk70). if we consider a liberal interest rate of say 5 percent for financing this expansion, based on repayment period of say ten years, the additional cost of refining will be around 20 paisa per litre on the total refining capacity after expansion to 4.5 million ton annually!
load shedding
load shedding is a serious problem in bangladesh for a long time. students are facing a lot of problems as even the ips is not being fully charged. as a result, when load shedding is taking place in different sectors of uttara, the ips is running. the buildings using generators are not in a better condition. the generator is consuming a lot of oil. oil is a non renewable source of energy which is quite costly.

richest indian in history!
who was the richest indian in history? according to forbes magazine, it was late nizam osman ali khan (1886-1967), the ruler of the princely state of hyderabad, whose wealth, in the purchasing power of the inflation-adjusted us dollar terms of 2008 would have been the stupendous sum of usd 211 billion dollars. the world's richest man living, bill gates pales in comparison, as he is worth only usd $56 billion, about one fourth of the nizam's wealth. by the same yardstick the personal wealth of the present king of saudi arabia was a plain usd 30 billion.
veil
the pcp article (18 july) is very lucidly and cogently written. i congratulate engr. nurul islam for this. as mentioned by him in final analysis, the full veil is not an islamic requirement but has developed as a survival technique for women in a predatory society ruled by ruthless warlords in the middle east.

blackout inside blackout
a three-hour movie takes up to five hours to watch. clothes must be ironed at least one hour before one is ready to go out. the microwave doesn't always work, so a hot meal is as chancy as a roll of dice. between power cuts, favourite television shows are rare to catch. the last charge bar blinks on the mobile phone, while the user is worried sick about recharge. tide may still stick to its guns, but time has lost its place in life. now, even time has to wait for its hour to come.

in memory of tajuddin ahmed
the first prime minister of free bangladesh" -- a phrase, associated with great honour and dignity. yes, mr.tajuddin ahmed, who happened to be the first prime minister of free bangladesh rightly deserved the honour and dignity as stated above. he was a leader of great ability and farsightedness.
our tragic hero
after bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman it is perhaps tajuddin ahmed, his closest aide, who can be termed my favourite bangladeshi politician. his intelligent and thoughtful role all through march 1971 turned him into my favourite hero.
a people's man
tajuddin ahmad -- the first prime minister of bangladesh was born on july 23, 1925 in kapasia under gazipur district (then dhaka). today is the 85th birthday of this great man, who is termed by many an "unsung hero." maybe he was not totally unsung, but the song is almost always sung in a low voice, with much less volume than it deserves. i greatly admire this man as the executant of our national liberation, while i regard bangabandhu as the organiser (1966-1970) and moulana bhasani as the dreamer (1957) of the liberation. view the page startech
