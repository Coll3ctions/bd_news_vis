felling of trees in the tea gardens
it is not surprising that the large-scale felling of trees in a tea garden in srimangal has outraged people everywhere. we wonder whether the forest department's order, issued in 2008 permitting the cutting down of the trees, had considered all the relevant pros and cons of the issue. it may be recalled that the order was held in abeyance (by then more than 1000 trees had been cut down) by the forest department in the face of opposition from the locals living in the area and environmental activists, only to be allowed again, this time with enhanced rate of royalty.
the passing of kg mustafa
k.g. mustafa belonged to a generation we can rightly regard as pioneers in our world of journalism. his death at the age of eighty-four is therefore a harking back to a time when values underscored the presentation of news and with that a formulation of opinion in newspapers. throughout his adult life (and it actually commenced in his teens), mustafa made it a point to remain steadfast to the vocation he had opted for, a position he did not waver from in his long life. following the partition of 1947, he clearly seemed to have decided that while the newspaper was going to be his preoccupation, both as a principle and as a profession, it would also serve as a vehicle for the promotion of political and social causes. the trajectory of his life shows all too well that mustafa upheld the causes he believed in. in the chaotic politics of 1950s pakistan, followed by the harshness of the decade-long ayub military regime, mustafa and a very large number of his peers saw little reason to suspend the battle for truth. view the page sports

swann thanks tredwell
england spinner graeme swann is a firm advocate of superstition. which is why he always bowls with his sunglasses on, as he believes it will bring him better luck. and who would argue with the tall off-spinner, after he grabbed his fifth five-wicket haul in his short 17-match career in the first test against bangladesh at the zahur ahmed chowdhury stadium yesterday, with his sunglasses firmly in place.

health hazard
we have seen many a time photos published in the daily star with the caption 'hello mayor'. this was to draw the attention of the mayor of dhaka to take note and to ensure some action in public interest. but we don't know if at all any action had been taken. when and after what 'grave' incident will his department wake up to redress the plight of the citizens, it is only to be seen.

ffs' children quota

religious sermons
every friday comes as a weekly eid day for muslims. it is an important duty to listen to the sermon called khutba in arabic. the imam always reads out some important lessons for the pious muslims. it is for sure that most of the listeners do not get the point exactly made for their enlightenment. though it is obligatory for muslims to have a little understanding of the arabic language for the sake of the religion, but it is neglected. hence the important sermon is listened to but not significantly understood. and muslim parents of modern societies attach less importance to religious teachings, regrettably though.

name game
traditionally, bangladeshis have a penchant for symbolism. names, metaphors, slogans have always got precedence over substance. it is an integral part of bengali psyche and history is replete with such examples. but the present cause of concern among the people lies elsewhere: it is the name changing of public places which worries them. now people can easily understand that these are not done to show any respect to any of their leaders but to demean them.
vicious circle
in bangladesh, till now no political party has ever won an election; it has always been the case of the other party losing! what makes it worse is that irrespective of who the government is or what their election manifesto was during the campaign, once in power the strategy is always the same:

desa control rooms
the capital experienced the first kal boishakhi storm which caused some damages and inconveniences to the city dwellers, one being the failure of electricity. i live within the jurisdiction desa's shyamoli control room. soon after the rain stopped i started contacting the shyamoli control room to lodge a complaint of electricity failure. the first problem i faced was to get the telephone line as the control room has only one number, i.e. 9146043. anyway after re-dialling for about half an hour, i got the line and lodged the complaint. the officer on duty informed me that it might take a few hours before they could restore the power supply. then after a few hours the electricity came but unfortunately the voltage was very low. again after trying for quite some time i got the line and complained about the low voltage. this time, the duty officer told me that it would again take some hours to mend the fault as the number of complaints were so high and their men are attending one by one. mentionable that the control room has only a limited number of technical manpower plus emergency vehicles.
open secret
with the passage of time we are confronting day by day some inevitable questions. what can we do if the police compel us to give a false confessional statement? what shall we do if we are arrested and displayed before some illegal weapons and ammunition which actually belong to the police themselves? how can we tolerate when we see the police are being assisted by some terrorists in an operation against some innocent persons? what the police will do if they are compelled by some powerful directors(political big boss) to arrest someone illegally? how can we get the truth if the media supply only partial news and views? how can we continue our education if there is a wide cultivation of terrorism in every educational institution? what will happen to our sisters who are facing the constant threat of abduction and rape?
renaming
in the newtonian universe every 'action' elicits an equal but opposite 'reaction' (3rd law), and the current naming/ re-naming in bangladesh is no exception. unfortunately, newton did not get time to work on the next theory about the reaction of 'reaction'. view the page international

sheikh hasina goes to china
the proposed visit of bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina to china on march 17 is timely since the ties between the two countries have been characterised by comprehensive cooperation for the last 35 years of their diplomatic relation.
the pakistan case
in pakistan, terrorism has become an endless cycle. consecutive suicide bombings in peshawar, the bomb blast near indian embassy at kabul, and the tehrik-e-taliban attack on the army ghq in rawalpindi, one of the most sensitive places in pakistan, raise questions on the effectiveness of military operations both in afghanistan and pakistan.
macro-economic performance and puzzles
in an international conference organised by the bangladesh institute of development studies (bids) in connection with its golden jubilee celebration few years back, my favourite teacher and world-famous economist dr azizur rahman khan (best known as ar khan) revealed a few pertinent puzzles that he observed in our macroeconomic calculus. i strongly feel that his seminal observations, presented below and at times paraphrased - of that time are worthy of notes even now for teachers and students of macroeconomics as well as for policymakers.
glimpses of k.g. mustafa
k.g. mustafa was already a well-known name in journalism when i was in school. and the first time i heard of him and of other illustrious figures in the world of bengali journalism was when my father reflected on what the newspapers in east pakistan were writing in the era of field marshal ayub khan. there was no way i could read mustafa's reports or his commentaries. in the first place, i was at the time yet to get a grip on my understanding of written bangla. in the second, the newspapers mustafa and his peers worked for in east pakistan did not make their way to baluchistan, where my family happened to be. that was in the 1960s.
between promise and delivery
it was such a relief to learn, from no less an authority than home secretary g.k. pillai, that maoists aim to overthrow the indian state by 2050. that gives us four decades during which the plus-40 bourgeois can die in their beds; those blessed with first jobs in 2010 can retire in comfort, and hope for a ringside view of the revolution; and those below 20 can worry -- unless, of course, they have joined the revolution.
