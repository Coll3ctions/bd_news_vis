bhutto in dhaka
dr kamal hossain is the only surviving member of the awami league team which engaged in the fateful negotiations with the yahya khan regime in march 1971. as he tells it, on this day in 1971, he was summoned by bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman in the morning. when he turned up at bangabandhu's residence, he found the awami league chief busy in conversation with tajuddin ahmed. bangabandhu informed hossain that he had been giving serious thought to the question of a transfer of power and from a strategic point of view he had come to the conclusion that a formation of governments in pakistan's five provinces would be in order. judging by the way the situation was developing, bangabandhu believed that it would not be wise for the awami league to take power at the centre at that point.

non-lethal approach at the border
every time chiefs of india and bangladesh border guards sit for talks in an ambience of professed good neighbourliness, somewhat mismatched by untoward border incidents, a fresh resolve to come to grips with border killings has been in evidence. efforts for an improved border management are there, yet one wonders why the issue of border killings still keeps figuring between the two governments. given the level of friendly political will manifest at the highest levels between the two countries and repeated assurances of non-lethal approach at the border by india this issue should have been squarely left behind by now.

impossible is nothing
mushfiqur rahim's men introduced a new bangladesh to world cricket by reaching the final of the asia cup after beating sri lanka in the must-win game at the sher-e-bangla national stadium in mirpur yesterday.
best already, even better it may get
days like yesterday, when bangladesh beat sri lanka to reach the asia cup final for the first time in history, transcends the limitations of sport. to understand the importance of such an achievement, one not only needs to appreciate the travails of the bangladesh cricket fan, but also the peculiarities of life in bangladesh.

the unfolding of history

indian trio don't stay for finish
while mahmudullah riyad and nasir hossain were steering bangladesh from a slightly precarious position to the cusp of victory, the eyes of the whole nation were fixated on the sher-e-bangla national stadium.
tigers' consistency impresses mahela
before the tournament began, sri lanka were considered one of the favourites, if not the favourite, to win the asia cup, having returned from a strong showing in the cb series in australia. but it was a completely different picture as the league stage ended yesterday at the sher-e-bangla national stadium with a game against bangladesh. the sri lankans were winless after three matches, with bangladesh's second consecutive win taking them through to the final against pakistan.

rethinking bank supervision
bangladesh bank has been repositioning its focus on bank supervision in a strategic way. we are monitoring the condition and performance of the banking sector with sharpened risk focus, taking up new initiatives to improve our oversight, both on-site and off-site. as part of that initiative, we have been holding town hall meetings of bb supervision staff -- nationally and regionally -- to know from them the ground realities and then providing necessary guidelines to strengthen the quality of oversight. the core objective is to integrate all aspects of supervision and realise a new architecture where oversight focuses, especially on institutional and systemic risks in lending and other business activities taken up by banks, and on how well corporate governance and internal control processes in banks deal with these risks. recently i inaugurated a regional town hall meeting in chittagong following the national one held in dhaka, where i provided some necessary guidelines to the field supervisors. let me share with the readers some of those ideas.

traffic roundabouts
in bangladesh, roundabouts are the accepted norm for traffic management and control across four-way road crossings. however, i came across different ideas, when i went through a professional traffic related journal in usa, a few years back! their view was that a traffic roundabout was suitable for intermittent and low density traffic. also the view around and across the traffic circle had to be totally clear for any vehicle driver approaching it from any direction and the traffic lights faultless! needless to say, it was taken for granted that all the vehicle drivers were disciplined, trained, licensed and fully aware of traffic rules! the visibility circle all round the roundabout was considered critical and traffic stoppage line at any road leading to the roundabout had to be minimum twenty five yards from the nearest circumference of the roundabout.
introduce gas meters
this is in reference to the letter of r.d qureshi from dhaka titled 'price of gas and its wastage' published in the daily star on march 14, 2012. he rightly pointed out that increasing gas price will not stop the wastage. he mentioned that the adviser to the prime minister, dr. tawfiq-e-elahi chowdhury said that domestic users waste gas as they get it cheap, so the price is going up to stop the wastage, and for a double burner cooker, one will have to pay tk 1000, in place of tk 450 per month.
harmful side of hevs
every technology has its positive as well as negative impact on the users and the environment. same is the case with hybrid electric vehicles (hevs). hevs are fuel efficient and apparently environment friendly. hevs cover twice as many kilometers per gallon as conventional fuel vehicles. they produce less gas emissions than conventional cars.
hard working, but poorly paid, traffic police
every time we hear the word 'traffic police' or 'sergeant', a very negative picture comes to our mind. the hard-working and skilled sergeants are only paid tk. 6,400 as basic pay which may increase with promotions. it is true that they are benefited with other allowances, but is 700 taka medical allowance and 55% house rent enough for them to survive?
tribute to dr. sirajur rahman khan
i am the proud son of a humble geologist. that geologist has written his name in the history of bangladesh forever for his work on the maritime boundary conflict with myanmar. of course, there were a number of lawyers and ministers who fought for our rights, but the irrefutable data was provided by my father, dr. sirajur rahman khan, who worked and crafted the data that made our dispute simply indisputable. although none of the newspapers carried all the names of the people who worked on this, i just want to thank everyone involved in this project, a first of its kind in the world. the significance of our victory may be lost for most, but i am proud of his achievement, because it has made our country stronger. an intellectual victory!
israeli designs against iran
it is just a matter of time israel starts attacking iran. at least that's what the indications show. recently, israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said he told chinese leaders that iran poses the gravest danger to world peace and stability. israel is afraid to see iran with nuclear weapons. lieberman said that israel hopes negotiations and sanctions can resolve concerns over iran's nuclear ambitions. he blatantly said that iran is the biggest threat not only to israel, but to the entire world, including all of the middle east. we really do not know how, all of a sudden, iran became a threat to the world peace. it is israel who is making all sorts of troubles with its neighbouring countries. whatever it is, we think israel is hell-bent on striking iran any day soon.
getting mrp in usa
we, the bangladeshis in usa, are happy to know that bangladesh embassy/consulate generals have started accepting applications for machine readable passport (mrp), but i am very upset reading the procedures of how one can obtain the new passport. i believe most bangladeshis in usa will agree with me on this issue. it is stated in the regulations that to obtain mrp one has to apply in person to embassy/consulate generals and also collect the mrp in person after 15 or 30 days. therefore, one has to visit the embassy/consulate generals twice. anyone living in usa knows how many embassy/consulate generals we have (1 embassy + 2 consulate generals). now think of the hassle one has to take.

our leaders' priority list
the honourable prime minister at long last has eaten humble pie. in a view-exchange meeting with the khulna district unit of awami league at the gono bhaban last week, she admitted that the “strict” government measures prior to bnp's march 12 rally caused public sufferings. but what she said thereafter was rather an act of self-defence than a confession. without recognising the heavy-handed measures as undemocratic, she rather asserted that the measures, including those of equipping bcl activists and pro-al labour wings with sharp weapons and ammunitions, were necessary to ensure public safety and welfare.
food security or safe food security?
the world food summit (1996) defined food security as: “food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.” this definition covers three major areassufficient, safe and nutritious food for all. but in recent times, emphasis is given mainly on having sufficient food for all and accordingly on producing more and more food. this overshadows two other major aspects of food security: safehow safe it isand nutritionhow nutritious it is. we have to keep in mind that market availability alone cannot guarantee food security
politics of despair
when the alwas voted to power by a sweeping majority in december 2008, there was a sense of shared hope and optimism shared by many across the country. there, right then, was the opportunity for a new style of politics to emerge that would be dictated by the interests and welfare of the people rather than the vested interests of a few self-serving demagogues as seen in the past. election day, itself, seemed like a day of celebration akin to any other festival in the country. that fantasy of a stronger, more politically stable bangladesh has, since then, ruthlessly unravelled.
