home minister's explanation of 'crossfire' killings untenable
we are indeed shocked by home minister sahara khatun's assertion that there have been no 'crossfire' killings under the present government. the shock takes an even more acute form when she describes all the killings that have gone on as acts of self-defence on the part of the security forces. we would like to point out here, in the clearest and most unambiguous manner, that in the past many years these deaths from so-called crossfires have given the country a bad name. what now makes these deaths extremely regrettable is the fact that the awami league, before it rode to power at the general elections a year ago, had strongly made clear its opposition to 'crossfire' deaths and had indeed pledged to put an end to them.
acid violence more rampant than reported
a national dialogue focused on open market acid sell in bangladesh organised by actionaid on sunday ended up being a fairly comprehensive discourse on acid violence. it has not only been a revealing statistical update but also a fairly diagnostic analysis suggesting some antidotes worth applying against the social malady. the statistics are simply hair-raising: we have it on the authority of the executive director of acid survivors' foundation that 3,000 cases of acid-related violence were reported during last 10 years in the country. this works out to an average of almost one victim per day. but these are reported incidents, and with the unreported ones added, the magnitude is simply appalling! yet the more horrific reality is that only 10 percent of perpetrators ever get punished.
the politics of unending surprises
there is no end to the surprises that our politicians keep piling on our doorsteps. the bangladesh nationalist party, which has never seen any reason to say sorry for its bad governance between 2001 and 2006, now has happily made it known to the country that henceforth begum khaleda zia will be its chairperson without anyone being able to challenge her on the leadership question. the amended party constitution makes this much obvious.
one year of al-led government

dst
the present government is doing a number of good work but one fails to understand why they are exposing themselves to criticism through making mistakes which could have been avoided. day saving time has become a sore point for everybody, particularly the young mothers and children. one wonders whether it has been imposed on us by a third country. otherwise, why the govt should be so stubborn despite the fact that majority of the people are against it. we are now one and a half hour ahead of india which means our international business closes 90 minutes early if the office time is up to 5:00pm in india. this provides more business opportunities for our competitors in the neighbouring countries. this is also funny to note that a cabinet meeting is needed to say 'no' or 'yes' to such a small issue.
