violence and the young
one could call it a storm in a teacup. and yet what happened in the dhaka university area on monday turned out to be something worse. an argument at a tea stall between students and the stall owner over change for a hundred taka note took an unexpected turn when policemen tried to calm everyone who happened to be getting agitated. and so what followed was predictable. students of the university tried to resist the police, who in turn went into action to discipline the young men. what happened to the tea stall owner is not known. that is natural, for all too often the causes of a bad situation often get lost when bigger elements are thrown into the chaos.
a rush of smiles on a sprawling lawn
everyone is talking about the moment sheikh hasina and khaleda zia met the other day, about the way they greeted each other and smiled at each other. knowing the way things go in bangladesh, you can be sure that it is a subject over which a lot of people will spend a lot of time talking. the process is already under way, and not even the adviser for home affairs could resist the temptation of telling us what actually transpired at the armed forces day reception. it was he who let us in on the revelation that the awami league chief had sometimes cooked her own food while in incarceration and had sent some of it to the bangladesh nationalist party chairperson. we have not been told, though, if begum zia had done some cooking on her own and whether she had reciprocated sheikh hasina's gesture.

meeting of the two
the nation is again in the grip of the two leaders, sheikh hasina and khaleda zia. what they did during their stay in power in the past is known to all and what they will be able to do in future is also not beyond imagination. they have become leaders not by their leadership qualities but by virtue of luck and the failure of other politicians in both major political parties to come out of the shadows of the two ladies. i was in saudi arabia for a long time and had to listen to the joke from saudis that there was no man in bangladesh having moustache! this is the fate of this nation.
street children
street children are a worldwide phenomenon. that they are in the streets for many different reasons should not discourage attempts to look at their problems as a global responsibility. if you are an adult and you live on this planet, be aware now that many of our children are going to sleep hungry tonight, in the streets, with no adult protection or care. millions of children are living in the streets, and the number is rising.
political reforms
i refer to the pcp article by professor nazrul islam entitled "vital reforms ignored" on 21 nov. his recommendations to reduce the tenure of an elected government from 5 to 4, to induce tolerance by the losers for the winner, is indeed a pragmatic idea and a newly elected parliament must take this on board for consideration. four years has been the tenure of the elected us president from the inception of its constitution about 2 centuries ago and it has proved its worth over this time for the unity of such a disparate nation, and for the development of a tolerant democracy.
edible oil price
edible oil price in local market has gone up again.
election date
the bnp's backing down indicates that they would not boycott elections at all, even if they were held on the 18th as scheduled. delaying the polls by 10 days really does not benefit the bnp. the rescheduling of the dates for nominations gives them a little additional time to prepare, but as far as the polls are concerned, 10 days will make absolutely no difference to their preparation or chances. the only logical reason that i can see for this demand is that delaying by a week to 10 days puts the elections during christmas time. many foreign observers will cancel their trips. i'm sure you are aware that there are still a fair number of bnp sympathizers within the administration, especially the ec, etc.
change for the better
change, change, and change. change is everywhere and change is part of life. if we accept good changes, we will grow, if we reject them we will be lost. america shows that you can change yourself to new choices, new relations, new ideas, and finally to a new life. the question is how many of us are ready to embrace this shift in our paradigm.
agriculture day
declaration of pahela agrahayan as the 'national agriculture day' by the government has sparked pulsation to the community life of our farming people. farmers throughout the country have celebrated the day with great enthusiasm and jubilation. the government deserves appreciation for declaring the national agriculture day by recognizing the men behind the plough who are actually the prime driving force of our economy.
experience!
i would like to pinpoint the present situation of our job market and the attitude of the employers of multinational companies. there is scarcity of job opportunities and the job seekers have to face the question-- "experienced or inexperienced?". my point is, nobody could be experienced while seeking his/her first job!
rats
rat killing drive is launched in our country under the patronage of the agriculture department of the government. the drive should be launched on a regular basis and the whole nation must be included in this task for the greater interest of the country.
michael jackson
none of the criminal cases against michael jackson could be proved beyond reasonable doubt. none of the civil suits could be proved with balance of probability. he is a clean man as per the definition of law. he even moved to the middle east. but the witch hunting continues which is paradoxical to the human norms and laws of lands. he is innocent as not proven guilty. now he has been confirmed to have converted to islam like many other celebrities in the west against all propaganda and media campaigns against the faith. the sun is one of the best selling tabloids in the uk where the story has grabbed the headlines of its 22 november issue with a shocking ridicule against islam which put jackson in a burkha, as if islam and burkha were synonymous terms. absolute example of disgusting taste in any form of civilised journalism.
secondary education
the government and ngos are working for improving the quality of secondary education across the country. particularly brac and tqi (teaching quality improvement project) are providing training to head teachers and teachers. obviously, there are other projects and ngos also working for the betterment of english teaching-learning situation in secondary schools.
education and employment
bangladesh is fighting against poverty since 1971. till now a significant chunk of the population is poor. ensuring two meals a day is a major challenge for this country. the government is trying to ensure education for all to fight against poverty. but only a small section of our people is getting higher education facilities. it is a matter of regret that those seeking higher education are also not being educated according to the needs of the age.
limited resources
our resources are limited. we waste our resources indiscriminately. if it goes on, one day there will be no resources for our general use.
licensed and illegal arms
in the last few days, most national dailies have published photographs or reports about owners depositing their licensed arms in police stations. that is good news, as far as it goes, for reducing the possibility of violence during the election period. however, the real and important thing is seizing the unauthorised arms, bombs and explosives; as well as eliminating the many workshops where these are being manufactured. this is a critical need to ensure not only a peaceful election, but also a peaceful country, which we badly need.
truth commission
it is interesting to see the truth commission, which shoulders the mammoth task of exorcising some accused with such alacrity, has got the dose of legal medicine, that is, the very legality of it formation is now in question. view the page international
