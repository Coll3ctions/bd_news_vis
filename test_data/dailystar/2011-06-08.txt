kashmiri aimed for indo-pak war
the pakistani and the us authorities are reluctantly claiming the death of militant leader ilyas kashmiri for the third time in the last three years, but they still lack the knowledge about his network, aims and the capability of his 313 brigade despite the fact that kashmiri was actually a genie created by the pakistani establishment. he served the interest of the us in the 80s and of pakistan's in the 90s, but today both american and pakistani security establishments want to celebrate kashmiri's death based on some confirmation. pakistani security agencies have arrested a number of people, who were once close to kashmiri, from different areas but the agencies are not ready to admit that the violation of the article 256 of the constitution of islamic republic of pakistan by the pakistani state actually made many people admire ilyas kashmiri.

the intensity with which both the ruling party and the opposition are focused on the caretaker government issue says something about their attitudes to the problem. the prime minister has in these past few days been reiterating her position that the door is open for negotiations between the government and the opposition on the ways and means of arriving at a solution. it is certainly appreciable that sheikh hasina has now assured the opposition that no one-sided solution will be imposed. her invitation to the bnp to return to the jatiyo sangsad and present its own formula towards finding a way out of the crisis is perfectly in order for the simple reason that at this critical moment both sides need to reach a compromise in the larger interest of our future.
protecting whistleblowers
