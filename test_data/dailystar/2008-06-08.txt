predictions of fall in remittances
remittances from bangladeshis working overseas might fall over the next two years. and it could happen because of some recent actions taken by countries where we have traditionally exported our manpower. one does not need much wisdom to know how badly off we will all be if such conditions come to pass. of late our manpower industry has been hit badly by government actions in malaysia, saudi arabia, bahrain and other places. while we realise that the governments of those countries have the right to formulate their own policies regarding migrant workers from abroad, we also feel that the bangladesh government should by now have adopted a strong and constructive position regarding our people working there. it is also important that the host countries go through rethinking vis-Ã -vis their own migrant worker-related policies. it is equally important that any misgivings here be removed at the earliest.

the secret diaries of manmohan, advani
how could my fellow-traveller buddhadeb bhattacharya call me the worst prime minister india has had? that stung. i rather like buddha. i know his typea sheep dressed in wolf's clothing. i've done my bit of lip-service to socialism. what option did one have if you wanted some trajectory up the old congress bureaucracy greasy pole? indira gandhi would spread nonalignment at breakfast and turn pink with the salad over lunch: poor dear, no one told her that nationalisation and nationalism are not quite the same thing.

spiralling food prices
it is a common practice in bangladesh to censure the authorities for everything and demand that the government quit. now the most talked about issue is the price hike. the prices of the essentials are rising almost every day. the prices of most of the food products have doubled in less than a year. but to overcome this crisis as a nation, we have to think deeply about this matter and analyse the reasons behind the price hike. if we take a look at the international arena we will see that the food prices have ascended globally in a brief period of time. japan is looking for alternate flour because of the rising wheat price. india, vietnam and egypt have put constraints on exporting rice to meet the local demand. the philippines has announced a ban on converting farmland to other uses in order to cut import of rice. it has to be realised that the food price predicament is global. cheap local political solutions do not really exist.
cu incident
the recent incident at cu is very shocking, where a student jumped from an over-bridge onto a train, failed to reach the train, fell on the rail lines and eventually died. what the students did in response to this incident is also very shameful. may be, at first they could not know the reason behind his death. here, in bangladesh, if anything happens against the rights of the university students or anything they don't seem to like, they vandalise vehicles, harass commuters etc. they never seem to understand that they are destroying our national property.

sustainable development
sustainable development is possible only when the development workers have two attributes.
1. skill
2. honesty
our country is developing with highways, multi-storied buildings, mills, factories. but the development will not be sustainable without skill and honesty.
our future
too often we say, âpast is pastâ while referring to some unpleasant memory, meaning that it is better to think about the present & the future. if we scale down a little more we can even feel comfortable to keep aside the present and seriously think about the future. as a nation what is there in the future for us? our motherland is the most densely populated country in the world and one of the poorest too. after the agricultural products, we are surviving on garments and manpower export. the first one is unpredictable as weather & other natural calamities are major factors that determine the output and the second one is already suffering due to destructive activities. the third sector i.e. manpower export is also experiencing setbacks, the most recent one being in bahrain that halted employment of bangladeshi workers following a crime, a solitary case that has now affected all bangladeshis working in that country. the government of saudi arabia where about 15 lakh bangladeshis are currently living, has also stopped issuing residential permits creating deportation fear in thousands of bangladeshi workers there. our import dependent economy is facing daily challenges from rising oil prices which may hit 200 dollars a barrel at the year end. above all, if the present pace of global warming continues unchecked, one fifth of bangladesh will go under the sea by 2050, making 20 million people landless & homeless.
leaders
we heartily appreciate the most practical and appropriate speech by dr. kamal hossain that was published in the daily star of may 31. we observe that some political leaders are regarded as âgoddessâ by some political parties. they think the law of the country cannot be imposed on them, they are above trial and enjoy immunity.
blind followers
it seems our politicians are not interested in any smooth transition to democracy. they have put their carts before the horses. they want their leaders out of jail before anything else, no matter what happens to the nation. they do not like dialogue, they have now patched up their differences with their rival parties, they are becoming united for a âsangramâ. we are surprised to note that even yesterday's arch enemies are demanding release of their rival leaders. the friends and foes are uniting themselves to take us, probably, to the era of pre-one-eleven.
saint martin's
i have read with great interest the article on "saving the coral biodiversity of st. martin's island." congratulations to the author, dr. md. m. maruf hossain. i should like to make my own contribution to our knowledge of the fauna of the island, collected on a one-week scientific expedition to the island led by the late professor m.i. choudhury of dhaka college in 1957. i made a collection of marine nematodes, two of which were new to science: theristus sanctimarteni timm 1958 and monhystrella marina timm 1964 (the only marine species of the genus).

prospects of english
i am an undergraduate student at the department of english in a private university. as a student, i have always noticed a kind of inferiority complex among the students of my department and that is, they have a feeling that with a graduation degree in english there is hardly any possibility of getting a good job in the present job market, since all the employers are looking for mba holders, not english âliteratureâ people. however, to my opinion this is one of the wrong ideas that people have about the students of english language and literature. why? let's have a look at the following points:
armed forces
the chief adviser and the army chief duly praised the good work done by the country's peace corps which took part in missions abroad. the ca also took the opportunity of mentioning the armed forces' contribution to the nation from time to time.
tofail's reaction
people of bangladesh are not at all surprised to see mr. tofail ahmed's reaction, as expressed in the print and electronic media, to the recent filing of a corruption case by the acc against him. the typical way he has reacted is well known to our people. all charges of corruption against our politicians are always 'false and fabricated'. he also hinted that it was a politically motivated case. his political colleagues spared no time to give him a clean chit and urged upon the government to withdraw the case unconditionally. that's what they all had been doing for the last sixteen years. politicians in our country fail to arrive at agreements on issues related to the welfare of the people. but they take no time to come out in a body, like the members of a trade union, with full force to save their colleagues whenever anyone of them is charged with a corruption case. can we ask them a simple question: if all of them are innocent as flowers, as it is commonly uttered in political slogans, then who did the corruption in the last sixteen years ? who were responsible to place bangladesh on the top of the ti's list of corrupt states for years together ? and, finally, why should the acc, a non-political independent organisation, file 'false and fabricated' corruption cases against mr. tofail and other politicians ? will any politician be kind enough to answer these questions ? view the page international
