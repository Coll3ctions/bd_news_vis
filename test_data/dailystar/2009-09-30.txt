gridlock reappears

dealing with extremist threats
news of the discovery of secret jmb training camps deep in the hills as also elsewhere has the nation properly and justifiably concerned. it is one more powerful indication of the persisting menace that threatens to keep the country on tenterhooks as long as the outfit and others like it are not neutralised. the good bit here, however, is that the law enforcing and security forces, namely, the police and the rapid action battalion, have remained busy identifying the camps and flushing out the elements busy trying to undermine the state. we appreciate the skill and confidence with which they have been going after these extremist elements and so persuading the nation that things are well in hand. there is, of course, yet a long road that must be travelled before such elements can fully be put out of existence. we cannot pretend that the menace is gone. it is yet there.
