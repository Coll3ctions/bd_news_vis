indo-bangla maritime boundary talks
the fact of the matter is that no tangible results have been arrived at by bangladesh and india at the end of their three-day conference on maritime boundary issues. and yet both the sides at the meeting held in dhaka have described the outcome as fruitful, which is just as well. when one considers the fact that these talks took place after an inordinately long gap of twenty-eight years, one will surely describe the event as encouraging, to an extent. it must be noted that such issues as maritime boundaries are of crucial significance in relations between states. indeed, they have international significance given that they are linked inextricably with such legalities as the law of the sea. the question therefore arises as to why bangladesh and india, being such close neighbours, had to wait nearly three decades before getting down to discussing the issue.
what a logic to fell trees!
the jahangirnagar university authorities have evoked strident protests from environmentalists and students alike following their decision to fell a few hundred old trees on the campus. the strange move is being ostensibly taken to keep off the poachers who have been spiriting away some of the trees for good money. presumably, they want to rid the campus of the inviting trees. rather than staving thieves off by effective security vigil, the administration seems to have taken a convenient route to appear in a salesman's role. the timber business will surely add to the university coffers; but at what cost?

how about better business for consumers?
in a post-budget write-up on this page, i mentioned that the fy09 budget was generally pro-business but biased in favor of production of import-substitutes over exports. now, i would like to argue that the tariff structure it put in place did much to prop up producer profits with precious little for consumers to be excited about. this could be a case of benign omission rather than willful design. let us not forget that consumers are the entire population of bangladesh -- 150 million strong. producers of manufactured goods in particular -- the main beneficiaries of the latest tariff adjustments -- would not make up 1 percent of the population. let us acknowledge the fact that they are much better organised and have far greater lobbying power than all the consumers of bangladesh.

bitter democracy?
what do we want to achieve through the general election? better or bitter democracy? we saw that in the early days of the ctg due to the anti -corruption movement most people were optimistic that bangladesh might be writing a new history. a new horizon was going to be introduced before bangladesh. most of the culprits were sent to jail. most of the corrupt organisations such as biman, titas, rajuk, and the dcc were targeted.
good advice, but...
barrister rafiqul haque articulated perfectly what every sensible person has in mind. he urged the two belligerent leaders of our political arena to come to senses (he should have said that in bangla). he urged khaleda zia and hasina wazed to sit together, if needed, at his place, and come to terms for the sake of the country, for the people, for themselves and for their beloved party (read group of cadres). we wholeheartedly support barrister rafiq's clarion call.

the holy month
we are in the month of serenity, sanctity, festivity and philanthropy, that is holy ramadan. there is another characteristic which is acknowledged by all the inhabitants of the land, that is the ghostly appearance of price hike of necessary commodities. though price hike is the common phenomenon of the land, it seems to be intolerable in the month of ramadan. especially, the poor people are the victims of such kind of price hike in the name of ramadan. we, the service holders, have the salary with bonus, but the poor people earn the money not enough for meeting their basic needs. we have to see a lot of faces living under poverty line.

compact township
the idea of a compact township is brand new to most people of the country and as a result we are unaware of this plan, but the good news is that it has far reaching positive impact on both our land and well-planned growth in crop production to mitigate the growing crisis of food. the compact township generally involves building up cities within the villages of bangladesh in which people would receive some modern facilities viz. schools, colleges, healthcare for their children. indeed, the villagers shall live within a particular periphery and accordingly they do not have to waste their cultivable land. apart from this, the stakeholders of compact township will have electricity supply in a planned way and this apparently may reduce shortage of power in the land as opposed to ill-planned connection of electricity for many different scattered areas in bangladesh . although this is a proposed idea invented by a buet professor and afterwards unanimously supported by all quarters including the powers that be, the project needs to be emphasized on a priority basis keeping the future of the country in view where we are doomed to losing lots of pieces of land annually. but before implementation of this project, workshops, seminars, symposiums should be organised to help accelerate the process.
