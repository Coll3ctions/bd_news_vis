new threat to haikkar canal
there is bad news again from the environment front. despite public concerns about canals, lakes and other water bodies being filled in with sand and stone by unscrupulous elements, despite administrative and even judicial measures to put a stop to such encroachment, there seems to have been little improvement in the situation. it is true that of late the authorities have moved toward reclaiming many canals and similar water bodies in and around the nation's capital. it is equally, and sadly, true that in some way or the other the nefarious elements responsible for turning these water bodies into something of a wasteland manage to sneak back to the scene and begin their dark work all over again.
prisons without doctors
it is dreadful revelation that 57 out of 67 prisons across the country do not have a single doctor to come to the aid of the inmates during illness. what is more atrocious is that prisoners serving rigorous imprisonment are given the task of nursing the patients because of the absence of trained nurses. we wonder what would the situation look like if epidemic of an infectious disease breaks out in any one of those prisons. as there would be no place to shift thousands of prisoners within a short time it is only probable that a large number of them would get infected and face death or impairment of health.
lessons from haiti
the devastation of port au prince, the capital of the central american state of haiti, has made it glaringly evident what havoc a powerful earthquake can wreak on a country that is poor and not well-prepared to face a natural calamity of colossal magnitude. though this island nation is no stranger to calamities, especially sea-borne ones such as hurricanes, the quake that struck it last tuesday afternoon was the first of its kind in the last 200 years.
a post-secular nation?
muslims, the world over, are in a quandary. continuing terrorism by a small segment of muslims in the name of jihad against "infidels" and their reportage in the global media have resulted in the framing of western attitude towards the muslims as a people chained to their roots and unable to adapt their system of politico-economic governance and social life in accordance with democratic principles understood "as a universal ideal (and) as the capacity of men to control their life in society through communicative reason and public institutions ( carlo galli of university of bologna-reset sept/oct 2007 )."
arsenic in paddy
on january 14, 2010, the daily star reported an increase in the accumulation of arsenic levels in the topsoil of agricultural lands that are irrigated by arsenic-rich groundwater. the article referred to a recent study by professor badruzzaman and professor ali (both of buet). in their study, the professors reported that paddy grown on lands that have been irrigated by arsenic-rich groundwater contain up to 0.3 milligrams (300 micrograms) of arsenic per kilogram of paddy. a relevant but unanswered question is whether this level of arsenic in the grains is a health threat. while the daily star article is rather ominous in its tone, some analysis based on who and fao data leads to a less threatening conclusion. view the page sports

sanctity of shaheed minar
my recent trip to shaheed minar shocked me to the power infinity. i could not find any match with the image aired on television every 21st february and the one right before my eyes. considering this is bangladesh, i was less than half expecting the national monument being embellished with fresh beautiful bouquets in the middle of november, but expecting a decent and honourable scene at such a historically blotted place isn't too much!
river madhumoti
the dead madhumoti has become a great worry of gopalganj people, as it has never been dredged properly. recently the government authorities have decided to re-excavate the river and beautify the surrounding areas.

good movie, but…
a few days back i went to watch the widely campaigned movie “third person singular number” by mr. mostafa sarwar faruki at garrison cinema hall adjacent to my residence with one of my relatives. since purchasing the ticket to watching the movie i was not at ease. although the cinema seemed to be thought provoking about what is happening to a lone girl in our today's society, i think it could mislead the youth. let me give an example-- in the first scene, where the heroine tisha was chased by a teaser and some hooligans while seeking a shelter to spend the night, i found a section of the audience making obscene remarks loudly as if their suppressed feeling found an expression in the form of the characters on the movie. from the beginning to end, such obscene remarks continued.
food for thought
there was a time when a conservative muslim woman would have preferred death to a touch of her body by anybody other than by her husband. it was unimaginable on the part of a muslim woman to move outside of her home without cloaking her entire body with a 'burkha' and wrapping a curtain around the passenger seat of a vehicle where she would sit to travel. getting photographed was also deemed sinful.
girls
i acknowledge that presently the state has given the girls freedom in many areas. but the family is still a problem. first of all, a family does not want to spend money behind the girls' education. in spite of being qualified, she is often not admitted in any good educational institution if it is far from her residence. on the other hand "the situation is completely different for a boy.
sharing river waters
the teesta water sharing agreement is on the anvil, as reported in almost all dailies on 5th. january. from one report in a daily, i quote the indian water resources secretary's remarks. he stated, "we want to share water with bangladesh, there is no doubt about it." what remained un-stated is the ratio of water to be shared. even if we get the leftover, say five percent of teesta water, even then it is sharing; justifying the basis of the very positive statement given by the indian secretary!
satellite tv channels
satellite tv channels greatly divert our young generation from our rich heritage. earlier our youths were influenced by western culture but with the introduction of satellite tv channels they are now dominated by indian culture. noticing that those channels were diverting our young generation to foreign culture, the local entrepreneurs launched local satellite channels. atn, the first private tv channel, started operation in 1997. gradually other channels came into being. at present about 17 local private tv channels are continuously airing programmes upholding our long-cherished culture and tradition. but if we shuffle through the channels we will come across the ubiquitous dance sequence of the indian music video. unfortunately, the young generation is easily lured into those things.
open and distance learning
i read in your daily, one column on open and distance learning written by dr manzurul islam. that was good writing. i also think that this method of learning should be accepted by the govt and people. i have visited several websites of universities teaching with this method. i think this service responsibility should be distributed to the private organisations. one more public open university and at least one private open university should be allowed to introduce this system as early as possible.

teenagers
we are in 2010. a lot of people think we are in an ultra-modern era. so, we would like to be so fast, especially the teenagers. in this time they wish revitalization of their vigour & visionary powers. obviously, this tendency has some positive and a few negative aspects. the positive side is that if the teenagers are devoted to their own goals in life, then they will be able to enjoy a dynamic life.
consultancy firms and students
every year a good number of students are going abroad for higher education. they are taking help from student consultancy firms. in most cases parents are allured by the advertisement of the student consultancy firms. student consultancy firms are hiding information and giving false information for doing business. if they give proper information to the students and their parents then they can mentally prepare themselves for any circumstances. after getting the information from the student consultancy firms, their expectations go high. but practically they are facing a different situation. just for example, the uk has graded their colleges & universities in a and b and imposed restrictions on recruiting students. the tuition fee of the colleges varies from 2500 to 4000 pounds. most of these colleges do not have enough space to accommodate the students as well as don't have enough classrooms. after the economic recession, the uk has made some tricky decisions for economic development. the highest revenue comes from the education sector. for that they have relaxed their immigration rules. their main target is to collect the cash money from all over the world. in the last six months approximately 30 thousand students have gone to the uk from bangladesh for higher education. but most of them have the plan to do job there. it is known to all that due to economic recession people are losing jobs all over the world. in this situation how can you expect to get job there? but the student consultancy firms are still informing that it is very easy to get a job in london.
a wrong policy
the year that saw a revolution in country's education sector must be painful for people who really want a change in education system for substantial development of the country. i was astonished to see dhaka university's admission procedure that technically banned students from madrasa backgrounds from getting admitted to some key departments. more amazingly, the decision coincided with rising militancy threats that turned out to be a big obstacle for the country's development, investment and everything. this insurgency is mostly led by some madrasa teachers and students.
ship-breaking or death game?
when world leaders gathered at copenhagen to compensate the nations affected by environmental pollution and to find out some alternatives or to reduce, to some extent at least, carbon emission to save the planet as human habitat from global climate change consequences, we are simply playing our death-games at sitakundo ship breaking zone defying all warnings and dangers. in an explosion on 26 december last year while dismantling the oil tanker mt agate in rahim diamond steel product, a shipyard owned by one hazi abdur rahim at madambibirhat, 4 people were killed on the spot and 2 more later and many others were injured. in the last three months, 13 people have died in three separate accidents and 22 in the last one year . since 1984, about 1, 000 people died and 6,000 injured in the ship breaking accidents at sitakundo. at present 37 shipyards are operating at sitakundo with about 4,000 workers. according to the daily star (01/01/2010) and the daily prothom alo (28/12/2009) , about 3,000 ships are waiting globally to be dismantled most of which will surely enter into bangladesh and sitakundo will grab its share, no doubt.

indo-bangladesh relations: view of a new horizon
that small is beautiful does not hold good in this world, not at least in the domain of international relations. in the new world order, it is quite natural that the nations of the world, particularly the economically weaker and smaller ones, will re-evaluate their development needs and revise their politico-economic requisites. therefore, it is more pragmatic to think regionally than nationally for the obvious reason that meaningful inter-state economic cooperation would invariably ensure sustainable growth and development.
