a modest step forward
the outcome from bali climate conference can be seen in a positive light given that the usa is party to a consensus which it has not been during the kyoto protocol days since 1997. in a last-minute dramatic turn, the us reached a compromise with the european union, tilted towards itself though, to the effect that no numeric range in slashing green house gas emissions was adopted in the declaration. aside from the usa, it does not also require two of the largest emitters of the world, india and china to take on reduction commitments. yet, a framework to launch negotiations and a timeline for reaching an accord by 2009 to fight climate changes has been spelt out.
massive power breakdown
the major nationwide electricity failure on saturday came like a bolt from a clear sky with no gale or cyclone in the vicinity whatsoever. it was a mechanical failure at the national power grid originating at ashuganj and it took hours for the pdb technicians to repair the glitch and bring back normalcy in life. our guess is there is hardly a functional auto-reactive mechanism in place to arrive at a solution within the shortest possible time. by all means, it was an irritant of a large scale as day to day work almost came to a halt at many places. among the mentionable sufferings, trade and commerce activities and hospital services were severely disrupted because of the obstruction. to say the least, the experience made the citizens ponder anew the dismal state of our existing electricity generation and distribution system.

sweet victory and awful defeat
when victory showered this nation on december 16, 1971, two things came to our then young mind: the birth of a free nation and at last the enemy has been defeated. it is not possible to put in words now after so many years elapsed, the relief sweet victory brought to this nation. view the page sports

annapolis m-e conference
many times on many occasions, at different venues, places, cities and capitals, the usa has arranged, invited, proposed, promised and lured the leaders of the arab world for statehood and freedom of palestine on the basis of 'two state solution' of arab-israel conflict for comprehensive peace in the middle east. but all the meetings and discussions proved futile due to us-israel secret deals, intrigue and dilly-dally tactics. we feel the annapolis conference sponsored by us president george bush would again end in a fiasco.
sidr
as bangladeshi we all are familiar with different types of natural calamities. the repeated floods and the recent sidr led to deaths of thousands of people and dislocated many other things. but sidr could not destroy our mental strength. we can rise up again.
sun temple
the sun temple of konark is situated at konark city in the eastern part of orissa in india. during our family trip to india, i longed so much to have a glimpse of sun temple which is very famous worldwide for its intricate sculptures and carvings. at last, after lots of persuasions and arguments, finally i managed to make my father agree to go to konark.
street beggars
the number of street beggars has increased enormously in the metropolitan dhaka city, especially, in most of the traffic signals, foot overbridges, in front of mosques. many of them are crippled (amputated foot or arm) walking with the support of crutch. blinds are begging with the support of either son/daughter or a caring person.
“micro-credit interest charges”
much as i appreciate your publishing my article on the above subject in your today's issue (29th november 2007), i have to convey that there have been some mistakes in understanding my technical paper which are as follows:
release of university teachers
it is great news that the four teachers of rajshahi university have been released unconditionally and that has really reflected the hidden feelings of general public. we are also very eagerly waiting to see the government decision on the release of respected teachers of dhaka university as well.
setting a wrong example?
teachers have the greater burden of setting the moral standards not only by teaching the same in the classroom but by living by them. when a teacher teaches about moral behaviour and discipline in his classroom, only the students sitting inside the four walls of the classroom have the opportunity to learn. but when they live by that, the rest of the world have the opportunity to learn the same. as you can see the later form of teaching not only has an exponential effect compared to the former.
mp's qualifications
i disagree completely with the writer under this heading (10 dec) that an mp candidate must have 15 years of political experience at union, thana, zilla level etc. such a requirement will fossilize the political process for career politicians and there will be no newcomers and no new big ideas. the writer has also been misinformed about such a process in other countries; for instance in the uk there is no such requirement. that is why una king could be nominated and won the tower hamlets seat for labour in 1997 when the local career politician with long experience ms. paula uddin made way for her.
ci sheet price
cyclone sidr hit barisal division and parts of khulna & dhaka divisions last november. as most of the inhabitants of the affected areas are poor, they cannot even think of pcc/rcc building. they have to reconstruct their shelters with wood, bamboo and corrugated iron (ci) sheets. but the price of ci sheet has gone sky high in the last one year. general people cannot afford it. in the international market the main raw materials of ci sheet, hot rolled coil (hr coil) and zinc ingot have risen sharply.
inaccurate news
in btv news on the armed forces day on wednesday, 21 november last, it was mentioned that the bangladesh armed forces comprising the army, navy and air force had come into being on 21 november 1971. the information is not correct. neither the armed forces, nor the army the navy, the air force was formed on 21 november 1971.
decline of colonial powers
the exploitation of the third world by the rich industrialised countries, that is colonialism, continues, directly or indirectly. today the dcs and the ldcs are facing additional pressures: natural disasters, relocation of factories, and the hunt for untapped sources of natural energy. bangladesh is a victim, and is under increasing social pressure due to turbulences in religious escape routes, for economic salvation, and the trappings of western democracy templates. the newly emerging nations are facing the indirect effects of the global village syndrome. the it effect on societies has increased the awareness of the masses [note the hartal on shortage of fertilisers]. the reduction of the communication gaps in the have-not societies has made corruption a hard issue to tackle by the regimes, lured by the economic disparities between the first and third worlds. now religious extremism is sought as an escape route back to religion, not back to virtual politics.
textile technology institute
the low investment, low technology and labour intensive garments industry has developed tremendously in the last two decades in bangladesh. huge demand of production ingredients like, nit & woven fabric, button, jeepers, level and packing materials of the garments industry created scope for backward linkage industrial units. a good number of industrial units have been set up in the last couple of years to cater to the demand of the garments industry, especially yarn producing spinning factories, fabric producing factories, processing dying and washing plants that have come up and created a good number of jobs. but these backward linkage industrial units are confronting shortage of technical experts in textile technology these days. on the other hand, every year thousands of crore is spent by the government of bangladesh to impart general and religious education in public and private school and collages, which ultimately increases the number of unemployed educated youths. what a pity!
divorce
now-a-days divorce, a widespread social disease, is affecting our family life. but have we ever deliberated on what the possible factors and consequences are and what remedial measures we have to adopt to redeem our people from its gangrenous effect? actually, it is high time we did so and any procrastination may deteriorate the situation hampering all possibilities of finding out a desired remedy. however we have to diagnose the ominous trend with a critical and analytical attitude. in doing that the most obvious factors that come out are conflict in personality, impact of satellite channels, extra marital relations and so on. in this case we have to remember that marriage is a holy bond that can never be defiled by noxious causes as mentioned above, it is a gateway to peace and prosperity, felicity and success and above all sound life through commitment, sympathy and co-operation. whoever embarks on this new life should be committed to maintaining that marriage does not mean momentary pleasure only and it is not a child's plaything that is vulnerable to personal whims, nor a commercial enterprise that is contingent upon monetary gains; over and above it is a track of patience, prudence and sacrifice for mutual understanding. but in our society modern couples, driven by their impulsive decisions, never care about the bedrock of marriage and take it for something worthless. that is they are very often seen embroiling themselves in personal attacks against each other with reference to faithlessness, sense of superiority and inferiority, dowry, difference of opinions, maladjustment in ages and so on which lead them to hasten their separation. this is a typical picture of our society which indicates that we are trying to keep pace with the western traditions, hurling away the age old unity and sympathy without ever considering that a little bit of patience, prudence and sense of propriety can ward off the painful situation. but before that we have to participate in indirect action against the tendency. view the page international
