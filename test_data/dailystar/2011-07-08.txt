teacher's sexual assault on pupil
the furore arising over allegations of sexual assault on a female student by a teacher of viqarunnisa noon school and college is of deep concern to citizens. one of course heaves a sigh of relief now that the alleged perpetrator of the crime, porimol joydhor, has been taken into custody. but the damage the incident has done to his victim and her family as well as to the reputation of the school itself is incalculable. and yet all this ugly publicity of the incident and a consequent fraying of the school's reputation could have been averted had the school authorities taken action immediately after the student in question and her schoolmates had filed a complaint with the head of the institution's bashundhara branch. view the page sports

cricket's minimalist
glenn mcgrath's first two years in test cricket were not much to write home about, averaging as he did in the 40s with the ball. it would have been far-fetched in the extreme to think that he would one day rival the one and only dennis lillee for the title of australia's all-time greatest fast bowler.

dhaka university turns 90

fight domestic violence
domestic violence is a matter of grave concern that needs to be handled with strict law. every day we are alarmed to hear the gruesome deeds of torture and physical abuse by the husbands on their wives. the recent story is that of rumana. the assaulters remain frivolous about their inhuman behaviour just to satiate their perverse frustrations on thousands of unaccountable reasons or simply to show that they are in control. most importantly, they feel some form of satisfaction that they can get away with anything as the law enforcers can never touch them. it is indeed extremely shameful for the government and for us as well that we let these criminals go unpunished.
palestine scene
following the intense pressure from the united states and israel, greece has announced that they will prevent the sailing of freedom flotilla ii. to date israel has breached more than 69 resolutions of un. it has more than 20,000 political prisoners, has killed more innocent civilians than any other country, has rendered more civilians handicapped. on top of that, it has continued building the apartheid wall, destroyed 350 mosques and churches and has got 468,831 new settlers on an occupied land. do our media substantially accentuate all this info enough? it's time we woke up and raised our voices for palestine.

landslides in chittagong metropolis
the landslide in batali hill early in the morning on 1st july killed 17 people who could not arrange shelters in other places except for the bottom of the hill. last year we also observed such mass killing by landslides in chittagong. it is a common phenomenon in the hills but we have not done anything so far. the hills of bangladesh are composed of soft earth, so when it rains for several hours landslide occurs. a tv channel has reported on 2nd july that at the bottom of 15 hills in chittagong metropolis thousands of poor people are living with high risk of devastating landslides. bangladesh is basically a country of plain land other than a part of chittagong division and some areas of sylhet division. but the weather, crop and culture are similar throughout the country. so, the government can consider erasing at least the 15 hills at chittagong metropolis on urgent basis to save the valuable lives of poor bangladeshis living at the bottom of those hills.
road rage
dhanmondi has become an area infested with educational institutions and private universities, which has not only created nuisance in the area, but also filled the hearts of the residents with terror as road rage has become a common phenomenon in the area. more and more youths are losing their lives as they indulge in this dangerous pastime. the police are at the receiving end for the failure in strict enforcement of laws to curb the menace. when you walk out of your home you will see the youths riding their bikes at least at 100- 120 km whizzing past you. you will also find some learners riding the bikes at highest speed. the police are tired of constantly devising new plans to deal with the issue as their every attempt to impart awareness among the bikers has fallen flat. road no 4/a is a real threat to pedestrians during evening.
shab-e-barat
laylatul bara'ah or shab-e-baraat is a very majestic night for the muslims. both the arabic word 'laylatul' and the persian word 'shab' mean night. and 'barat' means freedom, relief etc. the preceding night of the 15th day of the month shaban (a month of islamic lunar calendar) is known as laylatul bara'ah or shab-e-barat. the almighty allah accepts the prayers of this night. all sins are pardoned by him this night. the month shaban comes to us with the message of the arrival of the upcoming glorious month ramadan. the great prophet muhammad (pbuh) gave priority on the prayers of this night. the muslims offer the prayers of shab-e-barat to be free from all sins and be graced by the almighty. may allah give us the opportunity to lead a pleasant life on earth and in the hereafter!
caretaker govt. should remain
we can just sit back and watch the mayhem going on which has erupted from the political unrest centering the caretaker government issue. people were suffering from acute shortage of electricity, gas and water; spiralling prices of essentials and criminal activities. the government, instead of solving the existing problems, added another one, which is so unjust and objectionable that the country has been jolted by the impact. people have become stupefied by the government's decision to abolish the caretaker government system. why has the government done it, knowing very well the consequences of this wrong decision? the move is despicable; the government has disclosed how afraid it has become of losing the next general election. we urge the government to change its decision of scraping the caretaker government system and save the people from further distress.

punish the culprit
the recent behaviours of some teachers in our society are ruining the reputation of this noble profession. a couple of days back, another incident took place where a student of class x of viqarunnisa noon school and college was sexually assaulted by a teacher named porimol joydhor. we should take proper steps to stop this crime; otherwise it will spread like an epidemic in our society. i earnestly request the honourable pm and the home minister to look into the matter and instruct the law enforcing agencies to investigate the matter immediately and give the scoundrel capital punishment. view the page op-ed
blocking black money

tact, the missed link in politics

enough is enough
here's an unsolvable quandary -- why do most politicians view the world through the eyes of others when in power, but begin to see with their own wonderful eyes as soon as they are driven out of it?
