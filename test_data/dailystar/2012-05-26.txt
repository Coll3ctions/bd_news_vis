tales of a protean soul. . .
when azizur rahman mallick took charge as bangladesh's first high commissioner to india soon after the war of liberation in 1971, the move was correctly seen as an endeavour by the government of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman to project the new country in a properly intellectual light before the world. mallick did not have a diplomatic background, in that professional sense. but, as so often happens in history when nondiplomats are sent to speak abroad for their countries, mallick proved the truism once again that scholars are almost always symbolic of their national heritage and history in the capitals they are sent to. and do not forget that mallick served as bangladesh's top diplomat at a time when it was necessary to let indians, and others, know that a nation put to the torch by the pakistan army through a nine-month war was finally ready, politically as well as intellectually, to claim its place in the global league. mallick remained in touch with the indian leadership, notably president v.v. giri, prime minister indira gandhi and everyone who mattered in delhi's policy-making. added to that was the confidence bangabandhu had placed in him where speaking up for bangladesh before the diverse sections of indian society was concerned.
