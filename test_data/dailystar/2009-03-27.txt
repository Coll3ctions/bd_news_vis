deaths of bdr men in custody
nine detained bdr men have died in inexplicable circumstances since march 9. of course, the bdr, under its new management, has given it out that the men died of heart attacks or have committed suicide. at a time when intense investigations are going on to unearth the conspiracy behind the carnage that left 55 army officers dead at pilkhana in february, it is worrying that reports have kept coming in of bdr men in detention dying. we are dismayed by such happenings; and we would like to make it clear that explaining these deaths away being a result of cardiac arrests or suicide is becoming untenable. all of us remember the frequency with which people died in 'crossfires' during the period of the bnp-led alliance government. those reports of 'crossfires' did not hold water. in much the same manner, the nine bdr deaths are beginning to raise some uncomfortable questions.
revving up the administration
the prime minister has dreams and vision for a prosperous bangladesh. she is also under pressure of a massive popular mandate to deliver goods to people in terms of stable law and order, good governance and catering to basic needs of the majority who are poor. little wonder, therefore, that rather early in the day, a couple of weeks ago, she had addressed a letter to the secretaries exhorting them to quicken their pace of work in implementing the directives of the government, so that people can receive the intended services sooner rather than later.

calibration of a celebration
yesterday, this nation turned thirty-eight years old, a time of life when an individual stands at the threshold of middle age. but a nation is expected to live hundreds of years, and thirty-eight for it is still formative days. it doesn't have to worry about dwindling eyesight, hurting knees, fluctuating blood pressure, not even receding hairline or diabetes. a nation is still young and fresh, hope and freedom roaring in veins.
patriotism in divided bangladesh
the tragedy at pilkhana was no mutiny; it was premeditated mass murder. we could have called it a mutiny if the bdr jawans had held the army officers captive until their demands were met, but by the time the negotiations had started all the army officers had already been executed. the intention was to destabilise the country, and these cold- blooded murderers had no intention of ventilating their grievances and returning to their barracks. view the page sports

crafty game?
thanks to our dhaka stock exchange new president for his powerful strides to bail out our capital market from the vicious cycle around z category shares wrought about by some crafty wrong doers. z category shares transaction in percentage of our total turnover may not be that high. but the damage caused by it goes much deeper down the spine of our capital market system. it has produced such satire in our capital market that sounds as it were: invest in bad shares and be rewarded. invest in good shares and be punished. this hints at decaying of intrinsic value in our capital market system.
tourism potential
no doubt bangladesh has immense potential in tourism. but still it is not developed due to the lack of interest and proper policy of the government. the recent announcement on establishing a national tourism board is a ray of hope for the development of tourism industry in bangladesh. but it is not enough, because tourism industry is an amalgam of other industries like transportation, accommodation, international technology etc.
chemical pesticides
in order to protect the vegetables from pests, chemical pesticides are used. but the producers as well as consumers are not aware of the ill effects of the pesticides. nowadays, we observe some efforts by the law enforcers to ensure formalin-free fish and stop adulteration of restaurants foods. but they overlook the pesticides used while growing vegetables and other agricultural products.
national security
national security is matter of topmost priority. that bdr headquarters and other military establishments exist without adequate video surveillance and digital identification is just unthinkable to me. even before bangladesh goes digital, our armed forces need to do so immediately. it is sad to read how the investigators have to rely on amateur cell phone videos to look for suspects. many rosters had been burnt which make it impossible to determine the whereabouts of the personnel. this could easily have been avoided if each personnel were assigned a digital identification card. this would make their whereabouts easier to find and also the information could not be burnt as it would immediately (at the speed of light to be precise) make its way to a central digital information storage hub (say a facility in the cantonment).
misguided elements
the fundamental principle of all religions is to try to be a good human being, though there are different ways to achieve the goal. our prophet hazrat muhammad (pbuh) is the truest human being the world has ever seen. but some people, who claim to be the followers of islam, engage in activities that violate the basic tenets of the religion.

quality of local products

pak tour cancelled
i would very much welcome the cancellation of pakistan cricket team's tour of bangladesh. i think this is a very good decision by the government. there is no denying that terrorists have got no sympathy even for sportsmen who are considered goodwill ambassadors of their country. the recent attack by the terrorists on the sri lankan cricket team in pakistan is an example that even the sportsman are not sparred by them. thank god, the sri lankan team members narrowly escaped.
rohingyas
the rulers of myanmar are oppressing the rohingya muslims. though they are the legal citizens of myanmar, but their social and political rights have never been recognised. they can't perform their religious duties, they can't marry without the permission of the govt. they can't move from one town to another without permission. the dictators are trying their best to finish the rohingya muslims. the rohingyas are now foreigners in their own country. there were 3.5 million rohingyas, and 1.5 million have escaped from myanmar and they are passing through great uncertainty.
paramita's patriotism
recently, paramita's story in ds drew my attention. i was astonished to see her patriotism and love for the mother tongue. i can visualise my own childhood in the eyes of this little girl. she spent her money which she got as prize for poetry recitation, for building a shaheed minar. she did this spontaneously to show her love for the martyrs of the language movement. it was a spontaneous expression of her love for her mother tongue too. nowadays what our countrymen lack is patriotism. but when i read the story of a school girl's love for the country and our mother tongue, i got back my lost faith.

acca students
the acca students, particularly in chittagong, are facing many problems. since the course is not so established and familiar in the context of bangladesh, students cannot determine what is happening during taking tuition. the main problem is created by tuition providers, especially the new ones. they lack experienced and skilled personnel in administration. in fact, their management is too weak to run such a professional course. furthermore, it is widely complained that, they take the acca fees from the students but do not pay to the acca in time.
bonus bonanza!
aig and the other failing banks in the usa have set new and absurd standards for executive privileges. they give guaranteed bonuses; while the organisation reels under astounding losses! funnily, individual amounts of this bonus are more than the gross income of many us taxpayers! indeed the usa is the land of milk and honey! these fat salaried executives get the honey of bonuses in these hard days of economic downturn, regardless of losses suffered, conveniently milked from poor taxpayers! this is the refined way of robbing the bank without guns and masks!
rickshaws, again
i am really sympathetic towards md. lutfar rahman (letter to ds on march 20, 2009), as i too am feeling the pain and suffering each and every day caused by the careless behaviour of the rickshaw-pullers on dhaka streets.
co-ordination in human body
in the human body, all the systems simultaneously work in a co-ordinated way and in full harmony for a definite purpose, namely, to keep the body alive. even the smallest movements we do everyday, such as breathing or smiling, are outcomes of perfect co-ordination in the human body.
performance of ministers
i am very sceptical about the selection of the al cabinet. most of them do not have any technical knowledge or experience in their respective fields. it takes knowledge, vision and administrative skill to run a ministry. as a supporter of the al, i wish the situation will be rectified very soon, before further damage is done to the economy. view the page international
