hc quashes case against hasina
the high court has delivered what we, and the general public, would consider an obvious judgment. frankly, there couldn't have been any other. the verdict on the extortion case against awami league chief sheikh hasina, quashing the case, must be welcomed as it upholds the due process of law and rejects any emergency measure. the court has indeed upheld a simple legal point that no law covers any offence committed before its enactment. what we really find baffling and difficult to understand is why the government failed to foresee the situation that has arisen now. the government's legal advisers should have been able to comprehend that the case would be untenable.
