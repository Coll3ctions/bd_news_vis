choosing dependable energy source

the breeze that touched the poets
khondakar ashraf hossain made waves with teen romoni'r qasida , his seminal poetical work, quite some years back. and since then he has gone on to write not only substantive poetry but also purposeful literary criticism, especially on the various facets of bengali literature. his pre-eminent position as a poet and critic has again gone with his academic pursuits as a senior teacher in the english department of dhaka university. it is thus that he has carved a significant niche for himself as a scholar, proof of which comes through this rather riveting study of the degree to which bangladeshi poetry has been influenced by the incoming breezes and winds which once shaped literary sensibilities in the west.
rediscovering the richness of heritage
bangladesh's little magazines have a long and rich history behind them. many literary magazines, though not always considered little and not truly little in the real sense, are the inheritors of a precious heritage. magazines and journals such as saugat, samakal, konthaswar, purbamegh of the pre-liberation era were followed by similar worthy ones called sundaram, odhuna, dipangkar, sahityapotro, samprotik, mizanur rahmaner troimashik potrika, mati, ekobingsho, boier desh and others in the post-liberation period. some of them have continued publication till date and among these worthy few ushaloke could be sighted as a good example.
