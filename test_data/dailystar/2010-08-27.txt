the poor getting excluded from medicare
exorbitantly high service charges in the private hospitals, especially at their intensive care units (icu), have become a virtually insurmountable hurdle for patients from low and middle-income groups to get treatment there. the public hospitals, on the other hand, are almost inaccessible for such patients because too many patients are waiting in queues for too few icus. the result is that less privileged people have to either go without treatment or sell all their properties if they are to have treatment from a private hospital. view the page sports

an unresolved issue
i hope mr. tony blair and his wife enjoyed their brief stay in bangladesh (20-21 august '10). i would like to take this opportunity to remind mr. blair of his letter to me dated 06 june 2006, in response to my article styled “ 100-dollar laptop: un secretary general's office shouldn't be used for exploiting the poor”. let me quote an extremely pertinent portion of a sentence from my article regarding my invention 'radio without battery', which states “my invention was hijacked first by a british and then by an american”. while in office as pm, mr. blair found my article interesting and he referred it to the commonwealth and his foreign office. but till today, i haven't received any response from any corner. my article was published in almost all the national dailies in the country in addition to 6094 websites including wikipedia. some foreign enthusiastic people brought out cds on the article too. publication in the wikipedia was done on the initiative of a native american. actually, most of the people who wrote to me on the article, were quite sympathetic towards me on my invention being hijacked. my suggestion with due explanation to limit the expense of an international patent to a minimum, for the third world country inventors in addressing what i called “rich people's property(whim) effectively, instead of intellectual property”, was hailed as the greatest invention. earlier, on the initiative of our present pm's office (previous term), our high commissioner in uk wrote to the alleged inventor, but i am not aware of any response.
btv
honestly, in the last few years did any of you watch bangladesh television for a minute even? the obvious answer is a big no. there's no denying the fact that with time, many private television channels sprang up and viewing the so called national television channel turned to a part of an old fairy tale. when only btv aired shows and all, people of bangladesh jumped onto it and it changed the entertainment world's geography, but if we take it as it is today, watching this channel is now part of history.

nazrul: the ever-shining beacon
it is difficult to imagine a time when kazi nazrul islam could have been locked away in a world of anonymity. yet it is true that when he became involved in the anti-british movement, our national poet who had given his heart and soul to a nation, came very close to such a situation.
retrieving national treasure from trash
“nazrul was the music director of the film adaptation of tagore's 'gora'. visva bharati, however, objected to the release of the film; the charge was that music arrangement of one of the rabindra sangeet used in the film was improper. the film's release got stalled and producer of the film begged nazrul to intervene. nazrul went straight to visva bharati, met tagore and presented the predicament. tagore apparently was surprised by the allegation that nazrul did 'injustice' to his song and right away gave written consent, which enabled the film's release. the producers wanted nazrul to include one of his original compositions and the poet-music composer wrote the song, 'usha elo chupichupi'. one of nazrul's students, bhaktimoy dasgupta recorded the song and a scene was created in the movie for the number…”
life and times of a rebel
kazi nazrul islam was born on may 25, 1898 at churulia in the district of burdwan, west bengal, undivided india. nazrul said, “even though i was born in this country (bengal), in this society, i don't belong to just this country, or society. i belong to the world.” he was by nature and conviction a people's poet. he excelled both as a writer and musician, a rare genius who cannot be matched, except of course, rabindranath tagore.
special tv programmes on nazrul death anniversary
to mark the 34th death anniversary of kazi nazrul islam, different tv channels will air special programmes today. highlights of some programmes:

knowledge-based society
learning from cradle to grave" is an age-old maxim. human beings continue to learn throughout their lives from surrounding environments and experiences, and acquire necessary knowledge and life-skills for survival through informal and non-formal education. so, the concept of lifelong education is not a new discovery. but the conceptual framework of lifelong education/learning has undergone a tremendous change since 1970s.
