we are sorry that the opposition bnp has decided to remain absent from the parliament in the current session. it is all but clear to us that the reason it had joined, and that too very briefly, the last session of the parliament, was possibly only to prevent their seats being declared vacant. we feel that the party's position is not only irrational, it is impolitic and dysfunctional for democracy, for itself and for the state, and above all, it is a letdown of its supporters who are being kept unrepresented in the parliament for a long time.
when the ground caves in

hike in bus fare and its fallout
raise in bus fares in the government-run transport service, the bangladesh road transport corporation (brtc), within the span of a week of increasing the price of compressed natural gas by the bangladesh energy regulatory commission (berc) has enraged the regular commuters in the city. unsurprisingly, altercations while charging fares by transport staff from bus passengers often lead to fisticuffs between them. such scene has become common on the different city bus service routes since may 19, the day the officially announced fair hike took effect.

get your piece of pie, mr. investor
hello, mr. investor! yes, i am talking to you. right now you might be in front of the dse or sec protesting against the very recent price decline in the stock market. does it really make sense? should government do anything against short-term price decline? why are you really wasting your time? don't spend your time in front of dse; it wouldn't make much difference in share prices. spend the same time to do some research about the market.
