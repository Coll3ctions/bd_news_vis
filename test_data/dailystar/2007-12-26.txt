from hindu kingdom to secular republic
nepal's monarchy is finally set to make an exit. the decision by the country's major political parties to do away with it, in line with the long-standing demand of the people, most vigorously articulated by maoists, is a development that cannot but satisfy the nepalese population and people of the saarc region as a whole. that sense of satisfaction of course has to do with some recent actions of king gyanendra himself. since taking charge of the throne following the murder of his brother, king birendra and his family, in 2001, gyanendra has not exactly endeared himself to the people of nepal. but it was his seizure of absolute power, through which he sought to impose grave restrictions on politics, that proved to be the last straw. in the end, popular discontent made the monarch eat humble pie.

civil society in bangladesh: rhetoric and reality
in the wake of ershad's fall there was growing clamour for civil society, which gradually became louder in those days. perhaps the bitter memory of protracted military rule, with its concomitant curtailment of basic rights, provided an incentive to civil society messiahs to articulate their demand. yet, expressions like "civil norm" in our administration, "more civility" in the governance, and a vow for the firm founding of a "civil society" as voiced in some of the civil-military discourses rang an optimistic note for the nation's progress. view the page sports

us and middle east
it is very interesting to note that president bush, all of a sudden, has started walking anti-clockwise. a hawk who never knew anything besides war and war of words suddenly turns into a peace-broker! this move, however, raises some doubts among the critics. is this a groundwork for initiating another war in the middle east? is this the preparation of israel and the us for the so-called pre-emptive aerial attack on iran's nuclear sites? the fear remains high. it would be interesting to examine the following issues.
cng filling stations
while the government policy is to maximise the use of cng for motorised transports like buses, trucks, taxis, auto-rickshaws and private cars, the numbers of cng filling stations are few and far between. long queues in filling stations for cng is a major factor discouraging people from cng conversion of their vehicles!
let the poor smile
every eid brings two types of feelings. the people who are well to do enjoy eid in a truly festive mood. preparation for the eid goes on for a long time. on the other hand a gloomy, dismal situation is seen in the huts of the poor who pass their days throughout the year half fed/unfed. this situation made one of the philanthropists (a retired chairman of a sector corporation) of our village to do something for the poor that would make them enjoy eid with rich foods like others in the village and thus making them feel that eid comes to their doors also. with that idea in mind, the above-mentioned benevolent man came in to help the poor of our village, balia, hajigonj, on eid day. the first step was collecting the numbers and names of the poor families of the village and then making packets containing shemai, sugar, milk, fine rice, mugdal, oil and in separate packets saree & lungi. these packets were distributed among the people listed earlier. holding the packets they went home smiling.

an appeal to chief adviser
it is proved that your government is doing a tremendous jobs to uproot corruption, but i would request you to pay a bit more attention to a case named “extortion by unknown phone callers” which hasn't been stopped yet. lots of people like me, who live abroad, are always worried about their families back home, because our families are threatened by the extortionists every day. they know that we are able to give them what they want. but why should we give them the money which we have earned by selling our blood? the question arises, is there anyone to stop them? yes, the government can do that. but we are unfortunate enough till today as nothing has been done to rein in those hoodlums.
arms haul case
the news of the haul of 10 truckloads of sophisticated firearms in chittagong on 2nd april 2004 is still fresh in my mind. this incident had been the talk of the country for many days, i remember. undoubtedly, this was the biggest arms haul in the history of our country.
why this fear?
i was spending the summer of 1979 with my sister in massachusetts for a break from my college. my brother-in-law suggested that we go to new york museum to watch something special. at first i wasn't very enthusiastic. boy! was i for a treat?

us assistance
last week in your op-ed, ms. geeta pasi wrote with the above heading on the commitment of the usa and its people to standing by the people of bangladesh all the time. it surely is appreciated with the immediate reaction of the usa to send the marines to assist our hurricane-affected people. the immediate need of those people is always fresh water and we had seen that after the 1991 natural disaster the us marines undertook 'operation sea angel', doing an excellent job delivering purified water, foods and medicines. at that time the marines did a great job and were highly appreciated although when they first arrived there was a lot of hesitation and suspicion as it is now. i personally feel they should be welcomed (as i did back in 1991) and appreciated for their humanitarian duty but of course it should be all very transparent.

community radio
a campaign has been going on in the country for the past several years to introduce a new type of broadcasting media, which is widely known as community radio, but it has so far met with cold shoulders from policy level people for no justified reason, except only for fear of loosening their grips over local matters and their monstrous power undercut. but it has been proved that there is a lot of central level inadequacy to cope with local matters such as education, natural disaster, cultural life and many other issues. the need for people to share their views and concerns through a local media and policy makers listening to their voices is becoming a crying need. view the page international

thoughts on the past 36 years
as we enter the 37th year of our independence, my mind races back to memories both bitter and sweet. i lost a brother, shaheed munier chowdhury, one of the most illustrious sons of the soil, only 48 hours before we gained our independence. although i feel occasionally bitter and sad, i must say i am no longer haunted by it. after all, 36 years have passed by and i have seen bigger tragedies taking place on this very independent soil. human rights and justice continue to be accessible to a selected few, and as elusive as ever before to most. economists are busy producing lofty statistics, whereas the poor continue to struggle for mere survival.
