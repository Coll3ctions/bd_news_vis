that waterfall sound in her voice . . .
there has always been a flowing stream imagery about ferdausi rahman's songs. that slight tremor in the voice, coming with that particular sense of femininity, has been a defining point about the professionalism she has consistently brought to singing. and do not forget that music has been a strong underlying theme with her family. the trendsetter was of course her father; and then there has been her sibling. in our times, a niece too has made waves in this particular genre. in a very large sense, therefore, ferdausi belongs to that select band of music makers whose roots lie as much in their individuality as in their being part of clans made illustrious by their contributions to the shaping of melody and its various nuances.
reflections of a sage
swimming against the current requires skill and strength, but one requires still greater skill, clarity of ideas, deep insight, analytical ability and courage of conviction to wade against conventional thoughts, especially on complex economic phenomena. a k n ahmed, who is gifted with those sterling qualities in ample measure, stands out conspicuously from his peers when it comes to expressing his thoughts candidly. his frank opinions often earned inevitable wrath of his detractors in the past after the traumatic events of 1975; they wasted no time in seeing him off from his favourite milieu of banking and finance in bangladesh.
