volvo service to uttara
to ease the haphazard traffic movement in this mega city, the govt. has taken a number of steps, including removal of age-old unfit commercial vehicles from the city roads and introduction of newer vehicles on some routes. but unfortunately for reasons best known to authorities, the brtc volvo double decked bus service has stopped operating on the uttara route for the last one year. students, women, children and office goers, who availed themselves of this service are now facing serious trouble. older people and patients, who like to go to birdem, bsmmu, dmc etc. for treatment find no other alternative but to board a local bus which stops here and there to collect passengers and takes much time to reach the destination. moreover, these buses take passengers beyond their capacity and one has to fight to get a seat.
food-borne diseases
food-borne diseases are an ever-growing concern across the globe and it has been reported that in 2005 alone, 1.8 million people succumbed to death due to the diarrhoeal diseases mainly attributed to food and drinking water contamination. it's obvious that the poor and developing countries like ours top the list of most vulnerable countries due to many reasons like illiteracy, poverty, unscrupulousness of food manufacturers and sellers and lack of proper surveillance on the government's part etc. from the picture of the last few years it is as clear as the daylight that how horrible, grim and grisly is our condition in this regard. deadly formalin in fish, milk and milk products, urea with rice, poisonous pesticides, chemicals and other preservatives with fruits and vegetables, artificial ripening and colouring of fruits, algae in so called pure beverage bottles, industrial dye and tar in sweetmeat, arsenic in water and even, recently, in paddyin fact, the list is so long that a whole book could be written on it. as a result of food and drinks adulteration and contamination the health of the people is breaking down giving rise to fatal diseases on a regular basis. millions of taka is being spent behind treatment and the government is already gasping for air while coping with the ever-growing cost of health care.

airport at trishal
while i am writing, the govt. has already declared rangpur as a new division and obviously, this is another mind-breaking news for the people of mymensingh who are demanding mymensingh to be declared a division for the last around 30 years. but the govt's a recent decision to conduct the feasibility study, though some reports claimed it a decision, of establishing a new international airport at trishal has made the people of this area at least a little bit hopeful. this is a logical decision as we see the neighbouring countries especially india, malaysia, thailand and south korea establishing their national airports at least 50-80km away from the capitals. besides, through several unwanted developments dhaka is now going to be dead city and govt. is desperate to expand its metropolitan area.

residents of dhanmondi
those of you who frequent around dhanmondi, during rush hours i.e. in the morning, afternoon and in the evening must have experienced unpleasant traffic situation on both sides of the bridge connecting the eastern part with the western part. as i have been experiencing this unpleasant situation on a regular basis, i kept wondering what is the cause of this unbearable traffic jam. in my observation, it is the dearth of bridge connection between the two parts of dhanmondi. a few more bridges across the lake could have mitigated the problem to a great extent. it is though true that both mirpur road and shatmashjid road experience similar situation during such rush hours, even then i am inclined to believe that constructing a few more bridges across the lake shall greatly benefit the commuters.

death on road
reference to the death of four female university students in a quraiyat (saudi arabia) bus crash. it is really an unfortunate and sad event. the motor transportation is one of the major means of transport in saudi arabia, hence the incidence of deaths on the roads is much higher. some roads are badly planned and are one of the causes of accidents. many drivers are low paid and do multiple jobs. steps need to be taken to make sure that such roads are rectified or closed to avoid innocent people being killed or maimed. the drivers should also be properly monitored.
