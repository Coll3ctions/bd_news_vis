7th march, the moment nation rose up as one
7th march evokes the memory of the thunderous declaration- this struggle is for our freedom, this struggle is for our independence--by our himalaya, sheikh mujibur rahman. he led the great procession of the freedom-loving people in their struggle for freedom from the oppressive pakistani regime. the few who cowered before the pakistani junta instead of siding with the cause of truth and justice were the scum of the earth. once again, we need one like bangabandhu at a time when our enemies from home and abroad are humiliatingly our flag, earned at the price of an ocean of blood. how long will we live in poverty, fear and corruption? does not that thunderous voice of freedom and justice of our father of the bangladeshi nation ring in our minds? where is everybody? wake up again!!
help out small stock market investors
since the start of stock market disaster, more than a year ago finance minister, bb governor, sec chief and other experts of stock market regularly gave advice to investors so as to judge the fundamentals of the public limited companies (pcl) before investing their money. security and exchange commission (sec) and bangladesh bank (bb) are the authorities to allow raising of capital by plc through initial public offering (ipo). naturally they are the experts who analyse through various options and sensitivity analysis before giving permission. thus small investors like me do not bother to verify fundamentals as often uttered. what is more, i am not capable of doing so and i invest blindly in primary shares and debentures.

ustc area becomes battlefield
ustc stands for university of science and technology chittagong. this is one of the oldest private universities in bangladesh and the university is rich in medical science. from the name of the university, we understand, the students come here to learn science, technology and their applications in social life. for example, the medical students gain theoretical as well as practical knowledge in their respective fields. they learn how to diagnose patients' disease using modern technology. obviously, the students of other departments are supposed to know which technology is used for what purposes. nowadays life has become largely dependent on technology particularly for the new generation. they need to adapt themselves accordingly in all respects.
make violation of traffic rules punishable offence
a few days ago we witnessed a tragic accident that occurred in the early morning at the crossing between bijoy sarani and sangsad bhaban (northern side) roads. the reason is the traffic signal was not being followed by the careless drivers of a private vehicle and a bus. one person died on the spot and two persons were seriously injured. this is a common scene which often turns tragic in dhaka city. the accident would not happen if they followed the t rules and obeyed traffic signals.
avoid destructive politics
political crisis is an acute problem in our country. all the political parties are becoming crazy and cruel. bnp is all set on its move to "dhaka cholo" programme on 12th march. on the other hand, awami league has called for a "moha somabesh" on 11th march. and jamaat -shibir party too is not far behind other political parties in confrontational activities. we have been habituated to seeing that political party's movement or procession results in vandalising of vehicles, loss of lives and so on. we have nothing to say but to witness those.
