don't the domestic workers deserve a status?

an emerging paradigm for biodiversity conservation
a land area of more than 0.5 ha, with a canopy cover of more than 10 percent and trees able to reach a minimum height of 2-5 metres at maturity in situ can be called a forest. it includes areas with rattans, bamboos and palms provided that height and canopy cover criteria are met. forest also includes forest roads, firebreaks, meadows, other small open areas, windbreaks, shelterbelts, corridors of trees, national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas which have specific scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest. according to lindemayer & franklin (2002), matrix comprises landscape areas that are not designated primarily for conservation of natural ecosystems, ecological processes, and biodiversity regardless of their current condition (natural or developed).

pillow talk . . .
it was 4:30 in the morning, and david cracked open an eye to get a feel of the surroundings and get his bearing. he turned left to check if mindy was awake or had gone off to work which was when he realized that he had a slight headache, probably from the sleep deprivation, but he also could not rule out the possibility of being overwhelmed from all the thoughts swirling around in his head. mindy, who was lying next to him and was fast asleep until then, felt some movement on the other side of the bed and now slipped into a mode between sleep and awake. in this semiconscious state, she realized that the source of the rustle was david's habitual restlessness as he emerges from sleep, and she made a soft nondescript purr to acknowledge that they were both awake and wanted to know if david was planning to sleep some more.
who is afraid of taslima nasrin?
taslima nasrin, the bangladeshi-born writer, has become a legend in her own lifetime. she is hailed outside of bangladesh as the most important writer in bangladesh not only by laymen, but also by connoisseurs of literature. all over india, europe and america, she is recognized as a literary icon. if you travel to calcutta, delhi, bombay or london, new york, paris or hamburg, you cannot help being asked about this fallen literary goddess. while traveling by train in india, i heard with my own ears some fellow passengers fulminating against the ban on one of her books in bangladesh. as a bangladeshi, i was pelted with question after question as to why the nasrin was not being allowed to get back to her motherland. the questioners, however, belonged to a particular religion different from that of the writer. they seem to nourish a very lofty idea about taslima nasrin as an incarnation of truth. nasrin has become a living myth after the recurrent proscriptions of her books and her move into self-exile.

the quest for an afghan settlement
thucydides, the historian of ancient greece, believed that peace is only a short-lived armistice in a natural state of perpetual war and this has been the doleful experience of afghanistan. the country has bled and continues to bleed from the wounds inflicted on it by external aggression, internal conflict and ethnic strife. ever since ahmad shah abdali founded the kingdom of afghanistan in 1747, its people have been the victims of relentless violence. after abdali's death in 1773, his kingdom crumbled and spurred rivalry between imperial britain and russia which played itself out as the “great game” of the nineteenth century. the last three decades have been particularly violent and afghanistan became the only country in the world to be invaded and occupied twice by superpowers.

a freedom fighter's testament

thoughts of death and plans for life
a primordial song of life is sung by the author, bruce feiler, throughout the book, effecting a visual diary that tells us about his physical vis-a-vis mental condition in a most agonizing state. and he sings not only for himself but for humanity as a whole to live a life in perpetuity even when physically the person is no more. life is so endearing that the author would not let go of himself from his near and dear ones and therefore delves deeply into the matter of being re-created through his language and its expressions, his voice, beliefs and convictions, his ways of life in a comprehensive way, his society and on top of everything to be projected as the kind of man and father that he has been. thus he works in a most down-to-earth manner, bringing together a group of men, all dads, to concretize a project that he undertakes and in which he plays the role of a leader in all possible and not so possible ways. it is the story of the life of the author himself: after nearly four decades, bone cancer is detected in exactly the same part of his leg that had met with some bone injury from a bicycle accident on a high street at a rather young age. he is devastated. nevertheless, he does not bend. from amongst the group of his friends, acquaintances and a whole lot of other people, he forms a council of dads consisting of six males who will play his role to his twin young daughters after he passes away. a unique trait in his personality is thus manifest, something that is almost unbelievable for a reader. in other words, as he almost comes by his death warrant, he still embarks on a plan to do something novel and succeeds in fulfilling his objective. through personal contacts, regular correspondence and close interaction, a network of people who are reliable, warm-hearted and sensible enough to represent him before his little daughters from different phases of his life is formed. this gives the author much strength to fight his physical condition and also often through viewing a deadly disease like cancer as a strong motivation to work. consumed by the thought of what kind of world his daughters will face without him, feiler asks, "would they wonder who i was? would they wonder what i thought? would they yearn for my approval, my love, my voice?" all such futuristic thoughts shape his concern, so much so that finally he opens a website for helping distressed hearts in sharing and upholding the cause he is committed to. his personal agony thus turns into an altruistic vision and translates into a great job.
writing and reading letters
time was when we used to write letters. it was an era when people made contact with one another, and over long distances, through letters. something of the intensely personal came with those letters, something of communication between one heart and another. the beauty about letters was that the soul came with it. feelings embedded in the heart simply poured forth and once they all came to be encapsulated in letters, we felt something of a burden lifting from us.
