us' critique on our human rights situation
it is ironic that the us with its own stained human rights records should have seen it fit to admonish other countries on their performance in the sensitive area. this is not to preclude criticism where it is due in order to improve upon poor records but to point at a holier than thou attitude that is clearly not morally tenable.
dealing with swindler ngos
news coming in from natore about the vanishing acts resorted to by some ngos does little to cheer us, naturally. but what surely leaves everyone perplexed is the extent to which the district administration there has failed to take action against such ngos even after reports about their negative activities were circulated widely. it is a lax administration we are speaking of here, for the very simple reason that despite the detection of as many as 30 fraudulent ngos in the district, no punitive measures appear to have been taken against the people behind them. just how serious the problem is turning out to be is to be seen from the way in which a million people have been swindled out of an altogether taka 500 crore in eight north-western districts by these fake ngos.

du admission rules
i remember the elation i felt at the moment when i learned that i had passed the d-unit admission test of dhaka university and stood within the top ninety in the merit list. it was no small feat for a student with english medium background and one with no coaching. i was quiet sure i would get english, as i got more than twenty-four and twenty in compulsory and advanced english respectively; which were above the required minimum. but the interview burst my bubble in the worst possible way. not only was i frowned upon for being from english medium but i was also denied the subject on the sole ground that i did not have english in my a-levels, the fact that i had an a grade in english in o-levels didn't seem to prove my competence either. seriously, not even five percent of a-levels students take english, but that does not mean they don't want to study it. since it is not compulsory to have those particular subjects in a-levels that we want to take in undergraduate level then why this is different for english, which has been the medium of our studies? but while i was denied english, others who had it as a third or fourth choice were taking it up as their more favoured subjects were unavailable. so, they would rather take in reluctant people than eager and capable just because of rules that show little logic. this has happened not only with me but with quiet a few others.
dwindling tiger population

it has been reported that the government is contemplating introduction of 4000 new cng taxi cabs/auto rickshaws on dhaka city roads. i would congratulate the government for its efforts in mitigating the sufferings of commuters.
political scenario
the political cloud is disappearing, slowly but steadily. one can see some rationale behind the cec's firm attitude to hold the election on time or quit. he is opening up his mind with new hints and gestures. may be i am totally wrong, but i get the feeling that the election will be held as planned in a different scenario. major political parties or players might opt not to participate in the election because of the circumstances obtaining around two interned political leaders; or, there might be a split in the party with regard to participation in the election, and deflection of prominent members cannot be ruled out.
random thoughts
whenever someone in the government is asked about the election, you will automatically hear a standard answer that it is the responsibility of the election commission to arrange it. and if you put the same question to the gentlemen of the election commission, you are almost sure to hear that they are almost ready and it is the government which has to create the congenial atmosphere and facilitate holding of this grand event. the question is a normative one. and both the answers are correct, politically. but is something missing?
dhaka and architects
after going through the article of architect dr nizamuddin ahmed (the daily star 1/2/08), i was rather surprised to find that he knows all the problems and the probable solutions about our current repulsive architectural culture prevailing in society. but the influence on our architects in dhaka is negligible. it is the motivation factor, which is distorted [by market conditions].

amar or omor ekushey?
a report by bss-dhaka about celebration of ekushey in our missions abroad, published in a local daily on 22nd february, began as follows: "amar ekushey- the international mother language day......etc." i was somewhat confused, as i believe it should have been "omor ekushey" and not "amar ekushey"; as phonetically the meaning of the two words differ markedly. while "amar" in bangla means "ours", "omor" means "immortal". i believe we mean "immortal" and not "ours"; more so as the day is now recognised internationally.
pervez musharraf
