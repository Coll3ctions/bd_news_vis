govt handling of ec request indefensible
we are surprised, indeed shocked at the non-cooperative attitude of the authorities toward the election commission on the issue of a deployment of the army at the upcoming narayanganj city corporation election. it was citizens' expectation that the army would be in place to ensure a free and fair voting. more importantly, when the ec had written to the authorities that the soldiers would be required to ensure a smooth voting, it became the responsibility of the government to heed the request under the provisions of article 126 of the constitution, which clearly states that it is the duty of the executive authorities to assist the ec in the discharge of its functions. the government has failed to carry out that constitutional duty.
