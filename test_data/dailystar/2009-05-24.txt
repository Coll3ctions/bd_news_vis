indian election
the unexpectedly resounding victory of the congress party, in india's general election, has highlighted that people in india have rejected the rather communal bjp. this election has also seen the crumbling of the leftists in their very own citadel---west bengalas mamata's trinamul congress decimated them. now as experts have opined, a congress led government would be better for bangladesh in terms of solving some of the unresolved issues, issues of great importance, with india like water-sharing, maritime boundary, skirmishes between the bdr and the bsf, trade deficits etc.
death of a river
many civilizations grew up on riverbanks. our capital city dhaka was also born on the banks of buriganga some centuries ago. but this very river is now clinically and biologically dead. the notorious grabbers have been shrinking its width filling earth and then making houses and buildings. at the same time we have polluted its water to such a level that no fish or any other aqua creatures can live in it. now the buriganga is not only without fish, none can touch its water, let alone drinking it. chemical effluents of tanneries and other industries including dangerous dyeing materials, garbage etc have caused this condition of the once beautiful river. even two or three decades ago the distinguished guests from abroad used to go on river excursion on our famous pedal steamers (gazi, ostrich etc) from/to sadarghat. now people get sick taking the bad smell of water. and from this river the polluted water is spreading to other regions of our country. it is high time steps are taken to stop pollution of the river.

apology from pakistan
this refers to the article titled, "forget 1971 - says pakistan" published in your daily on 20th may. i must clarify that i am a pakistani individual presently living in dhaka and do not officially represent anyone in this letter. i may dare, however, claim that the thoughts expressed below will echo most favourably among the silent majority of pakistanis, especially the members of its fledgling civil society and particularly the people who are still being systematically disenfranchised, brutalised and tortured by the establishment there.
speaker in dilemma
i am talking about the speaker of the american congress, nancy pelosi. she appeared to be in the wrong corner while dealing with the issue of "torture" in custody in the usa. we will have to wait to see how the current debate develops in the political parties' ends and what actually she heard and when--- a centre point in the debate.
a land of tourism
as a tourism destination, bangladesh is truly hard to beat. bangladesh definitely offers a lot to see, enjoy and do. bangladesh means a 'country where bangla is spoken'. one of the most beautiful countries in south asia, bangladesh has tremendous tourism potential. its tropical beach resorts on the bay of bengal should be paradise for the sun vacationers.
jmb
rab arrested mizan and they busted a mini ammunition factory. he is a member of jmb and also a leader. with his arrest it is clear that still jmb is actively working in bangladesh. though the government declared a "zero tolerance" policy in this respect, we believe more steps are needed to blunt the force of such outfits.
education
there is a saying that a person is incomplete without education. this is probably true for the developed countries. but looking at bangladesh, i actually disagree with the above phrase.
status of industrial relations
as a human resource professional i have a cherished desire to see that one day the trade union leaders will play a significant role in each and every organization for its development through participatory practices and acquiring confidence. i'm engaged in industrials relation jobs for the last 20 years and was with the country's leading group of industries and some multinational companies but i have never found them in a good position and acceptable to the top management of the organization because of their unacceptable behaviour and attitude. whenever they form a union their attitude and behavioural pattern dramatically change. they become the tools of outsiders and unfortunately this is the way everywhere we are abusing our industrial relations.
corruption charges
the nation is shocked and amazed at the corruption charges brought against the former speaker, deputy speaker and the chief whip all belonging to a particular political party. no wonder instead of being ashamed, they preferred to deny the charges, as was done by their party leaders and bosses earlier against alleged local and international corruption committed by them, their family members, lawmakers, ministers etcetera. corruption charges against the guardians of the highest institution of the lawmakers of the country are unprecedented. only recently some members of british parliament lost their membership on charge of being involved in “expense scandal”. in a superb expression of moral responsibility, the speaker of the house of commons resigned over the scandal. in our country such action by our politicians is unthinkable. they would always try to get away with any kind of crime, and morality is a word not available in their dictionary. we noticed with utter dismay that persons charged with corruption during the caretaker government are now moving freely and the charges against them are either withdrawn or quashed. if that is the norm in this country only heaven knows whether this country would ever get rid of corrupt people who amass wealth at the cost of the teeming millions.
a suggestion
the majority people in bangladesh are poor. most of them, along with the middle class and rich voters, cast their votes in favour of the awami league. that is why the party got such a landslide victory in the last election. voters voted for fulfilment of their demands. the awami league has to take measures to create job opportunities and eradicate poverty.
private universities
recently, our honourable prime minister expressed her profound concern regarding the 'quality of education' of private universities of bangladesh.
unique, indeed
we the bangladeshis are unique people. we are different! our country was once known as a country of natural calamities like tornados, floods, famines etc. recently we earned the title of the "most corrupt nation" in the world. bangladesh becomes a news spot in the world media very often.
