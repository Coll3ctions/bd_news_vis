weekly currency roundup
feb 6-10, 2011
international markets:
the dollar rose broadly on thursday, boosted by better-than-expected u.s. employment data, while the euro slumped as investors worried about europe's lack of progress in tackling a sovereign debt crisis. sterling fell against the dollar after the bank of england left interest rates at a record low despite chatter about a possible hike, and traders said a recent spike in u.s. yields set the dollar up for further near-term gains. u.s. growth picked up in late 2010 and expectations of even brisker expansion this year have driven up bond yields to about nine-month highs, though the u.s. federal reserve has failed to signal plans to cut short a $600 billion bond-buying program. adding to the optimism, u.s. claims for first-time jobless benefits fell in the latest week far below forecasts, data showed. the euro, which hit a 12-week high above $1.38 earlier this month, struggled as investors drove portuguese bond yields to their highest level since the currency was introduced in 1999. portugal is considered at risk of becoming the next euro zone country to need a bailout, and investors are anxious about a lack of progress by policymakers in addressing a euro zone debt crisis. european leaders are to meet next month to discuss bolstering a 440-billion euro bailout fund for troubled countries view the page metropolitan

a gorgeous wc opening!
i congratulate the government for organising such a successful event. today bangladesh is no more 'a country beside india'. from the fireworks to the show casing bangladeshi culture and tradition- all was excellent. considering the fact that we have hosted something so huge for the first time, i would say everything went fine, but equally would like to highlight some defects, without which the event could have been more gorgeous. these are:
does our economy gain from stock market?
one of the most burning questions today is what's the use of the capital market and why the govt. should get involved to stabilise the market. why should we care about the prospect of the market, if it does not contribute to our economy? apparently, it seems that stock market does not keep any connection with the economy. but this market offers a great opportunity for the whole economy if we can grab it properly: firstly, the companies can arrange their long term capital for business expansion from market with a minimum cost. the banks are suitable only for short term and mid term financing. secondly, the companies listed in the stock market come under regulation of securities and exchange commission, which ensures the corporate governance of the companies. the financial statement of listed companies is quite informative and valuable than unlisted companies. thirdly, the most important factor is that stock market can attract investment. people reduce their consumption and invest here to earn better in future. fourthly, stock market can finance huge fund for large projects easily. finally, stock market is considered as the barometer of economy. an efficient stock market is the leading indicator of the economy.
student leaders and our future
there was a time when student leaders were the conscious-keepers of the people. it is they who gave us the right sense of direction at the time of crisis. their leadership during the language movement in 1952, the people's uprising in 1969 and the war of liberation in 1971 dazzles in our history in letters of gold. but after independence the quality of leadership at the student level as well as other levels has progressively degenerated resulting in campus violence, bloodshed and even death. it is because of the wrong steps of the majority of student leaders that acts like terrorism in the campus, unscheduled closure of institutions, session jam, copying in the examination have struck firm roots in the seats of learning.
save our children
nowadays students from kg-ii to a-level and also students of bengali medium schools have to study a lot of books. even children have to study from early morning till 11:00 pm which is putting tremendous psychological pressure on their mind. my son reads in class i and it is very difficult even for me to lift his school bag. there is almost no way but to hire private teachers for the children for good results. in this way education has become extremely expensive for children.
next time, bowl better!
what mohammad ali sattar wrote in your post editorial on february 22nd; is what we all probably think. shakib's views could well be that. after all; we are all wise after the event! i believe, shakib gambled, and lost! just imagine, what would have happened if sehwag would have been out in the first few overs? however, had sehwag gone; then tendulkar would not have been 'run-out'; and india could have reached say 280 runs!
being introvert is not a problem
there are two kinds of personalities in our society. one is extrovert and the other is introvert. introverts are reserved; they like to be with themselves. they don't mix with people much. the extroverts are just the opposite. in our society extroverts are much more than introverts in number. people who are extroverts think it is not normal to be an introvert. even parents want their children to be extroverts. they get upset if their children are introverts. they want them to mix with people, to be outgoing which is very difficult for an introvert. parents and elders pressurize their children to change their characteristics and be extroverts.
spectacular bangladesh!
after watching the opening ceremony of world cup cricket 2011 if anyone felt salty water on his/her cheek, what would we say? yes, we are proud to be bangladeshis. we have showed the whole world what we can do. the opening ceremony of cricket world cup-2011 was spectacular.
move while the green light's on
cricket teams, media personalities, international guests are in dhaka. i am concerned about our traffic problems. some vehicle owners, their drivers, passers-by and above all traffic police and sergeants are responsible for traffic congestion in dhaka city. i think only in bangladesh, vehicular traffic moves when the red light is on glows and stops with the green light, opposite to the system followed internationally. the main actor behind this is the traffic police who never keep the left track clear under their nose.
govt. must be cautious about share plunge
the share market of the country experienced extreme fall and rise in price index in the last week. it marked the lowest fall and the highest rise in price index in two consecutive days in the history of our market. finance minister, bangladesh bank governor, and sec all made frantic efforts to rein it. however, all went astray. investors, market analysts, all viewed the fluctuation as abnormal and traced some mischievous elements in it by some big syndicates. it is widely alleged that an alliance of 11 masterminds comprising both the government and opposition leaders and their associates realised around tk. 43,000 crore from the market this week.
no vulgar shows, please
only recently we witnessed a vulgar show performed by an indian film star which was widely criticised by the saner group of citizens in the country. we are dismayed at the fresh initiative to bring the indian actors and the russian dance troop for staging a similar show which goes against our cultural, traditional and religious norms and tend to destroy the morale of our youngsters.
politics of deception
the decision of building the proposed new international airport on the other side of the river padma was purely based on the feasibility study report prepared by international consultants. the donors will not lend a single dollar if the project does not seem feasible. many important factors were taken into consideration while suggesting the location of the proposed sheikh mujib international airport.

ten steps forward: studio 48 calls for attention
an artists' collective seems like an anomaly in this age of “individualism” which is a trope that promises independence to every living human in a modern society, but in reality, often effectuates an atomization of the individual leading to the weakening of his/her subjectivity. bangladesh is a country in transition; as such it is yet to mobilise its means to strive towards a “surveillance society” in line with western-style capital-driven state mechanism. for artists living in such peripheral topography the struggle is not about standing against state coercion but against the collective position vis-à-vis certain trends or training, through which the causes of the institutions are by design served. the very fact that galleries in dhaka have never done enough to nurture the emerging artists actually has a bearing on how artists organise themselves in this crowded city, and “studio 48, a group of visual artists”, is only a strategy in the struggle for emancipation from the mainstream impasse -- an alternative to the apathy shown to individual talent.
hollywood's big night

gaddafi's rats and cockroaches
there have been plenty of madmen taking over their countries and exercising pitch dark rule over them. you do not have to go back to ancient history or even early recorded history to know of these characters. in our own times we have experienced the likes of idi amin, the duvaliers and jean bedel bokassa. there was hitler, along with goebbels and an entire gang, to terrorise europe between the early 1930s and mid 1940s. and now we have muammar gaddafi of libya.
