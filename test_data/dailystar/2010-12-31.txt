military rule, never again
the high court verdict reached on august 26, with its full text released as on december 29 against the 7th amendment, is not only emphatic but also far-reaching in consequence as far as safeguarding democracy from usurping onslaughts of martial law and military regimes goes. the judgment is of seminal importance because it strikes at the root of the entrenched and frequent practice of usurpation of power by extra-constitutional forces from elected heads of state and government that this country's history is tainted with. in fact, the two military regimes as the honourable judges have forcefully contended had put the clock of democracy back by decades.

health care in slums: no strategy works
bangladesh has two health care delivery strategies-cum-systems because its urban and rural populations have different structures and different needs. but bangladesh has a third distinct population center: urban slums. to create a health care system in the slums that effectively delivers its services we must fix in our minds that it is an entire system that must be addressed, and it must be addressed holistically.
e-governance to make structural changes
bangladesh will celebrate its golden jubilee in 2021. the present government, in its election manifesto, declared that it would bring changes to make the country poverty free, healthy, socially sound, economically strong and technologically powerful by 2021. to attain this vision, bangladesh needs a strong administrative structure, with sound knowledge of modern technology and intricacies of development issues, supported by integrity and imbued with patriotism. view the page startech
