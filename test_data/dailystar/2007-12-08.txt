it for empowerment
the chief adviser to the caretaker government could not have been more explicit when he said while inaugurating the programme of mission 2011 that access to information technology (it) could empower the poor and rural population considerably. while the theme of the mission - “building a sustainable ict-based information and knowledge system for the poor and marginalised” is encouraging, the aim to set up 40,000 telecentres all over bangladesh by 2011, raising the number from present 800 only, is no doubt spirit-lifting. what remains to be seen is timely implementation of the mission objective.
probing institutionalised corruption
the campaign that the anti-corruption commission plans to undertake soon against institutional as well as institutionalised corruption is one the nation will certainly welcome, for obvious reasons. in these past many years, graft has eaten away at the vitals of society with the result that citizens have always found themselves at the receiving end of manifest injustice. indeed, corruption across many tiers, notably in the public sector bodies, has been synonymous with harassment of the general public. if now the acc can truly get into the business of ferreting out the corrupt elements in the utility services, one can be reasonably sure that a semblance of normality will come to life.
reducing water sector corruption
a joint publication undertaken by the stockholm international water institute, the water integrity network and the swedish water house has focused on a vital area of our daily life -- clean water. in this context conservative estimates have indicated that the lack of access to clean water causes the death of five million people worldwide every year. the study helps us to understand the magnitude of the problem by asking us to consider 34 jumbo jets, each carrying 400 passengers, crashing every day of they year. that adds up to about 12,500 planes annually. this is indeed a frightening scenario.
heady mix of religion and politics
gujarat and punjab are the two states in india, which are ill at ease most of the time. their problem is not economic but narrow thinking. most of the blame lies on the governments because they do not allow people to rise above their limited and personal agenda dinned constantly into their ears. the fallout is that the two states are often absorbed in non-issues and suffer the consequences of mixing religion with politics.
sidr aftermath: hold firm the helm of economy
the chief adviser of the caretaker government was very right when he extolled the people of southern districts of bangladesh as very brave being used to live with the unpredictable nature. the ultimate cost of such bravery, however, has been so very heavy as would blunt our imagination. surnamed 'sidr' the cyclone created havoc in the southern districts mostly razing every things on its way. trees were uprooted, crops in the field awaiting harvest were damaged beyond salvation. every homestead was ruthlessly battered. the death toll of human being was about 4000 till the last report came in. this didn't include innumerable missing. many fishermen who went out the day before to the sea to catch fish were yet to return home. perhaps they would never come back. the onslaught of the cyclone reaching a velocity of about 250 kilometer per hour with the sea waters rising 20-25 feet high ransacked the sundarbans. many deer and a number of other wild animals were washed out to the bay. a big part of the mangrove forest was rendered barren. view the page sports

it was during the cold war that some americans academics began to construct the category of “south asia studies”. subsequently, the influx of south asian students in western universities boosted the demand for courses in south asian culture as well as politics. a new generation of scholars then took over the term coined by the cold war intellectuals working with an “area studies” outlook in mind adopted earlier to give it a new currency dependent on the value that would be accruing to it because of the large number of south asians living and working in north america from the seventies onward. view the page strategic issues
gaza and aftermath of annapolis
it currently seems as though the israeli decision makers are conducting two different policies towards the palestinians; the first towards the palestinian authority and abu mazen and the second towards hamas in the gaza strip. as a matter of fact, however, the israelis are conducting one policy for both entities, that of continuing to confront instead of real negotiations with both parts of the palestinians.

an accumulation of awakened senses
paulo coelho, the brazilian born master storyteller, has done it again: he has presented readers with a piece of a gem. this astonishing, breathtaking book like a flowing river awakens the reader and rekindles the aesthetic senses. it is an intimate collection of the writer's reflections and short stories. these are tales of the living and the dying. they are tales of life and love, of the choices made in life. some of the tales are humorous and others are serious. however, they all tell profound tales. the tales delve into human lives and draw out wisdom. like real life experiences we seem to learn by trial and error as we go through the narratives of the writer.
