fixing the minimum wage in the garment industry
the government is reportedly finding it difficult to arrive at a consensus regarding fixing a minimum wage for the garment industry. it is reported that while the workers are demanding a threefold increase in the monthly minimum salary - from the existing taka 1,662 to taka 5,000 - the factory owners are ready to offer up to only taka 2,500 a month. both sides seem to have their own perspectives and reasoning with no meeting point in sight. at the end of the day, however, the government will have to give its verdict anyway. in order to promote good owner-labour relationship and to avoid further labour unrest, it is absolutely essential that the rationale of the government's decision is made clear to all stakeholders. to establish such a rationale, a number of questions need to be answered.

iran-turkey-brazil nuclear agreement

'she has your strength of character . . .'
the age of epistolary conversations is over. there is something about technology, about post-modern developments, that often comes in the way of your understanding of life and the bigger meanings which punctuate it at regular intervals. when that is the perception, you try travelling back in time, the objective being a comprehension of the world as it was in the days when ideas took shape in letters, which again came in longhand. and when these letters involve men and women who have passed into history as its defining voices, the pleasure derived from a reading of them becomes all the greater. deep poignance underlines such missives, or an exchange of them. and it does so through a recreation of the varied processes that once went into a shaping of historical perspectives, into a moulding of perceptions about the place of nations on a global platform.
