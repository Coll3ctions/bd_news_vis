human rights in bangladesh
the observance of international human rights day in bangladesh yesterday could not have happened in sorrier circumstances. for all the fanfare associated with a celebration of the day, through seminars, symposia and the like, the fact remains that in today's bangladesh, there is a blight which casts its shadows over the rights that citizens are morally and constitutionally entitled to enjoy. justice mohammad habibur rahman puts it in perspective for us when he notes that the executive branch of government possesses neither the skills nor the power to protect human rights. that is a severe indictment of the authorities. add to that the fact that there is hardly any meaningful exhortation from the powers that be about the need to guarantee human rights through taking swift action against those who have continued to demonstrate a cavalier attitude to them through a systematic violation of them.
image building through exposition of our culture
bangladesh has a great potential and opportunity to make its mark in the world by projecting her culture through heritage shows overseas like india and sri lanka have been doing. this was stated at a news conference held by bangladesh arts council (bac) ahead of a heritage show last thursday. bangladeshi culture has a unique history of 2500 years. we have a rich heritage, full of diversity and some distinct characteristics which need to be presented in a coherent and attractive manner to the outside world. view the page sports

preserving our liberation war sites!
most papers reported on 2nd december of the high court reminding the government of its duty to preserve the liberation war sites! it is a shame for the nation, the governments and now the awami league, that two years on, they have done nothing towards preserving our historical sites related to our liberation struggle. despite the writ petition in 2009, we are still ignoring our own history. one wonders why it needed a writ petition to the hon. high court by a few patriotic citizens, to point out to the powers that are, of this vital national duty. was it not the duty of our politicos to do this, since they talk the most about our liberation struggle and the creation of bangladesh? they were and are unfortunately too busy otherwise!
decentralisation of dhaka
almost all the countries of the world have two capitals i.e. administrative and commercial. the administrative capital of our neighbouring giant is new delhi and the commercial capital is mumbai. then again, islamabad is the administrative and karachi is the commercial capital of pakistan.
rights of minorities
i am disturbed by the contrast between the frequent assurances that the racial and religious minorities in bangladesh are treated honourably and tolerantly and the numerous examples of quite different behaviour that i have come across personally in my years here or read about in your columns - and, so far, have been silent about. these included several murders which got minimal publicity and, usually, no follow-up. on november 30th, you reported two situations, one in aluari village, dinajpur and another in shyamnagar, satkhira. mention of the damaging of 'a church' in one of them indicates the village was christian and in the other one, the community concerned included hindus.
controversial cantonment house
has begum khaleda zia committed any crime by living long 28 years at the cantonment house? she did not request dhaka cantonment board to allot her that house. the fact is our past government/dhaka cantonment board gave her the house to compensate her after the assassination of her husband president ziaur rahman. begum khaleda zia is totally innocent. we are surprised and shocked, and we fail to understand why begum khaleda zia was evicted from her house after 28 years? why now this hue and cry about cantonment house?
politics of hartal
although bnp joined one or two parliament sessions, it is a matter of regret that this opposition party could not play a significant role in making the parliament effective. besides, politics of hartal that caused huge loss to our economy has added fuel into the flame. bnp's decision of not joining the parliament has made the people frustrated. mps of bnp can even resign any time from the parliament; they have warned the government about it. undoubtedly, this decision is leading the whole country again to the politics of clash.
dr. yunus - our pride
what is going on in our country? we are criticising dr. yunus in a way which is so shameful for the nation. dr. yunus achieved the nobel prize for his role in eradicating poverty. he introduced microcredit to the world. it is a widely accepted theory and acknowledged by the world famous economists. he established his theory through his works. but we did not stand behind him, rather we criticised his getting the nobel prize. i felt so bad when i saw a procession coming out of dhaka university shouting slogans against dr. yunus. our pm also commented on the incident and demanded proper investigation into the matter which was unfortunate.
bangla dailies' reports
one cannot get the actual stories behind the news by reading bangladeshi dailies, especially the bangla dailies. for example, most bangla dailies carried the news of shifting khaleda zia's household belongings under big headlines. this is not a big news for the nation. the story behind this news is very simple. begum zia has lost her legal battle and she is vacating the cantonment house. of course, she deserves some notice from the media, but not this big coverage.
hindu communities' woes
while i was in bangladesh a few weeks ago, i went to my village where i grew up. in our village, there were almost 50 60 hindu families in 1971 and now there are only seven families left. more shocking is that these remaining families are now the poorest of all. most of them once had agricultural land, were relatively affluent, but now landless.
ragging
ragging is a nasty manifestation of popular culture. but what will be accomplished by assigning new police functions to school or college administrations? a look at child rearing in bangladesh will reveal the roots of ragging. girls appear to have lesser scope or opportunity for anti-social behaviour. but in the case of boys, a great deal is overlooked by parents. even in school, a parent is offended by reports of anti-social behaviour by his son. perhaps training children for adulthood has to start much earlier. it is difficult to overlook the fact that ragging is cultural in its origins.
custodial deaths
custodial deaths and extra judicial killings have made our law enforcing agencies controversial. last year as many as 90 people died in custody. very recently 17-year-old sagor died in police custody. his family alleged that he died due to torture by the cops. astonishingly, we are observing such deaths one after another. besides, the police show their disgust to file cases in these connections. thus, these deaths go uninvestigated.
hillary's humour!
the american diplomacy sustained a serious jolt following disclosure of a huge volume of classified government documents by the wikileaks. this disclosure has put the entire world into a chaotic and confusing situation.
cardiovascular diseases
the daily prothom alo has published a report on the health bulltin-2010 of health directorate on 27th november 2010. cardiovascular diseases have been identified as the number one cause of patients' death in the country in the report. and the people aged between 25 to 49 years die mainly of these diseases. the age group shown in the report who are vulnerable to cardiac diseases is the most productive and income generating group in the family. generally, the doctors say that hypertension, stress, anxiety, food habit etc. are the main causes of cardiovascular diseases.
delayed news in ds
we have seen an example of objective and responsible reporting from the daily star on december 3. a foreign media circulated a story of fund transfer from grameen bank to a sister organisation grameen kalyan. using this as a source the media at home made a news story on december 2 that created undue sensation in society. the news story created disturbance in the minds of the readers. some of them, who take pride in the performance of grameen bank and its winning of the nobel peace prize, were shocked at the allegations.
hijacked bangladeshi ship
a group of somali pirates reportedly hijacked a bangladesh-flagged ship in the arabian sea off the coast of india recently. the fate of 26 abductees remained unknown. the government and the naval force couldn't do anything to rescue the ship. some days have passed, and now the debate has turned into who hijacked the ship. this is really frustrating. the government should do something very quickly to recover the ship from the hijackers. view the page international
