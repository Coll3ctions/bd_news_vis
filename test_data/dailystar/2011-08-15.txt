as we remember bangabandhu …
remembering bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman is fundamentally a recalling of some of the most glorious moments in the history of bangladesh. for it was under his leadership and on his watch that we waged a long, tortuous struggle for democratic rights and national liberty. it was through his inspiration that this nation emerged into freedom and took its place on the global stage. in bangabandhu was personified the most articulate spokesperson of bengali aspirations, the most visible and vibrant face this nation could present to the world.

the irreversible loss
on august 13, 2011 we lost tareq masud and mishuk munier, two great talents of our country along with three other persons. i can't imagine that the maker of antorjatra, matir moyna and many other good films had to embrace such a tragic death. after mirsarai tragedy this is the most shocking one. actually, the word security is not in the dictionary of our country. here the drivers control our lifespan. we just cannot deny this reality. the dhaka-aricha highway has now become a deathtrap. we, the helpless commuters, know this but cannot do anything against it.

the hardworking souls!

in the hands of unskilled drivers
according to different reports and surveys, in most of the cases the inefficient or fake drivers are responsible for road accidents. i came to know a different thing while talking to a driver in dhaka. the driver said, “i am a skilled driver but i failed to obtain the driving license after my third attempt because i didn't give bribe to the brta (bangladesh road and transport authority) people, whereas unskilled drivers are buying driving licenses.” he also added that we have shortage of skilled drivers and unskilled drivers are driving throughout the city. if this is the real picture, then how come our roads will be safe from accidents, as the ghost is in the mustard? the government should take a hard line to curb corruption in all sectors like transport, electricity etc.
road accidents
we are actually tired talking about road accidents. each day when we go out of the house or traveling somewhere we are not sure if we can really make it. we know death is in the hands of almighty, still we can be careful and our drivers should be sympathetic to the people on the streets and other vehicles on the highways.

bangabandhu: our epic, tragic hero
he was a man, take him for all in all,
i shall not look upon his like again. (hamlet, 1.2.187)
history revisited
i was watching on btv the formal ceremony organized to bestow on mrs. indira gandhi, bangladesh freedom honor (posthumous), for her contribution towards the freedom of bangladesh. my mind went back 40 years, when prime minister sheikh hasina in her speech referred to mrs. indira gandhi as the only leader in history who withdrew within 3 months the indian troops from a country she helped to liberate.
reminiscing about bangabandhu
15 august, 1975 is the most remorseful day in our nation’s calendar. on this day, the father of the nation bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman was killed along with his family members save two by military adventurers abetted by self-seeking, unconscionable politicians. this tragic event was patently the precursor to usurpation of power through backdoor, overthrowing constitutional government. subsequently, we had to weather a spell of extra constitutional ambition in the space of the last 40 years of our independence. it was a distortion in the evolution of constitutional norms and practices for a nascent democratic polity like ours. the gory event enacted on that fateful morning at 32 dhanmondi traumatized the entire nation beyond measure. it left a deep scar in its psyche that will never be blotted out from memory.
sheikh mujib and the six points
"o judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
and men have lost their reason. bear with me;
my heart is in the coffin there with caesar,
and i must pause till it come back to me."
--- (mark antony in shakespeare's julius caesar, act 3. scene ii)
