welcome move by bnp
we are indeed very happy that the bangladesh nationalist party has decided to join the inaugural session of the newly elected jatiyo sangsad on january 25. in a political culture where the parliamentary opposition has generally not taken kindly to its defeat at general elections, the bnp's move is certainly encouraging. we would like to think it is the first of many steps the party will take in contributing to the growth of a new, sophisticated political culture in the country. in the last few days, begum khaleda zia and khondokar delwar hossain have made allegations, out of pique and in less than good taste, about the fairness of the recent elections, comments we think were highly off the mark in light of the credible way in which the voting took place. even so, the party has demonstrated a degree of political acumen in agreeing to play its role in parliament. the decision to go to the js is clearly a sign of maturity and must be appreciated.

when death stalked the land of the free
in the final days of his life, m. mansoor ali was a prisoner in the country he went all the way to free from pakistani colonial rule. he was part of the mujibnagar provisional government between april and december 1971, one of the many inspirational voices in what would turn out to be an annus mirabilis for the bengali nation. he was part of the team that organized, in the absence of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman (by then a prisoner in an undisclosed location in pakistan) the guerrilla war which in nine months would lead to the emergence of bangladesh as a free socialist, secular republic. as finance minister in mujibnagar, it was a difficult job he was compelled to carry out. in post-liberation bangladesh, his mettle was sorely tested when, as home minister, he was expected to handle law and order in a society where the disorder that follows a revolution was soon to manifest itself. he proved equal to the task. and in early 1975, as bangabandhu took the country into the baksal political system, mansoor ali took charge as prime minister.
a gourmet's delight it surely is . . .
eating is a biological necessity, but cooking is an art. instruction in the art is codified in recipes. the first recipes must have been orally transmitted, but with the invention of writing, recipes, like other forms of literature, began to be inscribed. a babylonian clay tablet from around 1500 bc preserves the recipes for certain appetizing ancient dishes. this may well be the earliest known precursor of the cookbook.

a zoo in my luggage is a hilarious account of gerald durrell's world of animals when he starts collecting them for a zoo of his own. it is a refreshing experience to enter the animal world and get insights into how the animals behave under different situations. once the reader starts reading the book it is impossible to put it down until the last page comes with the last burst of laughter and keeps the reader smiling for a long time.
