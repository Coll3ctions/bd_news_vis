indian minister's 'assurance' on river linking projects

making upazila parishads redundant

competency of rab
in a recently held seminar on human rights, the national human rights commission chairman very rightly said, “certainly there is inadequacy somewhere in rab's training and that needs to be looked into”. he concluded this from the fact that when rab personnel go to catch someone, it ends in deaths in almost all cases. the recent shooting incident of narsingdi where six people were killed by rab is an example that puts rab's professionalism under a big question mark. in this particular case, they just received information from a man who was reportedly robbed of tk. 48000 by the alleged snatchers fleeing in a microbus that was then stopped by the rab force killing all of them. surprisingly, the person who was robbed of his money now remains untraceable.
