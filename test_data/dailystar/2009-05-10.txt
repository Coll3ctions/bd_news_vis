may day and workers' rights
may day, the political version, - is an american holiday -- once celebrated everywhere in the world except america. the holiday is most often associated with the commemoration of social and economic achievements of the labour movement for a basic right we're now in the process of losing. the day began as workers campaigned for an eight-hour day - we all are aware of its history. but, what is actually happening? the industrial mode of production has divided society into two classes, those who own the means of production (the factories, corporate houses, and govt. institutions as well as development agencies) and the proletariats (the workers), those who are selling their labour as a commodity. the capitalist class is exploiting the labour of workers to produce a surplus for making profits.
climate change issues
bangladesh has three great rivers the brahmaputra, the padma and the meghna around 230 smaller rivers flow into these. as there are so many people living in the country, they have to use every bit of land available for farming, even the riverbanks. these riverbanks are prone to erosion and people frequently plunge into extreme poverty when they lose their land and homes due to erosion. although floods are an annual event, huge floods seem to be becoming more frequent. in 2004, a deluge destroyed 80% of the country's crops, killed 747 people and left 30 million homeless or stranded. the floods of 2007 were not as severe but caused far greater health problems such as cholera and diarrhoea than has been seen for at least a decade. temperature increase caused by climate change will mean that more snow will melt in the himalayas each summer. this water will run into the rivers increasing the chances of flooding and river erosion. if the snow melts fully, it could lead to severe water shortage.
mongla port
mongla seaport is situated in the south-western part of bangladesh. the previous name of this port was chalna port. during the pakistan period this was an ideal anchorage port & due to its location near the jute mills in khulna, it was the busiest port handling jute & jute goods. but after liberation due to sinking of various kinds of vessels the port's navigability has been affected, as the wreckage of vessels at the port could not be removed.
turkish embassy clarifies

pertinent point

education commission
the government has announced a new education commission. the new commission will follow dr. qudrat-e-khuda education commission which was the first education commission in bangladesh. to form a new education commission, a committee was announced on 8 april.
recession and mobile phone
recession has hit every sector and our booming mobile phone industry is no exception. every cell phone operator is experiencing decline in the number of new subscribers' registration. they are blaming the high tax on sim (subscribers identity module) as the main reason for this. so in order to encourage the users to activate the old unused sim, mobile operators have come up with various promotional offers recently. they are declaring 100% to 300% recharge bonus and some are offering to give tk 1,000 reward bonus to the users who have not used their sim for a long period of time. definitely, these promotional offers are unique and clever marketing policy on the part of the mobile operators and i find no harm in them. but i think they are treating their active users unfairly in the process. they are giving attractive offers to the subscribers who didn't use their sim, but why will the active users be deprived? what harm they did to the operators by using their sim constantly? i think if the operators encourage the inactive sim users, they should also declare reward for the active users at the same time in order to treat all equally.
contain sound pollution
noise pollution in dhaka is becoming unbearable, it is almost as big a problem as scarcity of water and power failures, but it doesn't receive any attention from the authorities. there is a simple solution: ban all hydraulic horns and loudspeaker use between 11:00pm and 7:00am, ban the use of cutters on fridays in residential areas, all cutters should be used within the building and not on the pavement or street, have better traffic control, so that people don't need to use their horns so often.
no place for the poor!

too defensive!
precaution is needed for our welfare but if it stops the speed of life, then of course this is not expected. in case of facing the threat of global recession, most of the companies (working in bangladesh) are doing the same thing. they have been so defensive that already they have stopped new recruitment totally. moreover, they are cutting jobs of temporary employees on different lame excuses. recently, the government declared (informally) in the same manner that less efficient ten percent employees will have to say 'good-bye' to their jobs very soon. view the page international
