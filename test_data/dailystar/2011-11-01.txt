the people of narayanganj have largely rejected the candidates with criminal records in the just concluded city polls, giving mayor-elect selina hayat ivy a relatively clean team to run the corporation.
a breath of fresh air
there could not have been any better news for democracy, clean politics and people's empowerment and, contrarily, a stronger slap on the face of terrorism, extortion, criminalisation of politics, intimidation and mafia control of voters than selina hayat ivy's victory in the ncc polls. it is truly a breath of fresh air in our otherwise conflict-ridden, rhetoric-laden and false promises-based political scene.

diplomatic failure

the economics of transit
having gone through a patchy period of ups and downs for sometime, bangladesh-india relations at the moment are poised for a positive trend, which we feel must be sustained. towards that end there is a very strong rationale for the two countries to develop an environment in mutual dealings that will bring about positive outcomes for both the parties in equal measure, with perhaps a slight tilt towards bangladesh since it has more severe development challenges to overcome.
ncc polls
if there is one lesson learnt from the narayanganj city corporation mayoral polls, it is that the people are the ultimate master of politics. because the people willed it, the maneuvering and manipulation by the ruling party -- including the ruling party candidate's attempt to spread panic through warnings of a possible militant attack -- had no bearing on how the people cast their votes. indeed, the ncc polls are a testament to the fact that a genuine political leader, one with strong public support, cannot be ignored, that too, without damaging party credibility. view the page sports
