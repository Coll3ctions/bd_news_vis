warning to forest grabbers
the chief adviser's voicing of resolve that zero tolerance has been ensured in all spheres of forest administration to curb corruption, mismanagement and malpractice is reassuring. evidently, it is set against the revealing tales of plunder of forest resources by officials of the forest department denying the national exchequer millions in revenue. their misdeeds exemplified the classic aberration of the gateman becoming poacher.

chakoria incident
it is a matter of disgrace to the police (a man was reportedly beaten to death by a police officer at chakoria). the distance between the police and citizens is increasing day by day. the sense of responsibility and humanity has completely vanished from the minds of police. most of the time they work for the rich (who give them bribes) rather than poor, weak people. the rate of corruption in the police department is so high that now we can't think of any honest policeman. but the situation was quite different in the past (may be during the british period). police used to command a lot of respect at that time. even at the time of our liberation war, many policemen fought like tigers. but the situation has completely changed.
population problem
these days many people are found talking on tv on various subjects. there is no dearth of subjects. they talk on dialogue with the parties, jute, price hike of rice and other commodities, increase in oil and gas prices, nargis and sidr and so on, but nobody talks about a major problem of the country and perhaps of the world. what is that? well, that's the 'population problem of bangladesh'.
water logging
water logging is a great problem that occurs (as is common for salinisation) in poorly drained soils where water can't penetrate deeply and that are poorly drained topographically. the raised water table results in the soils becoming waterlogged. when soils are water logged, air spaces in the soil are filled with water, and plant roots essentially suffocate -- lacking oxygen. water logging also damages soil structure. worldwide, about 10% of all irrigated land suffers from water logging. as a result, productivity has fallen about 20% in this area of cropland. the ultimate results are soil pores have no oxygen, vegetation can turn yellow, growth is stunted and thin, trees and plants can die, bare patches of soil appear, plant species more tolerant of saturated conditions will take over.
govt high school & college
in sabujbag residential area, mostly middle and lower middle class people live. but the government has not set up any high school or college over here. the private high school and college in the locality are sub-standard.
war crimes
at the heart of the concept of war crimes is the idea that an individual can be held responsible for the actions of a country or that nation's soldiers. genocide, crimes against humanity, mistreatment of civilians or combatants during war can all fall under the category of war crimes. genocide is the most severe of these crimes. in the context of war, a war crime is a punishable offence under international law, for violations of the laws of war by any person or persons, military or civilian. war crimes can be committed during international armed conflict or internal armed conflict.
patgati bridge
in 1999, the then government started construction of the patgati bridge over the madhumati to connect pirojpur and bagerhat districts with gopalganj. though the bridge would make easier highway links from the southern part towards the rest or the country through gopalganj, when completed, only two pillars of the bridge have been constructed so far.
beggars
the number of beggars is increasing in the city day by day. they make roads and passages unclean and unhygienic. the bangkok city authorities made the capital free from beggars and rickshaw pullers since the mid seventies which helped the city to be attractive to the tourists.
costly errors
rectifying a mistake can rather be an easy task, but one wishes that the same could be said about errors in judgement as well…. especially with regard to politics. if unleashing a lethal political vendetta between two ladies (leading two major political parties in bangladesh) for years to score petty-political gains (a major political mistake) was an act of political misdemeanour, then the unwillingness of (a grave error in judgement) these two ladies and their surrogates to realise that they are not invincible was nothing but a political felony/crime. and crime does pay very dearly and perhaps unfairly, at times.
lebanese scene
recent attacks by shia hezbollah on the sunni-led government of prime minister fuad siniora in lebanon signalled the coming bloodbath between two hostile muslim sects in the region. heavily-armed shiite gunmen belonging to hezbollah are slaughtering mostly unarmed or lightly armed sunnis with the aim to establish a shiite hegemony in lebanon and unless other arab countries stop hezbollah, lebanese sunnis might face a mass slaughter.
chittagong british council library
once chittagong british council library boasted a good collection of books. on the cards issued by the library it was labelled as a charity. hence a good number of students and readers visited the library. thus the library played an important role that was both educative and charitable.
abduction of a pakistani envoy
it now appears from a bbc (british broadcasting corporation) report, the ambassador of pakistan to afghanistan - who was reportedly abducted by taliban militants, a few months ago was released recently by his captors. it should be a piece of good news for family and friends of the envoy plus government of pakistan, per se.
edward kennedy
american senator and a friend of bangladesh ted kennedy is seriously ill with a deadly brain tumour. he is the man who supported bangladesh during our glorious liberation war, while his country supported pakistan.
purchase committee
some former members of the khaleda cabinet who, being members of the then cabinet purchase committee, have recently been arrested for their alleged involvement in the 'gatco corruption case'. some such arrested former ministers, some 'talkers' in the local tv channels and some journalists, through their writings and speeches, are trying to give an impression to the nation that the said cabinet purchase committee was nothing but a mere rubber stamp without any significance. as an ordinary citizen, i do not know what is written in the 'rules of business' on the duties and responsibilities of the members of the purchase committee. but i can assume that a committee on which sits a number of senior cabinet ministers, and on whose recommendation the prime minister gives his/her decision cannot be a committee on paper only. if the members of the committee conducted themselves as the “domestic aides” of the prime minister and, knowing the prime minister's mind recommended something which the prime minister wanted to do, the committee members concerned cannot escape the responsibility for the wrong doing by the prime minister.
dwindling bttb
this refers to the star business report (ds, 23 may) on the dwindling bttb subscribers. i am not surprised to see its gradual decline. even making bttb a public limited company will not be an appropriate solution. as per this report quoting a bttb high official, it is not the 'limited capacity to accommodate new connections' rather the backward looking and stagnant outlook of the board that has created this situation. mind that there is a huge amount of unpaid bills pending with the government organisations and, on the other hand, the individual subscribers are virtually being held hostage by the 'hon'ble linemen' all over the country. and the bttb has failed to do anything about it as the board is also being controlled by highly politicised union people.
us presidential election
forrest cookson's gloomy piece predicting that john mccain will win the next us presidential election may be prophetic. it also is right out of the republican playbook, despite mr. cookson's suggestions to the contrary. i share the view that mr. mccain has better chance of capturing the presidency than many observers suspect. but the exciting thing is that the rise of mr. obama has been both spectacular and unprecedented. who, six months ago, would seriously have expected him to be ahead of such an establishment figure as mrs. clinton? what happens from now on depends on whether mr. obama runs a campaign that continues to challenge the conventional rules of us politics, and whether he is able to transcend the past. it is certainly possible that he will do so, and that he will win a decisive victory that may be seen as a turning point. to foretell his failure at this juncture is out-of-touch with the situation on the ground, and is exactly what the mccain camp is counting on. mr. cookson's piece is little more than a stealth endorsement for mr. mccain, and readers need to know that.
du students' plight
i would like to draw your attention on the news about resident du students living in complete misery. it's a pathetic view of our best university. when the vc is living in a nice building , i guess, his students are sharing floors in a completely dire situation. i don't know how the administrators themselves used to live when they were students, but i think they should be sympathetic and take necessary steps. since du is one benchmark and reflection of country's educational system, where can i hide my face when our national dailies reveal such unpleasant truths. i was a student a few years back though not from du but i feel sorry for them.
rajuk's role
it is incomprehensible what the daily start tried to mean by its very news item captioned “a city itself set to dot dhaka horizon” dated 15th may 2008. the content of the news item says that rajuk is filling up wetland with an area of over 2,000 acres in uttara. the story is also full of pleas rajuk usually made in the past in grabbing valuable farmland, evicting the owners, for distribution among the members of the unholy alliance of the politicians, bureaucrats and the businessmen. in this distribution of looted items the rajuk officials also get a chunk. view the page international
