the essence of eid-ul-azha

seats in public universities
getting opportunity to study in a public university, undoubtedly, is a major concern for the applicants as well as the guardians. they appear in admission tests in different universities, and finally very few get admission. the number of seats, in proportion to the demand, is very few.
voters' duty
i would like to request all voters of our country to choose honest and patriotic people in the next elections. after a long time we have got this chance to practice our rights and to select the government which will rule this country for the next five years. so, we all have to be very careful to make the correct decision.

post-election scenario
come 2009, the eagerly awaited election will only result in the same old tarnished politicos in the same old parties; still tied to the tail of their founders' names, and practicing autocracy in the garb of democracy, once again ruling the roost! will there be any change in their attitudes, mind-set and smelly practices? i wonder! it will be only more of the same; and as we say "old wine in old bottles" with nothing new to write home about.
reach out and seek help
the mindless carnage of 26th november in mumbai has immensely angered the indian government, people and also us all. we all condemn the terrible act in the strongest possible terms. the indian government needs to devise means to combat terrorism in its own soil and safeguard its populace, and prevent its escalation in other asian countries. a pertinent question arises- why does it keep on happening? india experienced terrorist attack in 2003 and then it kept on repeating. early finger pointing at pakistan or bangladesh or nepal will not help solve the problem, rather it will alienate them and the situation will turn more difficult.
mumbai attacks
re: op-ed: "this fire needs to be put out," by fareed zakaria (dec. 2).
uttara and purbachal plots
i am a non-resident bangladeshi living in canada, working as software engineer. recently rajuk invited applications for plot allocation in uttara and purbachal. they have given the opportunity for expatriates also, but the time is so short that it is almost impossible to collect all those papers . they asked to scan and email all the papers, i am sure most of the people will have problem to do that because that will be a huge file to email, there will be the bandwidth issue which rajuk never considered.
indian propaganda
i watched with horror how some indian media tried to implicate bangladesh in the mumbai terror attack. msnbc cable tv of usa was feeding from ndtv of india and it was reporting on the very second day that 29 pakistani and 11 bangladeshis were in the terror group! msnbc, i'm sure, was sucked into ndtv's agenda driven, unsubstantiated, innuendo based news. ndtv dished out anti bangladesh propaganda to us viewers with the help of msnbc.
railways
bangladesh railway is doing a great job from its introduction. it's one of the most comfortable and secure mode of transportations since the british period. commuters of our country feel comfortable to make their journey by train because of reasonable prices of tickets. we usually see the long lines of commuters in front of railway stations.
canadian immigration rules
due to changes in the immigration and refugees protection act (irpa), federal skilled workers' applications received on or after february 27, 2008 will now be assessed for eligibility according to a set of instructions issued by the minister of citizenship, immigration and multiculturalism, canada.
psc's decision
the psc has introduced a new method in the 28th bcs exams. well, basically a change is for betterment. but the change in bcs exams is a suicidal one-- deduction of 0.5 marks for each wrong answer. has psc been highly inspired by the caretaker government's mission against corruption? the drastic decision taken by the psc can destroy all dreams & hopes of bcs candidates. the psc should reconsider the decision.
mccain's visit
needless, to say that the visit of u.s. senator john mccain, carried much importance. after the mumbai massacre, the arrival of mccain added a new dimension to the oriental politics.
irony of our politics
the bnp has flouted the provision of the rpo (in nominating their candidates for the parliamentary polls) which required grassroots leaders to send panels of candidates and then only would the parliamentary board select candidates from that list. the bnppb has instead unilaterally nominated candidates. to make matters worse they have nominated people with dubious backgrounds, accused criminals (an aug 21st grenade accused has also got nomination!) and convicted persons. the recent hc verdict barring epr convicts from polls has been a positive decision and hopefully this will keep away some of the notorious persons. while the al has followed the grassroots' recommendations (though in some cases they have not), their alliance with the former military dictator h.m.ershad is a sign of al's "win at any cost" mentality. ershad, it appears is keen to get the post of president (as a part of a deal with al) to lead the last days of his life "respectably."
education and private tuition
our whole education system is completely enveloped by an invisible curtain namely "private tuition" which is absolutely responsible for producing the unemployed educated (!) groups. private tuition is now a better job than teaching in any reputed school or college or university. most of the teachers are highly interested to serve as an expert "private tutor" rather than a skilled teacher in any educational institution. for this reason, the students who are regular in their academic classes are being deprived. moreover, they, the private students, achieve good results through those teachers who taught them in private and the students who did not join the private classes get poor marks in that subject. this is not an ideal situation.
mumbai mayhem
words are insufficient to condemn the terror attack in mumbai.
electoral debates
it's really nice to hear that the election commission (ec) plans to organise electoral debates on crucial issues before the december elections. it would be really good to get academics and thinkers to ask the political leaders detailed questions on their plans to turn bangladesh around and also on their visions for the country.
bbc and awami league
the news story entitled "dhaka [bcs] exams row sparks violence" on bbc website (tuesday, 2 december 2008) does not seem to meet the usual bbc standard of neutrality and fairness.
pakistan and terrorism
"pakistan rallies support as tension with india rises" was news headlines of some dailies after a couple of days of the mumbai terror attack. myself and rest of the bangladeshis would like to see which country supports the terrorist nation if there is a fourth war between pakistan and india.
minister resigns
