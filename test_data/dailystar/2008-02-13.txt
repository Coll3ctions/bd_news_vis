dealing with housing corruption
the national coordination committee on combating corruption and serious crimes has been doing an appreciable job in dealing with institutionalised corruption. its efforts to track down wrongdoing in such organisations as rajuk and titas gas have been welcomed all over the country. it then follows that it is now time for the national housing authority to be taken to task. that much becomes clear in light of the inquiries already made by the task force of the ncc. what the inquiries have revealed is staggering, and naturally too given the fact that individuals as young as two-year old children have become the proud owners of residential plots. such dismal realities only hold up yet once more the degree of corruption that has for years undermined the integrity of institutions, to a point where the nation as a whole now faces the uphill task of clawing back to a semblance of order.
