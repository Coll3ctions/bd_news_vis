fertiliser distribution
the efficient management initiated by the agriculture minister of the distribution of agricultural inputs, together with a more or less assured supply of electricity in the rural areas for irrigation, had last year endowed bangladesh with a bumper crop. everything in the country seems to have taken a nosedive since then. after having witnessed the syndicate-raj tweak the nose of several ministries and reduce their vaunted claims of stable prices into whimpers during the past ramadan, one wonders whether the syndicate-raj is going to call the shots once again by creating a fertilizer crisis and hold the government hostage during the ensuing boro and aman seasons.
role of a university
shahjalal university of science & technology, sylhet, has been playing a revolutionary role in extending a wide range of scientific and technical education throughout the country since its establishment in 1987. the most remarkable thing is that this university has recently innovated an easy, quick and simple digital admission process for the session 2009-2010. this method of admission is expected to reduce the hazards and complexities of admission seekers. besides, it will save both the money and time of the applicants concerned. however, the present government pledged extensively to digitalise bangladesh by 2021 during electoral campaign. perhaps sust as well as other universities of the country can play a leading role in transforming bangladesh into a modern, digital and financially sound country. it is also believed that bangladesh will be recognised as a democratic and prosperous country through the relentless efforts of the universities like sust. finally, it is recommended that the government raise supportive hands setting up more academic buildings and research centres within the universities to facilitate this sort of innovative and cost effective effort.
easing traffic jam
how long does someone spend in the ever prevailing gridlock of dhaka city? you are never sure when you will reach your destination, doesn't matter whether you have a very important meeting fixed at a certain time, or may be you need to attend a very serious patient. nobody, from top-notch executives to day labourers, diplomats to garment workers can escape from these important hour losses. to make matters worse, we have sophomore cng drivers and apprentice rickshaw pullers targeting some quick bucks during the month of ramadan and on the occasions of holy eid & durga puja. even the number of street beggars has jumped manifolds, and not to mention our culture of going in numbers for buying even a single article.
swat killings
it was reported in the september 15, 2009 edition of the new york times that the pakistan army in the swat valley has retaliated for the heavy army causalities inflicted by the taliban by resorting to torturing, maiming and killing civilians. people in swat valley have disappeared for days and later their bodies were found dumped in mass graves.
passport issue
i went to the bank that deals with passports. they told me that they were considering discontinuation of passport issuance, renewal etc. services. when asked about the reason for such a decision they expressed dissatisfaction, annoyance and anger with the fact that passport authorities in agargaon are not co-operating with them. passport authorities are not issuing or renewing passports on time. so, the bank is facing lots of unnecessary problems with passport seekers and customers. the bank officials informed that the illegal income of the 'passport people' has decreased to a large extent due to the public friendly arrangement, and passport men want to sabotage a public-friendly service! submission of applications for passport issuance or renewal at the bank has brought down public sufferings to a great extent. in other countries, passport forms are submitted in post offices, designated banks and passports are mailed to the address or collected from banks.
traffic rules
there may be many reasons behind traffic jam. in my experience, so far i have noticed that most of the people whether he or she is a car owner or not, men or women don't obey the traffic rules. compliance with traffic rules is needed for reducing traffic jam.
for a better bangladesh…
the government is committed to building a non-communal democratic bangladesh where people of all faiths will leave in peace. people of every religion and ethnic group would leave in this land with dignity and rights. with the adoption and practice of secularism there will be no discrimination due to religion. people of all faiths will be treated in the same way without any difference whatsoever. is that enough to protect the fundamental rights and interest of all class of people of the state? what do we find today? interest of people having different political faiths is molested ruthlessly. one needs to be a qualified person of the ruling party to get appointment, transfer, posting, promotion, tender, work order, chairmanship, directorship, varsity admission, seat in the hall etc. etc., even vgf cards.
admission in universities
i was reading "the daily prothom alo" on 1 september 2009. the article was written on the different opinions of vice chancellors of the universities on giving admission form online.
extension of service
two top bureaucrats have been given two years of service extension, each right before their retirement, depriving the next deserving senior civil servants on the plea that they are their own unswerving stalwarts (the daily star: 13.09.09). it is the repetition of the previous governments' practices. it's a sheer transgression of the civil service norms and discipline. honourable prime minister, being a citizen of this country, i suppose i have the privilege to ask where are the 'days of change' you pledged in your election manifesto?
of traffic and transport
the minister for communications has recently taken up a 'few' mega projects to help the development of the transport sector of our country. these projects are all set to commence by 2011. i congratulate him for all the hard work he's done, but i would have preferred a more efficient solution to our transportation problem.
education policy
to have a proper and effective national education policy may be a great boon to the nation. it is good news that we are going to have a new national education policy. positively, we hope that it would bring about a radical change in our education sector towards betterment. the class range of primary and secondary education along with other facilities is appreciable. moreover, the decision on decentralisation of national university by setting up centres in all divisions is also highly admirable. but it's really shocking that mps will have direct influence on governing bodies of the educational institutions. would it be fair to have political bodies' influence upon educational institutions?
no hartal, please
the national committee to protect oil, gas, mineral resources, power and ports called 'hartal' on 14th september, 2009 protesting the government's decision to award three offshore gas blocks to international oil companies with provision of gas export.
grabbers
we are really disappointed to see the jhau tree plundering along the cox's bazar coast. though the pm is looking into the matter, but how did this happen? we have government officials at every level in a district. what were they doing?
teachers' training
a process of restructuring the primary education system is going on. as a school teacher, i feel that our teachers need to be reequipped. it is very painful to say that we pay our school teachers a scanty amount and we want a noble return. we don't even make sure that they live an honourable life.
unpardonable crime
not only they took things that didn't belong to them, but their outrageous act now puts thousands of lives in danger as those trees were planted to create a cyclone-shield for the coastal people. fourteen years of progress has been sabotaged in just a few days! all that money that was invested to plant those trees have now gone to waste. and that's not the end of our wastes. what about all the police/court time and resource that are now being diverted to this matter? surely we are paying for that. and if those 30,000 trees are to be replanted, who is going to pay? we again.
zoo in bad shape
i had the opportunity to visit our "great" dhaka zoo the other day. what a joke! there was rubbish thrown about everywhere. the animals looked depressed and under-fed. the cages were too small. people visiting the zoo were teasing the animals with no zoo keeper to warn them. if the zoo authorities are incapable of maintaining it as per international standards, then there is no reason to keep this zoo open. i felt so sorry for these animals and wondered how these zoo keepers would feel if they were locked up in these cages instead. view the page international
