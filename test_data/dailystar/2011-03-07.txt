it is this writer's view that the march 7th speech was bangabandhu's finest hour. he stood far taller than ever before and with him we too stood taller. he was always known for being a powerful speaker. but that day, 26 years ago, he outperformed himself a thousand times over, and a thousand times more empowered we felt that day. during that crucial march afternoon, and especially through the electrifying moments of the speech he stood towering above the nation, singly shouldering the burden of leading an unprepared people towards sell assertion.
harbinger of independence
the spring is the time of the year when the bengali people had many times in the past risen up in protest against oppression, injustice, betrayal and tyranny by authorities in power. sometimes those oppressors were alien regimes, while at others they were home-grown autocrats. bengali youths revolted against the pakistani rulers' conspiracy to demean and relegate their mother tongue to a subordinate status on a spring day of february 21 about six decades back.
bangabandhu's moment in history . . .
as bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman rose to speak before the million people gathered at the race course in dhaka, indeed before the seventy five million people of bangladesh on march 7, 1971, the moment turned electric with excitement.
dhaka: an unlivable city indeed!
over the last two decades, the country experienced phenomenal urban growth, and has now become an epitome of squalor and poverty and an environmental abyss. despite the everyday trauma, rigours, and exhaustion, people are endlessly attracted to the city, for it seems to have work, livelihood and even prosperity on offer.
prof. yunus and bangladesh
i like prof. yunus a lot, and more than that i respect him. i also know that there are many like me. i remember, on hearing the news of prof. yunus' nobel prize i jumped about and screamed like a person gone mad with happiness. there have not been too many such occasions in my life. my happiness was not because someone i knew got the nobel prize but because the prestige of bangladesh went sky high. only those who have lived abroad can truly gauge how cruelly, indifferently and disrespectfully bangladesh is sometimes talked about, and it is prof. yunus and his work that have helped us enormously to counter that. the wall street journal in a recent piece, pointing out the difference between pakistan and bangladesh, wrote, “pakistan's hero is a rogue nuclear scientist who unlawfully smuggled nuclear technology, while bangladesh's hero is prof. yunus, winner of the nobel peace prize for helping the poor with small loans”.
