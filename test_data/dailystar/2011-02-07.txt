get bangla in arabic script
the death of mohammad ali jinnah in september 1948 pushed pakistan squarely up against a set of new conditions. a fundamental reason behind that was that jinnah had combined in himself the powers of governor general, president of the constituent assembly and president of the ruling muslim league. his successor khwaja nazimuddin could not lay claim to such unbridled authority. besides, there was prime minister liaquat ali khan, who was already making it known that power was now his to wield. as for nazimuddin, he showed not the slightest trace of taking pakistan to a new direction, but he did make it clear that under him pakistan would remain firmly on the course its founder had set for it. that included the late founder's position on the language question.

hartal should have been withdrawn
a withdrawal of the hartal called for today by the bnp, now that the government has stepped back from its plans for an airport at arial beel, would have paid the party good dividends. that begum zia and her colleagues have refused to do away with the hartal is regrettable. of course, there is the general feeling that all the cases registered by the authorities in connection with the recent agitation in arial beel must be withdrawn if conditions are to return to normal. the bnp would have done better if it had served warning on the authorities on the need to ensure security for the inhabitants of arial beel by a quashing of the cases filed against 21,000 people. for the party to now say that the hartal will be underway unless the cases are withdrawn and unless the crises in the areas of gas, electricity and water are resolved is really to shift the goal posts.

import 'sweeping trucks'
the picture with which my mail appeared in these columns on friday january 14, 2011, took me back to my school days in the 1970's learning about the invention of shoe, most probably a satire, by the world famous poet of the sub-continent. cleaning a place with broom sticks apparently cleans that particular area or place, but it has a serious adverse impact on the environment and surroundings. i would never have learned about it, had i not have the privilege of living in houston.

bold and opulent canvas

tribute to bob marley
born on february 6, 1945, son of a white english-jamaican father and afro-jamaican mother, nesta robert 'bob' marley spent his entire life facing questions about his racial identity. growing up as a ghetto child in the heart of kingston and because of his beliefs in rastafarianism, marley identified himself as a black african. his identity crisis reflected in his songs that later became anthems in the third world nations. the 1979 album “survival” clearly encompasses his afro-centric political ideologies.

let shariatpur tragedy be enough
the death of 14-year-old hena of chamta village in shariatpur district after she was forced to suffer arbitrary punishment at the hands of self-styled adjudicators is a glaring instance of how vulnerable women still are in our society. the victim girl, who was still in her dreamy adolescent years, could not perhaps imagine in her worst nightmare how heartless and barbaric some of the elders among whom she had been growing up could become -- not at least until the fateful night when she was raped by one of her relatives in his forties.
the collapse of a lie
nothing, goes the maxim, clears the head faster than the sight of a noose. this is true for ordinary mortals like you and me. despots intoxicated by the hallucination of indispensability are either puzzled or terrified by the notion that power is finite. their cronies have always told them otherwise. their palaces have insulated them from the street. the international order did business without the whisper of a question. why bother?
in defense of survey methodology
the recent tiff between the supreme court (sc) of bangladesh and transparency international, bangladesh (tib) is a watershed event for all professionals who conduct surveys and the organisations that use them to guide important decisions. in the business world, surveys often guide major strategic decisions. and the use of surveys for political opinion polling is ubiquitous.
bureaucracy for the people
in this sub-continent, elitism in bureaucracy was introduced by the british in order to cement their hold on the colonial people. they needed a subservient, compliant group who would look after the interest of the colonial masters and collect taxes from the subjects for the benefit of the raj. hence came the ics with all their perks and privileges.
