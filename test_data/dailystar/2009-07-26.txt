al chief's unquestioned power re-established
the awami league has just emerged from its council session through re-electing sheikh hasina as party president and entrusting syed ashraful islam with the responsibility of being general secretary. public attention, it would be quite correct to say, was focused on the council and especially on what steps the party took about its passage to the future. sheikh hasina's re-election as party leader is once more a reaffirmation of the confidence the awami league has placed in her since 1981. as for syed ashraful islam, it was clearly his proactive role in keeping the party together in the difficult days following the imposition of the emergency in january 2007 that seems to have smoothened his way formally to the top. both hasina and islam will now be expected to provide the party with the kind of inspiring leadership which can deepen the al's roots countrywide.

tree plantation
this year the rainy season has not arrived with its typical pomp and pleasure, and when it should be showering, and village ponds, tanks, and rivers are full to the brim, we see the hide and seek of clouds and the sun in the sky. the amount of rainfall is not adequate enough for the farmers to get to business. however, we expect there will be heavy downpour very soon and we should start tree plantation on a very large scale. in fact, there are a lot of fallow lands in different parts of the country. there should be more campaign, canvassing, and seminars on the importance of tree plantation. moreover, we can encourage students and young people explaining its environmental, medicinal, and financial benefits. by planting different types of trees, we can minimize the detrimental effects of green house and climate change and thereby make our country more habitable and beautiful.
unbearable traffic jams
nowadays traffic jam has increased beyond description. from morning to late night, the streets of dhaka city remain very busy hampering the lives of all citizens living in dhaka. lack of new and well-connected roads, good transport services and the influx of people in dhaka city are the main reasons of traffic jam. on the other hand, nobody follows the traffic rules and consequently creates traffic jam.
higher education
education is the backbone of a nation. a country cannot make progress without educated and knowledgeable citizens. knowledge is the most important capital of any society and hence the success of any society lies in harnessing it. at present there are 27 public universities, 54 private universities, 14 public medical colleges and 1 public medical university in bangladesh. but the quality of higher education of these institutions is below standard compared to our neighbouring countries like india. even it is observed that some private universities of our country are actually selling certificates to the students because their main motive is to earn money, rather than imparting proper education. however, a couple of leading private universities of our country are imparting world class education.

our journalists
nowadays we have a lot of national dailies as well as private tv and fm radio stations where a good number of journalists are working and performing their professional duties. it's true that journalism is a kind of profession where honesty, integrity, patience, courage are the top most priority and journalists need to exercise their professional duty without fear or favour. it's encouraging to note that most of the journalists of our country are honest with their profession and it's because of their sheer hard work and dedication that our leaders feel at least some degree of accountability while dealing with them.
medical service at school
schools in bangladesh lack adequate medical infrastructure/facilities, which can lead to loss of life. the increasing competition in class has led to high stress levels, and consequently students are falling prey to physical ailments such as vertigo and asthma. the concern is whether schools are prepared to handle such cases and provide first aid till the time the child is taken to a hospital.

the general
former army chief general moeen u ahmed, who was once an influential man in the post 1/11 political scene, is now again at the centre of parley since he has retired. as his term is over, disgruntled politicians both from the ruling party and opposition are challenging his activities during the two years of the army backed interim govt. during those two critical years, he appeared as a rescuer and reformer. now it is time to evaluate his work.
hajj guidebook
i performed hajj in december 2008. like many other organisations, dhaka ahsania mission published a guidebook on hajj and umrah. this guidebook has been extremely useful for the intending hajis. however, the guidebook has sketch maps of zannatul al'muala at makkah and zannatul al'baqi at madinah which are not accurate. it was my privilege to visit these graveyards of utmost importance. in these two graveyards lie our prophets, religious scholars as well as the family members of the greatest prophet muhammad (pbuh).

pollution
of course everyone knows little or much about pollution. but the question is how much conscious we are about this problem? .maybe, people think that only mills and factories cause pollution but in fact we also contribute greatly to pollution. of course the government has to take a tough and rapid decision to terminate this forever, especially water pollution. view the page international

the future of our campaign against corruption
"in any country where talent and virtue produce no advancement, money will be the national god. its inhabitants will either have to possess money or make others believe that they do. wealth will be the highest virtue, poverty the greatest vice. those who have money will display it in every imaginable way. if their ostentation does not exceed their fortune, all will be well. but if their ostentation does exceed their fortune they will ruin themselves. in such a country, the greatest fortunes will vanish in the twinkling of an eye. those who don't have money will ruin themselves with vain efforts to conceal their poverty. that is one kind of affluence: the outward sign of wealth for a small number, the mask of poverty for the majority, and a source of corruption for all."
-- diderot (french philosopher)
