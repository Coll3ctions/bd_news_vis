it is something of a heartbreak. the election that we have been so proud of and which earned wide international acclaim for being a massive demonstration of a people's right to franchise was not without a blemish after all. a tib survey covering 88 candidates for 29 december parliamentary election pronounces the message loud and clear: 87 percent spent on average tk 44 lakh to come out winner as against the stipulated ceiling of tk 15 lakh. just how fiercely competitive the money spending spree got is exemplified by a single candidate spending tk 2.81 crore. thirteen percent that kept within the expenditure limit were all defeated.

offsetting recession fallout
the global financial crisis has generated a lively debate in bangladesh. at the initial stage the debate centred on whether bangladesh was insulated from the crisis. many argued that bangladesh was safe, as it did not have any connection with the toxic assets that caused the turmoil. this was rather naive because in the modern inter-connected world economies are inter-dependent in a variety of ways including through trade, capital flows, tourism, and remittances. thankfully this debate is now over as evidence of slowdown in growth of export earnings and remittances along with further evidence that these trends will likely become worse in 2009 have convinced all that the adverse effects are real and may last for sometime. at the least 2009 will be a very difficult year for all countries including bangladesh and this may even spill over into much of 2010. so, the debate has now shifted to what needs to be done to address the difficulties caused by the global crisis.

saint martin's island
as the only coral island of bangladesh, i can understand the interest it draws from us bangladeshis. but do we have to go for the overkill and ruin it in the process?
car parking
the parking of automobiles is clearly a wasteful use of road space, but the alternativesproviding all off-street parkingis a wasteful use of other resources. a compromise is thus needed to improve the efficiency of road space without inflicting inordinate costs on society in terms of paying for off-street parking.
landlords' decree
the fixed income city dwellers comprising both middle and lower middle class households are in real trouble to tackle the rising house rent in the country. most landlords, in the recent years, have increased their rentals on the plea of increase in prices of the essential commodities, construction materials, holding tax and cost of the utility services.
bcl and violence
on the issue of bcl violence, the editorial of 5th april asked: will it ever end? well, here is a financially viable, easily enforceable and the most accurate answer in the universe: to completely end all this violence, our political parties must dissolve all their student wings. or, we can beat around the bush and come up with all sorts of condemnations, suggestions, analyses and fancy articles. but that would all be pointless. we would simply be fooling ourselves, yet again.
rein the bcl in
being allured with the slogan "din bodoler sonod" we the young generation voted for this present government. after coming to power our prime minister announced that terrorism would be wiped out from our country. hearing this the nation became very optimistic but the prevailing hazardous situation, especially on the campuses , makes the nation pessimistic. what's going on on our campuses in the name of so-called student politics? on 31 march, we lost rajib in dhaka medical college. the nation has lost a doctor. we have seen clashes between two groups in shamsunnahar hall of du. it is a very awkward situation for the nation to see its female students engaged in political turmoil. if such a situation continues, very soon the nation will be in dire trouble.
traffic jam
thanks are due to mr. muffazel hossain who wrote an article of substance describing the ills of dhaka's traffic in ds of 26 march 2009. the options he has highlighted are constructive and feasible and should make a difference on dhaka's road very quickly, if implemented. a few more options that could be considered are:
muggers operating freely
i'm writing this on behalf of my father who is a service holder at petrobangla, dhaka. at around 10:00pm, he was coming from gabtoli bus stand to banani road no 2 by a cng baby taxi. the cng driver's appearance was harmless, so my father thought he would go home safely. but he was wrong. the cng driver stopped his baby taxi twice on the way.
chartered accountancy
accounts are the language/blood of business. not only the business houses, non-trading organisations also need to maintain accounts. but as the world of business and organisation is expanding and involving more and more complicated situations, the academic accountants (b.com, m.com) cannot cope with it.
nuclear power plant
lots of talks are going around about building a nuclear power plant. several countries are interested, as i understand from the news. our bureaucrats are running fast with this prestigious project and as usual i'm afraid they are going to make a deal which will be a losing one for us. there are experts and professors who are dealing with it, but do they have any professional experience? i don't think so. you can't run a nuclear power plant theoretically (none of other industries either). a simple example is the placing of the power plant. what i know from the news, they are talking about the old proposal of ruppur. but the basic rule for a nuclear power plant is its safety and that can't be located in a place where surroundings are densely populated. the second thing is the cooling system and availability of water supply. i don't think ruppur fulfils any of them. these are only a few examples and there are many more.
arab leaders' empty show
the doha press report, published in most dailies on march 29, was an empty talk show of arab leaders without any substance. most of these leaders are dynastic despots, governing their subjects by might, rather than any right, by and large more autocratic than democratic!
why?
news published on 23.03.09: "amid mounting pressure from the government, vice-chancellor(vc) of bangabandhu sheikh mujib medical university(bsmmu) and its three senior officials resigned yesterday".
private residence in cantonment
the issue will generate a lot of political tension now. i hope the pm was quite aware of the political reaction from different quarters, especially from the well-wishers of begum zia and the bnp. we heard a university professor giving his view point from legal perspective and human emotion attached to it. i think it is also necessary to analyse the statement of the pm in parliament. she has raised a question about the legal process adopted in giving the house to the bnp chairperson by the then government of president ershad. the pm has made an appeal to the chairperson to handover the house to the cantonment board, not necessarily any counter legal action to force her to leave the place. view the page international
