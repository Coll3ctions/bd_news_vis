the heritage of ekushey
every observance of ekushey is a remembrance of the young men who made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the bangla language this day in february 1952. they did so in order for all of us to be free to speak in that language. it is thus that we pay tribute to salam, jabbar, barkat, rafiq and all those others who scaled the heights of martyrdom and in doing so left us all a legacy that we were to consistently build on. in the broader sense of the meaning, therefore, every observance of ekushey is a recapitulation of the story of men who made the first of many sacrifices in the larger interest of the bengali nation culminating in the emergence of independent bangladesh through a determined, spirited war of liberation in 1971.
verdict for change in pakistan

we don't want a let off commission
we understand that the "truth commission" (albeit under a new name -- it is good that the government has thought it fit to abandon the idea of naming it truth commission) is all but ready to be delivered to the people, whose aim it will be -- from as much as we can glean from whatever is available to the public so far (very little is made known to the public and, apparently, there is no intention on the part of the caretaker government to elicit public opinion on such an important issue either) about its substance -- to deliver the incarcerated businessmen, which will, in turn, hopefully, deliver the country from the clutches of the business syndicate.
a day of mourning, reflection and action
february 21 is a day of national mourning, reflection and action. it is the language martyrs' day. it was fifty-six years ago that, among others, barkat, rafiq, jabbar, shafiur and salam sacrificed their lives for the honour and preservation of our mother language, bangla.
the end of conservatism
conservatives are a gloomy bunch at the moment. many believe that their party -- the republican party -- has lost its way and that it has done so by abandoning its principles. aside from his foreign policy and supreme court appointments, conservatives find little to love about george w. bush. his signature domestic policies include a vast expansion of government-financed health care (prescription-drug benefits), and increased funding for education while halfheartedly promoting vouchers and school choice. bush also signed into law campaign-finance reform and supported a proposed immigration bill that would have allowed illegal aliens a path to citizenship. the republican congress is even worse, having indulged in an orgy of irresponsible spending. and now the party is set to nominate john mccain as its presidential nominee, a man who on several key issues has broken with republican orthodoxy and voted with democrats. for conservatives, a return to principles is the only way to be returned to power. view the page sports
