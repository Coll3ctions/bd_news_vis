musharraf's plan
ref: usa being misunderstood on pakistan.
cyclone and role of media
on 29 april, 1991, 'cyclone gorky' struck the southeast coast of bangladesh. the cyclone's wrath was immense, and over 140,000 people lost their lives as a result of its fury; millions of others lost their homes and their livelihoods.
pakistan and india
as it is known, india is ill-focused on pakistan and does not think well of it. even though “cross-border-terrorism” has been replaced by president gen. musharraf with “cross-border-trade”, in practical terms, india hasn't changed its ill-feeling towards it neighbour. recent developments in pakistan have caused nerve problem in new delhi.
are we still united?
it was an incident which took place a few days ago. i was coming back from my university on a bus which was quite crowded as usual. we were waiting in a traffic signal as well as several vehicles including a big old pick-up carrying a big load of books just beside our bus. two men where sitting on top of the books. suddenly, when the green light appeared the pickup turned to the right side and the part which was carrying the book fell down resulting in all the books being allover the street. the fist guy was able to jump out of the mess but the second guy couldn't make that much. so he was under the burden of thousands of books. as we were right beside them, i thought we were going to run over on the second guy. i closed my eyes, but our driver was quite witty and managed to pull over. our bus stopped there and all the people from our bus were struggling with each other to have a better look of the accident from the bus. i saw the traffic police and few local people rushed down to help the guy but as it were thousands of books they were not able to help the guy at all. to my surprise, no one from our bus came down and helped the guy, all were staring at the scene, as if it were a movie shooting. there were at least 50 men in the bus and nobody cared a bit. then after a few moments, the driver drove away.
mobile phone and our youth

marrying a foreigner
surely, marrying a foreigner cannot be prohibited on moral grounds. however, carrying out government or diplomatic service while being married to a foreigner does provide problems of possible compromise of national interest and hence there are stringent rules in this area. the solution seems to be for the foreign national to give up his/her foreign nationality and become a bangladesh citizen by due process of law which surely must exist somewhere in bangladesh constitution and legal framework.
"empowerment of local bodies"
this refers to your editorial “empowerment of local bodies” (16 nov 2007) and your support and plea for setting up a three-tier local institution in the form of zila, upazila and union parishad. i beg to disagree with you and suggest that our union parishad be re-organised and real administrative power given to this grassroots level tier of local government.

electoral roll and non-resident bangladeshis
including non-resident bangladeshis (nrb) on the electoral roll has become a controversial issue ever since the election commission (ec) was reconstituted after 1/11. the debate has been recently rekindled following the visit of two members of the ec to uk. this controversy seems to have originated mainly from the lack of understanding of our constitutional law. thus, my main objective here is to clarify the constitutional nature of the election issue. hopefully, this will help us keep our eyes on the ball and help resolve this critical constitutional issue.
hurricane horrors
the terrible destruction wrought by sidr, that struck southwest bangladesh, has exposed the high level of poverty and risky life-style of those living in these areas. provision of support and succor to those who have lost so much is ongoing, and the well-organised efforts of bangladesh to provide support will be successful. building up the logistics links takes time. just listing what has to be done is exhausting:

next move?
the return, on a special plane provided by the king of saudi arabia, of former prime minister nawaz sharif to a popular welcome after seven years of exile serves as a reminder of the folly that is military intervention in politics. mr. sharif should have been allowed to return to his homeland when the supreme court ruled that he had an inalienable right to do so. but soon after the supreme court's judgement, the government unlawfully bundled mr. sharif out of the country. view the page star city
