bnp on govt's role in copenhagen
we cannot but help being surprised at bangladesh nationalist party (bnp)'s statement on what it termed 'complete failure' of the government to project bangladesh's case at the un climate summit and its inability to utilise the opportunity of leading vulnerable and least developed countries in copenhagen. such a reaction not only reveals a lack of information but also reflects a lack of basic understanding of what went on in the climate conference; indeed, what was the climactic inter-play of international diplomatic currents and cross-currents that shaped the final outcome as it emerged.

woman rebel: silu's story
this past october, the short documentary woman rebel by 25-year old director, producer and photographer kiran deol was short-listed for the oscars (otherwise known as the academy awards here in the united states). this is an outstanding achievement for a young south-asian american woman, who only graduated from harvard university in 2005. (there will be a second round of voting in february to decide the final nominations; out of eight short-listed documentaries, five will get the nomination.) the day after her graduation in 2005, deol left cambridge, massachusetts, and got on a plane to nepal to film her documentary. deol wrote her creative honours thesis about a female nepalese soldier, as a novel on the advice of jamaica kincaid, the acclaimed antiguan novelist who teaches fiction writing at harvard. this creative writing project formed the basis of inspiration for her endeavour: from extensive fund-raising and with help and support from her friends and family, deol began her next, more difficult journey, alone, to nepal to fulfill her dream. deol's story, as much as her film, is extraordinary. she says her south asian roots, along with her passion to tell the truth, kept her connected with issues of women in this distant, remote area of the world. she has always been interested in exploring the plight of third world women and their position in oppressed societies. upon arrival in nepal, deol wrote the screenplay and started filming.

history, with all the facts . . .
abdul matin's interest in history and in bangladesh has never wavered. as an expatriate, he has found little reason not to reflect on what has been happening in the home country he left long ago to make a home in the west. from the distance of london he has, with something of determination and with a huge deal of principle, focused on the need to set the history of bangladesh in the proper perspective. that matin was on his way to being a commentator on bangladesh came through as far back as the early 1970s, when he ventured into a work that was to emerge as geneva-e bangabandhu. he has come a long way since then. and in all the works he has come forth with thus far, matin has deemed it refreshingly necessary to play by the rules. and that has consisted in adding to the substance of his works through bringing documentary evidence into it.
