since george w. bush came to power in 2001, the relationship between iran and the united states have plummeted to a new low. on january 29, 2002, president bush gave his “axis of evil' speech, describing iran along with north korea and saddam hussein of iraq as an axis of evil and warning that the proliferation of long-range missiles developed by these countries were of great danger to the us and that it constituted terrorism. the speech caused outrage in iran and was condemned by both reformists and conservatives.
the systemic fault in politics must go
the political parties should thank the election commission for persistently prodding the government to allow some sort of dialogue. as the country is yet to recover from repeated natural calamities, underperforming economy and restive campus, one must appreciate that it is a bold decision to allow indoor political parley. if politicians could trust and respect each other and follow the rules, there would have been no need for restrictions, much less for reforms. the institution of the caretaker government (ctg) is unique in a sense that it is an acceptance of unreliability of politicians by themselves. without being cynical one must concede that the ctg is the outcome of failed politics. call for reforms is not a political issue but moral challenge to the nation; b. a. choudhury is right to demand a national government and a decade to weed out the dirty culture: but he also knows the old faces are no more acceptable to the people.
joint us marines-baf air exercise
a joint exercise between us marines and the bangladesh air force (baf) commenced from wednesday last and continued for a week. this is by far, the largest joint exercise with us defence forces since starting of such operations in 1990. the exercise will provide valuable training for aircrew and maintenance personnel. such operation will enable the us marines and baf participants to sharpen air combat skills, improve procedures for sustained operations, as well as promote closer relations and enhance interoperability. it complements a number of other exchanges and exercises intended to develop closer defense ties between the us and bangladesh. one of the aims of this type of operations is to optimize and develop necessary standardized procedures for the interoperability - that is to say, the possibility for common, trouble free deployment. view the page star books review
transiting from a nation to a nation-state
the fourth edition of emergence of a new nation in a multi-polar world: bangladesh is made up of two distinct parts: the original text, made up of seven chapters, and an addendum, consisting of the remaining three. although the author informs us that it is revised and enlarged, the reader could only be sure about the expanded portion, but not about exactly where the revision has taken place. the introduction to the latest edition offers no clue, although it does say that it “contains new chapters on the various global, regional and national developments that have occurred since the 1970's.”
the bengali brigadier in pakistan's army
the war of 1971 remains a point of reference for bengalis, especially those with first hand experience of the conflict as it built up and then moved towards a denouement. with men like khalilur rahman, the war of liberation was at once a distant affair, fundamentally because they were away in west pakistan when the pakistan army launched its genocide in occupied bangladesh in march. and yet there was a closeness, in spirit and temperament at least, where comprehending the issues involved was concerned. rahman was a senior bengali officer, a brigadier, in the pakistan army and stationed in west pakistan at the time. it certainly was not the best of times or the best of places for any bengali to be in. like rahman, there were hundreds of other bengali officers and sepoys stuck in a place from where all the salvoes were being fired at their compatriots in occupied bangladesh. and then there were the thousands of civilian officials, employees and their families stranded in what was definitely hostile territory for bengalis. briefly, west pakistan after march 1971 was a place where bengalis were treated with open disdain and, almost always, as traitors to the country jinnah had built in 1947.
from partition to bollywood movies
vikram chandra's massive novel (as long as tolstoy's war and peace) is not only an extraordinary narrative but also a brilliant commentary on india's underworld of crime and international intrigue, mostly during the past dozen yearsin short, unforgettable. if you pick up the book, you'd better be prepared for a long haulnot simply reading for a couple of nights. fortunately, given its length and the dozens of significant characters, chandra has provided a "dramatis personae" at the beginning, which you can flip back to and use to place a character into context.
chronicles of love
they stood facing each other, looking into each other's eyes. the eyes held still, they seemed to forget even to blink. they saw beyond the eyes, they recognised each other as the ideal soulmates meant to be together on the wheel of eternity. they had a vision of a long winding road on which they were walking, hand in hand, walking towards a bright light; the light of a new life.

this happens to be a highly readable book from one who has been closely involved with bangladesh's economic planning in the country's early stages. indeed, islam was one of the leading proponents of economic autonomy for east pakistan in the 1960s. that background should be good enough for readers to get their hands on the work.
