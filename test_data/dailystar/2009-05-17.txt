threat from religious extremists

hc guidelines on sexual harassment
the move by the high court last week to lay down a number of guidelines for the authorities to prevent sexual harassment of women is surely a milestone in bangladesh's legal history. it has long been known, and publicly pointed out, that women in a very large number of instances and in very many professional and other areas have been subjected to such harassment over the years without any measures being put in place to help them deal with the problem. now that the hc has acted, thanks to a public litigation writ petition filed by the bangladesh national women lawyers association (bnwla), we can be reasonably sure that concrete steps will be taken to ensure the security of women in their work and movement, that indeed women will be empowered to take such action as will bring the perpetrators of the crime to book.

environment issue
bangladesh has been largely preoccupied with managing moderate economic development, starting from a very low base, with an aim to provide basic necessities to the population. poverty is still the main issue and will remain so for many years to come, given the moderately high population growth rate, limited land resources and periodic natural calamities such as flooding and cyclone damage. to put environmental concerns into perspective, the average life expectancy in bangladesh is still only 51 years, and more than 70% of the adult population is illiterate. in rural areas, the environmental conditions have been impacted more by natural causes than by economic developments. although the land is intensively cultivated, the land-use patterns have existed for many generations. in the urban areas, however, industrial and residential development has more serious environmental impacts in localized areas. the major concerns are poor solid waste management, effluent treatment and related health problems. except in central dhaka, air pollution is not a serious problem. the level of industrial development is still limited and comprises only 16% of gdp, compared to 26% in pakistan and 42% in china, and the physical conditions tend to disperse and absorb the present low level of emissions. though the environment may not be considered a priority concern in bangladesh, some important environmental issues should already be considered to include deteriorating urban environmental conditions, threat of global warming and rising sea level, protection of sensitive environmental habitat. for the poor, living conditions in urban areas are worse than in rural areas, since housing, access to safe water, food supply and nutrition are at low levels. urban waste dumps and effluent discharging into stagnant bodies of water already present serious health conditions for the urban poor. at present, and again with the exception of central dhaka, bangladesh is less concerned about acid rain and air pollution. regarding c02- bangladesh is very worried about the implications of climatic warming and rising sea levels.

nsu incident
from tv channels and newspapers i came to know that a 'revolt' took place at nsu, following the increase of tuition fees. indeed, it is a matter of great concern for me and other students who are studying at private universities. sorry, nowadays, it is no longer a concern of private university students alone, rather the students of public universities are also suffering.
remittance growth slows
inward remittance by wage earners for the current fiscal period is expected to touch the figure of us$ 10 billion. the figure is considered to be huge for an economy like bangladesh. despite its enormous impact on economy, there arises a question concerning its proper and productive utilization. available records speak that this huge amount is only supporting the payment of import bills for the goods/commodities that can never be called essential or productive.
nuclear power
i cannot believe that so many scholars and eminent persons are so far removed from the realities of industrial plants in bangladesh as to recommend this as a viable option. the health risks associated with inappropriately managed nuclear waste are long-lasting and manifold. in a country where basic safety standards in any industry are a joke, and public understanding of the need for such standards is nearly nil, how dare these people compare our situation to highly industrialized, educated and socially empowered societies like south korea or japan. nor is the landscape of densely populated, low-lying bangladesh anything like the areas in india and pakistan where their nuclear plants are located. this is not just about economics, this is about geography, health and safety, and governance. nuclear power is not for everyone or every part of the globe. how dare these people try to sway the public with such sweeping, ignorant remarks.
story of a freedom fighter
the winter white light fell on the pale figure standing next to a corner of the shabby house. those dark, brown eyes penetrated the core of my heart and as i looked at him, his eyes reflected nothing but memories trapped in another dimension. i wondered how this man once fought fiercely with the pak hanadar bahini.
second padma bridge
as our country is criss-crossed by numerous rivers, we need many bridges, no doubt. but building bridges over big rivers like jamuna, padma, meghna etc are not an easy task for a country like bangladesh. again it is not impossible at all in this age when financial and other assistance can be obtained from friendly countries and different agencies /organisations, if proper steps are taken at the right time. we built one of the biggest bridges in the world over jamuna a decade ago. the present government is going to start the work of the first padma bridge at mawa point very soon. they also have committed themselves to starting the work of the second padma bridge at paturia-daulidia point simultaneously. we think it is possible to undertake construction of both the bridges at a time. if that is impossible, paper works along with land acquisition etc i.e. all pre-construction works can be completed during the construction period of the first padma bridge. after that the actual construction of the second padma bridge can be started.
