why is countdown so important?
a countdown is loudly counting in reverse from 10 to 1, prior to an event. in a rocket launch, a countdown is a carefully devised set of procedures ending with the ignition of a rocket engine, which starts 72 to 96 hours prior to its launch time. during the countdown, step-by-step procedures like placing the vehicle at the launch site, loading the essentials needed for the launch, setting up communication with the launch centre, etc are executed. when everything is okayed, 't minus time', that is, 3 minutes and 40 seconds is set and the process of ignition begins.
super energy bank
scientists at the u.s. department of energy's brookhaven national laboratory have helped to uncover the nanoscale structure of a novel form of carbon, contributing to an explanation of why this new material acts like a super-absorbent sponge when it comes to soaking up electric charge. the material, which was recently created at the university of texas -- austin, can be incorporated into "supercapacitor" energy-storage devices with remarkably high storage capacity while retaining other attractive attributes such as superfast energy release, quick recharge time, and a lifetime of at least 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.
insect brain
the brain is a coding machine: it translates physical inputs from the world into visual, olfactory, auditory, tactile perceptions via the mysterious language of its nerve cells and the networks which they form. neural codes could in principle take many forms, but in regions forming bottlenecks for information flow (e.g., the optic nerve) or in areas important for memory, sparse codes are highly desirable.
