freedom to write
the energy of literary art emanates from the imagination's willingness to journey into places where many would not go. a writer soars and dives, intrudes and clamours, opens windows and widens horizons, creates perspectives and often acts as an anarchist. he can be an irritant to those who are content with the status quo, and perhaps a danger to those whose insularity is threatened. a writer must always be ready to fight against the singularity of a way of life and champion the plurality of what is possible. the art of writing cannot be nourished in an incubator of smug certainty. i would like to think that contemporary writers are receptive to new ideas, that we have been influenced by significant areas of knowledge which have evolved over the past hundred years or so and shaken, if not radically altered, ossified beliefs. for instance, i am particularly curious about the influence of quantum mechanics on our thinking. to be more specific, to what extent has werner heisenberg's the uncertainty principle made us sceptical about absolutism? philosophical truth is a matter of perception and perspective and the morality of an artist can only be judged by the honesty with which he responds to his imagination.
fiery intensity, a flowing sweetness
when i picked up hari kunzru's new novel my revolutions (new delhi: penguin book; 2007) the cover focused on a woman with oversized sunglasses, her right fist raised high, other faces and fists behind her -- i was immediately intrigued. here was a novel about the sixties from an author who wasn't born until 1969. what story did kunzru want to tell?

small states and how they worry about security
any serious undertaking on security-related issues in any part of the globe should arouse the interest of specialists on the subject matter, as well as most ardent enthusiasts. mohd. aminul karim, a senior army officer on active duty, through nine essays composed over an eleven-year period, from 1995 to 2006, adds to the considerable literature already existing on the topic of security. he limits his geographic attention to the asia-pacific region, with particular emphasis on the security-related concerns of bangladesh. for the record, the nine discourses, which have either been published in journals, or presented at conferences, are, in order of their presentation: “bangladesh's dilemma between traditional security and development issues in the regional environment”, “american geopolitics in the asia-pacific”, “nuclear doctrines of indo-pakistan: a comparative analysis”, “power politics in the indian ocean region after the cold war”, “national security of bangladesh: a comprehensive view”, “geostrategic environment of bangladesh”, “civil-military relations in bangladesh: a perspective”, “higher defence organization: a bangladesh perspective”, and “bureaucracy and civil society in the reform process of bangladesh”.
names, against a background
in the present-day world there is a deep interest in the study of muslim names due to the resurgence of islam throughout the world. a special characteristic of the muslim community is that its members share similar names, whether they live in bangladesh or in the middle east. muslims have a preference for names associated with one of the ninety-nine names of allah. both 'muhammad' and 'ahmed' are also familiar muslim names. a muslim is pleased to find his or her name, or a derivative of it, mentioned in the qur'an or that it bears the name of a well-known sahabi of the prophet of islam.
