sound pollution -- a severe health hazard
level of sound pollution (also termed as noise pollution) in dhaka city is now a major concern for the general people because it has already exceeded the tolerance level. because of this sound or noise pollution millions of people in the country are exposed to a number of health risks -- from deafness to heart attack. on city streets noise pollution can be caused by hydraulic horns of vehicles (the most harmful offenders), microphones and cassette players. the hydraulic horns used by buses, trucks and taxies in the crowded city streets are dangerous for human being. this is also how noise pollution in dhaka city is affecting the hearing power of thousands of children everyday. noise intensity is measured in decibel (db) units. at 45 db of noise the average person generally cannot sleep. at 120 db the ear registers pain; hearing damage begins at a much lower level, about 85 db. experts say, if a child below three years of age hears a horn emitting 100 db of noise from a close range, he or she might lose his or her hearing power. a child's health may also be adversely affected by loud sounds from the radio, television, cassette players and, not speak of, microphones, also the sound of mills and factories and any loud noise.

manik bandhapadya's short stories
this is the centenary birth year of manik bandopadhay. he was born on 19 may 1908 in a small town called dumka in bihar. writing came to him by accident. the story is that when he was a student at presidency college, during an adda in the college canteen, a friend dared him to publish a story in bichitra , at that time a well-known kolkata publication that published only the best of writers and writings. he took up the dare and put in a story in the editor's box. he signed it off as 'manik' (his nickname) bandopadhyay. the story, named 'atashimami, ' was published, it created a stir, and at age twenty manik bandopadhyay was well launched on his literary career. from now on he would live solely on the earnings from his writing--in fact, in true marxist fashion he famously said that a writer was a “pen-wielding labourer” who must be paid for his labour. it was a courageous decision to take, since writing was an ill-paid job in his time, and is sadly reflected in the fact that manik bandopadhyay died prematurely in 1956, barely forty-eight years old, dogged by penury and ill-health.

us mission in afghanistan: doomed?
president bush's decision in 2003 to attack iraq, leaving the mission in afghanistan incomplete, and the country's history are combining to produce the same results as the soviet invasion in the backdrop of a resurgent taliban and militancy that has risen alarmingly in recent times. the gloomy scenario has been brought into international attention by the ambassadors of great britain and russia in kabul.
durand line-the hot spot
when the british left india in 1947, it left two contested borders, pakistan-afghanistan border-the durrand line, and india-chinese border, the mcmahon line. observers believe that one of the most explosive spots on earth today is the so-called durand line, the 2640 kilometre border, much of it in harsh mountain country, between afghanistan and pakistan. this is where the united states and its nato allies are battling the taleban and are facing the possibility of military defeat. the durand line was established by the british. it was demarcated and then signed into a treaty on november 12, 1893 between the ruler of afghanistan, amir abdul rahman khan, and sir mortimer durand, foreign secretary of what was then british india. the idea was to create a buffer zone to protect british india from possible czarist russian aggression in what was then the 'great game' between the british and russian empires as the nobel laureate kipling described it. when british india was partitioned between india and pakistan in 1947, the durand line became the pakistan-afghan border. successive afghan rulers repudiated the durand line as the border with pakistan. there was a demand in the past by afghan rulers to set up an independent pakhtoonistan state of pashtun people. because of the non-recognition of the durrand line as the international boundary, afghanistan in 1947 voted against the admission of pakistan in the un. even hamid karzai, afghanistan's current president, has called the durand line a “line of hate” because by cutting through tribal lands it artificially divides the pashtun people, whom kabul would like to claim as afghans.

ruins of old courage and lore of old hope
this novel by marilynne robinson, which won the pulitzer prize in 2005, is a first person narrative written in the form of a communiqué from an aged father to his very young son, whose adulthood he does not expect to see because of his advanced years. the novel is set in the in the american midwest, in a small town bordering the vast prairie area which is both a landscape and a condition that colours the attitudes and responses of the characters in it. it is not a novel in the epistolary or letter form, yet the text divided into sections, which purportedly have been written over many days, addresses the boy, a child of seven, in an attempt to leave not only a memoir of his parent but also to explain and perhaps justify the life that that father has lived, a testament that he hopes the child will read when he is an adult. the intimate, contemplative, often introspective, tone of the book makes the reader almost an accidental bystander, even an eavesdropper.

the power of the word
there is always something stirring about speeches, especially when they have the soul soar in every possible way. think of abraham lincoln's gettysburg address. it is a simple collection of words and yet it has resonated with generations across the world and time. 'four score and seven years ago . . .' who has not recalled these famous opening lines? there was, long before lincoln, demosthenes with his 'i have always made common cause with the people'. demosthenes was an orator, in the way that pericles was. oliver cromwell was slightly different, but when his indignation threw up in 1653 that famous reprimand to parliament, he went into the history books. 'in the name of god, go!' --- and they all scampered off. puritanism was finally in place.
