diplomatic failure in kuwait
we strongly condemn the tyranny unleashed by the kuwait authorities on the workers of bangladesh who have been deprived of their legitimate remunerations and other benefits by the employers there. they simply gave vent to their anguish and agony suffered at the hands of the employers in kuwait for long and certainly did not deserve to be treated like beasts who have been beaten mercilessly by the kuwait police in captivity. these workers have been subjected to inhuman torture by their employers right under the nose of the kuwait authorities and perhaps at their behest. it is, therefore, everybody's right to protest against injustice which actually the bangladeshi workers did. any protest against injustice is called “jehad” in islam. it is highly unfortunate that instead of addressing their legitimate grievances, the authorities there maltreated and sent them back home without any payment even. most of them could not bring their personal belongings even. our prophet (sm) had instructed, “pay the wages of labour before drying up of his sweat”, whereas the wages of these workers were either not paid or paid partially in violation of contract. in islam honouring of any lawful contract by both the parties is binding on each other. there were reports that the maids hired in that country from various countries including bangladesh were treated like slaves and even were subject to sexual abuse ! so what kind of islamic law is pursued in that country?
powerless people
a new country was born in 1971 after a bloody war of nine months with a hope & dream that from then on the country would rise to the top step by step. it had been ruled by foreign invaders for 225 years-- two hundred years by the british and 25 years by pakistanis. it is very unfortunate for us to mention after long 37 years of independence that the hope has been shattered and the dream has become a nightmare. today is august 5, 2008 and in the last 24 hours there was no electricity in my area (pallabi) for 7 hours. that is, the electricity went off due to load shedding 7 times in 24 hours and each time for an hour. it may also be mentioned here that the electric supply during pick hours is not available.

earthquake
an earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy in the earth's crust that creates seismic waves. bangladesh is highly vulnerable to earthquakes. now we are facing many problems due to the vulnerability to earthquake. the causes of earthquake are as follows: most earthquakes are caused by the sudden slip of rock mass along geologic faults and fractures, the collisions between tectonic plates and increased pressure within the rock's crust that exceeds the strength of the rocks and the filling of reservoirs that may increase the stress in the earth's crust.
use of chemicals in foods
whenever i see pictures and read about the use of deadly chemicals on fruits by the growers and vendors to ripen and make their produce look attractive, taste better and to boost their production, i shudder. how can the government look away and not take appropriate, strong and quick steps to stem this diabolical practice of poisoning fruits and vegetables and cheating the public to buy them? this is a horrendous case of systematic destruction of society. the authorities have the knowledge of how bad is the effect on the consumers and how serious this despicable act is, but, they are not doing enough to save the consumers and protect them from the evil of these people who have no conscience and behave without compunction. they are horrible elements whose only aim in life is to extract maximum profit even if society has to suffer and pay an enormous price. this is destroying the vitality and vibrancy of the society affecting the younger generation more, in a way, which is irreversible. these elements are slowly and sneakily destroying us. we have to do something and not let it go on unpunished and unchecked. these sinister people are holding us hostage, doling out their goods and forcing us to eat because we have no choice as apparently every item you buy is affected, though the sellers will vouch their merchandise is clean and pure.
it education
information technology is not only an integral component of modern civilization but also a vehicle that helps our dreams come true. the whole world is now a village owing to the effective use of it. the development of every sector in the world is based on it. in the age of it excellence, we cannot afford to lag behind because it has the potential to promote economic growth and can facilitate the integration of bangladesh into the global economy. i believe, like all of you, that proper use of it can contribute actively to our national development.
emergency and election
it is clear, at least after the recent mayoral elections, that the caretaker government intends to hold the general election without lifting the state of emergency. this intention, till now, is opposed quite strongly by both 14-party and 4-party alliances. yet, the persistence of the caretaker government with this particular agenda is creating confusion among the politically conscious citizens regarding the motive behind it. legally, holding elections under the state of emergency is unheard of. in theory, the state of emergency refers to a situation where a citizen's basic civil and political rights are curtailed and the fundamental rights of people are re-established only when the emergency is withdrawn. therefore, the coexistence of emergency and election is in essence contradictory. however, if the government intends to legalize such exercise through finding small loopholes in our legal framework then one cannot stop them from doing so. but, as citizens we still want to know the logic behind the caretaker government's persistence with this particular agenda. the government's clarification on this issue is important since it will help create a consensus among the political parties which is needed for political stability. if the government has a practical reason which is fuelling their desire to hold elections while maintaining the state of emergency, then they need to discuss their point with the political parties and civil society and create a socio-political consensus regarding this issue. otherwise, all the elections conducted by this caretaker government will be questioned by political quarters, and this will not be good for us in the long run.
polls under emergency
from the news reports published in the dailies we have come to learn that the ec has claimed that emergency would ensure extra security.
obama and "change"...
much has been witnessed, much has been talked about in america and outside about the upcoming presidential elections. senator obama, the democratic candidate, has by now charmed his people and others across the globe with his magical and magnetic prowess in terms of outward and the inward manifestations of the much talked about "change". it is that magic that the americans are desperately looking for. it is indeed that hope of "change" in american policy that the people of the world are also looking for. we've seen, till date, that a black young, charismatic and flamboyant leader in obama that has already captured the mandate of the europeans (recent historic europe tour) is striking gold to be the first non-white american president. we'll see in future that america is being ruled by a woman president --- democracy has reached its peak there. now it all depends on the american people whether they will elect obama or not.
set the priorities right

not surprising…
he has said what he was supposed to say in line with his party's political culture. we were, in fact, expecting this reaction from the bnp (khaleda) before even the mayoral and municipal elections were held on 4 aug. so we were not surprised at all. khandaker delwar hossain has categorically said that the election was “patano nirbachon”. he blamed existence of emergency rules and termed this election as ctg's game-fixing election, although all the election observers including the foreigners have expressed satisfaction about the turnout, peaceful atmosphere and enthusiasm among the voters and finally peaceful voting. the bnp's own grassroots level leaders have congratulated the winners in front of the tv cameras, some were seen sharing sweets together with their rivals after conceding defeat. this is a rare scene which the bangladeshi people could see for the first time in 37 years.

letters
the letters column can be considered as the comic relief from the serious reports on current affairs like local polls, graft cases, corruption cases, arrest and bail, and violence or nightmare. generally, most of the pages deal with merely happenings, while the letters column is covering a wide variety of themes as mr. s.a. mansoor points out. he is absolutely right as we readers are tired of observing the same type of reports every day. many reports are being printed on contemporary national and international issues. most of them are very conventional which are already known to the readers. these dimensionless and casual reports are not capable of sharing views or ideas but merely repeat the information cycles. view the page international
