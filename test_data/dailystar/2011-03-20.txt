repatriation hampered
the appeal by the international organisation for migration (iom) and unhcr for international assistance in repatriating thousands of foreigners fleeing libya is the biggest sign of what governments can yet do to help captive citizens. the situation is particularly difficult for the thousands of bangladeshis who remain stranded on the frontier between libya and tunisia, a condition that looks likely to continue now that the iom has run out of funds. while one expects the international community to come forward, and quickly with emergency funds, one also believes that governments such as bangladesh's should be doing a whole lot more to help their own people out of the crisis.

weekly currency roundup
march 13th-march 16th, 2011
international markets
this week the international fx markets were deeply affected by the earthquake in japan. the yen strengthened significantly on the back of strong anticipated repatriation by japanese investors and a spike in risk aversion. the yen steadied around a four-month high versus the dollar on wednesday, but japan's nuclear crisis could trigger more yen demand versus higher risk currencies, raising the prospect of intervention to stem gains. the dollar traded at 80.70 yen, just above a four-month low of 80.60 yen hit on monday. higher risk aversion could push up the yen, on speculation japanese financial institutions will repatriate funds to japan and on renewed selling of higher risk currencies, although the dollar's record low of 79.75 yen looms. since a massive earthquake and tsunami hit japan on friday, the yen has risen, partly on market speculation that japanese insurers and companies may repatriate funds to help pay claims and reconstruction costs. concerns the japanese authorities will intervene to weaken the yen have limited its upside so far. other "safe-haven" currencies including the dollar and the swiss franc were supported by ongoing uncertainty about the aftermath of japan's earthquake and political turmoil in the middle east and north africa. the dollar index rose 0.3 percent, while the swiss franc traded at 0.9166 francs per dollar, hovering in range of an all-time high hit on tuesday. the euro slipped 0.5 percent to having failed to break above a four-month high of $1.4036 hit earlier this month. market participants said offers to sell the euro lay above $1.40, keeping downward pressure on the single currency. local money market

resilient japanese
i stood dumbfounded watching on tv the severest temblor (8.9 on the richter scale) to hit japan during the past 140 years since it began keeping record of tremors.
commodity prices
the recent price hike has certainly irked the ruling party government. the general masses are also suffering a great deal for the upward surge of the commodity price. prices of oil and rice have already gone beyond the reach of the lower-middle class people of our country. the middle-class is also finding it difficult to keep pace with the market price of the daily necessaries. to curb this annoying problem, the government should reform the regulatory bodies to make them effective to supervise the market situation. the regulatory teams should also observe the market closely and calibrate price lists acceptable to both the customers and traders. creating a price list somehow or other has not been of any use. consumers' association of bangladesh, cab, should also play active roles to uphold the interest of the customers. as an average consumer has nearly no clout over the price of commodities, the government must take organized measures to regulate market prices and make the lives of civilians a little easier.
fatwa based killings
fatwa has now become an ugly word, as it is associated with the recent cruelty causing the death of a young girl, coming from a needy family. the excesses being carried out in the name of 'fatwa' pronounced by illiterate persons, whose knowledge of islamic thoughts and philosophy is often extremely scant, needs to be stopped!
marine environment & organic agriculture

france and italy should save libyans
any american intervention in libya will raise the accusation that the imperialist americans are trying to control libya's vast oil resources. as such, president barack obama has been wise not to intervene militarily, despite the libyan rebels are being slaughtered by gaddafi's african mercenaries. but if all other nations stand by, gaddafi will crush the opposition in the same way burma's military junta crushed the popular revolt in that asian country. as such, the international community will have to find a way out from this impasse. one solution will be to prod france and italy to send a joint military contingent to stop the massacre of libyans by gaddafi's forces. a joint franco-italian contingent will be enough to defeat gaddafi's mercenaries. once gaddafi is defeated, the united nations should organise a general election and help the country to build democratic institutions. this way, libya will be liberated without any american intervention.
libya scene
while the battles rage in libya, calls are growing on the international community to impose a no-fly zone to cripple gaddafi's air force, the reality is “there's a lot of, frankly, loose talk about some of these military options, and let's just call a spade a spade. a no-fly zone begins with an attack on libya to destroy the air defenses." (secretary of defense robert gates)
four hadiths
i often remember imam abu daud (r)--one of the six-purest hadith book writers--who took just four hadiths as the fundamental code of his life. the four hadiths are as follows:
taxing the people
i would rather like to term this action of the government as dacoity in broad day light. the party in power has imposed this arbitrary tax on the owners of motor vehicles of the country, which is on top of motor vehicle tax and fitness tax, saying that this tax would be adjusted at the time of submitting tax returns. the bnp government, did away with this tax, which was imposed by the party in power when it came to power the last time. this tax used to be tk.3, 000 now it has been raised to tk.8, 000 an increase by tk.5,000. the government is further contemplating to impose property tax on those who own property, which i believe is again going to be on top of all kinds of existing taxes that goes with the property.
bcs tragedy
“believe it or not, i qualified in the bcs examination not by reading but by leaking the question papers and by political connection. so i know a little english. throughout my student life i yielded weapons as a cadre so if you want to learn that, come to me” said one of the government college english teachers to the students without feeling any compunction. i personally know about many bcs cadres who find comfortable mixing with drunkards and miscreants rather than with the enlightened. then to confirm my conviction came the report-“a total of 3295 (20.11%) of candidates appearing at the 18th bcs examination (held in 1996-97) got zero in english, even though some of them qualified for bcs posts”.
it's not easy for us
the logical and sensible essay by quddus published on 22nd. february, along with his sincere advice to obama; is easier said than done! it expresses his thoughts on m-e liberty, but may not coincide with us ground realities. possibly, president obama is at a disadvantage, for taking a realistic and rational decision; for more reasons than one. middle east regimes are clearly either for or against usa; which will give all support for setting up democracy in syria; but will that hold true for saudi arabia?
ensure pure water
more than ten million people depend on water supplied by dhaka wasa. in dhaka, water for construction work, for washing, for bathing, for cooking food, for drinking is supplied by dhaka wasa. no one can lift water even from nature's gift underground without special permission from and charge given to wasa. it is a government enterprise and managed by a board that is formed by lgrd ministry. the bsti and directorate of environment of the government over look the phenomena of contaminated water supply by saydabad water treatment plant of wasa.
is it the power plants?
on 14th february the daily star carried a very pathetic picture - a woman is crying embracing her child. it reminds us about the poor victims of sidr and aila in our country. in fact, the recent earthquake of japan is terrible news for all asians. japan is very prone to natural disasters like earthquakes.
