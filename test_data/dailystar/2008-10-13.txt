for effective traffic management
against the backdrop of horrendous traffic congestions, what the suffering citizens want to see now is strict implementation of existing rules and regulations to bring discipline on the city roads. there is obvious lack of effective traffic management, which is causing congestions lasting hours together in the capital, every day from dawn to late evening, thereby making life and living next to impossible. the rush of vehicles that turns the roads into veritable traps for commuters also results in other fallouts, such as loss of valuable fuel and that of man-hours. surprisingly, it has been going on for years together but no relevant agency came forward to stop the slide.
square pegs in round holes?
only the flunkeys will deny the fact that the unusual caretaker dispensation of the day has failed to deliver. it's not for nothing that it has started drawing flak from the public who gave this government blanket support on its advent eighteen months ago amid great relief and rejoicing. there is no denying the fact that it made some waves with its anti-terror and anti-corruption drives. now, with the motives of those popular steps put to question, the redeeming works visibly coming to a naught, and the country's political forces gaining primacy irrespective of their past records and background, the credibility of the caretakers couldn't but plummet drastically.

colonial impact on education
the people who believe that we are free from every kind of colonial influence are not being realistic.
why this intolerance?
we know that since the beginning of the pakistani era, the act of breaking the images of the hindu goddesses and defiling their places of worship has been the favourite pastime of some people. it happened last year despite the rab deployment (we shall not talk about the years of the 4 party alliance rule when those acts were rampant) and it has happened this year.
free market economy
economists all around the world would agree that free market has become a cliché in today's world. today, free market is a blended version of capitalism's perfect market competition and government monitoring don't confuse that; we call it mixed economy. however, whenever a third world government plays regulatory role our "development partners" still mischievously use this concept as a tool to suggest that "laissez-faire"(which means market mechanism bypassing government participation) is the best way to go about operating market. "customer sovereignty", "better regional market balance" and "effectiveness of private capital management" --these are the very old pretexts that have been shown behind their prescriptions and not very surprisingly been duly carried out by our somewhat "spineless" governments of the third world (or more specifically ldcs) despite strong and spirited protest from local economists.
party registration
there is enough evidence in the news presented by the media today that the date of registration of the political parties would be extended. the next question is: whether the date of election would be refixed and extended by a couple of months. yes, the reason is the bnp. they have not found sufficient time to stabilize their party discipline until the chairperson was freed from custody. the "king's parties" are loudly asking for extension to rebuild their party strength and finalise the coalition partners. the comment of the al chief in london has indication of change in the election date.
what are they doing?
i am astonished to know that this year a renowned and about 300 years old festival is not going to be held. yes, i am talking about the “gurpukur mela” of satkhira. the reason is that some terrorists have threatened to stop it. so, my question is, what are the law enforcement agencies doing?
bnp's structure
i have gone through the letter "bnp's structure" in 22 september'08 issue written by dr jamir chowdhury. he has rightly pointed out the fallacy of democracy and governance issue.
religion and business
business houses and socio-political organisations are putting the "islamic sticker" with the name of their organisations. there is no reason that i can have reservation about their choice. i am looking for the rationale. i wonder what kind of thinking is there behind the idea. is it to add islamic value and practice into the operation of these organisations? or, this is just “religious consumerism” and promotional activity to attract more customers and reach the target customers of services in those fields ?
first debate
in the first presidential debate, mccain behaved like mr. knowall from the barracks -- overconfident and arrogant. obama looked powerful and presidential and yet more friendly and compromising.
the big two
no doubt, it will be a great achievement of the military-backed caretaker government if they succeed in bringing the two major parties to a dialogue in the greater interest of the nation.
zardari's comments
please allow me to voice my frustration over the much publicized promiscuous behaviour the pakistani president displayed during his meeting with the american vice-presidential hopeful sarah palin. if his personal remarks, unbecoming of a head of state, were not embarrassing enough for the pakistani community settled in america, most of us are dumbfounded over the spin his party is putting in his defence; e.g. it's considered as a compliment in us.

restaurants at cox's bazar

chinese products
the current chinese milk powder contamination is a serious blow to the trust on all chinese products! we in bangladesh must re-look for different sources, as we import many things from china. starting from plant and machinery to consumer goods, toys, medicines, processed food and many primary and semi-finished raw materials and primary and ready to use chemicals, paints etc. all these and many more items coming from china are now suspect.
one stop service
the service delivered at the one stop service at the passport office at agargaon is simply outstanding and deserves appreciation. there has been a significant improvement in the overall service.
“half the cabinet abroad”
what could be more important news for this impoverished nation than the above? how else to serve the nation better? what else could be the best way of spending our hard earned forex, primarily earned through the remittances of our expatriate poor labourers? coming to power our leaders get mad to visit foreign countries at state cost, not realising how dearly it costs the nation. the nation bleeds.
