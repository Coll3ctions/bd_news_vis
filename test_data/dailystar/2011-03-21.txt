action against gaddafi
libya is under armed attack from the united states, united kingdom and france. the action against tripoli, mandated by a un security council resolution, with significant abstentions has been taken to prevent the autocratic regime of muammar gaddafi from attacking and killing his own people, who have in these past few weeks made it clear that they want him out of power. for his part, gaddafi has not helped matters any by vowing to show no mercy to those who have risen against him. his chilling warning that his forces will conduct house to house and room to room searches to locate his opponents has only demonstrated the desperate straits his people are in.

changes underway
it is normal practice that the authorities concerned and the cricket pundits will all take a long look into their project every four years. when goals are set, they are usually with one time frame in mind; in this case from one world cup to another and accordingly a new plan and strategy will take place, so that one can go ahead with a new dream for their country.
test tigers with tests
some will say the world cup was a moderate success for bangladesh, while others will remember the global event for the ignominy of two sub-100 totals in the same tournament, an unfortunate feat that has been equalled only by namibia in their only tournament till date. the fact remains, however, that the cup is over, and the tigers have missed a golden opportunity to do something special in a world cup in front of their own crowds.

mediocrity rules, ok
another bubble burst again, the resounding crash as loud as the one heard when the stock market collapsed. but the two had so much in common; a total disregard by all and sundry stakeholders of the fundamentals of the stocks, and in the case of the significant other, our national cricket team. the meltdown was waiting to happen, if we had just cared to be a little more attentive we should have seen it coming a mile away. but impressionable millions chose either to ignore the signs or were simply incapable of distinguishing silly point from serious short leg. by piling on unwarranted expectations on themselves, the general public put themselves on board for a ride which transpired to be the biggest scam of them all. what it did provide in the end was an easy way out for the beleaguered captain of our side to pass the proverbial buck. pressure, did we hear him say? of course there was, and plenty of it. if the debacle is unacceptable, let us be man enough to admit it was as much a failure of countless millions to understand the true worth of this team, as it was for the players to have been so inept and incompetent at this level of the game.

the japan tragedy

this enmity must go
i read with interest the column 'this enmity must go' by mr. mohammad ali sattar. i have also written a number of articles on this subject. in my weekly column in 'janakontho' on tuesday on 8 march on stone- throwing at the bus carrying the west indies players, i made some brief references at the massive vandalism by some of our student's .at dhaka university campus three days earlier. i have also been watching with distress the reckless conduct of a section of our surface transport sector workers, all under the direct patronage of our shipping minister, who is at the same time the president of the transport workers. he condones, rather encourages, the transport workers to vandalize the brtc buses. he wants the brtc buses to stop operation so that the private bus owner can loot the helpless passengers without even the slightest of competition from any quarters, not even from railway either. about 10 months ago, this minister persuaded the communications minister to restrict the services of brtc buses in many places of the country. daily 'janakontho' published a long story on this subject only last 15 march in its first page. i consider these two ministers are working against the interests of the poor passengers, and all in the interest of the private bus owners. in an otherwise good piece mr.sattar have missed this point. thanks for the column all the same.
second-rate performance of our cricketers
in a sport there is always a win or defeat, but we don't expect our team to lose matches by huge margin. we, the bangladeshi cricket fans, find these two defeats against the west indies and south africa a hard pill to swallow. these two defeats were hugely upsetting for all the fans and it will take years for us to forget the painful memories. shakib al hasan should spend more time in cricket rather than talking big during interview sessions, and on many occasions he seemed over-confident. tamim played the most disappointing cricket and could never come up with big scores. in fact, his performance was awful. i hope jamie siddons will ponder on the performances of our cricketers and find out what exactly went wrong. but our bowlers did really well.
abandon nuke power plant project
recently, bangladesh signed an accord with russia to set up a nuclear power plant in rooppur. in view of the recent accidents (still uncontrolled) with the nuclear power plants in japan after the earthquake and tsunami, i suggest that the bangladesh government abandon the idea of setting up the plant because of the following reasons: firstly, bangladesh is in high risk of earthquake. secondly, we are not so technologically developed like japan to cope (still to be seen) with a similar situation. and thirdly, bangladesh is such a small country (radius hardly about 135 miles) that in case of such radiation hazard, people will not be able to move to safer places. as such we should stick to the other traditional methods of generating power.
discriminatory bcs quota system
after the result of 29th bcs has been published, the quota system has become the most talked about issue across the country. the question has arisen in our mind whether the present quota system is justified in the present context of the country where thousands of brilliant students are still unemployed. a meritorious student has to attend the exams twice or thrice to become a bcs cadre while less meritorious students are getting chance easily using quota facilities. this is injustice to the meritorious students. to build a powerful nation there is no alternative to merit. it is high time the present govt. started to think about the reshuffle of present quota system lowering it to 10 percent. i urge the people of all walks of life, especially the university students to raise their voice against this discriminatory quota system. the present govt. should look into the case with due attention.
no-fly zone over libya
it is unbelievable that the west is being prodded to enforce a no-fly zone over libya. this is an arab and an african issue. why are not the arabs and the africans enforcing it? it is not because they don't have the resources; it's the will that is missing! the arab league, the organisation of the islamic conference (oic), the gulf cooperation council (gcc) and african union are all lame duck organisations that provide high-profile jobs to favourites who will guarantee the security of their patrons and vested interests, not the interests of the ordinary citizen, the poor and the downtrodden. this is not a recent phenomenon. the palestine and kashmir issues are still burning!
a matter of great public interest
during the last days of the colonial period to prevent the water-logging of a large area of the then brahmanbaria sub-division, created due to siltation of the river titas, n.m. khan ics,sdo took the initiative to dig the anderson canal, named after the then governor of bengal. this saved a vast acreage of land from constant flooding, thereby enabling the people of the area to achieve great agricultural output.
dr. yunus' image
i think the best thing for dr. yunus would have been to resign even before all these so-called allegations were being conjured up by different organisations and politicians. i am sure he was not planning to run the bank as its' md into perpetuity. i am also sure if he has spent the last several decades in organising the grameen bank, then he has also structured it in such a way that it would run even without him.
role of islamic foundation
i don't see islamic foundation of bangladesh playing any role in removing misconceptions associated with islam or preventing torture in the name of religion. the foreign scholars are doing a much better job. i am ashamed of the fact that despite the existence of islamic foundation, we have to write letters/articles to clarify various islamic injunctions. the only time i see islamic foundation active is during shab-e-baraat with one day's elaborate plans of “righteousness.” how has this prevented the misuse of fatwa? islamic foundation of bangladesh should take up long-term projects to eliminate ignorance and produce good human beings.
attention: election commission
the up elections schedule has been announced on 24th february. but it is a matter of regret that many of us have not yet received the national id cards. we, the inhabitants of araihazar, are facing problems for this. our photos were taken in 2009. after that, 18 months have passed. but we have not got the id cards yet. can we vote without our id cards in the up elections? if not, then we urge the authorities to give our national id cards soon.
muslim women are everywhere
the idea that muslim women are oppressed is preposterous. there are 1.57 billion muslims. out of them, millions are women. are they all “oppressed”? if prophet muhammad (pbuh) wanted to subjugate women, why would he say “it is only the generous in character who is good to women, and only the evil one who insults them?” let us not forget that khadeejah, wife of the prophet (pbuh), was a successful businesswoman. jobs for women such as driving, encouraged by islam ages back, are recently making way into the “modern” civilisation and being welcomed as empowerment of women. the qur'an has also prohibited female infanticide. muslim women are everywhere, studying, working and contributing to the society. therefore, if you want to be fair, ask a muslim woman how she feels, not bbc or cnn.
see the writing on the wall
the government is out to remove every kind of thorns from its way. this government dreads everybody who has temerity to burn bright dispelling the dark of the society. so, dr. yunus who made us proud by winning the nobel peace prize is a blood sucker in the eye of sheikh hasina, but when chhatra league cadres extract juice from the already shrunken general people by racketeering, they become golden boys. how much money has the govt. squandered in name changing game? hundreds of opposition leaders and activists are languishing in jail on ridiculous charges while the genuine murderers, rapists, land grabbers involved with the ruling party are being freed and absolved from all cases against them. how long will the govt. be able to deceive the people? a storm of anger is brewing somewhere ready to erupt. won't they heed and see the writing on the wall?
dv lottery deception
diversity visa (dv) lottery is an opportunity of immigration given by the usa govt. for people throughout the world. so far, the recruitment process has been proved transparent and praiseworthy. people from different countries like bangladesh, india, nepal, etc. are getting chance to go to america safely. but some unscrupulous persons are deceiving people using the name of dv lottery. hacking the e-mail addresses of several people, those cheats are sending fake messages of dv visa affirmation. the e-mail messages sent by those frauds offer “permanent” resident card only for $681! the govt. must come forward to solve the matter. and the media should also come forward to make people aware about this deception.

no-fly zone is no solution to libyan crisis
like the recent uprisings in the north africa and the middle eastern countries, the libyan popular revolt against muammar gaddafi's dictatorial regime is also leaderless and amorphous. that is the basic weakness of the libyan popular rebellion against colonel muammar gaddafi's more than four decades long rule. the common thread running through this arab-african political phenomenon is that in all the countries where the uprising has taken place have been under a dictator. and all the countries that have seen such popular revolt so far have or had been ruled by pro-western dictators. but libya's case is somewhat different. gaddafi was never known for his pro-western stance. on the contrary, he had been violently anti-american and anti-west. but in the post-cold war era context, he has been compelled to call an uneasy truce with america and the rest of the west. pre-cold war era anti-west third or second world dictators are now a few in number. so, like before, he is hardly able to use anti-west tirades to keep his followings intact. naturally, though he is fuming and frothing against the un security council's (unsc) resolution 1973 to create a no-fly zone over libya, overwhelmingly with north america and western europe's and ostensibly with arab countries' support, russia and china conveniently remaining noncommittal, gaddafi had to lick the dust by at least verbally agreeing to go by the unsc resolution by enforcing a ceasefire. but on the ground, he is trying to mobilise the military loyal to him to surreptitiously grab as much rebel-held areas as possible.
