climate change and food security
world food and agricultural organization's (fao's) recent projections to 2030 suggest that globally the share of food in average household expenditure will continue to decline. however, recent trends, at least for some commodities, appear to be showing the reverse, with food prices increasing faster than incomes. growing scarcities of water, land and fuel are likely to put increasing pressure on food prices, even without climate change. additional pressures on these resources due to climate change, the introduction of mitigation practices that have the potential to create land use competition, and the attribution of market value to environmental services to mitigate climate change, also have the potential to cause significant changes in relative prices for different food items and an overall increase in the cost of an average food basket for the consumer.
green plot ratio: environmental planning of cities
weeks ago i went through the article 'blazing dhaka: an urban heat island' written by one of my departmental fellows in the daily star. it should undoubtedly be a great concern for the urban experts. the uhi is the worse outcome of urban metabolism process (exchange and transformation of material and energy flow) and is very much explicit in most of the densely built urban environments. but most of the economically developed countries are totally dependent on artificial air cooling system to get rid of the uncomfortable local climatic situation which again discharges waste energy in the atmosphere attributing to the global warming. dhaka, unless address and takes proper initiatives to attenuate the impact of uhi, the city life will be really very much miserable and not unlikely that the city becomes abandoned while also facing other environmental issues as majority of city dwellers are not so rich to own ac and ac in every house in congested localities simply unbearable environmentally.

kali o kolom poush 1415 -- december 2008
the present volume of kali o kolom began on an interesting note with the lead article by sanatkumar saha being on three celebrated english-language novels by bangladeshis who were deemed by him to be probashis in various degrees: monica ali's brick lane , abid ali's seasonal adjustments and tahmima anam's a golden age. however, midway through the piece, the reviewer brought in a poetry volume of a ms. seema nusrat amin, bootsole unbound (dhaka: oup, 2005), which he then proceeded to discuss in the same terms as the other three. the inclusion of this volume and poet within this particular discussion was incomprehensible--in no way is it comparable with the other three. the sample lines of poetry from the book reinforced the above thought in no small measure: “...you, slim-twigged lavender birch/thrashed but rooted in the yellow sorrow/with you i have passed, these desert stars' harrow...”. it immediately and conclusively rendered suspect the reviewer's ability to deliver credible critical assessment of south asian english fiction. it also brings into question kali o kolom 's reviewing of english language fiction--its reviewers must be vetted for english language fluency, and knowledge of english language fiction, before being tasked with such assessments.

there is one fundamental difference between the present caretaker government and the ershad regime. ershad knew he did not have the people's support. he looked for political roots, organizing heterogeneous elements willing to collaborate, even patronised a pliant opposition after fortifying power. as a popular move he downsized the districts to subdivisions, created upazillas and had elections. that some people still remember him, and he is a countable political force, is due to his people friendly activities in spite of the convictions and allegations.
perilous security system of the world
many countries around the world today possess or have the means to acquire weapons of mass destruction. they may be nuclear, chemical, biological or other types of weapons, which can be delivered through diversified ways. it is mainly the more powerful and wealthy nations that have such weapons although some poorer nations are also obtaining them. in recent years, there have been several movements and treaties to facilitate control of the flow and deployment of arms, be they landmines, small arms, or weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear weapons though most of these are considered as controversial. disarmament is now an issue that cannot be found even in a fairy tale now.
the future combat system

searching for god in one's inner being
in spirit driven success , dani johnson presents a subject matter that is as old as time itself but in a sparklingly refreshing manner. her overriding message throughout the book is that human life has a definite purpose which a person may not be aware of because oftentimes we tend to live or rather prefer to live in a status quo, but for the realization of which we must seek god, the supreme, the ultimate. from her deep conviction, the author avers that in spite of one's having ability, skill and other qualities, one shall not have wholeness of life until and unless one surrenders oneself to him and puts in efforts to be the best according to his will. the advice 'submit oneself' to god recurs throughout the book and johnson makes the meaning of the word 'submit' very explicit, that is, to respect and honour. she urges, 'accept instructions from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.' then again she adds, 'god doesn't make you submit. he gives you the choice'. and whenever a person chooses to submit to him, miracles occur in life. she further says that one has to ask for his help and for miracles to happen in one's life, to one's people. the word 'life', according to the author, refers to all areas of life that are physical, mental, emotional, social, relational and, she adds emphatically, financial as well. her resounding advice is to seek god whole-heartedly and totally unconditionally for all time so that the maxim, "many are called but few are chosen" flashes incessantly in one's vision and one is ready to be chosen.
insights into an old culture
the more one reads the more one is convinced of how less one really knows. kudos to raana haider for her wonderful work. the slimness of the volume belies the depth of knowledge and wisdom embedded in it. the work is a wonderful appetizer/eye opener to a more in depth appreciation of china. indeed a savoury appetizer with delectable observations and morsels of wisdom interspersed at regular intervals.
a simple matter of the environment
a world heritage site, tanguar haor is one of the largest freshwater inland wetlands; it is important and is of national significance, was designated as the second 'ramsar' site, and was released from the 1930 leasing system on january 20, 2000. earlier the government of bangladesh designated 59,600 hectares of the sundarban forests as the first ramsar site.
old gods displaced by the new
things fall apart is one of the thinnest books on my shelf and yet one of the most precious ones. plainly and colourfully, chinua achebe, in this book, shows how a rigid thing like tradition falls apart under stubborn alien powers.
