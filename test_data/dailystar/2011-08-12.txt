norway tragedy
recent tragic events in norway illustrate how dangerous it is when neither the state, nor society in general, recognises or confronts those religious extremists (christian or muslim) who argue they are not under a country's law because it is "man's law and not god's law" and so consider themselves free to break the law. this can encourage unstable or brain-washed individuals to think they have the right to persecute and even murder those who disagree with them, even members of their own faith community.

awareness about autism
there are potentials in every child. the autistic children need special care. the mass people did not have very clear idea of autism previously. in most cases parents were indifferent about autism which led the autistic children to frustration and there remained no one to help them. but now the situation is changing. the effort to create awareness about autism among the common people is very appreciable.
taking advantage of my situation?
i have been using a cell phone for the last 13 years and till today i am stick to one number. in all these years this number have become a part of my life; in fact, i treat this number as an identity of me. but recently i received an sms from my operator which surprised me. my operator told me to dial a special number to get connected to rab, police, fire service or blood bank during any crisis period or in emergency.
the holy month
ramadan is the ninth month of the islamic lunar calendar. muslims fast for the sake of allah and to offer more prayers than usual. muslims believe ramadan to be an auspicious month for the revelations of allah to humankind, being the month in which the first verses of the holy qur'an were revealed, on lailatul qadr, to the prophet muhammad. in the qur'an, allah proclaims that "fasting has been written down (as obligatory) upon you, as it was upon those before you."
corporal punishment
let me applaud and endorse the views expressed by sir frank peters about corporal punishment. it is sad that most teachers do not know about the un convention on the rights of children. the teachers require a thorough orientation to increase their awareness levels. the authorities can think of introducing a feedback system through which the outgoing students of a class can give an assessment of the teachers who taught them during the year under review. a dispassionate assessment of the feedback will help in improving the system.
create a culture of constructive criticism
it's unfortunate that in our country constructive criticism is almost non-existent. when we criticize something we generally use a range of disgraceful words that often create unhealthy conflicts and confusions in our society. as a consequence, criticism often becomes synonymous to harassment. we fail to understand that every individual or institution has its own flaws and limitations.
an appeal to khaleda zia

'business behind police boxes'
it is very much disgusting to read in the newspaper that a group of advertising agencies in connivance with the traffic police is making unauthorised police boxes and are using them for advertising without having prior permissions from the dhaka city corporation (dcc). the dcc does not know about these police boxes that are being built without their knowledge.
unscrupulous traders
every year during the month of ramadan the prices of essentials like sugar, cooking oil, brinjal, cucumber, mint, cumin leaves, tomato, carrot, rice, chicken, beef, mutton and fish go up. extortion by traders and business people reach intolerable heights. even the rates of bribes increase in this holy month! lives of the common people become very difficult. we wonder whether ramadan is a month of sacrifice or a month of extortion by greedy traders. we think a consumers' rights movement should be waged to combat these anti-people greedy practices.
curb road accidents
road accidents are being occurred so frequently that we take it as a common phenomenon of our life, and we do not take enough action to minimise the incidents of accident. every day some of us lose our relatives and friends in road accidents. how to curb this? firstly, i think we need to emphasize on raising awareness; we have to make drivers understand that they should care not only for their own lives but for the passengers' lives also. media can play a vital role in this.

the american war in afghanistan
the us appears to be sinking into a quagmire in afghanistan. the number of us troops on the ground keeps rising, and the number of troops killed and wounded keeps rising as well. the much-trumpeted operation in the helmand river valley didn't succeed in permanently removing resistance fighters. since that was its sole purpose, it was a failure. the planned attack on kandahar has been delayed, and many outlying operating bases have been abandoned by us forces as too costly to hold. isn't the united states losing the war on the ground in afghanistan?
hindutva ideology: democratic challenge or civilisational threat?
