human or beast?
being an educated person how hasan manzur could do this! why should he be jealous by the shining prospect of his wife? he should have been happy with her brilliant success. we feel shame to see and hear such kind of news. hassan syed has bitten her nose! almost gouged her eyes out! what a shame! i have watched in discovery channel that the big cats and hyenas are always hunting the gentle animal like deer and others. no doubt, hassan syed will be regarded as the symbol of human hyena. i would request the concerned to publish his picture in all printing and electronic media, so that everybody can recognize this new hyena in our society. it's a matter of hope that he has been caught by the detectives already.
corruption, adulteration and 'brain-drain'
adulteration in all spheres of our country at present has attained a new height, perhaps the maximum. can anyone identify a single sector in our country bereft of corruption or adulteration? corruption has made its way in every nook and corner of our society. adulteration is an inevitable by-product of the number one problem of our country, i.e., corruption. the appalling scenario in our fruit markets simply multiplies our anxiety, tension and panic. what we are eating are all adulterated mixed with perilous chemicals and other detrimental ingredients.
we want the opposition in parliament
we think bnp should not become enthusiastic just because people supported a few of its strikes, the eviction of begum khaleda zia from her house made people so outraged and awami league-led government's decision of scrapping caretaker government system made them so angry that they did not oppose the hartal. it does not mean that people like hartal, they have had enough when awami league was in the opposition, from 12 hours to 72 hours non-stop hartals; we shudder to think about that period. so much public property was damaged, newly built railway station and the biman office in chittagong was vandalised and set on fire by the activists of awami league. office goers were stripped off their clothes if they dared to go to the office during hartal hours.
tax limit for lower income group
the minimum taxable income limit has been proposed to be raised from tk 165,000 to tk 180,000 in the budget of fy 2011-12. thanks to the government. the prices of essentials have shot up tremendously and the cost of living like house rent, educational and medical expenses have also gone beyond the control of the lower income group. we are the worst sufferers in the society. the minimum ceiling should reasonably be increased considering the purchasing power of the lower and middle income group. if somebody gets a salary of tk 15,000 plus, it's very difficult and burdensome for him to pay tax with this little income. all the people of bangladesh are paying taxes by paying vat while buying essentials, paying telephone bills, electricity bills, and water bills and so on. why should the lower income group pay income tax again? if the ceiling is raised from proposed tk 180,000 to tk 240,000, the lower and middle income group will get some space to breathe and it will be a great relief to them especially at this critical time when prices of essentials are beyond the capacity of the general people.
of democracy

please re-carpet the road
more than a thousand pupils study in kadamtala purba bashabo high school & college situated in kadamtala, bashabo. the only approaching road to kadamtala has been damaged in such a way that it is not at all suitable for traffic movement or even for pedestrians' use. hundreds of small potholes have developed on the road and those are growing bigger day by day. as kadamtala is basically a residential area, thousands of inhabitants as well as the school and college students are suffering immensely on their way back home. re-carpeting of the main road and other lanes is very much necessary. but the dhaka city corporation is overlooking the problem. if the road and lanes are not re-carpeted immediately, those are to be re-constructed in near future. we urge the dhaka city corporation to re-carpet the road and lanes of kadamtala, bashabo.
paying for polluted water!
the other day i was waiting for some of my friends in front of a fast food shop at shugondha residential area in chittagong. suddenly i became terrified to witness something unusual -- a man carried two buckets of water to fill up the empty "filtered water jar”. at once i took a snap with my mobile phone. i did not understand how the shop owner allowed him to do so? i was thinking how we are being cheated by drinking so-called “filtered water.” when i was taking the snap the shop owner was laughing at me. he did not even bother about my photograph. the law enforcing agencies must take stern action against these fast food shops, hotels and restaurants which are providing unsafe drinking water and thus cheating the public.
