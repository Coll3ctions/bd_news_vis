offices for mps by year-end
the speaker of the jatiya sangsad has informed the country that all members of parliament will be given individual offices before the year is out. it certainly makes sense. the fact that mps need such space to do their work has been acknowledged especially since 1991 when democracy was restored in bangladesh. there is hardly anyone who will disagree with the idea that lawmakers, like their counterparts in the us and at westminster, must be provided with all the facilities that will enable them to perform their public responsibilities to the satisfaction of their constituents. one wonders, though, as to why such a long-felt need of our parliamentarians has not so long been addressed.

patience pays off
watching herschelle gibbs in full flow is one of the more delightful viewing experiences in cricket today, his grace and style elevating him above most other contemporary hard-hitting batsmen. he has competition -- notably in suresh raina -- for his typical hits over cover but no one comes close to matching the delicious swat-flick that he plays. he exhibited that today, nonchalantly picking up manpreet gony for a six over long leg. but he also exhibited another side -- gibbs mark ii -- that eventually took deccan chargers to their fourth win on the trot.

hydraulic horns
you have published many reports about the sound pollution by "hydraulic horns" of heavy trucks, covered vans, trailer trucks, inter-district buses etc. etc. in your daily. unfortunately, the authorities concerned have not taken any 'positive step" to stop the menace. day by day the number of vehicles is increasing, leading to increase in sound pollution. people are just helpless.
using land
bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world. the growth rate of population here is still high. but the land mass of the country does not increase, not even an inch. besides, the agricultural land is reducing every day. why not, every day new schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, offices, courts, playgrounds roads, homes, markets bazars, trade centres, industries etc are being established on the agricultural land.
battle for the house!
although the steam is getting less powerful, the bnp activists are still holding the street to retain the house. a newly empowered heavy weight politician of the bnp, who happens to be a lawyer, is really out to make all kinds of arguments to retain the house of his leader. bangladesh is a country of extraordinary judicial culture--for some one's mistake or favour the country will have to pay for it. even constitutional protection is given to protect an illegal and immoral act of individual and of the government. the learned lawyers of the bnp might find a way out to save the house so that they are not evicted from the place of birth and bastion of power. this is well said by the sg of the bnp. according to him, ' minus cantonment means minus politics or minus one " what an interesting admission of the political ideology of the party. we feel baffled learning that the house is donated to the entire family of president zia, which means they will inherit the right from generation to generation and the basic political ideology will carry with them. i thank the political mentor for taking such a farsighted action for the newly born political party in 1975. this is called political statesmanship. the learned lawyers might be saving the heritage whether it is illegal or immoral by any standard.
putting railways back on rails
your timely editorial, highlighting the sad plight of railways on april 18, deserves the government's serious attention. this matter is of national interest; since railways provide the cheapest mode of passenger and goods transportation. the task is mammoth, but it needs to be done, maybe spread over a number of years in order of economic priority, as it will require huge investment mostly in foreign exchange.
power supply

positive sign
the so-called islamic militancy is an "unlawful war" of some misguided people against the civilized society. the members of the militant groups claim themselves to be muslims and are waging war in the name islam. if we look at their latest front of war, they are killing fellow muslims inside the very prayer houses i.e. mosques. for example, we are watching what is happening in pakistan-- the so-called islamists are killing their brothers and sisters in the mosques on special prayers day, the friday. so, it is very easy to understand that the so-called islamists are not real muslims but they are using islam and destroying its image.
acc's role
the propriety of acc's action in filling cases against people and the way it spent a huge amount of taxpayers' money have been called into question. many people were put in jail, harassed and humiliated in connection with acc cases. the role of the anti-corruption commission during the two years of the caretaker government's rule has come under sharp criticism for the manner in which it instituted cases against political and business leaders, including two former prime ministers.
love for luxury!

some days ago a man came to our office to buy an apartment from a particular project. he wanted to know whether any buyer from barisal was there. according to him, it is impossible to live with a neighbour from barisal. my other two co-directors smiled silently as i am a man from barisal. over two decades ago, i along with my wife went to the house of one of my acquaintances. there were a dozen people who were engaged in a debate over “who are the worst people in bangladesh?” the conclusion of the debate was that the people of comilla, noakhali & barisal were the worst! my wife also fell into this category as she is from noakhali.

an appeal to lawmakers
i would like to draw the kind attention of the general readers and the lawmakers of the country in particular to the section 18 (3) of the arthorin adalat ain 2003 (ain). this is a bad law as it discourages the investors to invest in the long run. no business can guarantee profit. if it could be ensured, then everyone would start a business. in practice , only 3-5% of the world population are risk takers i.e. the entrepreneurs, the prime movers of the economy.
cancellation of lease
if it is looked upon from public interest and from the point of inadmissibility of conducting political activities in a restricted and sensitive zone, the proposed cancellation of the lease to begum zia of her cantonment residence in no way goes against the tenets or ethics. earlier, as the people were unaware of such a vast land being under the occupation of a single family, they had nothing to say against, but now they do not sympathize with the family.
disorder in bcl
against the backdrop of bcl's destructive activities which have virtually closed almost all the major educational institutions in the country, our prime minister has stepped down as the organisational chief of bcl. following her resignation, a legitimate question arises as to why she has done so. does she mean she has failed to control the bcl? if so, then who else can bring the bcl back on the right track? it is also possible that she has resigned being frustrated with the notorious activities of her party's student wing. but her resignation will not bring any durable solution. she and her government are responsible for restoring order in the bcl and create a congenial atmosphere in the educational institutions. though our pm has sent a message of stern action against those bcl activists who are locked in fighting, extortion, tender manipulation and other criminal activities, this may not serve the purpose as her message of stern action is not a new one to the bcl men.
