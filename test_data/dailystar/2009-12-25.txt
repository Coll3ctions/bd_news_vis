merry christmas!
the coming of christmas signifies for the followers of jesus christ not only a celebration of life but also a remembrance of the need to conduct their lives on the principles of belief. the fundamental basis on which jesus lived and for which he died was that people must love one another and share the joys and sorrows of this world because they all spring from the same creation. the birth of jesus christ in bethlehem was a sign that a bright new dawn had arrived for those who had long waited for a sign from the almighty of oncoming change. for joseph and mary, the birth of the child jesus was a miracle. for suffering souls in that long-ago era, it was a broad hint that fate was about to change for them. wise men followed a star and made their way to the spot where a fresh symbol of faith awaited them.
managing city's unwieldy traffic!
the dhaka metropolitan police (dmp)'s ongoing drive to enforce movements of different modes of vehicles along designated lanes and debarring private cars from parking along streets reflect a certain commitment on the part of traffic police authorities to bring discipline on the roads. some new measures have led to an untangling of traffic mess in certain places and to that extent these are welcome. yet, given the serious physical and infra-structural constraints of limited road space relative to the size and population of the metropolis, flawed signalling arrangements and, above all, utterly inadequate parking facilities, such measures are bound to be mere palliatives to a malignant syndrome.
when politics perverted poetry
a popular saying has it in nicaragua that everyone is a poet until proven otherwise. what about the rest of the world? poets spring from their soils, and every soil isn't equally fertile to bear a bounteous crop. khaled hosseini writes in a thousand splendid suns that amongst all the provinces of afghanistan, one couldn't stretch a leg in herat "without poking a poet."
separate strategy needed
copenhagen, as many had feared, delivered very little. the developed world once again used its clout to deny a fair deal for all other countries, particularly the worst hit ones. many had gone to the meeting expecting a great accord with legally binding clauses but what it produced was a "thin deal" even by the un, which is a professionally optimist body. many are saying that this is the first step and some have said that the process will go on for a better deal, but it's going to be more disappointment if one expects all this. the poor countries have basically been left to fend for themselves as they have no clout in the world of international negotiations. view the page sports

bijoy mela

israel issue
more than sixty years have passed since the usa and the uk created the state of israel within the state of palestine under the 'two-state' utopian theory -- israel for the immigrant jews and palestine for the native arab muslims and christians to divide and rule the middle east.
biking
in the usa it is hard to find an 8 year old, a male or a female, who does not know how to bike. though biking is not much used as a means of primary transportation, many people take their bikes out in the summer for recreational touring. in holland bikes are used as a means of primary transportation by a large number of people. people use bikes to go to schools, to work, do shopping and visit friends all the time. streets are designed as bike friendly and there are special rental and parking facilities for bikes in the city areas. in bangladesh where most people either walk or ride rickshaws, biking could have been made popular if it could be made available to common people at an affordable price. parents need to buy bikes for their children and encourage them to learn biking. industries need to come up with full size, as well as, children's bikes, at lower costs to make this happen. the government may come forward with incentives to the industrialists who show interests in such venture to help at the early stages, until they become self supporting or profitable.
is human safety universal?
is human safety universal? realists, and later neo-realists, have seen safety as merely incomplete as well as provisional, for the reason that "war is expected." they consider the world anarchical. since they consider the state as the ultimate power, therefore, safety is destined to be "national safety." it presupposes a set of mechanisms to defend a state so that it can continue as a political unit. they include defence against attacks and pressure from outside as well as against any event that could gravely intimidate a country's ruling government from inside. as such attacks can take place anytime, they call for force. when there is neither war nor other armed disagreement, a state is hypothetically "safe" or "at peace." southeast asia calls it "comprehensive security." many non-state actors, including the non-government organisations (ngos), propagate this idea. inclusive security goes further, and presupposes customary military pressure, internal aggression and racial conflicts.
build the nation
no wonder as a nation we are proud to have several achievements. one of the biggest achievements is our independence. the extensive nine months' bloody war and sacrifice of the lives of millions of people including awful torture on men, women and children ultimately led to the glorious victory in 1971.
a great man
i commend pope benedict xvi for signing a decree recognizing the late pope john paul ii's life of “heroic virtue.” pope john paul ii, a man of deep faith, will one day be canonized a saint by the catholic church! the holy father was an inspiration and a model witness to the life of christ; a shepherd of truth immersed in profound humility and immense love for both god and man.

recruitment by banks
a job in a bank has become very popular nowadays. many students after completing their masters or mba want to be employed in both categories of banking job (govt&private). the bankers' recruitment committee usually want to have their candidates to have 50% marks or second class at every academic level. but there lies a competition among private banks. they want certain gpa grading or class. some banks seek 1st class holders at every level. the students of english dept. are victimised because of such demand . it is very tough & sometimes very difficult to get first class at every level.
cox's bazar
cox's bazar is a potential gold mine and a potential foreign exchange earner in bangladesh. it is essential to develop cox's bazar into an attractive city in order to attract more tourists, especially from foreign countries. a proper tourist industry should be set up and well educated and groomed people should be trained on how to handle, speak and help tourists.
