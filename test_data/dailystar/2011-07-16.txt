the tagore mystique
on the occasion of rabindranath's 150th birth anniversary, bangla academy has published a special issue (baishakh 1418) of its periodical uttaradhikar, devoting all 320 pages of the journal to scholarly writings on rabindranath's life and literary works. it comprises, for the most part, works by seasoned tagore exponents who have been working on rabindranath for decades. as a result, the collection will presumably become a reliable work of reference for tagore enthusiasts, on the one hand. on the other, if one looks for radical new readings of tagore's classics in the light of contemporary critical literary theories, one will find little. nevertheless, bangla academy's initiative in bringing together such a rich collection of scholarly essays and to offer it to readers at such a low price (taka 50 only) is praiseworthy.
