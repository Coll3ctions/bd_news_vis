risks from illegal billboards
illegal hoardings and billboards atop buildings and on roads in the capital remain a clear danger to citizens. the danger rises now that the season of storms is upon us. the first manifestation of it came last wednesday when a huge billboard collapsed at mirpur road during a storm. while storms are a regular climatic happening in bangladesh, what should not be regular is a deliberate flouting of judicial pronouncements on such matters as a removal of unauthorized billboards. despite a specific high court order on rajuk in april last year that all such hoardings and billboards be removed, hardly anything has been done to comply with the order. the chairman of rajuk now informs us that a lack of manpower has prevented an implementation of the hc directive. that begs the question: how is it that in an entire year rajuk has not had the capacity to remove the billboards? besides, why has it not come forth with any explanations about its failure until now?

weekly currency roundup
april 17- 21, 2011
international markets:
this week the dollar took a hammering against a basket of currencies. on thursday it hit a three year low against a basket of currencies as strong corporate earnings buoyed risk appetite in illiquid pre easter trade, which threatened to drive the greenback to historic lows. the euro jumped to 16-month highs and looked on course for a move towards $1.50 if it holds onto these gains. currencies like the australian and canadian dollars also surged, though some traders warned the moves could reverse as investors take profit on short dollar positions before the long easter weekend. the chart outlook for the greenback looked dire after it tumbled through a 74.17 trough hit in november 2009, a move that may spark a run towards the 70.698 all-time low hit in 2008. this week's threat by standard & poor's to cut the united states' prized triple-a credit rating has knocked dollar sentiment, reminding the market, which had been focused on euro zone debt woes, that the us still has massive debt problems. a series of records have been broken, with gold vaulting to all-time highs above $1,500 an ounce and the aussie powering to 29-year peaks above $1.07, while the singapore dollar and swiss franc hit all-time highs. however, there were signs of profit taking, with the aussie stumbling ahead of options barriers at $1.0800 after surging as high as $1.0775. the single currency looked poised for further gains, with the path clearing for a run at the 2009 peak at $1.5145. the dollar index fell 0.8 percent from late new york trade to 73.735, the lowest since august 2008 -- just before it surged during the lehman brothers collapse -- as world stocks marched higher. view the page metropolitan
