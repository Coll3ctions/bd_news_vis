begum zia's reform signals
bnp chairperson khaleda zia's readiness to drop the bad elements from her party and go for a dialogue with awami league president sheikh hasina are steps which we welcome. such moves will help inaugurate a fresh new democratic spirit in the country, one that we as citizens have for years been advocating. in fact, it has always been the desire of the people of bangladesh that a productive and genuine democratic order be set in motion as a precondition for the overall development of the country. within such a programme of democratic reawakening must be included a democratisation of the inner party working process, the right of independent thinking within the parties, indeed the right of party leaders and workers to voice dissent over issues they cannot morally agree with. in other words, for democracy to work, it is for the parties to ensure that freedom of thought characterises their own functioning.

relief for india
andrew symonds's absence from the australia touring party leaves it shorn of a forceful cricketer and character. india has felt his power at the crease and will be relieved to be spared any repetition. never mind that he was patently caught behind the wicket before he had taken command, still symonds's innings in the ill-mannered sydney test match was one of coruscating power. once he was underway, anil kumble and company might as well have been firing popguns at a tank. it was an exceptional assault.

private cars in dhaka
let us return to the private car. whatever convenience and comfort it provides comes at various costs. cars are the main source of pollutants worldwide. there is no such thing as a clean car; cars just vary in the amount they pollute. despite increasingly stringent emissions control standards over the decades in the us, cars pollute more than they used tobecause people are driving more.
our priorities
what do we need now? what bangladesh needs most now for its 140 million people and their future? a "bride" we need now! it is a symbolic term here! the political parties , elections and the government are the ornaments of the bride !! the bride is nothing but the "policy" of the country which is the most important thing for us now !! it is not important who wins the election and who sits on the opposition benches in parliament, what is important is the right "policy" which must be followed strictly in order to get the proper democratic system started in our country for the first time in history. a policy , which is 100% for the welfare of the general public, nothing else. a policy which will ensure the following most required three things -
prices shooting up
we have a department, a ministry, an adviser and above all a powerful government. they have all along informed the people that such and such steps would be taken to control the rise of the prices of daily necessities during ramadan. the result is opposite . the latest move by the fbcci has failed, and they are planning to call for the support of the law enforcing agencies like rab, bdr and police. the success of the new move is doubtful and might create a panic in the mind of the traders having the same result we saw in the early days of the ctg adopting the terrorising strategy. the efforts to neutralise the terror effect on the market and the traders are being continued by the ctg. the fbcci has perhaps a major role in pursuing such a reconciliatory move by the ctg. therefore, they should be well aware of the pros and cons of using the tactics of intimidation and force against the wholesale and retail traders as identified by them..
“obama effect”
there is a growing concern that the “obama effect” currently changing the face of “politics as usual” in the united states by propelling an increasingly large number of americans, especially the forward looking, educated and young across the colour and racial divides, to cast their precious votes for their candidate of choice, who represents a quantum leap and paradigm shift towards a post-ethnic and post-modern national and international leadership, may turn out to be an euphoria and an “audacity of hope” that is intrinsically ephemeral. in retrospect, would this be construed simply as a “pleasure principle” that took the united states by the storm briefly, but was eventually caught up by the “reality principle” implicit in the “bradley effect,” also known as “wilder effect” or “dinkins effect,” in which the margin of lead in the primary election enjoyed by yet another very promising african-american candidate was significantly wiped out in the final election because the white voters, who posed as independent and swing voters to conceal their racial affiliations during the primary reverted again to their true colours in the final election unabashedly? could we bet on obama's white half-ancestry to tip the balance in the final election to be able to declare that we had finally moved beyond the “phenotype” incontrovertibly entrenched in the us psyche for generations?
price hike in ramadan
the holy ramadan is the month for self-correction and self-sacrifice. but what we are observing in this month --instead of going down, the prices are going up. this is too bad for us, especially for our poor and low-income people. this is a sad truth that when ramadan comes traders and hoarders hike the prices of essential commodities. the people have nothing to do. they are bound to buy the essentials. the policy makers and the market controllers are blind to this situation.
school timing
the government's declaration that the schools will all have to start at 7:30am is good news to me. at least the government is trying to come out of its negligent attitude. some schools (and their students know very well to whom i am referring to), keep their students locked up in long, unnecessary lessons. the government should also have mentioned a suitable time for schools to close for the day.
english spellings
bangla has a great heritage and a rich history full of struggle. there is no other language as bangla which has a similar history. we sacrificed some priceless lives on 21 february 1952 to establish the right of bangla as a state language of the country. now 21 february is the international mother language day.
parade of failure!
a very interesting and appropriate headline on the chronic failure of the bangladesh cricket team. the blame is due for the entire system, the bccb, selectors, team management including the coach and finally the captain. we only hope that cricket would be governed and run by the cricketers and be kept above the current trend of politics in sports and games.
traffic chaos in dhaka
there has been extensive coverage of the terrible traffic situation in dhaka city. one can only sit and read these and feel like "strangling" someone at the total frustration and helplessness we commuters suffer from!
stop student politics
my elder brother is a student of sust. he has completed his honours course this year. but it has taken seven years to complete this four year course due to session jam. student politics is responsible for such jams. in our country, it takes much longer than usual time to complete our academic life. so we can't apply for government jobs in time.
day of national mourning
august 15 has been observed as a day of national mourning. on this day in 1975, the father of the nation bangabandhu sheikh mujubur rahman, president of bangladesh, was brutally killed along with some other members of his family during a military coup. the coup leaders also killed four national leaders in jail on 04 nov 1975. august 15 is definitely a black day in the history of bangladesh.
ill-fated mother?
i will try to say something about the ill fated mother whose letter was published on september 5, 2008. i was surprised after reading her letter "no way out". i couldn't understand how a mother calls herself ill fated when she has two golden super- talented children. yes, it is painful that her daughter could not manage sponsorship. but why should we think that nothing more is left in life? and why should we think that the usa and the uk are the only places for a brilliant student?
acc's job
while there is no question about the integrity and honesty of anti-corruption commission chairman lt gen (retd) hasan mashhud chowdhury, the way the acc is working towards its stated goals of uprooting corruption from the country needs to be reviewed. except the naiko and gatco cases where procedural irregularities along with financial losses were taken into account, every case so far i know was filed for amassing illegal wealth or concealing information about the wealth when the acc asked for it from an individual.
trading everywhere!
i usually go out early in the morning for a walk, since i developed some symptoms of diabetes, and get a chance to look around, especially wall writings and posters. i have recently noticed there are some talented singers participating in competitions in the electronic media, although i must appreciate it but i feel bad when i see some posters on the wall with the participants asking people to vote for them by sms. those who are interested in watching these programmes may send sms if they like their voice, but it is not clear whether the participants should uses posters for this purpose. is it the proper way to be a popular singer?
hope fading away
the people of bangladesh never got so much hope before, except our great win in the liberation war. a real hope, a great dream & a bright future we could see in the horizon after this caretaker government took over. but unfortunately all our dreams are vanishing day by day. thanks to dr mahboob hossain for his letter “ election & return of goons” and mr. rony ahmed for “ the unfortunate nation”. view the page international
