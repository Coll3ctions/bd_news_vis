a recent exhibition of installations, titled 'longitude latitude 4', showcased at beauty boarding, on sirish das lane, in old dhaka featured the works of contemporary artists. the choice of the venue, by a dingy lane, may seem a little unusual to many. but the group of artistes who put together the event wanted "an art happening at beauty boarding." the term "happenings" was coined by american painter allan kaprow in the late 1950s and his counter cultural, interactive works shaped much of the course of late 20th century art. in his views, the distinction or hierarchy between artists and viewers are superfluous and viewers' reaction determines the art piece, making each "happening" a unique experience. blurring the lines among different genres, the installations usually involve different mediums of art at a single event.

bangladesh's defence: a debatable dialectic
the armed services of democratic states leave politics to politicians, concentrating instead on professional concerns e.g., national strategy, defence doctrine, threat perceptions, and military preparations for their constitutionally-ordained responsibilities, i.e., defending territorial integrity from external aggression, and safeguarding sovereign control over internal affairs.
10 signs bin laden's next door
analysts are trying to guess where osama bin laden lived before he got to abbottabad six years ago. i'm sure he lived next to me. my neighbours were so noisy they either had 50 children or were terrorists making homemade nuclear bombs (a uranium-235 centrifuge makes a racket). i'm not sure which is scarier. probably the 50 children.
