the president's three-week long dialogue with 24 political parties including the key players bnp and al, may have earned him accolade for his diligence, tenacity and handling of a task that was basically thrust upon him. but in substance, it has had very little to commend itself for. on the contrary, the outcome merely repeated what the ec had proposed nearly nine months ago as we elaborate below. it's all the more frustrating when clearly an opening was provided through the initiative as this paper had repeatedly commented.

some suggestions: is railway minister listening?
whenever someone goes to a railway station in dhaka or chittagong, five days, six days or ten day earlier to his desired travelling day, he is told at the ticket counter that 'all the tickets are sold.' but when a ticket is somehow managed and one has boarded the train, he would find that lots of the seats are lying vacant and some people are selling those vacant seats. intercity trains have an attendant in each compartment. it is alleged that some of these attendants are involved in selling vacant seats. these attendants virtually come to no help to the passengers.
old age allowance
the older people of the country are being given an allowance of tk.100 per month by the government. we think the amount is too meagre given the rising prices of the essentials. as the elderly people cannot work and earn like the younger ones, they need the allowance. but this allowance should not be a mere token money. even though the country is beset with many problems, the government is at least doing something for the welfare of the poor old people. this is a noble initiative on the part of the government, but the said amount is a mere pittance by any standard.
coal will remain a reserve forever?
the prime minister has declared that we will keep our coal reserve for the next generation and will now import coal to generate electricity for our use in bangladesh. having attended several ministerial and secretarial meetings on coal policy, i have written in your daily that the forces working against coal mining in bangladesh is more powerful than that of al, bnp and jp put together. my write-up 'buried treasure' published in your forum's july 2010 issue explains that we do not have to reinvent the wheel, nor is it rocket-science to formulate a simple 'coal policy' and avert the crisis that faces this country.
people are the best judge
the recent victory of the rebel bnp candidate monirul haque sakku in mayoral election of comilla city corporation proved once again that people always favour a leader who is dedicated to improve common people's lot. our political parties must understand the pulse of the common people and they must nominate honest and pro-people leaders who truly represent the parties. they must not choose candidates with dubious characters. nowadays, the common people have become more conscious. they know they should elect the right candidate. in the recent mayoral elections of narayanganj and comilla, people have made it clear. any kind of manipulation in voting could be disastrous for the government. it would have rekindled the politics of confrontation and distrust. the government and the election commission deserve kudos for holding a free and fair election in a peaceful environment. congrats to the new mayor of comilla!

we want a sports channel
we have a good number of satellite channels in the country. these channels broadcast drama serials, movies, talk shows and many more entertaining programmes. we also have a few channels that are broadcasting only news. however, it is really unfortunate that we do not have any sports channel. we hardly get daily sports updates except in the news. like other countries, we need our own sports channel. our national cricket team play international matches regularly. but btv only broadcasts a few of the matches. therefore, we need a 24-hour sports channel to meet the demand of the sports lovers.

evm magic
despite much criticism about the use of electronic voting machine (evm), mainly by the opposition party, the election commission (ec) has done the job successfully in comilla city corporation election. the polling stations were hassle-free. and the final result came out like a magic, within a very short time. although there is a big risk of election manipulation in case of evm use, but a strong, unbiased and transparent election commission can accomplish this herculean task.
we need quality education
the students of class v throughout the country made a very good result in the last primary education terminal exam. last year the pass rate was 88.84 per cent. the pass rate rose by 4.92% this year. the overall result of jsc examinations has improved also. but still the dropout rate is a matter of concern. by dint of hard work the students are making satisfactory results. the guardians are also very serious about their children's education. if the situation improves gradually, no student will fail in any public examination in the near future. now importance should be given to the improvement of the quality of education. quality should be ensured for the better future of the students and for the betterment of the nation.

old mistakes, new lessons . . .
now that ghulam azam has been taken into custody, our expectations of a proper, fair and full trial of the war criminals of 1971 take a newer, happier dimension. we do not mean to prejudge the course of the trial of those who have been brought into the net of the law and those who might be picked up at a later stage. the good bit in the war crimes story is that every effort has been expended into making sure that the process of the trials meets internationally accepted legal standards, that indeed no questions are raised about the transparency of the trials. those who have been accused of crimes committed in the course of the war of liberation must be satisfied that it is justice, not revenge, the state of bangladesh means to pursue. for those of us who have not forgotten the manner in which the pakistan army and its local collaborators went about killing, raping and burning, the goal remains an attainment of justice as a means of bringing the past to an end through letting the war criminals know that while they may have got away with their notoriety in the past four decades, history is now about to catch up with them. finally.
