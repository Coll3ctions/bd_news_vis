army housing scheme
an army housing scheme(ahs) estimated to involve 13,000 bighas (about 4,333 acres, approximately at 3 bighas per acre) without rajuk's and works ministry's involvement speaks not only of the naivety of army seniors dealing with the scheme but also of the subconscious mindset that any army's scheme will get implemented regardless. otherwise how could a scheme of such dimension, providing for 27,000 plots, even be conceived without a thorough planning and thinking about its feasibility, not only in terms of finding such a huge chunk of land but also in terms of public reaction to such a move. reportedly this scheme to be funded by personal savings of the members of the armed forces, was approved by the prime minister's office, following which a limited company was formed with the quarter master general as the chair and a brigadier general as managing director. so far 1,400 bighas have been purchased, with the target of getting 13,000 bighas in total.
high court move on jailed children
the high court directive that the authorities free all children currently in various jails all over the country could not have come sooner. by the standards of civilised behaviour, both on the part of individuals and institutions of the state, it is morally and even legally inexplicable why persons under eighteen years of age should be kept confined in prison. yes, there may be offences committed by the very young, but that does not allow the state to treat these young in the same way that it treats all hardened criminals. besides, when the institutions of the state begin to feel that children should be kept in jail, without any possibility of freedom, they are only making sure that these children will in time turn out to be hardened criminals themselves. it is just the sort of condition we as citizens would like to prevent from shaping up. view the page sports

bangladesh cricket
we congratulate the bangladesh national cricket team on their victory over a stronger opponent, new zealand. it has been a consistent display by the tigers. captain shakib-al-hasan has shown how to lead from the front. the entire series has been a glaring example of good leadership and team dedication.
joining parliament
if i remember rightly, bnp is not joining the parliament because it wants more seats in the front bench and more time to talk in the house. i feel that the best way to sort it out is to go by it mathematically, based on the number of seats won (not nominated women's seat). the calculation could be as follows, based on a hypothetical election result.
mario vargas llosa

babri masjid verdict
there is no denying the fact that the verdict on babri masjid has left a vast majority of muslims feeling cheated by the judiciary. they had hoped for a judgement based on impartiality but it seems that the judges were influenced by the propaganda war unleashed by the anti-muslim groups. unfortunately, they are more vocal, more visible and able to influence many sane persons including muslims. but they forget the safety and security enjoyed by the vast majority of non-muslims in the muslim areas/countries. in the recent past muslims were brutally killed in gujarat, mumbai, nelie, bhagalpur and a number of other places. the denial of job opportunities and discrimination of muslims in india is a well-documented fact.
our defence expenditure
once a mighty military power, britain is now talking of major defence cuts to contain the budget deficit. the 5-month-old govt. under david cameron made no bones about the unpleasant decision his govt. is about to take in view of the hard facts and ground realities.
health tips
i would like to give the people of my beloved country some health tips. these are:
late sm ali
late sm ali was an icon of journalism in bangladesh. he set an example of objective journalism in the country for others to follow.
road conditions
i had the misfortune of travelling by road from dhaka to chittagong recently. it took us over ten hours. it was not because of heavy traffic but because of the slow pace and congestion resulting from the abysmal condition of the road. the stretch from baroiahat to chittagong, perhaps some 70 kilometres, is in particularly bad shape. it is virtually without any surface and has innumerable potholes. it is difficult to imagine how the authorities could allow the condition of the most important highway of the country to deteriorate to this level when the concerned ministry is waxing eloquent about subways, magnetic trains, bridges and elevated expressways.
halloween
as halloween approaches i feel it important to remind parents and children that the feast of halloween was once the vigil feast of all saints' day, which is celebrated on november 1. it was the beginning of a day in which we rejoice in the work of god seen in his saints.
khaleda zia's cantonment house
the government should allow khaleda zia to remain in her cantonment house. people are passing their days in great misery. power, water and gas shortage has become acute. in addition, prices of essential commodities have gone out of reach of common people and crimes of all sorts have increased manifold. instead of tackling all these serious problems, it seems that the government is bent upon creating further distress for the people by asking begum khaleda zia to vacate the cantonment house. it will definitely create an upheaval in the political field and the common people will sufferer. we do not want fresh unrest; it is the government's duty to see that people live in peace, not to shatter it.
us election and bin laden
when the midterm us election is just around the corner, all of a sudden osama bin laden, who is believed to be dead, has appeared in the media from nowhere. the united states is capable of taking to task almost anybody as it did saddam hussein. osama bin laden is no head of a state or government. he is a mastermind terrorist and is the brainchild of none other than the united states.
oil/gas exploration
i am very glad to have read the news item in the 6th october 2010 issue of the daily star that our govt. has approved exploration of oil /gas at salda along bangladesh border with eastern india. the nation's first oil / gas exploration was successful at haripur long ago, few miles east of sylhet town, and expectation is high that more success would come up at salda, and may be in other parts of sylhet.
disparity in education
we have seen two reports in the national dailies that there are no primary schools in 131 villages of kurigram district and 67 villages of tangail district.
save our village
charkumaria is an old village of greater daudkandi in comilla district which is about 400 years old. during the british period it was a centre of attraction for travellers. but this beautiful village, habited by around 5000 people, is being ruined by river erosion. during 1964-1971 kathalia river was about 1 km away from the village. but now our village is standing on the bank of the river. view the page international
