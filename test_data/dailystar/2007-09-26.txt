bangladesh bank's timely directive
the directive issued by the bangladesh bank to all commercial banks regarding transactions by business concerns even as criminal cases are pursued against their owners is a welcome move. and the first point that needs to be made here is that it should go a long way towards reviving confidence in the economic sector. while it is true that there are criminal charges against a section of businessmen, with many of them abandoning their firms, it is equally true that for the economy to move along smoothly it is essential that business activities continue unimpeded.

why politics matters, and always . . .
being a politician and being in politics are not quite the same. the first refers to one who has made a vocation of politics. the second draws attention to one who has found his way into the political field without first having been baptised in it. a politician is an individual who has walked all across the country, known the pulse of the nation, and, having known it, spoken up in defence of all its aspirations. and one who strays into politics, or decides that he should be in it, is a person who may have pursued a profession all his adult life, and then, having gone into superannuation, decided that a foray into politics was not quite a bad idea.
the future of american exit from iraq

there are more things between al and bnp
paraphrasing the bard of avon let us begin with the words: there are more things between awami league and bnp that are not given as much importance by us as they deserve for all the good reasons. and there is strong logic behind the argument that for this serious lacking we failed to build a cohesive society that should have been built thirty years ago. too much of politics and little importance to social development are the main reasons for this state of things as they stand today. view the page sports
