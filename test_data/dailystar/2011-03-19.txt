living in a time of change
slinging mud at opponents is a staple of our democracy, although most voters prefer sensible debate on the hardest national issues. the moral majority sincerely yearn that the government put the economic crisis before politics. in fact, it is evident that some of our politicians are spending a lot of time vacillating, arguing whilst being loud and disagreeable, whereas democracy needs leaders with the inclination and ability to adjust and compromise. democracy in the absence of other desirables, like the independence of the judiciary; rule of law; free press and fair elections, often limits a country's progress. our democracy needs defending.

economics of mulla nasruddin
president harry truman asked to be sent a one-armed economist, having been tired of economists who say, 'on the one hand, this' and 'on the other hand, that'. pararthoparatar arthaniti, a serious bangla book on economics of altruism, by akbar ali khan is, on the one hand, enlightening, on the other hand, lightens the hearts of readers. the university press limited published it in 2000 and reprinted it in 2010. akbar ali khan, alternative executive director of the world bank for some years and an adviser of the caretaker government of bangladesh in 2006, has written this book in quite a charming way. following philosopher ludwig wittgenstein who said, 'a serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes', the author has interspersed this book on economics with many, many jokes, from his personal experience and stories of mulla nasruddin. pararthoparatar arthaniti could be titled equally well as a book of jokes. the jokes are sharp, intelligent and subtle. mulla nasruddin has come so many times in this book to give simple explanations of many complex economic theories that this book could as well have been 'by mulla nasruddin'. a person asked the mulla, 'how old are you?' 'forty' replied the mullah. the other man reminded the mulla that he had said the same thing even ten years ago! 'yes,' replied the mullah, 'i always stand by what i have said.' on the one hand, this one-word mulla nasruddin could have been the most favourite economist to president truman. on the other hand, the british economist keynes who used to change his mind with the moving hand of a good clock, in a reply to a question about the inconsistency of his mind said, 'when the facts change, i change my mind. what do you do, sir?'

a ghost speaks
when one hears of field marshal mohammad ayub khan's diaries, incredulity is what one is struck by. there is a reason for that. when towards the end of his decade-long presidency of pakistan in the 1960s he came forth with his memoirs, bearing the arrogant title of friends not masters , a goodly number of questions were raised about the ghostwriters who probably had worked on them. and indeed there were the ghostwriters, all of whom in later years were spotted explaining away their roles in the making of the memoirs which, incidentally, amounted to little that was enlightening or revealing.
