khaleda zia's unfortunate stance
it was with a fair and natural degree of happiness that we welcomed the announcement by jatiyo sangsad speaker abdul hamid about a joint appearance by the prime minister and the leader of the opposition at an anti-poverty rally scheduled for saturday. the fact that the speaker's announcement was made in the presence of the chief whips of the awami league and the bnp gave people to understand, and rightly too, that here finally was an opportunity for both sheikh hasina and khaleda zia to offer their perspectives to the nation on tackling poverty and its consequences. sadly enough, that opportunity, having come so close to being a reality, has now been dashed by begum zia on grounds, however justified, need not have been expressed in this manner. she has put forward a four-point demand she thinks the government should accept as a way of forging a national consensus on the issues that matter. and unless her demands are met, she will have nothing to do with the ruling party.
women's vulnerability to repression growing
among the major causes of concern for us all is the frequency and severity of oppression women are subjected to in bangladesh. news of rape, violence and murder of young girls and women for dowry often hit the headlines. then we read horrendous accounts of young girls being trafficked across borders to be sold in brothels; and how faces of young brides are totally disfigured by acid. early marriage, early pregnancy and death from complications at childbirth are other forms of oppression that hardly draw attention of the law enforcing agencies. a report in this daily on saturday, quoting home minister sahara khatun said that at least 1,479 women were raped in six months beginning from january of 2009. reportedly, around 3,584 and 3,462 women were violated in 2007 and 2008 respectively.
social attitude towards women must change
violence against women in different forms happens everyday everywhere in the world. but the causes behind the violence vary, depending on which society one is talking about. and in each and every incident of violence against women, in the case of sex-related ones in particular, it is always the male who is taking advantage of the victim's weakness. and the weakness can be both physical and social in origin.
endless violence and continuing mistrust
terrorism's endless cycle," said a pakistani newspaper. consecutive suicide bombings in peshawar, followed by the bomb blast near the indian embassy at kabul, topped by tehrik-e-taliban attack on army ghq in rawalpindi, one of the most sensitive places in pakistan, raise questions about the effectiveness of military operations both in afghanistan and in pakistan. military actions in swat and malakand have only moved the terrorists to other areas near to islamabad and outside the federally administrated tribal areas (fata).
the world's friend?
a storm has developed around the political world on the awarding of the nobel peace prize to president barack hussein obama. is this award given only for achievement? strange! the peace award has been given to so many distinguished personalities, but where is peace in the world? the world has increasingly been burdened with occupations, wars, oppression, subjugation, deception, deprivation, arms race, nuclear proliferation, foreign interference, unilateralism, torture cells, religious extremisms, all forms of terrorism including state terrorism etc. my sense is that this award is meant for those who have been making serious efforts towards ending at least some of these evils that have been responsible for the "non-peace" situation in the world. view the page sports
