"goom" (forced disappearance) syndrome!
mysterious disappearances have now gripped the country. every day people are disappearing and in most of the cases they do not reappear. this sort of disappearance cannot take place in a civilised country. so i believe we are still uncivilised. all of a sudden anybody can lose his/her near and dear ones. if such disappearances continue, then the whole nation will live in constant fear and become mentally ill. enmity may be the main reason behind disappearance. enmity may exist among friends, neighbours, colleagues at work and among members of the ruling parties or opposition.

nationalise non-govt. primary schools
