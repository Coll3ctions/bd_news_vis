child workers
childhood is the time for studying, playing and growing up. but in bangladesh children are working in factories, small shops, tea stalls and where not. they are deprived of their basic rights like education, food, shelter and healthcare.
traffic rules
on november 01, i started my journey at 7:00am from motijheel and reached uttara at 9:00am. i waited for about 40 minutes at moghbazar crossing. i did not notice any extra activities of traffic police to implement the new traffic rules. there are two cng filling stations at moghbazar crossing, which creates severe traffic jam. traffic police do not take any action against haphazard parking near the cng filling stations.
errors in textbooks
it is a matter of regret that our textbooks contain many errors; especially english and bengali textbooks of hsc published this year contain lots of wrong information and spelling mistakes. because of lack of supply, many students couldn't buy the original books.
higher education in bangladesh
in bangladesh, everybody is talking about “quality education” from top to bottom. there are more than 86 higher educational institutions in bangladesh. every day, news appears in the media on quality education. but the reality is very different.
for a better society
the education minister has said that he would introduce moral lessons in the new syllabus. and the govt. is going to enact a new law against stalking.
political parties
we hope our political parties will think about the future of the country. they should work for the benefit of the people. we do not want to see them blaming each other. we want to see both the parties in the parliament.
corruption
the sabri brothers undoubtedly took qaw'wali, especially natia and sufi qaw'wali to the very apex of the difficult but thoroughly intoxicating rendering of the munificent majesty of allah and the deeds of the prophet. one of their all-time popular qaw'walis of 25-30 years ago, is “paisa bolta hai (money talks)”, where they decried the use of currency notes, on the one hand, for payment of zakat, fitra and other good deeds, while on the other hand, the same notes being used for payment of bribes, corruption of all sorts, and white and blue collar crimes and vices.
stalking
almost every day there is a report in the media of stalking. yet the government continues to say that the law and order situation in the country is good. i wonder when they will admit the truth. deaths resulting from stalking are quite frequent and it is on the rise.
taking care of a male child
it is said that a child's mental maturity is no better than an unintelligent creature. when a baby boy grows up to the age of going to school, dependency on his mother gradually decreases and he starts following the men around him. he follows his father, elder brother and teachers. the environment of his family and school is very much responsible for his grooming. i would like to request all parents and teachers to take care of their sons and students. the teachers should discuss with the parents if they find any deviation in the students' attitude.
teachers
teaching is a profession different from others in the context of nature, motives and status. our education system has many limitations resulting in acute socio-economic problems. most of our teachers lack the qualities they should have to teach. very few are familiar with the participatory method of teaching. most of them lack proper trainings and, therefore, 'training of teachers' should be arranged for them.
child rights
it creates a mental pressure on me when i see a poor boy or girl begging in front of my school. i feel intolerable pain when i see a girl or a boy working in a restaurant where i am eating. we often forget that they are also human beings and they have some basic rights too. this situation cannot continue anymore.
runa laila's affection
at present runa laila is performing as one of the chief judges of channel i “shera konthon - 2010” competition. the last episode of the singing contest was held at an old-age home in gazipur. it was indeed an entertaining programme attended by some of our respectable senior citizens staying at that place. in that programme the celebrated singer, out of her deep affection for children, said that one of the contestants was like her son. a nice gesture of goodwill and motherly feelings indeed! as far as i can remember, she had also pronounced another boy as her son during last year's contest.
a plot of land
musa ibrahim is a victim of gross injustice. musa brought immense honour to bangladesh by becoming the first bangladeshi to scale mount everest. a remarkable achievement for any person, but for a man from a country that doesn't have snow, ice, or mountains on which he could practice, it's simply phenomenal. he risked his life to accomplish his dreams and bring honour and glory to bangladesh.

a home, the streets and revolutions
moudud ahmed enlightened us somewhat the other day. the matter of begum zia's residence, said he, would be handled politically on the streets. and that is precisely where the enlightenment comes in. all these years we had thought issues of public interest were dealt with politically in parliament. the streets, if you must know, are a perfect spot for agitation. and agitation, if you have some idea of the way politics works, is something we resort to when the space for politics is either too narrow for us or does not exist at all.
plans for higher-level meetings in future
saarc is a regional political entity, and bangladesh is keen to have close relations with all countries within the saarc, including pakistan, for addressing the common challenges of poverty and underdevelopment of the region.
the psychology of development
development is a continuous process of change from the existing level to the planned new level. it implies that the level aimed at is better than the past one. it is necessary, however, to limit the development goals in terms of what to achieve or in what direction a particular action must be taken. for example, one may think of development objectives as improving people's level of living by increasing production, increasing workers' productivity, fulfilling targets, improving educational and health standards etc.
child labour poverty linkage
the recent progress in bangladesh measured by the undp hdi is encouraging. the country ranks 129 in hdi among 169 countries reported. the improvement is quite prominent -- 17 steps forward compared to the previously reported 146th position. in the area of human resources development the country's achievement is even greater.
slow but steady
we are passing through a difficult time because of price hike of essential items like rice, edible oil, vegetables etc. the government wanted to keep the people in peace through presenting two satisfactory budgets. but things did not happen the way it wanted them to. however, the opposition parties, particularly bnp, are not bothering much about a national issue like price hike. they are concentrating more on private issues of the bnp chairperson.
