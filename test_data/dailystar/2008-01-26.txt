bangladesh, the country (state) which contemplated at her birth in 1971 to control almost all aspects of the nation's economy, has been surprisingly overwhelmed by the doctrine of “laissez faire” of market economy. so much so, that the government seems to have drifted from the position of a manager of the economy to a mere spectator. however, this level of romance with the market economy results not only from the prodding of the donors (world bank, adb, eus and so on) but also from the wrong perception about the working of the modern market economy and misplaced emphasis on national priorities at the policy level.

salim al-deen
last year was one of the most fruitful for salim al-deen, whom i have been calling 'salim bhai' ever since we met in sharif mia's canteen at dhaka university nearly some forty years ago. a driven, work-obsessed and rather tensed individual, although never without a sense of humour and an indulging attention to friends, he spent the year basking in public adoration, and creatively engaging himself with ever more challenging tasks. the year began with his receiving the ekushey award for his contribution to theatre, a belated recognition that nevertheless, gave him immense joy. it was not salim al-deen the state has honoured, he told me in reply to my congratulatory call, but our indigenous theatre - which he lived and died for, literally speaking. throughout last year, he also received rave reviews for his latest narrative shornoboyal, which the weekly 2000 published in its eid issue as upakhyan, but which salim called akhyan and many others called natak or drama or even novel. confusion about its genre aside, shornoboyal was a splendid piece of work - well-wrought, profound and passionate, with a language the mongal geeti writers would be proud of. then there was nimojjon, a stage play that his long-time comrade-in-arms nasiruddin yusuf bachchu culled from a long and complex narrative. it was something like shornoboyal but had a more global perspective, since its subject was war and the unspeakable things people do in the name of war. salim bhai and bachchu formed one of the most productive and close-knit theatre teams that i've seen anywhere, and together they've given a rich trove of dramatic productions to our theatre - kittonkhola, keramat mongal, prachya, hathodai, joiboti konyar mon, horgoj, bonopangshul, to name only a few. bachchu had an implicit understanding of salim bhai's thoughts and philosophy, his idea of theatre and, more importantly, how our own theatre should shape up. watching a performance of nimojjon a few months back, i marveled at the uncanny way bachchu had sculpted the finished version out of a myriad of different plots and ideas and characters that crowded the seemingly endless narrative.
good-bye my friend, it's hard to die —
once again i am reminded of the mahabharata. dharma quizzed a thirsty yudhisthira on the bank of a lake, at the price of his life: “what is the greatest marvel?” all four of his brothers lay dead, having failed to answer dharma's riddle. the exiled yudhisthira replied unhesitatingly: “each day, death strikes and we live as though we were immortal. this is what is the greatest marvel.” as i write this, salim al-deen lies buried at the jahangirnagar university campus. i did not pay my last respects as he lay at shaheed minar nor visit his grave. there is something uncanny about a dead person. it is not the pallor but the uncanny stillness. now freud admonishes me with a smile: “everything is unheimlich [uncanny] that ought to have remained secret but has come to light.” it is then that salim al-deen's face melts into the lake from where issues once again dharma's question. i can see my face reflected in the dead. suddenly, the eyes open. they stare back unblinkingly. i forget my thirst for life. i run away - in exile... view the page strategic issues
peace and security in the 21st century: possible responses
although it is true to say that eruption of armed conflict among world's major powers is unlikely, serious differences persist on the emergence of the new world order of the 21st century.
the palestinian dimension: prediction for escalation
although there has been an increase in israeli threats of invading gaza, it appears as though israel will not invade and occupy gaza. rather, it will continue with its current policy attacking targets daily, both facilities and persons from the air. at the same time, israel will continue the policy of containing hamas, militarily, politically and economically by continuing the severe civilian and economic closure and siege of the gaza strip.
india's emerging strategic security paradigm and sri lanka policy -- part-i
the sri lanka government has formally ended its ceasefire agreement signed in 2002 with the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte). it only regularises an existing state of war that had been going on since december 2005. it is a sad development because it shuts the door on the peace process sponsored by the tokyo donors conference. while the four co-chairs of the tokyo conference the eu, japan, norway and the us, can walk out of the peace process, india, as a close strategic neighbour of sri lanka, cannot afford to ignore the development. it will also face the fall out of yet another round of full-scale war in sri lanka in some ways, because india-sri lanka relations have become closer than ever before. view the page star books review
understanding the american ethos
"impatience with theories, ideas --- the entire practice and process of abstract thought --- is perhaps the most common manifestation of anti-intellectualism throughout american popular culture and average americans' day-to-day lives. therefore, it should be no surprise when that attitude is found even in magazine coverage of higher education --- the one institution in which americans have expected (not to say preferred) and perhaps even tolerated this core requirement of intellectual activity.” although these lines are to be found towards the end of an absorbing book, in a chapter (6) pertinently titled “unreflective instrumentalism, hedonism, sexism, and age discrimination”, they encapsulate the general drift of anti-intellectualism in american media: magazines & higher education. and the author, while ending the previous chapter (5), entitled “populist anti-elitism and higher education”, bemoans such a state of affairs thus: “however, the needs and opportunities in the united states in the areas of arts, sciences, government, journalism, retail politics, and the overall american culture and american society --- even the complexity of day-to-day life for the average citizen --- suggest that more citizens, not fewer, should be learning, and not only a finite amount for a degree, but learning more and more over a longer period of time. unfortunately, american anti-intellectualism makes the idea of even necessary, let alone optional, lifelong learning a tough sell.”
reflections, reminiscences and beyond
partly nostalgic narrative, partly political diatribe and partly a journal of self-discovery, tirtha amar gram (holy is my village) is an amalgam of poignant, vibrant pieces by dr. mizanur rahman, an expatriate in canada for over five decades now. it is an impressive example of a new genre, a dovetailing of reminiscent sketches with the prevailing socio-political agenda. he first wrote these pieces for bangla journals published from ottawa, new york and new jersey.
a tale that no one might remember
what started out as a short story titled sundowners in the new yorker in 2006 later developed into the novel alentejo blue. it is monica ali's second novel. her much acclaimed first work brick lane was about a bangladeshi village girl named nazneen, who moved to london after her marriage. the novel of 400 pages revolves around her life along with a parallel story of her sister hasina, who lives a perilous life on meagre earnings.

the real lives of europe's most infamous rulers
c.s. denton
arcturus
a riveting series of essays on all the cruel men and women who once ran riot across europe. but there are the helpless and misunderstood ones as well, such as louis xvi and his empress. it is a work that brings alive the darkness that for long pervaded europe until thoughts of democracy began to make inroads.
