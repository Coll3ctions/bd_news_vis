the case that changed history
thirty five bengalis, accused of conspiracy to break up pakistan through declaring its eastern province as an independent state, were produced before a special tribunal on june 19, 1968. the agartala conspiracy case instituted by the government of pakistan against bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and thirty-four other bengalis remains a point of reference for students of bangladesh's history. much debate has ensued about the way the case changed the course of bengali history and transformed the nature of politics and geography in south asia, especially in the context of pakistan and bangladesh. there remains the opinion of those who have believed that the case effectively hastened the fall of the military regime of field marshal ayub khan. there are yet others who have held fast to the idea that when the pakistan government decided to go ahead with the case and in fact gave formal shape to it, the state of pakistan, by nature fragile, took an inexorable step toward decline in its eastern province.
