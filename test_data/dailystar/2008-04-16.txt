incentives for sme development
the bangladesh bank governor has said recently that the government is considering providing incentives for small and medium enterprises (sme) and food processing industries. the sector deserves massive support and assistance from the government since these have the potential to generate investment, attempt innovation and diversification and employ a large work force, both skilled and semi-skilled. the other advantage is, smes do not require heavy machinery or huge start-up capital and therefore they can go into production and earn dividends after a short gestation period.
potatoes, politics and a few other things
politics and potatoes have been getting into a rather interesting mix of late. with the caretaker government letting us in on the thought that one way of handling all those problems relating to rice would be for us to go for a consumption of potatoes, it is quite evident why potatoes should now take centre stage in our thoughts.

learn from tourists
in few departments of the game have bangladesh been visibly better than pakistan in this series. their batting, though improving, has been fitful and when they have scored runs, they have given away the fruits of their effort. their bowling has broadly been ineffective, save the admirable mashrafe mortaza. bangladesh's youth possibly edges the fielding stakes, though not by much.

cultural identity
we have a very rich culture. if we just think about 'pahela baishakh' we will understand that we do not have to borrow anything from the western world. but it seems that we are ignoring our own culture. our dress is getting westernised and we have lost faith in family values which were once the foundation of society. however, the worst thing is what we are doing in the name of so-called individualism. culture is very important for a nation. but it cannot be retained by observing only some events on some days. we have to treat it as having a lot to do with our identity.
women's rights
it is very sad that some people in our country do not know how to think outside the box. if women get equal rights in every aspect, everyone in our society benefits because these women are either our sisters or mothers. when my mother gets equal share in her parent's property, i benefit from that. my sisters and i are born of the same parents; sharing parental property with my sisters only makes me happy because it helps my nieces and nephews.
save buriganga
the buriganga river is dying. do we care? i do not think so. while the dwellers of dhaka city are neglecting this issue, the river is slowly losing its life day by day. we ourselves are to be blamed for this. it was because of us that buriganga river is drying up. the government is not doing anything to stop the industrial units surrounding the river from spewing out dangerous chemicals into the river. the government must take appropriate steps to stop further pollution of buriganga water so that the aquatic lives are saved.

shocking indeed
it's deeply disheartening that police and activists of the anti-quran law resistance committee, on the very premises of a sacred place like baitul mukarram national mosque, engaged in clashes and turned it into a battlefield.
our problems
i do not disagree with the letter published on 6th april, 2008 entitled, 'ostrich mentality'. i also do not believe that our 'think tank' has dried out of ideas that would soothe the immensity of the dry season power-cuts and water shortage. foreigners often complain that bangladeshis are not being sensitive enough to their problems. water shortage and power cuts are tolerated and accepted with great patience.
higher education
to be frank, as a vigilant and regular student of a university, i watch too many irregularities and anomalies at my university. it is clear to all that the institutional objective of this university is to gain profit by fleecing students, rather than imparting education. they (management) want more money ignoring the students' financial condition. they never listen to what the students may have to say.
upsetting the democratic trend
the wise remarks of the former chief adviser justice habibur rahman at the national citizen's dialogue as reported in most papers on 7th. april are a very timely and relevant advice to the present ctg and its mentors. we could have on a short-term basis involved the men behind the scene in an anti corruption operation, and cleaning up of the police establishment with no strings attached. but influencing governance from behind the scene is not the proper method to adopt. authority without responsibility is the harbinger of instability and other serious issues that destabilise democracy in the long term; though appearing very rosy in the short term! this is unfortunately happening in bangladesh. it is a fundamental political and governance issue that the nation must resolve, if we want democracy to survive and flourish in the long-term.
cruelty to animals
our treatment of animals should be kind. animals are often mistreated or killed unnecessarily. a few days ago i was stuck and unable to move at uttara at around 10:am and i witnessed the cruel act of a man. i had dropped my daughter to school and was waiting for the traffic to clear up. i noticed two goats tied tightly to the roof grill of a bus. it was sunny, hot and crowded and the goats' owner ensured that the goats did not fall down. the two ropes were pressed round the necks of the two fragile animals pressing against the arteries. i reckoned it would have been better had the goats' waist or legs (say "wrists") were tightened.
trial of politicians
it is more than a year, the caretaker government arrested the politicians on charges of corruption and misuse of power. but till today the jailed leaders have not been tried.
people's plight
recently, the daily jugantor published an article “will the people survive?” the news didn't escape the eyes of voracious newspaper readers like me. nowadays, such articles flood the front pages of the dailies with awkward but colourful and lively photos where we see a long queue of hungry people standing in front of any bdr outlet. who doesn't know that a huge number of people are now passing their days amid great uncertainty? how long can they fight to survive?
gulshan traffic
at the crossing of gulshan road no. 50 and kamal ata turk avenue, traffic coming from kamal ata turk avenue is allowed to turn right. also traffic coming from road 50 is allowed to turn right. for some unknown reason, traffic coming from gulshan 2 is not allowed to enter road 50. instead, that traffic is required to make a u -turn at banani . the crossing at banani serves in-coming and out-going traffic of road no.11 and also the traffic of road no. 27 of banani.

remove the dustbin
i would like to draw the attention of the authorities concerned to the dustbin lying on the east/sukarabad side of the mirpur road near the brac bank (dhanmondi branch) and daffodil international university. beside the dustbin there is a narrow pavement which is fenced by a wall on its eastern side. over the pavement, there are hanging electrical wires. a flock of crows always remains sitting on the wires in the hope of collecting foods from the dustbin. hundreds of people including school going boys & girls, office going people and others have to walk along this pavement every day, but often they face an odd situation when the crows….

“histological” examination of history
it appears from one of the news items of today's (12 april 2008) ds: prof. anwar hossain of the history department of dhaka university noted, “it is not history, rather information on the liberation war was distorted.” the professor was speaking at a book publication ceremony at liberation war museum in the capital. eminent jurist dr. kamal hossain also reportedly spoke on the occasion.
gm foods
nowadays gm(genetically modified) crops are a much talked about subject. of course it is more productive than local crops. but we should also not forget that quality is often more important than quantity. still we don't know we are consuming some gm crops. this may expose us to certain physical disorders.

near the newly built posh biam center at new eskaton, on 5th of march, 08, i was wondering about the unusual gathering of a large number of hatirpool slum dwellers. while still getting deeper to biam, i found a contingent of police, some of them were right inside the slum to ensure safe eviction and some others outside were probably waiting for a provocation. i soon then realised the very purpose of the helpless congregation. the sight of the poor driven out slum dwellers was very sad and pathetic. some little children were seen playing around the gathered shabby belongings of theirs. the bigger kids were seen really upset and sharing thoughts with their elders "where shall we go?" the moments of tension made it appear more pathetic and unveiled the cruel reality. their half starved physical appearance and popped up eyes looked helpless. the eviction of this old slum was either to construct a road for easy movement to posh biam center-cum school where mostly wards of quick rich governments officials make the most out of it, or make a way for posh apartments for quick rich people. we condemn this inhuman act of bulldozing the slum.
rickshaws
i would have found mr. mohammed rahat's letter on the subject in ds of 10 apr 08 and earlier, his and that of mr farzand ahmed of bangkok, hilarious, if they had not dealt with the very serious problem of dhaka's traffic jams so flippantly. these two gentlemen seem to be living in an illusory utopia, with their heads in the sand like ostriches. mr. rahat brushes aside the existence of rickshaws and those connected with them with such demeaning expressions as “cancer, nuisance, inhuman, epidemic” and calls for their 'elimination' shades of auschwitz!
rice scarcity
last week, i visited some bdr shops and saw the situation of our country. the queues of people in front of bdr rice selling centres in capital dhaka and other major townships across the country turned longer this week with increasing number of people joining them. while visiting some bdr outlets, it could be noticed that the majority of the people in the line for rice were women, some cradling their babies in their arms in the unbearable summer heat. view the page international
