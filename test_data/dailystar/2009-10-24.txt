work culture in foreign missions
the foreign minister's upbraiding of bangladesh's overseas mission staffs for their poor coordination, which is impacting the job markets there for local manpower, can hardly be gainsaid. if truth be told, a harder look at the bangladesh foreign missions would reveal lapses in their performance record other than the one the minister has identified. and the lack of coordination among the different sections of the missions is also not the only shortcoming they suffer from, although clearly it is a major one.

tackling those shadowy figures
there is no denying that the december 2008 general election of bangladesh was an outstanding feat in the annals of democracy in our part of the world. the awami league won the polls with a thumping majority. the verdict at the hustings was loud and clear. there is, therefore, a surge of expectations amongst the electorate from a government that comes as a result of such clear mandate. however, the premonition that is lurking in many hearts is whether those in charge of managing the affairs of the state are faltering or getting stalled on account of the malevolence of not-too-visible elements.

kashmir without soul
it is unbelievable, but true. srinagar has changed beyond recognition these past four years since i was last there. from the new swanky airport to the hotel, about 10 kilometres, there is modern construction. it looks as if another noida, near delhi, is coming up. trees, however, have been cut mercilessly and familiar pavements dug out to accommodate fancy thoroughfares. walls running along the road have been demolished and the rubble is still there for all to see. probably something new and modern will replace what once aroused feelings of nostalgia. as i covered the journey to my hotel, i missed the old kashmiri houses from where women with long trinkets would peer to see the incoming tourists.

challenges for bangladesh
bangladesh is recognized to be one of the most susceptible countries in the world, highly vulnerable to climatic manifestations (short-term and long-term impacts of climate change) due to its unique geographic location, hydro-geological characters like dominance of floodplains, low elevation from the sea and lastly the socio-economical characters like high population density, high levels of poverty, and overwhelming dependence on nature. unfortunately, the country's future is now trapped between the melting himalayas in the north and the encroaching bay of bengal to the south.

walking the lunatic fringe: blake at bone hill
there is a fine line between lunacy and genius. the romantic poet william blake walked that fine line. as a child blake reportedly saw god's head at his window; he and his wife were so fascinated by milton's paradise lost that they used to roam naked in their house at lambeth palace in london; he said 'damn your king' to a police constable that led to an indictment with sedition charges'; and he considered milton (like him) as a member of the “devil's party”. this is the same man who created a body of work that includes jerusalem, four zoas, the marriage of heaven and hell, and the ostensibly simple songs of innocence and of experience. while blake's lunacy is considered a matter of dispute, his genius is recognized beyond any doubt.

afghanistan war: another angle
this article is primarily in response to mr. billy ahmed's article on 10 october 2009 entitled “afghanistan war: can the us win?” the writer, like so many others, painted a gloomy picture of war where us was portrayed as the aggressor and ordinary afghans as the victims. according to him, the talibans were engaged in a war of resistance and further us reinforcement into afghanistan would only cause more us and afghan casualties. the end result, according to him, would be a vietnam-like debacle for the us and the west. he quotes a number of anti-war critics, as well as a “leading islamic scholar” in usa named imam zaid shakir, whose prescription for president obama to end the war in afghanistan was to “blame it on bush and get out.” i would argue that despite the bad news coming out of afghanistan, all is not lost.
military gains upper hand in conflict over us aid in pakistan
the things that are currently happening in pakistan are unbelievable. suicide and ordinary bombings causing deaths and destruction that are “breaking news” elsewhere are ordinary news in pakistan. but the attack by the militants on the army headquarter in rawalpindi early this month is absurd even by pakistani standards. the militants followed the rawalpindi attack with three attacks simultaneously carried out in lahore on top security installations that have underscored the tightening of alliance between the taliban, al qaeda and militant groups in punjab.

tales told by a global nomad
raana haider is a spirited storyteller. and the stories she relates have all been part of her life, for she has been a pivotal figure in them all. she has seen it all. her writing is fast paced and her diction vibrant and substantive. as you turn the pages of this work (it would not do to simply call it a travelogue, for there is much more to it than that), you understand the human understanding and the depth of appreciation she brings to her tales. for fragrance of the past is about the good times lost in history. if you have cared about marco polo and hiuen tsang and vasco da gama, enough to recall the world they saw opening up before them, you will read haider. she subtitles her work a middle eastern itinerary. in a broad sense, though, it transcends geography and reaches out to the ages of glory that simply do not happen to be there any more.
fundamental issues beyond personal grievance
notes from a prison bangladesh is a disturbing book, written by a deeply aggrieved man. as things stand, bangladesh is a deeply divided nation over a few serious, and some maddeningly asinine, issues (or, rather, non-issues), and the chasm seems to be getting wider and deeper. for the country's sake, one can only hope that sanity will return, and the ominous fissure will shrink before the possibility of a bloody internecine strife becomes a reality. and, lest one forgets, that very rift was a key factor in facilitating the kind of regime that prompted muhiuddin khan alamgir to spill his guts out in print over the treatment he received at its hands. notes from a prison bangladesh is a litany of complaints, often vitriolic, written in a no-holds-barred style, of an outraged person, that is true, but it is also a book that compels one to think about political legitimacy, constitutionality, and undesirable aberrations in the practice of liberal democracy.
