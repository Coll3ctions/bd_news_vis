the expectations in 2011
the year 2011 is already upon us. and it is as good a time as any to look forward to what the nation ought to expect from the government, given its record in the year just gone by. the first point to note is some intrinsic strengths the government possesses, mainly by virtue of its three-fourths majority in parliament, whereby the ruling party can show magnanimity by giving the opposition some space. for its part, the opposition, being a crucial component of democracy, must come to terms with its own responsibilities to its constituents and to the country through opting for active participation in the jatiyo sangsad. reverting to the performance of the government, we are deeply distressed at the cavalier manner in which a number of so-called politically motivated cases have been withdrawn. we believe the law should have been allowed to run its course. such withdrawals of cases have only raised questions about the future of the rule of law. in addition, there has been a clear degree of politicization of the bureaucracy. appointments to administrative positions along partisan lines have obviously undermined morale in the civil service, something we should have done without.

the global economy in 2011
we are cautiously optimistic on the global economic outlook in 2011 and beyond. we expect sustained above-trend expansion and forecast global gross domestic produce (gdp) growth of about 3.5 percent in 2011 and 4 percent in 2012. global growth is rarely uniform, but the current recovery is more uneven across major economies than usual. the developed countries overall should record only modest growth in 2011 because of private sector deleveraging and, in many cases, fiscal consolidation. divergences are likely to remain acute in the euro-area, with continued above-trend growth in germany but little or no growth in the periphery countries like greece and portugal. the emerging markets in asia should again outperform the other regions as the expansions in china and india will continue, not only in 2011 but also for many years to come.

sham economic growth
g.d.p, expressed in arithmetical number, is the barometer to measure economic development of a country. obviously, the question is does it stand true to what it is intended for? a cursory look at the state of affairs obtaining in developed and developing economies all over the world will provide instant answer. it is apparent that though a good many countries show meteoric g.d.p growth and high rise of income and wealth, yet the fruits of development do not reach equally, or even at all, to all the segments of the population. in fact, the rich and poor divide further widens and the number of poor multiplies.

morality and secularism
morality is the only virtue that makes human race a nation, and even a man great. the international, national, social and family problems that we are facing nowadays are due to lack of morality. all thoughtful people's opinion regarding morality is almost similar. every religion teaches morality and the believers practice it whole-heartedly. in our society, the best way of teaching morality is to teach religion. the teaching of making a believer is more important than the teaching that makes a person mere educated. view the page international
