we hail press council verdict
we hail the verdict of the press council (pc) regarding some recent false, fabricated and motivated reports in the daily kaler kantha. we are happy to note the clarity and emphatic manner in which the press council reached its decision. indeed, it is refreshing to observe that the body has reasserted its ability and capacity to adjudicate matters concerning the media. this surely augurs well for journalism especially given the fact that recourse to the pc holds out the promise of the proceedings being less time consuming and decisive. we would like to advise everyone involved with the media and also readers that in cases where media houses and individuals might feel aggrieved by other media reports, they can take the perfectly logical step of recording their grievances with the press council. such a step, besides preventing journalists from being harassed unnecessarily, will be a spur to future activism on the part of the pc. the council's potential should now dawn on those needing it in future.

why is authority silent?
dhaka is now known as the city of traffic jam. among the various problems of this city, traffic jam is the most discussed which we face every day from the very dawn to late night. one has to spend two and a half hours to reach dhanmondi from airport only for traffic jam. we often see vehicles parked on the roads defying legislation and common sense. one of the main causes of this traffic jam is illegal parking of vehicles on the roads. most of the shopping malls in dhaka city have no parking place. the administration seems to keep silent and don't take action against illegal parking and shopping mall authorities. can we ask the authority why does it not take action against them?
check population growth
we know that large population is considered as an asset of a country but it is considered as a burden if they are unskilled and unproductive. the rate of population growth in our country is 1.4%. in our neighboring countries like sri lanka and maldives it is 0.9% and 0.5%. now the population of our country is 16.44 crores. what will happen in 2025? every year more than two million people are added to our population. it is time we include a lesson on the adverse effect of having large family in primary and secondary education. family planning system in our country is not satisfactory due to shortage of employee. conscious people, mass media and govt. should join hands to minimize the population growth if we want to make a digital bangladesh.
theft of oms rice
being concerned with the increased price of rice and other commodities, the govt. has been trying to meet that demand with open market sales (oms). though the supply is not enough at oms, but it acts like a circuit breaker against the dire need of rice across the country. now, we get news of commercial sale of the oms rice! moreover, irregularities in management of sales schedule, corruption of the local dealers of oms have made the fruition of oms a far cry for the rural people. the govt. must take effective and proactive initiatives in ensuring the proper management of the open market sale before it becomes another tale of agony!
it's the cars not rickshaws
mr rahat of malibagh (ds 18 april) continues to pour vitriol on rickshaws whose 'crime' is to provide dhakabashis with cheap, convenient and pollution free transportation that the gas guzzling monstrosities can never do. astonishingly, he has still not realized what causes traffic jams. in any rickshaw-free road (picture, ds 19/04/11) it is the 5 lacs cars, parked or speeding that are to blame for the jams. if the rickshaw - van pullers turn violent sometimes, it is to protest against the repression of police, who otherwise fawn over the blatant violation of traffic laws by the ggms. further, is this deprivation not a flagrant violation of the constitutional rights of rickshawalas to access public roads for their livelihood?
jihad and fatwa: some misconceptions
the meaning of the arabic word "jihad" is "to strive/to struggle". for example, if anybody earns his livelihood by staying in the right path then it too is one kind of jihad. out of various categories of jihad, one category is "to struggle against oppression or injustice". in our country many organizations in the name of islam or jihad, are killing innocent human beings which is strictly prohibited in islam. these people are extremist or terrorist. another burning question is, whether fatwa is harmful and should it be banned? actually, if anybody abuse fatwa should be given severe punishment. but that doesn't mean that fatwa should be banned. for example, if anybody kills an innocent human being by using a pistol then surely it will not be logical to ban pistol.
we should have nuclear power plant
in response to the letter of nur jahan published on april 01, 2011 in the daily star, i am writing this letter since i personally disagree with her point that we should forget the idea of nuclear power plant. in my opinion her solemn suggestion is lame, when it comes to greater benefit for the nation. to be logical i have to pose some questions like- if we think of merely setting up coal and gas based power plants instead of nuclear ones, then how long do we expect these natural resources to be lasting to serve this very purpose? and when they are depleted indicating alternative sources being employed, what will happen then? bangladesh government should go on with its primary nuclear deal with russia to help build its first nuclear power plant, which should be in operation in 2014-2015.

hindi songs on pahela baishakh
i went to ramna park to celebrate pahela baishakh. on my entrance to the park i noticed an ongoing concert on the premises of institute of engineers, bangladesh sponsored by royal tiger energy drink. none can overlook the huge round of applause by a group of youngsters when a female artist dancingly sang out “shila ki jawani...” on stage. i was quite embarrassed to witness such activities. it was a 'hindinized' pahela baishakh , insulting to our very culture and language.
defending illegal actions
i am confused about the new policy concerning rivers. it seems that the concept of 'river-narrowing' is a new way of excusing the authorities from prosecuting those who grab land beside rivers because all they are doing is 'narrowing' a river.
we condemn this act of servility
in the past we have seen that students of different institutions used to get lined up on either side of the street with small flags in their hands to greet the head of the state visiting our country. but now the same thing has become a ritual even for a minister, visiting a district or his constituency. we learnt that the ministry of education has strictly forbidden this practice to relieve students from this laborious process. however, some over enthusiastic party activists flouting the directive amass students from different institutions and kept them standing for hours in the parching weather against their will just to please the minister. it is also reported that many students especially girl students fell sick due to heat and dehydration. we strongly protest this act of servility and urge that this practice be stopped immediately.
please do something
our policy makers have a slogan, 'steps towards change'. we still believe in this motto. but we the 3340 frustrated youths who have been selected for the non-cadre service in 29th b.c.s remain unemployed. our future looks bleak from the experience of 28th b.c.s. we have relevant information that there are nearly 38000 non-cadre first class vacant posts in different ministries. i am an ardent believer in the actions of the head of the state as well as the head of the govt. we have a heart-felt plea that their excellencies will soothe our anguish in which we are groaning.
frequent short circuit incidents
incidents due to short circuits have increased. on 17th march 2011, there was a fire incident due to electrical short circuit occurred in my home at popular housing-1, barabagh, mirpur-2. it's a five storied building and eight families live here. all of us got stuck in the smoke. later the electric rescue team from desco disconnected the main wire from the pole and all of us were saved from a fatal incident. thanks to desco team. i am also extending my sincere thanks to desco, kallayanpur team for reconnecting my electricity without any hassle. now my earnest request to desco/desa and other electrical agencies to find the reasons for these frequent short circuit and take necessary action to reduce these incidents
an appeal to the lhc
our understanding of the universe is about to change by the outcomes in the gigantic experiment of the large hadron collider (lhc) conducted by european organization for nuclear research (cern). it will revolutionize our understanding, from the minuscule world deep within atoms to the vastness of the universe. the lhc will not be completed until the people of backward societies in every corner of the world in superstition-chain will not be enlightened with the true knowledge of nature. so, we appeal to the lhc to work on complete eradication of false notions about nature from people's mind.
