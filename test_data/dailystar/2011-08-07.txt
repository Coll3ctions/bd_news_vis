thailand's new leader
thailand enters a new and pretty uncertain era under yingluck shinawatra. it is not just that she is the country's first woman prime minister but also that she takes office with so many expectations of her from her supporters. a particular reason why ms. yingluck's rise to power is remarkable is that she does not have a history of active politics behind her and that she takes centre stage only five years after her populist sibling thaksin shinawatra was overthrown by the military. in a country where 18 coups and attempted coups have undermined democracy since 1932, the new prime minister cannot but tread carefully. view the page sports
abahani hit jackpot
young goalkeeper shahedul alam sohel repeated his semifinal heroics to save two shots from the spot to guide abahani to a 3-2 tie-break win and the crore taka grameenphone super cup triumph at the bangabandhu national stadium yesterday. the regulation time of the marquee final against archrivals mohammedan had ended with the score on 2-2, and thirty minutes of extra time failed to yield any result, leading to the shoot-out which was eventually won by the sky blues.
2nd time lucky
as soon as the final whistle was blown, a few thousand spectators from the western stands came sprawling over the barbed wires and stormed onto the pitch. it was a sweet reprieve for the sky blues faithful who had witnessed their bitter rivals mohammedan seize an early grip on the final. the crore-taka title, which was the only domestic trophy to have eluded the vaunted sky blues' cabinet, was grabbed at the second attempt after the 2009 disappointment against mohammedan. this time, however, it was abahani's turn to pocket the 1-crore purse while mohammedan were left licking their wounds with tk 20 lakh.

tcb in soup
the trading corporation of bangladesh, the sole government trading body that secures imports for the country from the private importers, is having a tough time with the importers. they struck deals with tcb that they would supply essentials during the month of ramadan and made a back track with their promised deal with the alibi that the prices they had quoted in their bids were much lower than the existing price currently in effect in the market. eleven importers have signed agreement with the tcb to supply one lakh twelve thousand tons of sugar from which six companies have expressed their inability to supply the sugar. in addition to that, four companies, signed contracts with tcb to supply nineteen thousand six hundred tons of soybean oil, has also conveyed their inability of supplying the oil. they even have told the tcb that it can forfeit their performance guarantee money due to breach in contract. it is learnt from the reliable sources that the importers can yield hefty profits even after the deduction of guarantee money. this shows how prices of essentials are increasing in an unabated manner. our ministry of commerce seems totally handicapped to either contain or control the prices or these influential importers' syndicate. this is just the two examples of how these importers monopolize the market defying government directives. though it may sound ludicrous but the bare fact is that “who will bell the cat”?

restriction on rickshaws
government is constructing flyovers at different points of dhaka city and has restricted movement of rickshaws in some areas for improving the traffic jam. i am doubtful whether this will reduce the traffic jam. main reasons of traffic jam are: grabbing of footpaths by hawkers, road side parking and evading of traffic rules.
autonomy of bb and btv
ahead of each general election, the major political parties give us the assurance through their manifestos that if voted to power, they will ensure the autonomy of bangladesh betar (bb) and bangladesh television (btv). but it is regrettable that all major political parties seem to be oblivious of the issue after they are voted to power.
poor state of politics
bangladesh political culture could not get out of the bottomless basket even after four decades. political leaders do not pay much attention to the long-term development of politics remaining busy in subjective politics. the role for the society leaders is to debate the plus and minus points of dynasty politics because the two dynastic parties are not interested in raising this topic. this tendency to live in the past is having a negative and harmful effect on the new emerging young leadership which is not getting all the right inputs for future thinking. the future of this young nation looks bleak. examples of self-sacrifice are not evident in the mass media.
depleted cyclone shelter
the 'focus bangla' picture of a cyclone shelter in kalapara upazila in patuakhali, published in the pages of a local english daily on 8th july, is on the point of collapse, as it was built with cheap and poor materials.
break the circuit of corruption
the rate in which the public is taking law into their hands gives rise to this fear that time will come when they will lift the cudgel to beat the corrupt officials and politicians. however, public justice is prone to be excess as it is seen in the recent aminbazar incident. the proverb goes, while the cat's away, the mice will play. in the absence of law and order, criminals rule the roost in every sphere of life. once unknown uneducated 'zhantu' becomes unopposed leader and run roughshod over the area with immunity, thanks to party affiliation and police inaction. a chain of corruption and camaraderie complete the circuit and continue to electrocute the public. incapacitated, thus the public is waiting for brave ones to break the circuit of corruption. who will be that brave one to usher in a brave new world?
lp gas price
when gas supply is not available, people solely depend on lp gas (liquefied petroleum) for household use. but regardless of the concession in import duty, the price of lp gas is very high. the international market of the raw material of lp gas is quite stable. so what might be the cause for such kind of illogical price hike? the govt. must solve the matter urgently.
why was khaleda zia absent?
we have heard that khaleda zia, the leader of the opposition, was not present in the highest state honour conferring ceremony. president zillur rahman handed over the "bangladesh freedom honour" award to sonia gandhi on behalf of her late mother-in-law indira gandhi. it may be mentioned that indira gandhi has been honoured by bangladesh after long 40 years of its independence for her outstanding contribution to the country's liberation war in 1971. prime minister sheikh hasina, cabinet members, mps, foreign diplomats, delegation members of sonia gandhi and distinguished personalities attended the function. but the leader of the opposition of bangladesh did not attend the programme. analysis may unearth many unknown reasons behind khaleda's absence. but the image of the country has been damaged already. it also did not boost the ruling party's image. in fact, nobody was benefited by this. how can this nation get rid of these unhealthy gestures of the politicians? we do not know, to what destination our politicians will lead us.
holidays for students
the government has announced the leave schedule for students to enjoy holidays during ramadan. as per the announcement, secondary schools remained close from august 4 and madrasas from august 2 while colleges and technical institutions will remain close from august 14, and primary schools from august 17. because of the different leave schedules the parents are suffering the most and the city dwellers cannot get rid of the terrible traffic jam. a mother will have to wait till august 17 to go to her village home because her one kid got vacation from august 4 and another will get it from august 17. i earnestly request the govt. to reconsider this fact and declare a common leave schedule.
land grabbing goes on

teachings of ramadan
allah forgives us in this month of ramadan. hajrat jibrail(as) came to prophet hazrat muhammad (sm) with the holy quran in this month. there is a special night in this month when allah shows unlimited kindness towards mankind. this night is called 'lailatul qadr'. our prophet muhammad (sm) devoted himself to prayer in this month. so, we should honour this month and involve ourselves in prayers. we should be sincere in acquiring knowledge from the holy quran and try our best to establish the rules of the holy quran in the society. a man should fast to get the kindness of allah. if one fasts sincerely and follow the teachings of ramadan, a special door to the heaven named 'raihan ' will be opened for him/her forever.
