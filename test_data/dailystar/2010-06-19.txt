life in its patterns
it was an arduous albertan winter. the temperatures fell to - 45 degree centigrade. edmonton was the coldest place on the planet for a week or two. the winds moaned incessantly and snow drifts piled up high in our front lawn. nature appeared insensate. i ventured out for grocery essentials on one of those sub-zero days and thought i was in the midst of an alistair maclean's novel, namely “ice station zebra”! in times such as this, a human being asks one self... “where am i? where have i been? and... where am i going?''. then one evening there were sparks in the dark night sky. i saw flashes of the aurora borealis that only manifests itself in the arctic zone. it was eerie-the skies lit up like a fireball and then the spirit of the great north appeared to speak: “patience, my child...life unfolds in its own patterns, of which you are only a small part...embrace the north and it will embrace you.”

preventing political somersault
history of modern world agrees that in spite of the continuous barrage of advices/support/aid from the developed countries, third world countries maintain a volatile socio-political environment. military coup or multidimensional political somersault is the order of the day. it is quite unfortunate for the people and also for the leadership that they are yet to figure out how and why it happens, let alone when it takes place. it is extra conducive in a country where the leadership is encircled by associates with minimum sense of patriotism and is totally consumed in enjoying power. to avoid such intermittent political fiasco we need to learn how to detect it. only then we would probably be wise enough to prevent it.

in his cairo speech on june 5th last year, president obama had raised a great deal of hope and expectations among muslims that his administration would make sincere attempts to address their concerns. instead he has sent more troops to afghanistan and has decided to win the war against terror, primarily militarily. in iraq, there was an election that was heralded to be a major step towards establishing democracy. but three months have gone by and still a government has not been formed and though conflicts, deaths and suicide bombings have declined, iraq is far from being a safe country. president obama seems to be following the script of his predecessor.

palestinians are non-entities everywhere
on 11 august 2008, peter clark writes in a guardian obituary that as a poet, author, and politician, mahmoud darwish 'did as much as anyone to forge a palestinian national consciousness.' while clark's comment is undebatable, it is also true that darwish's poetry transcends its national boundary by reflecting on universal humane values through the mirror of the palestinian experience. it is one of the major reasons why darwish now is a great name in world literature. memory for forgetfulness is his exquisitely written prose-memoir. ibrahim muhawi's adept translation brings out the delicacy of the piece. it is based on israel's invasion of lebanon in 1982 that was aimed at wiping out the plo's base from southern lebanon. the fact seems most startling when one reads the memoir containing evocative details of beirut under siege. darwish, however, lifts up the sufferings of the invasion to an aesthetic level through his musings on reality, belonging, history, resistance and the role of art involving these. the entire book is an extended internal monologue (the poet's thoughts in his mind) about which robyn creswell writes in harper magazine's january 2009 issue:
