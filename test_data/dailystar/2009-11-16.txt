india-bangladesh foreign secretaries' meet in dhaka
the just-concluded talks between the foreign secretaries of bangladesh and india appear to have yielded some rather encouraging signs of how ties between the two countries could be taken forward along positive lines in the coming days. there can hardly be any denying that little, if any, headway could be made in resolving some major bilateral issues over the years. the mood in both capitals, however, has been undergoing a perceptible shift, particularly against the background of the re-election of the congress-led government in india and the election of a new government in bangladesh. at the operative level, this mood has been reflected in the discussions between foreign secretaries nirupama rao and mijarul quayes in dhaka.

all eyes on copenhagen
climate change is today's stark reality and there isn't any way to escape its ravages such as severe drought and intense flooding as well as frequent storms and rising sea levels. as warned by the scientists, this is already happening as demonstrated by the recent havoc in kenya, india, the philippines and bangladesh. last week, a global day of actions on climate change was observed across the world, from the bottom of the great barrier reef to the summit of mount everest. that the climate change concerns are no more in the backseat is proved through climate change rallies and other related events which all centered on the number 350 to draw attention to 350 parts per million (ppm), which the scientists say is the safe upper limit for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

the city we live in
most of the garment factories have been set up within the area of metropolitan dhaka city. it accelerated population growth in the capital. indeed over population is one of the acute problems in dhaka metropolis. the number of vehicles exceed the capacity of roads. traffic jam has virtually paralysed the capital. frequent labour unrest in garment factories creates an unbelievable situation in the city and its suburbs. construction of new roads and reduction of population are two solutions to the problem. but both are difficult to achieve. it is high time to re-locate the factories in different districts adjacent to highways e.g., dhaka-chittagong, dhaka-sylhet, dhaka-barisal, dhaka- dinajpur, dhaka- khulna etc. to reduce population of the capital and also to reduce labour unrest. the people concerned have to keep in mind that not more than 50 factories should operate in a particular location. making a hub of factories is not a pragmatic decision.
tales of progression
very recently, i was in sri lanka and i sadly observed that the down-syndrome i suffer from after visiting any country outside bangladesh seeing their infrastructure, their roads, their compliance to traffic signals, didn't go missing even this time. sri lanka, a third world country as well, still recovering from the war plights, a small country with limited resources and some inaccessible terrain, has outraced us in terms of a lot of things. even at 3:00am in the night, their drivers comply with the traffic signals, they park their cars accordingly, their roads are neat and clean, they don't blow horns unnecessarily and they stop or at least slow down at zebra crossings. and what is most amazing is that they are capable of constructing a flyover in 60 days and that doesn't collapse or crack within a year of construction! in fact, when i reached the city, i heard a lot about the infamous traffic congestion in colombo, but practically speaking that is nothing in comparison to what we see in dhaka. if a war-torn country can be so advanced in terms of behaviour, how come we are lagging so far behind even after more than 35 years of independence? i definitely don't expect my city or country to become like bangkok or kuala lumpur overnight, but can't we even be like sri lanka?
education
our syllabus and question patterns demand memorizing of everything from the text. the stereotyped question paper at different education levels prompts students to memorize and achieve good grades in the exams. since the emergence of british empire in bengal, we the bangladeshi people have had the same education system. no significant change has been made. and so far this system has made students mere memorizing machines by hammering their brains.
poor planning
i was dismayed when i read in the newspapers that the under construction connecting road leading from bijoy sharani to tejgaon will have a width of 250 ft at the initial point and will culminate in a width of just little over 100 ft while it meets tejgaon road. this is incredible; a road which is going to be an extremely busy one will have such a small width. one can see unbearable traffic jam both at the bijoy sarani and tejgaon ends once the road in its present design is allowed to open and therefore will defeat the purpose for which it was built at a colossal cost including the much talked about demolition of rangs building. this road in its present form can now be safely called a “lane” rather a road. it is also most surprising that the chief engineer of the project while talking to the newsman disclosed that if necessary the road could be widened afterwards as the adjacent areas belonged to the government. if so, why the road is not widened now when it is under construction and why it is deferred to a future uncertain period? perhaps it is not very difficult to figure out the reason; dismantling and re construction will bring more benefit for the interested quarters! with the enormous growth of transport and population in dhaka city most of its roads now have turned into lanes. this is because of the shortsightedness of our city planners, engineers and the government officials. while these roads were constructed say about fifty years back they thought the volume of traffic would not grow more. that is why they even permitted the construction of multi-storied buildings right on the edge of those roads prohibiting any of its future expansion. in gulshan circle 1, one twenty two storied building was allowed to be built occupying a large portion of the footpath and without any underground parking facility! it does not require one to become an engineer or architect to think of at least hundred years ahead while undertaking any construction of public utility services. the short sightedness of these people now rendered the dhaka city into such a sorry plight that this city can never become a liveable one. we are now dreaming about construction of overhead roads, elevated expressway, under ground metro system, circular rail and waterways etcetera. the materialization of those super ambitious projects is still in the air only. even if some of those projects could be materialized in the long run, dhaka would become a jungle of concrete and constructions and thereby become unliveable.
new dhaka
i am an nrb living in the uk for the last 25 years. i did enjoy your article on a new capital for bangladesh which i found very interesting. bangladesh is not a poor country but extremely poorly managed. in the 1960's, malaysia was poorer than bangladesh and look where they are now and what they have achieved simply because over the last 40 years or so they have had visionary leadership and eradication of corruption. a corrupt society simply cannot prosper and that's a priority bangladesh needs to sort out. another big impediment to our development is the poor and low level of government tax collection as a proportion of gdp. in the uk, most people hand over one third of their income to government coffers because they have systems and checks in place so that people do not evade paying what is due upon them. now how many people of working age in bangladesh are willing to do that. in return people in the uk get first class infrastructure and free health care and education. people in bangladesh complain about wanting better health care, free education and a working infrastructure but how many are willing to pay for it?
