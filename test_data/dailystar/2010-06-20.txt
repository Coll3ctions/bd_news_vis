a cosmetic sign of improving living standard

rajapakse's rejection of un demands
sri lanka's leader has come down hard on demands for a probe into war crimes allegedly committed towards the end of the conflict between the government and the ltte. president mahinda rajapakse does not think that the sri lankan army committed any crimes or excesses, but he does believe that the criminality the united nations wants to be inquired into came from the defeated tigers. it is a position that will not sit well with the global community. nor does it help that the president has described such demands as a demonstration of sympathy towards terrorism. the record does not show that the international community and global bodies have at any time been supportive of terrorism anywhere and have on the contrary been vocal against any individuals or organizations engaging in violent means of changing politics anywhere. view the page sports

israeli aggression
we are deeply shocked by the news that the israeli army boarded the flotilla which was coming from cyprus to gaza carrying humanitarian aid to the people of gaza. israeli defence force (idf) came on board the boats and killed at least 10 people who were bringing foods, medicines, and other essentials for the people of gaza who are in dire need of those.
education policy
this pertinent news, reported in all dailies on june 01, is an important achievement of the government. the significant fact is that education up to class eight will be free and compulsory! the idea of common public examinations at class five, eight, ten and twelve is also rational.
re-designing rickshaw
may i echo sikander ahmed's request for the need of a newly-designed rickshaw to be on the streets? like millions, i love the rickshaw - not only for its convenience and cheapness but the encouragement of a means of earning a living in a way that does not pollute the environment and responds to so many needs. being able to see the sky overhead - oh, everything about it!
adieu bangladesh!
the other day in late afternoon, a friend of mine asked me whether i was free or not. as my answer was affirmative he requested me to join him in going to elephant road to collect spectacles for his son studying abroad in japan. after arriving at the designated optician, we found that the spectacles were not ready yet to be delivered. so we had to wait for a while for the delivery.
death on road
ilyas kanchan, a famous cine artiste, lost his wife in a tragic road accident. since then he started a campaign for 'safer road'. my friend ekram ahmed, a senior bureaucrat, lost his teenage son under the wheels of a speeding truck. ekram is now a 'safer road' activist. comparing to the number of motorised vehicles, death toll in bangladesh roads is the highest in the world. but this epidemic has little impact in our society. sporadic clashes occur when any student or a garment employee is killed in such accidents but most of such deaths go unnoticed. in some incidents, cases are filed with police stations. but we have not heard of any punishment in any such cases. it appears that we have become used to such deaths. a few years back highway police was established but we don't find any improvement of the situation.
begunbari tragedy
the recent incident of begunnbari has shocked us all. it again proved that we are living in the unsafe concrete jungle. rajuk is the top decision-making body which permits any owner to construct buildings in the dcc area. people are now claiming that this organisation doesn't carry out their responsibilities correctly.
an overdue progress
your newspaper reported the prime minister being one of the first recipients of machine readable passport (mrp) along with fourteen other citizens of the country. ten of them are quite prominent citizens. the five unmentioned must be the labourers and students. the pm, her cabinet colleagues, the army chief, and the fbcci president all receive special treatment at the airports. nobody dare harass them in any airport - it's the poor labourers who suffer for lack of proper papers. wouldn't it have sent a better signal if fifteen labourers and students were the first to receive the new passports? one can't help but notice that the implementation of this project has come not only late, but it's so late that the deadline for a new technology -- the e-passport or biometric passport -- is knocking on the door. according to icao regulations, the government will have to start issuing biometric passports from the year 2014.
decentralisation
begunbari and nimtoli tragedy - both of the disasters were man-made. unplanned urbanisation is the root cause of the disasters. what's the lesson that we get from the facts? definitely decentralisation of dhaka alongside industrial decentralisation.
government organisations
it is lamentable that most of the government offices of bangladesh are extremely bureaucratic and inefficient. most of the government organisations lack the smooth systems needed to serve the general people effectively. public services in these government offices invariably involve redundant paperwork and unnecessary hassles, which often make people unwilling to ask for their services. moreover, government employees in most of these organisations are corrupt, rude, uncooperative and extremely inefficient. instead of helping troubled people, these government employees generally push them into deeper troubles and take advantage of people's helplessness. there's no effective monitoring mechanism, and administrative responsibilities are often handled with utter negligence. general people are frequently harassed by the employees and illegal agents who are good at making money out of people's predicaments. most of these government offices epitomise the endless mismanagement and exploitations that our public administration is known for.
the subcontinent
on 29-05-2010 i attended a seminar at cirdap auditorium arranged under the auspices of pdi policies and development ideas. the keynote paper was read by engr. tam nurul basher. he described the political history of the subcontinent dating back thousand of years and the partition of india into two countries in 1947 and three countries in 1971. it is true that these partitions brought undue miseries to its citizens.
what is going on?
after the btrc (bangladesh telecom regulatory commission) had booted out many of the voip equipments terming these illegal and cancelling licenses of some telecom operators, it was heartening to note that engr. hasanul haque inu, chairman of parliamentary committee, came out boldly stating that the govt. would adopt an open door policy in telecom sector and some 3,000 operators will be given licenses to operate voip. this was a relief to people who understand and operate telecom business.
break the silence
road accidents, building collapse, fire disaster, etc, are becoming regular incidents. most of the incidents are happening for lack of our consciousness. apart from this, our government could not take any fair steps regarding these incidents. whom will we blame? how long would we remain silent?
press freedom
the government cancelled the declaration of amar desh, a bangla daily, on 1 june--stating that it has no authorised publisher.
poverty
poverty is the greatest problem facing humanity. poverty has been defined as being "a punishment for a crime you didn't commit." millions of children around the world are being punished every day - and their only "crime" was being born into poverty. while most children cry to buy toys or their favourite junk food, disadvantaged children beg to live. their only concern is surviving each day as it comes.
double standard
flouting the international opinion and all norms of humanity, israeli soldiers killed 9 unarmed innocent peace activists in the international maritime territory while they were on the way to gaza with humanitarian aid on 31 may 2010. this audacity and boastful aggression has been denounced worldwide. but the saddest part of it is that the usa has failed to understand and evaluate the world sentiment. it has once again failed to denounce the fiend israeli despot and interposed in taking a lenient resolution in the security council of the un.
land grabbing
the recent reports published in some national bangla dailies regarding encroachments of land at various points of the cox's bazar sea beach are very disturbing. experience tells us that once such process starts it goes on unabated and some government functionaries responsible for protecting public assets also join hands with the unscrupulous grabbers and create different excuses to support them. the euphemisms for such activities may be joint ventures for development, public-private enterprise and the like. i hope the media and concerned citizens will come forward and voice their opposition to snapping up of land by wealthy rapacious land grabbers in collusion with dishonest public servants and force the government to take appropriate steps to protect the longest sea beach of the world, one of our national treasures.
branding bangladesh
nowadays, "branding bangladesh" seems to be buzzing quite a lot- seminars, round-tables, and other events. i am not against what's going on because at least we are talking, which also means thinking. view the page international

democratic polity in india was again exposed when details of the bhopal gas tragedy came out. there was a nexus between the judiciary, the executive and the bureaucracy. all the three joined hands to let chairman warren anderson of union carbide, the company which owned the gas plant, escape from india. they also scaled down the compensation that the company had offered and delayed the court judgment by 26 years.
the things that could have saved sohrab

for a face in that empty space

you cannot begin to speak of the chittagong mayoral election without taking note of the contributions of those who have made its outcome possible. much as a joint secretary general of the bangladesh nationalist party would like to under-emphasise the role of the election commission in the conduct of the election, the unalterable truth is that chief election commissioner atm shamsul huda and his team have convinced the nation that, on their watch, the people of bangladesh can be privy to free and fair elections. they did it in december 2008. and they have done it again, in chittagong. these are men we need if democracy is really to dig deeper roots in this country.
