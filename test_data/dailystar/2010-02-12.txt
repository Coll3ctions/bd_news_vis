education in disarray
while presiding over the convocation at jahangirnagar university, the honourable president very rightly expressed his concern at the declining educational standards of our universities. it is high time our intellectuals took up serious and realistic measures to correct this sorry state of higher education. of course, student politics, patronised and actively encouraged by all our political parties, is a major reason behind this state of affairs. political parties must rectify their relationship, in the overall national interest of better education standards for higher education in bangladesh.
vegetables
vegetables are one of the essential food items for growth and maintenance of health. in the months of december through march, vegetables are available all over bangladesh. but during the rest of the year frequently people confront tremendous shortage of vegetables. bangladesh is predominantly an agricultural country with rich soil condition and climate. numerous types of vegetables could also be grown here from april to november. it is matter of regret that, even after four decades of independence, we could not produce enough vegetables for the countrymen. the issue needs better handling by the departments concerned.
death of a student
the gruesome, cold-blooded murder of a dhaka university student is condemnable. the dastardly act is a grim pointer to the entrenchment of student politics across the country. there is absolutely no place for violence and extremism in a democracy.
business syndicate
very often whenever there is a price hike of any item of daily necessity or an industrial raw material, a group of manipulators, popularly know as "syndicate" surfaces. hoarders, monopolistic importers and retailers in collusion with each other create an artificial shortage making the shop-shelves empty and then charge the price at their will. sometimes this gamble is short-lived and sometimes it continues for a considerable time. whatever may be the life of the manipulation, the members make a brisk business of over profit at the cost of the poor consumers. in bangladesh, there is hardly any powerful instrument which is able to catch hold of the syndicate.
du classroom!
dhaka university, needless to say, is still regarded as the biggest, most prestigious and best university of the country. so, it's natural that this historical institution would have the most facilities and amenities in terms of infrastructure and other elements necessary for maintaining proper educational environment. but what i saw the other day makes me wonder if it is indeed the topmost university of the country. that morning seeing a number of students huddling even almost outside the door of a classroom, i thought may be something entertaining was going on at that rush hour. but i was utterly shocked to know that in fact it was just a regular literature class of the 1st year, 2nd semester students of the department of english. the whole classroom was swarming with more than hundred students and those who weren't lucky enough to grab a seat on the bench or at least a place to stand inside the room were forced to stand and huddle outside trying to listen to the lecture, as if they were in a public meeting. when it's hard to concentrate even inside the closed classrooms with continuous noise from the vehicles, buzzing of the passing students and uproar from the 'indispensable' processions, how could one concentrate under such a situation, i don't know. in fact, it's not the problem of the english department only, many other departments are suffering from the same problem of accommodation which greatly hampers the proper environment for learning and teaching. i therefore urge the authorities concerned to look into this matter and address the issue immediately.
mental health
the daily star has published some good articles on mental health over the last few months. you have shown your readers how important it is to overcome ignorance and prejudice, fear and denial concerning mental health problems and have highlighted the need for suitable institutions, with properly trained specialists and carers - for voluntary patients.
fifth amendment
now the fifth amendment will be considered illegal and our constitution will regain its original spirit with the installation of democracy, socialism, secularism, and bengali nationalism. through 5th amendment president ziaur rahman legalised the illegal and unconstitutional rule of khondokar moshtaque, justice sayem and his own military rule from 1975 to 1979.
us anti-missile plan
recently, the usa announced that they have a plan to set up defensive missile systems in gulf arab countries to halt possible strikes by iran. i suppose this is a new political ploy to ensure presence of americans in the region.
supreme court verdict
there is no doubt that in the constitutional history of bangladesh, the verdict of the hon'ble supreme court would be written in golden letters. this is such a historical event which can only be compared with the golden days of our independence.
our national sport
the thought provoking article entitled “kabaddi or karma” by mr. mohammed badrul ahsan that appeared in the daily star on the 1st of january 2010 has really given us food for thought. the article gives us a wonderful view on how different countries have come up with a game as their national sport which symbolizes their nature and suits their country's outfit. our whole nation had their hands wide open for a gold medal in kabaddi at the 2010 saf games. but the loss of the pinnacle has really forced the whole nation to scratch their head in shame. it is high time to think whether our national sport really represents the mass population. for a national sport to succeed throughout, it must be followed by the youth with passion and should be played all over the country with lot of interest. but in case of our national sport, kabaddi, it is not followed at all and the question of practicing by the mass is far away. as such, we can always think of eliminating kabaddi as our national sport and may think of declaring swimming as our national sport. without touching the satirical part of the socio-political issues raised in the article by the writer, i am only concentrating on the national sports part.

zia's mortal remains
the talk about ziaur rahman's dead body in national parliament is so much unwanted and disgusting. such a talk seems not to show any respect to a departed soul. we must know that he was the president and a freedom fighter who lived his life in a very simple manner, not like a modern day politician. whether the box contained zia's body or not was determined by a competent authority and he was buried after a big janaza.
iran scene
in this debate about iran's right to acquire nuclear weapons for security reasons, no one seems to be mentioning about the slaughter of iranians by the ruling mullahs for protesting the rigged presidential elections. since rigging the election, the ahmadinejad regime has been slaughtering iranians for protesting against the voting fraud.
clash at du
we are deeply shocked to see the news of the death of du student abu bakar on 3rd february. abu bakar siddique, a third year islamic history student, died in dhaka medical college hospital at around 9:30am. he was injured during clashes between two bcl groups. from the online newspapers we got to know that he was a meritorious student studying heart and soul to become first so that he could be a du teacher. we have lost this boy.
