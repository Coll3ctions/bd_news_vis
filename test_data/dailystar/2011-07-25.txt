respecting our parents
last saturday i was waiting for my car in front of my coaching centre. another student of that class was also waiting for his car. he told his mother to bring the fees of our teacher when she would come to pick him up. due to poor condition of the road she couldn't arrive at the right time and as our teacher also left, he failed to give the fees. when his mother arrived he aggressively approached towards his car and threw some disgusting words at his mother. i was shocked. i couldn't understand how a young boy like him could humiliate his mother in such a disgraceful way in front of other people on the road and even in front of the driver. most of the children of our country, especially the teenagers are losing their respect for the elders day by day. therefore, i would like to suggest all the parents of the country to look after their children and take necessary steps to teach them manners and make them more polite towards their parents and other people as well.
discourage smoking
