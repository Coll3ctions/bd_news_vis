disciplining errant party elements
it is worthwhile to note that a verbal climate of crusade is in the offing within the ruling party against leaders and activists who seem incorrigibly set to bring their party to disrepute through abuse of power. new voices are being added to the pm's stern warning in the september 17 parliamentary party meeting against the lawmakers' indulging in or patronising acts of extortion, tender manipulation and the like. al presidium member obaidul quader expressed the party's resolve to identify and discipline those who tainted the government's image. al secretary general ashraful islam also joined in.
drive by law enforcers
in a series of special drives on friday, police and the rapid action battalion took as many as 418 people into custody. it has been given out that the arrests were made as part of security measures related to the puja celebrations. reports of bombs hoaxes at some puja mandaps in the capital certainly prompted these law enforcement drives. one surely cannot underplay the threats that may come in relation to religious or other collective celebrations and observances, which is why one fully understands the need for the security forces to be in a state of constant alert. no citizen will ever be inclined to disregard any question about ensuring the security of people at any given time.
speed-up administration
compared to a developed country the capability of an underdeveloped country is very limited. bangladesh, being a least developed country, should never be oblivious to the fact that she will have to overcome lots of hurdles before reaching the stage of mid-income country. to attain this stage she needs good governance and good administration. it is regrettable that, despite the passage of more than nine months, the new government has not been able to make us hopeful about attaining its declared commitment. to a neutral observer, the al-led government appears to be more concerned about consolidating its power without concentrating on promoting national interest. admittedly, the administration has failed to speed up work to attain the national goals in time. in fact, the prime minister has already conveyed her disappointment and disapprobation to the secretaries to the government about the painfully slow disposal of government decisions. her admonishment could not bring any positive result as it is beyond the powers of the secretaries to gear-up administrative actions.

fashion?
we have been observing, albeit silently, an incremental yet disturbing trend among the burgeoning fashionists in today's dhaka city. apart from the sheer mockery it makes of the holy month of abstinence, the fashion ads smeared across the magazines and billboards reek of over-exposure of the feminine form, in complete denial of our treasured cultural identity. our collective cultural identity had long been embedded in the notions of modesty and grace, and these are traits and values we are and should take immense pride in. even the daily star for certain features in its lifestyle and weekend magazines may stand accused of implicitly endorsing an ethnocentric view, when it is pivotal for a national daily not to lose sight of the fact that gulshan-banani-dhanmondi views on trends and fashions do not necessarily reflect the collective values of the entire city, let alone the country as a whole. many people echo this view in inconspicuous settings in fear of being branded a fundamentalist, but as social engineers our elected authorities indeed have a responsibility to nurture and preserve positive aspects of our cultural identities before they go awash in prevalent global tides.
child trafficking
whenever we turn over the pages of the national dailies, we come across may headlines on “child trafficking”. the illegal traders have included children in their list, like commodities. they make the children fall into their trap. the illegal traders normally offer an angel like child candy, apple, sweets and what not. the children, who are basically poor, respond to their call. the traffickers catch them. they sometimes buy children from local agents at a very high rate. the unscrupulous traders sell them outside the country. hundreds of parents go mad losing their sons and daughters. the law enforcing agencies are there. still, the traffickers carry on their inhuman business year after year. again, we know the sufferings of a child after he has been sold. we just shudder at hearing the unbelievable, unimaginable and inhuman stories.
law and order goes haywire
in an impoverished country like bangladesh our progressive dreams of socio-economic development are the only route to national prosperity. however, vicious social cancers like crime and corruption often prematurely trample our budding dreams and grossly contaminate our perceptual world with their filthy nightmares. it's absolutely undeniable that despite all the seemingly compelling promises of the governmental policy makers, the overall 'law and order situation' has deteriorated significantly over the last few months. the relentlessness and ferocity of crime have made us utterly speechless. we hopelessly witnessed the vivid blossoms of our collective peace and safety being ravaged by the outrageous outburst of violent crimes that literally made us vulnerable in every corner of the country. it appears that we have been hurled back to a medieval age of sheer lawlessness where the value of human life and liberty was absolutely negligible. murders, muggings, extortions, kidnappings, robberies and rapes have almost become an unannounced norm in bangladesh in the recent times and it appears that our representatives in the government are either shamelessly incompetent or they really lack any sincere determination to resolutely counteract the monster of crime. it seems that the incumbent government is represented by a bunch of uncreative sycophants as they are recurrently failing to device feasible and effective plans to curb crimes.

hartal and bnp
ms nur jahan in her letter published in ds on 18 september expressed her utter disappointment at the response by the people towards the hartal called by the national committee to protect gas, oil mineral resources and power in dhaka city on september 14. but i am quite surprised that she did not utter a word against the main opposition party bnp and its close ally the jamaat for not giving any support to the hartal. opposition parties are duty bound to the nation to check the government misdoings, if any, by voicing protest in parliament or on the streets or both. but the bnp has miserably failed to do the same mainly by abstaining from parliament for a childish demand for more front-row seats initially, though gradually adding more demands which include the issue of khaleda zia's huge palatial complex at dhaka cantonment. it is obvious that people are now allergic to hartal because of its frequent use and misuse in the recent past. if we want to develop as a democratic country we, irrespective of our political inclinations, should encourage/ pressurize the political parties to debate all national issues in parliament in open public view on radio and tv channels.

open letter to susan rice
