we have known it for some time that many government officials are apt to demand signing money for certification of an entitlement which falls within the purview of their normal duties to dispose of. the fact that they are of a status that enables them to certify someone approaching them, albeit with the right documents, is a matter of prestige for the certifier. more importantly, they are helping people to meet an official formality required to be fulfilled by some authority in the government of which they are a part. view the page sports

smothering the wellspring of life
the sea is the earth's life support system. the services rendered by it are so fundamental that most of us tend to take them for granted. scientists have brought it home to us that without the ocean, the earth might be lot like marsa place inhospitable for us and the rest of life on earth. the sea shapes the character of this planet, governs weather and climate, stabilises temperature, yields to the atmosphere the moisture that falls back on the land, replenishing earth's fresh water in rivers, lakes and streams. oxygen is generated there and carbon dioxide absorbed.

non-partisan interim government, a must
we have seen how the present government raised barricades by using the administration, law enforcing agencies and awami league cadres to foil the grand rally held in dhaka by bnp-led opposition parties on march 12. dhaka was totally isolated from other parts of the country for 3 days through stopping of buses, steamers, launches and trains by the administration and law enforcing agencies at the instruction of the government. an unofficial hartal was observed throughout the country. live telecasting of the speech of the leader of the opposition by 3 private tv channels was also suddenly stopped. moreover, government officers/officials were forced to attend the political rally, human chain and grand rally of the ruling party with banners on march 7, 11, and 14, respectively, which were telecast live by the tv channels. as such, it has been clearly proved by the above instances that a fair, neutral, transparent and acceptable parliament election is not possible under this government with the politicised administration and law enforcing agencies.

between dreams . . .
it is a cold night. he is shivering in the night as bomb blasts are heard in the distance. if he listened carefully he would swear he could hear the trickle of blood as it flowed down the expanse of the vast land they were fighting for. his breath ragged; with a mighty cry he raises his gun and fires upon enemies. in a haze of atrocious actions the enemy falls with a face devoid of emotions while a bittersweet feeling sweeps in him for fighting for a much bigger cause. but in a matter of heartbeats the scene is broken as he wakes up in bed sweating and panting. the moment is lost and he can no longer grasp the exhilarating feeling of moments before. view the page star health
take prompt action, save lives
for most women and their families, giving birth should be a time for celebration; but, every minute for one woman, pregnancy and childbirth end in death and mourning (unfpa 2009). although bangladesh has made a notable progress in reducing many causes of maternal mortality, eclampsia — a disease characterised by high blood pressure and convulsion in pregnancy remains a significant problem for us.
complementary feeding crucial for child development
complementary feeding is very important issue for normal growth and development of young child. up to six month of age, exclusive breast-feeding is enough; but after 6 month, we need to add some complementary food to the diet of baby to ensure healthy life. after 6 months, babies need more protein, vitamin a and c, zinc, iron, which breast milk alone cannot provide in sufficient amount. if weaning food is not given to babies after 6 months, their weight may decrease, growth may be impaired, anemia may occur, intelligence and immunity may decrease. so, we should ensure complementary feeding to our child along with breast milk after six months.

russia-india-china strategic triangle: signalling a power shift?
the 11th round of the russia-india-china (ric) foreign minister's meet was held in moscow on april 13. prima facie, this impressive continuity in the ministers' annual parleys has gathered sufficient mass and momentum which makes this forum appear pregnant with the potential for global and systemic implications for the 21st century world order. closer home, these cordial trilateral meetings have also generated positive vibes amongst the three foreign ministers, which gets reflected in their often rather soft responses in bilateral relations that have otherwise witnessed their own share of turbulences and irritants.

feelings, dreams and desires
taking isabel allende's book 'daughter of fortune' in hand comes with expectations of finding some surreal elements, the magical presentation that many of her books carry. but the surprise comes when one finds the book to be down to earth, revealing human endearment, agony and ecstasy, lust and betrayal. embroidered is an intricately detailed story with pulsating characters.
where water is the issue . . .
the work is a real tour de force authored by a non-specialist but rarely attempted at in this genre before. the author's tenor rings a shocking loss and a profound concern for the vanishing flow of what were once brimming and thriving rivers traversing and criss-crossing the vast plain of northern bangladesh. the life of the people of this riverine region and their culture were inseparably intertwined with the bounty of the waves since time immemorial. rivers occupied a special place in their heart, their environment and ecology, culture and tradition, literature and folklore.
old allegories to explain new times
bali, the sacrifice, has a unique place in the field of indian drama. the play projects belief in god, in hinduism, and jainism --- one belief whose rituals revolve round blood and the other that abhors killing and blood. beyond the literal lies the more profound meaning, that violence is an integral part of human existence and that the moral dilemma encountered on account of violence is part of everyday life.
