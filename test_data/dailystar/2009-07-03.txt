the bnp's boycott of parliament
the continuing absence of the opposition bangladesh nationalist party and its erstwhile ally in government, the jamaat-e-islami, threatens to put at risk the new phase of democracy inaugurated through the general elections of december last year. indeed, the bnp had pledged in its election manifesto that if voted to power it would go for laws that would put an end to the pervasive culture of a boycott of parliament by political parties. obviously, the bnp did not get back to power. but should that be any reason for it now to stay away from a legislative body in which it castigated the opposition in its own days in power? the bnp, in line with its manifesto, could on its own take the initiative of proposing legislation aimed at doing away with the boycott culture. that way, it will not only convince people that it has gone for a reinvention of itself but also encourage them into believing that change in the political mindset is also in the offing
