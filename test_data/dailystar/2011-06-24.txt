decline in poverty rate
the household income and expenditure survey (hies), 2010 has come up with some good news. the poverty rate at the national level has gone down by 8.5 per cent between 2005 and 2010. in absolute terms, this is no mean achievement, given the shock of global recession and internal political instabilities it had to absorb along the way.
ugc survey of public varsities
the university grants commission survey findings about five public universities are certainly worrying. the survey, which covered the universities of dhaka, chittagong, khulna and rajshahi and the bangladesh agricultural university, reveals the depressingly low standards to which teaching has declined among a large number of academics. when 28 per cent of teachers are observed to be extremely poor in teaching, when indeed the quality of research work undertaken by academics (13 per cent of teachers are not into research at all, while only 20 per cent are doing very well) does not conform to regional or international standards, it is time for us to sit up and take notice. there would be little point in arguing that beyond this 28 per cent are those teachers who appear to have been doing a good job. the fact is that teaching at the public universities must be of a uniformly high quality which demonstrates the intellectual excellence of academics. view the page sports

cyber crime and bangladesh
"though we use the term 'cyber crime' quite frequently, we barely know the definition of it," says quazi mh supan, asst. professor at the department of law in the university of dhaka. and according to him it's because of the ever changing nature of the modern technologies. due to cyber crimes surfing in the internet is harmful nowadays! in our country cyber crimes probably started with spam mails and trojan attacks, but it now extended to debit/credit card theft, cell phone threats and frauds. on sept. 5, 2008, rab discovered that their website had been hacked! but rab was successful in catching the hackers which proved that bangladesh was not far behind in catching cyber criminals. cell phone threats are also very harmful but the victims keep quiet as it would result in their embarrassment. we should take precautions against cyber crime. please don't download free content from the internet as it carries within harmful software. we should not use cybercafés as most of their computers can record one's email address and basically everything that is typed! take precautions.
wrong trees in wrong place!

people's purchasing power decreasing
on 17th june, our honourable commerce minister said that food price in our country is cheaper than any other country. it's true. but he can't take it as an achievement for the govt. even at the time of shaista khan when it was thought that the food price was really cheap, it was not true at all. it was relatively cheaper from other provinces. but people were starving (ref: sonar bangla: myth o bastobota by dr. akbar ali khan in bangladesher etihash.) so, it should not be a topic to talk about. the thing that matters most is the purchasing power of the people. now-a-days, the food price is really very high. inflation is rising. value of money is decreasing. people are forced to buy fewer products with their fixed income, which means people's purchasing power is decreasing. we have to talk and think about those problems. this should be the subject of concern for our minister.
