shadow of a doubt : hitchcock's favourite hitchcock film
alfred hitchcock was born 112 years ago on august 13 in leytonstone, london. his father would have him locked in the local jail for ten-minute stretches as punishment for minor misbehaviour. his mother would make him stand at the foot of her bed and recount his sins for hours. it's no wonder he became the master of the psychological thriller; what's incredible is how incredibly funny -- nervously, darkly funny, but still funny -- his films are, too.

highway hemorrhage
we would talk volubly about road accidents and deaths, only after they have come about. it is an exasperating ritual we are deeply involved in. following every accidental death the onrush of commiseration stuffed with age-old phrases has become a pattern. to some, soft words of sympathy now sound like expletives. we promise a thorough query and exemplary punishment to the killer drivers, which we invariably renege on.
now, freedom from some indians please
we lost the central hinge of the plot on august, 15, 1947. we thought that raising the tricolour over edwina and lord louis mountbatten's palace marked the end of the freedom project launched by mahatma gandhi in 1919. it was only the beginning of a second and equally difficult freedom struggle. the first had been against the british. the second indian freedom struggle would be against fellow indians.
london is not too far
the weeklong london riots have been a blow to britain's proud self-image as a "haven of stability," so said john burns in his friday's article in the new york times. but the riot in question was also not the first of its kind in england. the one in 1985, for instance, took place at the same flashpoint of tottenham in north london. however, the spread and the scale of devastation caused by rioters this time has been far greater than those of any other time since world war ii. in either case, it was the death of a resident during police raid in the area that sparked the violence.
bangabandhu and bangladesh

a tribute to a hero
in a society where few acts are selfish and no commitment is final, where sacrifice is neither unheard of nor expected and loyalty is mostly partisan, brig. gen. jamil (bir uttam) is one of the most unusual persons of all. he drove down to certain death because duty called and once and for all established the ultimate example of courage and sacrifice. it would be very hard indeed to find another like him in our history.

omar khayyam on cubes
one of the accomplishments of the persian mathematician omar khayyam was to give geometrical constructions for the roots of a cubic as the intersections of two conics. of course, this approach had been used earlier by menaechmus and others to solve certain special cubic's, especially in relation to the problem of "duplicating the cube”. but khayyam generalized it to cover essentially all cubics. although with many individual cases so as to avoid negative numbers). it's usually said that khayyam erroneously believed the cubic could not be solved algebraically, but i think we need to be careful about assuming that khayyam was referring to the modern idea of what constitutes an "algebraic" solution. one of his most famous quotes is

it is architecture in another form, the creation of living and working spaces which are a harmonious blend of technology, multimedia, intelligent systems and user interactivity. these spaces can be customized and the residents can claim to be the world's most connected community. cybertecture even allows a person to select preferred background music. one such cyberstructure is coming up on an area of 32,000 square metres in mumbai called the cybertecture egg. it will have 13 floors of offices, and include a feature to monitor occupants' health, besides virtual scenery which can be changed.
