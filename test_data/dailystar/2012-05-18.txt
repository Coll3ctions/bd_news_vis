disrespecting nation's icon
a few days back syed ashraful islam, an influential minister in the cabinet, launched a scathing attack on dr muhammad yunus and undermined his pioneering work in micro-credit and his winning the nobel peace prize. the minister did so in presence of the prime minister. what is really shocking is that the pm a few months back recommended dr yunus as the president of the world bank for his achievements in micro-credit and women empowerment. any opinion of a minister in a public platform should be considered the government's opinion. i beg to ask whether the pm's recommendation of prof. yunus as a candidate for world bank presidency was real. syed ashraf's comment was instigated by hillary clinton's opinion that the us government hopes that bangladesh government would not interfere with the grameen bank's activities. dr yunus is one of our very few global ambassadors and it is really disheartening to see that the current government is undermining the very individual who brought immense fame and goodwill to bangladesh instead of giving him the recognition he so much deserves.

people's welfare is the ultimate objective of democratic governance. economic, socio-political, rights based, peace and conflict resolution policies and strategies at the national and international levels are futile unless they address the basic requirements of the people. democratic governance at the national level should identify the most effective instruments and ways to attain that goal in a sustainable manner.
