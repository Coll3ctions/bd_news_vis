tragedy on the kirtonkhola
the tragedy which occurred on the river kirtonkhola on thursday is only one more instance of the callous indifference shown by people in charge to passenger safety concerning movement of river vessels. the story, as tragic as all others of its kind in the past, is simple: one vessel, in this case a cargo-carrying one, rammed into a launch that was, as usual, overloaded with passengers. there are a couple of questions that immediately arise in the aftermath of the accident. firstly, why was an individual other than the captain of the cargo vessel allowed to operate the vessel? secondly, despite all the rules and regulations periodically spouted out by the authorities about the number of passengers river vessels can carry, why are there no efforts at all to see such measures through?

mother language day
undoubtedly, the international mother language day is one of the greatest achievements of our country. the supreme sacrifices of the valiant sons surpassed the national boundaries and are commemorated the world over. our gallant boys gave up their lives on this day to reinstate bangla as one of the state languages of pakistan. the overwhelming protest on this day in 1952 against the announcement of 'urdu only' policy resulted in firing on the procession brought out by the students. the nation as well as the world pays homage to the stars for their heroic protest against the brutal regime. the world needed half a century to fathom the depth of significance of the day. the international mother language day is celebrated not only to respect all the mother languages and to pay homage to the language movement martyrs but also to build awareness to save and promote all the languages, especially the endangered languages in the world.

movie "monpura"
noted television director giasuddin selim's much hyped movie monpura finally got released on the first day of the spring. the curiosity factor attached with this movie is natural since this movie is remarkable for quite a good number of reasons. first of all, it is the debut film by talented small screen director selim, secondly, the familiar faces of our television drama chanchal chowdhury and farhana mili paired for the first time on the big screen through this movie,. thirdly, gifted music director and young craze arnob for the first time composed music for any bangla movie. moreover, because of the overwhelming response of the audio soundtrack of this movie, the expectations increased manifold. now the question is has monpura delivered what was expected of it? the answer is a resounding yes.
bnp vs. al
during the general elections held in 2001, the bnp got absolute majority with 193 seats while al won 58 and according to sheikh hasina they were then given only 6 seats in the front row of parliament( apparently 1 seat for every 10 mps which roughly makes 5 and 4/5th seats for 58). now in the elections held in 2008, the al won absolute majority with 230 seats whereas the bnp managed to get only 32 including 2 of the jamaat. therefore, following the existing formula, they are entitled to only 3 and 1/5th seats at the most 4 seats but certainly not 7.
music maestro a r rahman
western cinema's bigwigs let out a collective twitter of nervous laughter when a r rahman took the stage for his golden globe win. it was probably because they couldn't wrap their tongue around his name, mispronouncing it no less than three times but the humble maestro, gracious as always, acknowledged his surprise and gratitude at receiving the award by thanking the slumdog millionaire team.
our culture
our heartfelt thanks to the print and electronic media for projecting our bengali culture in the right manner with sincerity and purpose. being abroad, we were eagerly waiting to watch the live telecast of the major cultural events at "bakul tola" of the charu kola academy. the following poem has really touched my feeling and heart:
bandarban tragedy
chittagong had become a city of mourners instantly as the tragic report reached the town. people irrespective of age and class were rushing towards ctg medical college to see the survivors. quite a few, fifteen approximately, are undergoing intensive treatment, and some more from them might meet death (god forbid).
corruption in education sector
though this sector receives the highest budgetary allocation each year in national budget, there is a shortage of quality educational institutions in bangladesh. a significant portion of the allocation is not properly utilized owing to massive corruption in the education sector. dr akbar ali khan has rightly said, "corruption in education sector is the root of all kinds of corruption, and it fuels corruption in other sectors."
women ministers
the awami league's landslide electoral victory came as a surprise to many. however, the formation of the cabinet is all the more surprising. but the cabinet that has been constituted with young , energetic and promising members of the party was praised by all. more surprisingly, it includes many women lawmakers as ministers with ministries/portfolio such as home and foreignsomething unmatched in south and southeast asia. with a women prime minister and two important ministers at the helm, it is unprecedented.
role of english

joya ahsan ad
i suppose some ethics should be maintained by the advertising houses and the corporate bodies. it came as a real shock to me when i found in the ntv that a leading actress of the small screen, joya ahsan, was missing for 5 days. in these days of kidnapping, killing and man slaughtering, i was almost certain that something had gone seriously wrong with her and i shared my feeling with my wife. however, later it came as a big relief when we realized that it was an "ad".
don't weaken acc
the anti-corruption commission plays a vital role in eradicating corruption. during the regime of caretaker government it took actions against some political stalwarts that made us optimistic. but unfortunately, the elected government has raised some questions regarding the functions of the acc. even prime minister sheikh hasina raised this issue in parliament that made us a little bit pessimistic. actually, it is true that bangladesh is infested with all-pervasive corruption and it is ruining our country gradually. we talk about this issue very fervently, but we are not sincere to root out corruption. the last bnp led alliance government formed the acc under the pressure of donor agencies, but they did not make it functional. then the acc was titular. after the political upheaval of 1/11, the military backed caretaker government took some courageous steps to make the acc functional and result-oriented. and it had showed its performance. the al has pledged in its election manifesto to eliminate corruption from society. but their outcry against the acc sounds very odd and dubious. so, we all are very concerned at this.
drug addiction
a few days ago, the prothom alo, ran a story on one majnu, a young man whose life has arrived on the brink of a precipice as a consequence of his long attachment with the drug like heroin. he has been kept in chains by his parents as he turns violent when he does not get his coveted stuff. with hollow eyes, a shrivelled body, stuck out veins--majnu is just a classic example of the dangers of drug addiction.
day of the valiant
the language movement of 1952 marks one of the most important chapters of our history. every year on ekushey february the whole nation salutes the language martyrs. thousands throng the central shaheed minar to show their respect. it is a special day whose character has now received international recognition. on 17 november, 1999, the unesco general conference unanimously adopted a resolution tabled by bangladesh proclaiming shaheed dibosh as the international mother language day. the courage of those people touched my heart and i felt as if i were just one of them. surely, i thought, if i were there at that time, i would have joined all the people on the streets and cried out for my rights, fought for my mother tongue. on the other hand, books in the ekushey boimela look very smart indeed. thousands visit the boimela in february. view the page international
