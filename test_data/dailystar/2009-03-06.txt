absence of quorum in js
on wednesday, the jatiya sangsad session was adjourned because of the lack of a quorum. while we realise that it is rather too early in the day to comment on such situations, we do hope that it does not become a pattern. it is regrettable that even as the nation happens to be going through a crisis over the bdr tragedy, our lawmakers, especially those in the ruling coalition, have already begun demonstrating disquieting indifference to the js. this quorum crisis is but a repetition of the past, where parliamentary sessions were rendered pointless through similar attitudes on the part of the then ruling party. we would like to make it clear here that the entire responsibility for the quorum crisis on wednesday must be borne by the chief whip and other whips of the treasury bench as they have more than three-fourths of the seats.

challenges ahead
in an indigent country like ours almost every group of people has countless grievances and unfulfilled demands. students have demands for an efficient educational system; labourers have demands for higher wages and better living standards; while civil servants have demands for effective administrative reforms. however, having grievances and demands (no matter how grave they might be) doesn't justify mayhem by the aggrieved. just because a few students have certain demands, it doesn't anyhow give them the right to vandalize their campuses and brutalize their teachers. similarly, in a civilized society distressed workers aren't expected to slaughter their employers if the latter fail to fulfil the workers' rightful demands. by the same token, the incredible crimes perpetrated by the bdr mutineers is by no means a justifiable way through which a disciplined and well-trained armed force should express their grievances. it's quite apparent that there were several constructive ways through which these mutineers could have communicated their demands to the authorities. instead of killing a great many of their superior officers they could have called a non-violent strike (or even a 'hunger strike'). moreover, it was also a legitimate option for them to communicate with different interest groups, the media and the government policy makers via their own spokespersons. despite having all those applicable alternatives, they resorted to indiscriminate violence that actually made us question the credibility of their blatant accusations. if they had taken a peaceful route to achieve their objectives, they might have been able to make their causes clearly justifiable. brutal killing of superior officers apparently exposed the inadequacy of moral and cultural grooming that exists in our paramilitary force.
crime index
the department of criminology and police science (dcps) of mawlana bhasani science and technology university (mbstu) in tangail has undertaken an exceptional publication named “crime index 2007” of bangladesh. this is reportedly the first ever initiative of this in the country. the book published by the appl was formerly launched by professor mozaffar ahmed, chairperson of tib at a function at dhaka reporters' unity on 20 february 2009.

climate change

english and math teachers
at this moment there is a huge shortage of english and math teachers in rural secondary schools and this is severe in madrasas. in almost all the rural schools, english and math are taught by the teachers who haven't studied math and english at their degree level. teachers themselves do not know english and math, so how will they teach their students? even in england, the government gives extra facilities to the students, who are studying math or science at the degree level to produce math and science teachers in their secondary schools as there is a shortage of science and math teachers.
indian visa and visa office
indian visa and its office has become a headache for visa seekers as well as neighbours of the visa office. as india is our nearest neighbouring country people have to visit india for many reasons. but having an indian visa has become quite difficult due to heavy rush of visa seekers. neighbourhood people of visa office unnecessarily suffer due to the crowd gathering since early hours of the day. now banani dwellers are very rightly opposing shifting of the office to their area. to avoid the hassles, we put forward a few suggestions which may solve the problem.
how to go about now?
a handful of disgruntled bdr personnel rushed inside the durbar hall from the back door and with a burst of gunfire killed completely unarmed officers. their subsequent heinous acts are by now well known to every citizen of the country. with her wisdom the honourable prime minister declared general amnesty to bring the situation under control. but the general amnesty certainly did not mean pardoning those who were involved in the act and the same has subsequently been made crystal clear by the honourable prime minister.
our leaders
what good are they when they could not come together on the day one hundred and fifty of our bright army officers were brutally murdered? what stopped the prime minister from calling upon the opposition leader to join her in facing the grave national crisis? at a time like this they are still busy mud-slinging and blaming each other, instead of joining hands in saving the country and giving solace to the wounded national psyche.
who are they?
the photographs printed in your daily of men in white caps standing with their feet on the chest of a flattened man and rejoicing on the streets of dhaka, again of men in the same attire throwing shoes at other men in similar attire inside sacred mosques have raised a question. who are they?
barbarian!
eggs were to be served to the accompanying people of the bridegroom in a wedding function in rangunia. but as the father of the bride could not manage to collect about 700 eggs at a time from the market, the bridegroom's people became very angry and later the “brave” bridegroom broke 19 eggs on the newly married girl's head. actually, the man is not a “bor” (bridegroom) rather a “borbor”(barbarian). the innocent girl will be burdened with the memory of this incident up to her last day in this world.
csr issue
corporate social responsibility or csr is a very popular buzz word today. the corporate bodies are trying to demonstrate that they are doing many social welfare activities from csr point of view. it would be a matter of great satisfaction if they really would do so. actually many people do not know the real essence of this commonly uttered term. the organisations should be more honest and sincere. view the page international
