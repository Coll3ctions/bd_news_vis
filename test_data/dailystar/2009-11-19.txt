justice order of the day
the nation waits to hear the ultimate verdict today in the bangabandhu murder case trial with bated breath and also in the expectation that finally justice will prevail. it has been a long, painful journey for the people of bangladesh. it ought not to have been this way, for the particular reason that the liberation of bangladesh from pakistani occupation in december 1971 was considered symbolic of a clean break with the past. that bangalees would see democracy grow in their country, that under the leadership of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman they would go forth to create shonar bangla, a cause the father of the nation had consistently espoused since he emerged with his six-point programme of regional autonomy in the mid-1960s, was not a misplaced expectation. indeed, it was a dream that seemed eminently attainable with bangabandhu as the undisputed leader of this country.

facing the moment of truth
today the nation has come face to face with a stark truth. the very fact that we had to wait for the last 34 years to complete the trial of the murder of the founding father of the nation bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman including most of his family members and bring the killers to justice has brought us face to face with the moment of truth. why had we to wait so long, for after his killing governments came in succession, one of those -- the bnp government of 1991-- being directly elected by the people. strangely enough, before the awami league government of 1996 was voted into office, none of the earlier governments felt the legal and moral obligation that the tragedy of august 15, 1975 at least deserved a hearing in the court of law! what had happened to our proud legacy of protest and struggle against all kinds of injustice?
