desalination holds promise
safe drinking water is essential to humans and other life forms. the coastal region of a country has to face tremendous drinking water crisis, as most of the water available is saline. in bangladesh 19 out of 64 districts are in proximity to the bay of bengal. the chief difficulty in the development of appropriate water supply system for the communities in the affected area is that deep aquifers containing sweet water are not found at all possible locations in the coastal region. one of the most convenient options to ensure potable water is to make use of the abundant source of seawater and brackish water. one may think it to be insane - drinking a glass of seawater! well, to bring down the salinity under specified limit, desalination is widely practised all over the world. ways of desalination are many. the conventional methods of desalination of salt waters to produce fresh water such as distillation, electrolysis and reverse osmosis are intensive energy techniques. due to increasing energy costs and declining energy sources, there is a growing interest in the use of low cost technologies.
