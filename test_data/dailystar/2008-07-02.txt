the government decision to raise the prices of petroleum products was inevitable. the record level of crude price in the international market and the consequent need for increasing subsidy to the bangladesh petroleum corporation (bpc) to procure it called for upward internal price adjustments to keep the deficit under control. but the margin of price increase by 33.84 percent to 50 percent from previous levels on wide ranging petroleum products is a big quantum leap at one go is what draws instant flak. is the economy with near-double digit inflation ready to absorb the consequent shocks?

nelson mandela, a great political leader born in south africa in 1918, fought against racism, violence, oppression, repression and impoverishment in his country. a noble laureate for peace in 1993, he became the first black president of south africa.
students abroad
i am going to reply mr. md. zahidul islam jibon's letter which was published in the daily star recently. i am totally upset with his saying “there is hardly anyone who can accomplish higher education in a foreign university because of high educational expenses. so they do odd jobs.'' how could he pass a comment like this? these days, lots of bangladeshi students are studying in foreign universities, especially in the uk. as an educated person you should respect all types of jobs. there is no difference between an odd job and others jobs. you are doing a job to earn money. that's it. anyway, i want to give you an example. i came to london in 1995 after finishing my bsc. i had to work hard to earn my university tuition fees. but as a college student i was not able to work so many hours a day. so, only during my vacation i could earn a lot of money. now i am a student of a good university and i am also proud that i am doing my msc with my hard-earned money.

bravo!
salvation for the deserving (sfd) congratulates finance adviser dr. mirza azizul islam for his speech delivered on june 24, 2008 at a function of dutch bangla bank ltd. the finance adviser stated , “ the government is considering tax exemption on a part of corporate income to be spent on discharging corporate social responsibilities (csr).” we think that such kind of an initiative would definitely encourage the business organisations to engage them in social development activities. it should be mentioned that sfd has been advocating from its inception in different seminars, symposiums and writing that donation to the organisation should be kept tax free as no nation can survive keeping the 1.5 crore people uneducated, untrained and in improper hygienic condition. the present caretaker government signed the 'un convention on the rights of the people with disabilities'. furthermore, the national office of the 'national foundation for the development of the disabled persons' was shifted from the 3rd floor of a multi-storeyed building to a separate one-storied building. such kind of initiatives shows the government's benevolence to the disabled and marginalised persons. we express our heartfelt gratitude to the government for such initiatives. we know that, due to limited resources, the government alone cannot achieve the goal of poverty alleviation and sustainable development. able and affluent people should come forward to shoulder the social responsibilities. considering the facts, the speech of the finance adviser to encourage corporate houses to carry out their social responsibilities is praiseworthy.
