the london and irish police model and our experience
the late 18th century and early 19th century britain faced serious challenges of law and order. london, the capital of the british empire, was itself plagued by insecurity and violent crimes. it goes to the credit of sir robert peel, the then home secretary, who, after several abortive attempts by the british government to reform the police, succeeded in devising a system that slowly and gradually resulted in bringing about order to a city in shambles. the main principles behind peel's london metropolitan police act 1829 that shaped modern policing were:
dredging the silted rivers
the prime minister has directed the authorities concerned to formulate a complete plan for dredging the silted rivers of bangladesh to bring back navigability of those rivers at the earliest. she has prescribed the time limit of the plan as 'not more than 15 years'. she has suggested that the plan should start with excavating river gorai as its work progressed much during the last al regime (1996-2001). unfortunately,4-party government stopped it along with other dredging projects on political consideration completely ignoring the fact that economic and humanitarian consideration should always remain above political consideration, particularly in a poor developing country such as bangladesh. such a whimsical decision of the said government resulted in increase of people's misery and wastage of huge public money.
matter of credibility

can river training benefit us?
last month a section of press published a news report on a mega plan to dredge and train the river systems of bangladesh, including three major rivers the padma, the meghna, and the jamuna, to maintain navigation, recover land, and prevent flooding and bank erosion (the daily ittefaq. july 12). according to the report, the prime minister of bangladesh announced this plan on july 9th during a meeting with food and disaster management ministry officials. as an academic working in the field of river mechanics and sediment transport, i am concerned about the viability and outcome of such a major undertaking.

tagore --- spinning poems and songs
rabindranath tagore (1861-1941) remains a superman for us, even at this distance in time. he was the same to his contemporaries, though not until he reached the years when he would be recognised as a poet at home and abroad, and when this growing fame would be crowned with the 1913 nobel prize for literature. it is interesting to see, though, how he evolved from a common man, from an uncle or father, into a literary giant in the eyes of his close relatives and friends.
reliving time: ted and kara kennedy
the year: 1972. the month: february. the place: the main entrance to the dhaka university arts building hallway. the time: afternoon. three or four of us, all students of that institution, were lounging on the long brown wooden bench that was placed adjacent to the high left wall of the entrance. all the three gargantuan heavy wooden doors with elaborate carvings were wide open, symbolically announcing that the massive building, looking more like an enormous lump of concrete rather than exuding any aesthetic aura, was open to entry and egress. the late winter sun, giving off wan rays, would, before long, be disappearing over the horizon in a blaze of red glory.
she
i see a young woman walking alone at midday
through the alley's sun-drenched silence.
standing with a hand on the window grill
i wonder where she will go.
a complete stranger
yet for an unknown reason
a shadow of affection for her,
redolent of the scent of rain on dry earth
descends on my soul.
i wonder if she will walk like this
one day and enter a slimy darkness
or if unfathomable moonlight
will rain on her the rich pollen
of passionate love?
but let her rest
for the moment
in the serai of these lines.

the menacing intruder!
the recent outbreak of h1n1 influenza epidemic which is better familiar as swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type a influenza virus that causes regular outbreaks in pigs.
symptom and management of h1n1 influenza a
for antiviral treatment of novel influenza (h1n1) virus infection, either oseltamivir or zanamivir are recommended which are available in bangladesh.
pay attention to pandemic, not panic
the novel h1n1 influenza a virus spreads four times faster than other viruses and creates much panic all over the world. the rising number of cases every day and increase in death rate in some countries made it a serious concern. but experts in influenza and infectious disease are still saying the exact level of danger from the virus is still far from certain.
children first and always
for the last few days swine flu is all over the news. especially parents are really worried about their children, as children’s immunity is unlike a healthy adult. they catch normal flues easily. they also closely mix with each other when they are in school. and once they get infected or start undergoing treatment, sometimes they cannot express their symptoms properly.
recommendations for facemask/respirator use to reduce transmission
information on the effectiveness of facemasks and respirators for decreasing the risk of influenza infection in community settings is extremely limited. in the absence of clear scientific data, the interim recommendations below have been developed on the basis of public health judgment, the historical use of facemasks and respirators in other settings for preventing transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses and on current information on the spread and severity of the novel swine flu virus.
do’s and don't’s
* cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. it may prevent those around you from getting sick
some facts ...
* swine flu is a misnomer and should not be used to describe the current h1n1 outbreak in the human population. the proper name is h1n1 influenza a. the world health organisation (who) has stopped using the term swine flu to avoid confusion over the danger posed by pigs view the page strategic issues

peace eludes south caucasus
on 12th august, russia's prime minister's visit to abkhazia - a break-away territory recognized as an independent state by moscow - is a signal that russia is going to consolidate its hold on the territory.
should pakistan sign the ctbt?
after south asian nuclearization in 1998, the p-5 and the international community strongly condemned nuclear testing by both india and pakistan and urged both states to immediately sign the comprehensive test ban treaty (ctbt). in an initial reaction to the pressures thus generated on pakistan, the then foreign secretary shamshad ahmed was quoted as claiming that pakistan “would not be coerced into signing ctbt in disregard to its vital security interests.” however, in an attempt to deal with the political backlash of nuclear testing in the form of sanctions by the international community, prime minister nawaz sharif while addressing the 53rd session of the united nations general assembly stated that, “pakistan has consistently supported the conclusion of a ctbt for over 30 years…in a nuclearized south asia, ctbt would have relevance if pakistan and india are both parties to the treaty. however, pakistan's adherence to the treaty will take place only in conditions free from coercion or pressure.” view the page star books review
philosopher with the self-deprecating humour
the soldiers of the pakistan army had their job cut out for them on the night of 25 march 1971. when they reached gobinda chandra dev's quarters in the residential quarters of dhaka university within hours of the commencement of the genocide, they wasted no time. they simply pumped their bullets into dev. the philosopher, revered all over pakistan for his insights into life and all that it symbolized, collapsed. there was no chance he would live. the life had already gone out of him. dev's corpse would soon be dumped into a mass grave the pakistanis had some of their victims dug. in a matter of moments, the man who had spent his living years going through one sacrifice after another --- he did not marry, he did not opt for india when the partition of the country took place --- was dead and gone. in death, he assumed a new symbolism, that of a nation suddenly pounced upon by a horde of men masquerading as politicians and soldiers come from what was then west pakistan. dev died that night, or in the first light of the next day, as did thousands of others, as millions of bengalis would in the months to follow.
