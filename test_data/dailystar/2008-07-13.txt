one child policy
before our liberation war in 1971, the population of bangladesh was 60 million as opposed to the present figure of 150 million. it is pathetic and frustrating to discover that within less than 40 years we managed to increase our population by 150 percent, while retaining the position as one of the least developed countries with a poor literacy rate. did we, as citizens, think about the consequences of this population boom? the present scarcity of food, road space, educational and medical resources and the rising unemployment leading to degradation of law and order situation is caused by the population boom.
tribute to manekshaw
with a heavy heart, i would like to pay the highest tribute to the top commander of the joint bangladesh and indian forces of 1971 bangladesh liberation war, field marshal (then general and indian army chief) sam hormusji framji jamshedji manekshaw (1914 - 2008) and all his brave 'boys' (and also the bangladesh and indian navy and air personnel of '71) for swiftly defeating the organised evil of the pakistan army in bangladesh. they acted under the wise leadership of premiers indira gandhi (india) and tajuddin ahmed (bangladesh) in a hostile international situation. shrewd war planning and its execution by manekshaw's team saved millions of innocent lives from the hands of the pakistani troops.

non-utilisation of adp
i would like our govt. to carefully understand the following problems they are shortly going to face:
“derailed train”

drug abuse
my twin sister and me were going home after attending one of the monotonous classes. waving goodbye to my classmates, i started my journey home with my dear sister when suddenly something unusual caught my attention. a well-dressed boy was sitting all alone in the footpath holding a packet of white powder. i did not pay much heed to it first, but then the boy took some in his hand, smelled it and then gulped a whole mouthful of it. that's pretty weird because i had never seen such food before, neither did i saw any advertisement of such peculiar food. out of curiosity, i walked a few steps towards him. god bless my soul! i must be dreaming. that is drug. he was having it in broad daylight in a public place not bothering to maintain privacy. i was stunned. people walked past him, acting as if he did not exist. i was helpless too. taking allah's name i started walking. in the course of my journey, i cursed myself for believing that my country was one of the least developing countries. i was under a deep illusion. being a spectator of this incident i can surely say without any hesitation that my country bangladesh is not only developed but well ahead of others….
billboard issue
this is a reply to mr. aminul hoque's letter --"where are those billboards?" (in response to mr. zakaria's letter). i am a muslim and i have always made sure that people from other religions never feel uncomfortable in anyway because of the way i talk about myself. in fact if i am not mistaken that is one of the virtues of islam - giving everyone their democratic right and space.
“road show”
“road shows” may bring better opportunities for some of our policymakers and administrators for showing their success in the last 19 months. and it may raise the awareness of the people against corruption.
price hike
price hike is a common word these days. it is not a problem for the people in the top echelon of society. but it is putting the people of low and limited income groups in distress. i am a student and i know how difficult it is to survive.
use waterways
we are quite aware about the chaotic situation in our inter-district communications system. every year a lot of money is being expended from our national budget for road construction and maintenance. but have we seen any remarkable initiative to ease or lessen traffic congestion ? to mitigate the problem we should use alternate waterways, as we have a very good waterways system throughout the country.
neglected khilgaon
i have been living in khilgaon for over 25 years. unfortunately, i have never seen any development in this area. all sorts of works were done without any long-term thinking.
humour at its worst !
during the rule of shaesta khan, subedar of bengal (1664-1688), one could purchase 8 maunds (about 300 kilos) of rice at a cost of tk 1 only, i repeat tk 1 one only. while commenting on the present market price of rice and other essential commodities which have gone all time high and far beyond the buying capacity of common people, our finance adviser dr. mirza azizul islam has reminded us that this is not the age of khans. you better not ask for a better price than what you are enjoying (?) now, tk 40 a kilo to be specific!
poor road management
every year in the rainy season the roads become death traps. not even a single road is good for transportation. it is really sad to learn that these roads were made of poor bricks and other substandard construction materials. that's why the streets are easily damaged by rain. we know that every year the government spends a lot of money for road repairing and construction but it is an irony that we don't see any improvement.
unified english texts needed
often my students and others ask me which book or manuals should be used for improving english language proficiency.
sau
this university is continuously demanding that its vc be appointed from within itself, although this is a relatively new university. i don't find any rationale behind such a demand.
law and order
now, the government seems to be slightly reluctant about improving the law and order situation. we general people are experiencing incidents like hijacking in the busy roads of the city. the so-called “molom party” and “ogyan party” are coming into the scene again. the marked criminals are just waiting for the favourable time to start their activities. we don't know why our news media is silent on the incidents happening in the city every day.
train service
we all know that the train is a cheap and safe mode of transport, or mode of mass communication. but today we can call it cheap, but cannot say that it's safe. a few months ago, i travelled on intercity ekota express and nil sagor express to dinajpur and syedpur respectively. but these days i fear to travel on train because of frequent accidents.
re: stray dog

jamaat swindlers
