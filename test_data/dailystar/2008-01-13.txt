there is general agreement that the anti-corruption drive launched by the caretaker government has convinced people that no one is above the law. while that is a big stride we are nonetheless confronted with the problem of petty corruption that affects our life on a daily basis. this is the type of corruption that citizens encounter in their dealings with police stations, land registration offices, education department and union parishad personnel. there are also the very regrettable instances of aged, superannuated government employees having to gratify petty officials in their efforts to have their pensions settled and drawn. the list can be endless.

price hike
the exorbitant price hike of daily essentials, particularly coarse and other varieties of rice, edible oil, flour, lentils, and potatoes has put the common and fixed income groups in a very difficult situation. the prices of these commodities are very high and are showing an upward trend every day, it is now beyond the purchasing capacity of many common people. they have been facing acute hardship and, therefore, are trying to manage with less intake of food or avoiding some of these commodities in daily meals and even many daily wage earners have reduced their daily meals from three to two. on january 2, on my way to office, i saw a long queue of thousands of people of various classes waiting to purchase rice in a brd sponsored shop designated for selling daily essential commodities. it clearly indicates that the market prices of rice and other consumable commodities have gone very high.
hasina's illness
awami leaguers have put forward the demand that their leader sheikh hasina be sent abroad for medical treatment, although her lawyers who recently met with her did not notice any such serious illness and she gave a political statement, as usual, to her party supporters. she is an accused in a corruption case and at present an under trial prisoner. if she is sick, why the government should be asked to arrange her medical treatment abroad at the cost of the public exchequer is not understood. very recently, there was a similar demand from the awami league to send her husband for medical treatment abroad at government expenses. she is like any other ordinary citizen of the country and, therefore, should get the treatment from the government which an under trial prisoner is supposed to get. otherwise, if she can afford, she should be free to avail any foreign medical treatment, provided legally allowed. under no circumstances should the public funds be used for her medical treatment abroad.
china-japan ties
yasuo fukuda's recent visit to china is a reflection of the fact that fukuda looks forward to warming ties with china and the fact that by improving relations with china, he also looks to bolster his own position ( in effect, this would help him overshadow some of the domestic problems he has been facing, to a certain extent). while his predecessor looked to adopt a more tougher stance towards china, fukuda is certainly not following suit. and this was clearly reflected by the refusal of his government to meet the dalai lama in november last year (when he visited japan). the excuse given by his govt. was that dalai lama was not "important" enough and hence they could avoid meeting him.
release of top leaders
the year 2008, the long awaited election year for the people of bangladesh has dawned with a lot of hopes and aspirations. the ec (election commission) has declared a roadmap for a free, fair and credible election this year. this is the first time the people of bangladesh are expecting to cast their votes with voter id bearing their photos. there is lot of enthusiasm among public to enlist their names as voters. as the election time is nearing the voices of some of the leaders of certain political parties are becoming louder every day. they are dreaming that their old days are coming back and the people are always with them as they were and ready to sacrifice their lives for them as they did in the past, as if they (these leaders) have not done any wrong to the people and were not involved in any anti-people activities. they are trying to make the people believe that all the actions against them by the present ctg are vindictive. they are clean and "fuler mato pabitra"-- the slogan their supporters used for them.

gold and oil prices
a london based back page report on the rising gold prices (jan:02) was published in a local english daily. however, i believe that it is not relevant to the vast majority of bangladeshis; except for the very few well-to-do, who are planning weddings this winter. in addition, the same daily, in its bottom left hand column in the same page, writes about the paris based report of oil reaching 100 dollars a barrel soon this year! more miseries are in store for bus passengers and those who use oil driven transports. it will be no wonder if our electric power, water and fertiliser prices follow suit! view the page international

an ode to winter
chill in the air, lukewarm sunshine in the afternoon and scant fog at dusk characterise winter. in spite of the weak wintry features in this 'concrete jungle', the city dwellers still continue celebrating the season with passion. poush mela or winter fair at ramna batamul brought the flavours of culture and tradition in the midst of the hustle bustle of urban life. the celebration started early in the morning with a folk instrumental track when the timid winter sun just started shining. freedom fighter and folk singer abdul jabbar boyati and dr anisuzzaman inaugurated the celebration together lighting fire in a clay pot as a symbol of warmth. udichi, spandan, bonhi shikha, nrityom and renowned artists welcomed winter with songs, dances, poetry recitals and blowing of shaankh. the fair also offered mouth-watering winter cakes like bhapa, maalpoa, chitoi, paatishapta, handcrafted items and fresh honey. poush mela first started in 1997 at the rabindra shorobor beside the dhanmondi lake.
