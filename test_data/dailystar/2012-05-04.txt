honouring bangladesh's foreign friends
a friend in need is a friend indeed. some foreign friends contributed a lot for the emancipation of bangladesh from the clutches of pakistani occupation forces during 1971. some days ago bangladesh honoured those foreign friends who strongly deserved to be honoured. our heartfelt gratitude to the friends who came to bangladesh to be honoured. it is a good initiative by the government to honour our foreign friends who made invaluable contribution during our war of independence. they (our foreign friends) drummed up support from world leaders and mobilised financial support from different organisations, countries and individuals and provided training to mukti bahini. on the other hand, some countries went against the birth of bangladesh disregarding the just struggle of bangalee people. sadly, a section of bangalee people helped the pakistani army and committed all types of war crimes. they actually did not want the independence of bangladesh. we are waiting to see due punishment to the pakistani collaborators in this land. without the help of our foreign friends, it would be difficult for the independent bangladesh to claim its position on the world map. finally, i would like to thank our government for taking such a noble initiative to honour the true friends of bangladesh.
mind the education sector

pakistan has ranked higher than bangladesh in the world happiness report 2012, holding the 85th position against our 104th. even india lagged behind in the 94th position despite pakistan's reputation as a country rife with terrorism, religious extremism, political violence, and corruption. which leads us to this rightful question. what is happiness if contentious politicians, suicide bombers and trigger happy gunmen can make a happier country?
big statues don't cry, unless…
the thought has occurred to me before, but seems more relevant now. if you are lucky in life, you become a statue in death. if you are super lucky, you turn into a giant statue, majestically distinct from the torso-sized apparitions where it is impossible to determine whether our hero had a sparse moustache or merely the misfortune of a diarrheic bird dropping by for a rest and a chat on his head. the great icons of a nation get disfigured on a mammoth scale, whether it is gandhi dominating india's parliament or lincoln staring grimly from america's mount rushmore. it needs distance to get sufficient perspective on such majesty. no man is a hero to his valet, possibly because the valet stands too close to nose hair.

protecting freedom of expression online
media freedom has the power to transform societies and to change the course of history. over the past year, across the middle east and north africa, ordinary citizens found their voices using social media and blogs. but freedom of expression continues to be repressed in many countries and some have seen a significant decline in media freedoms. around the world, journalists, bloggers and others have been obstructed from doing their work by being harassed, monitored, detained, or subjected to violence.
