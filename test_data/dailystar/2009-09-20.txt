the essence of eid-ul-fitr
eid-ul-fitr brings with it a sense of joy we associate with a benign commitment to sharing it with others. coming as it does immediately after the end of ramadan, it is for all muslims an occasion not only to celebrate but also to introspect and reflect on the degree to which we have brought themselves closer to the true tenets of the religion and how prepared are we to identify ourselves with the woe of the disadvantaged and less fortunate members of society. it is not enough to be empathetic of their plight but also to contribute our mite to serving the cause of collective well-being. through a month of sacrifice and the process of self-purification we came to stage of giving zakat and fitra as a more than symbolic act of piety.
highway policing
in times like this, when there is a glut of vehicular traffic on the highways carrying home goers to various parts of the country to enjoy the holidays, does one feel the absence of a well organised highway police outfit even more. the present state of the highway police gives it little capacity to perform its assigned tasks.
let us not forget the countryside
all through last week, homebound people left the capital city in droves to celebrate eid-ul-fitr in their country homes. and how the capital as well as other bigger cities of bangladesh depend on the countryside for their verve and sparkle one can understand on such big socio-religious occasions such as eid. though the city's older residents often curse the influx of fresh invaders from the districts who are responsible for its ever-swelling population, its intolerable traffic jams and everything that annoys them, it is also the people from the countryside that keep the city going. the city-ward migrants who swarm the slums and the footpaths are not purely an object of vexation, for they also supply the factories, the households and the markets with their necessary workforce. the expanding city needs enough working hands and the migrants their work. so, they both serve one another. ideally, the relationship between the city and the rural backyard should have been mutually beneficial, a win-win one. unfortunately, in the case of the capital and other big cities of bangladesh, it is rather a lose-lose situation as it is also destroying the demographic and ecological balance of the cities.

dying zoo animals
the daily star has taken a timely and crucial step to pinpoint the social frailties and odds which is praiseworthy to citizens. going through the daily star on 11th september, 2009, i noticed the crucial issues about dhaka zoo at mirpur. it stated that a lion and a tiger died after the death of a young giraffe. more than 4 animals including a giraffe had already died in the past month. a survey has revealed that about 20 animals have died this year. many other animals are suffering from infectious diseases.
child labour at its worst
the headline of the 13th september issue of the daily star 'prisoners of ropes' caught my attention and i can not help but write this piece. it's pathetic and heartbreaking to know from that news report that minor boys are toiling hard at the rope factories in the outskirts of keraniganj to earn livelihood. the worst is that they are subjected to inhuman physical labour and are burdened with making coils of rope, carrying huge sacks of bobbins etc without having any protection gear at all. they almost work 12 hours a day for a meagre income. at this age when they should have been enrolled at educational institutions for study, they have been engaged in such barbaric tasks. it speaks about the fate of these ill-fated children. there are many such kids here in our country who are being engaged at various workshops and enduring great hardship to support their family and it a known fact to everybody. it seems that our government and the policy makers bother little about these children. it's understandable that the government is burdened with 'huge' tasks but at least it should look at the plight of these children. we don't expect our government to solve all the existing problems which the 'adults' of these country are going through but at least it can pay attention to the needs of the poor children who are subjected to such harsh treatment at workplaces due to poverty. without educating these poor children and ensuring their basic rights, how could this government expect to build the cherished 'digital bangladesh?'
the magic number
there was a fascinating front-page article on september' 09 in a local english daily. it highlights the very interesting mathematical phenomena of the digit 9. wednesday's date 09/09/09, if the added digit comes to:
what is democracy?
we, in bangladesh, profess to be a democratic and civilized society. but what is democracy? besides meaning 'rule by the majority', does it not guarantee the state bestowing on all its citizens, all the rights as enshrined in our sacred constitution. these rights include the right to travel on all public roads freely, it includes the right to earn one's livelihood by all legal means and it includes the right to mobility and access to any part of bangladesh.
primary education
bangladesh has one of the largest primary education systems in the word. primary education is recognized as a means of reducing poverty and improving the quality of life.
america's role
we know hitler of germany was the man behind the second world war. italy and japan were his partners. for stopping the war, america decided to drop an atom bomb on the enemies. but why did it choose japan and not germany or italy? many people believe that the war was at its final stage at that time. america chose the time to see and show its power. germany and italy were/ are european christian states and there were/ are many christian states around these two countries. on the other hand, japan was not a christian country and it was in asia.
a bankrupt america
when former us president bill clinton entered the white house, his first act to raise taxes on wealthy americans to stem a runaway budget deficit. clinton's tax-hike on the rich, denounced by republicans as "a passport to recession," balanced the budget, produced a surplus, lowered the long-term interest rates and triggered the longest economic boom in recent history. his successor president george w. bush squandered the surplus by his staggering $1.67 trillion tax cut, producing a massive $400 billion deficit.
criminology
the history of criminology from ancient times to the early twentieth century, its many themes at times have clashed and at times supported one another. some scholars concentrated on criminal law and procedure; others; on criminal behaviour. some took the biological route; others the psychological; still others, the sociological. and the work of some investigators has encompassed a combination of factors. the founding father of modern criminology is cesare di beccaria. after his long time research we have got the modern criminology.
bad news
we are aghast by the news that in the js session of september 8, 2009, speaker abdul hamid rejected all 35 notices from opposition lawmakers. they demanded discussion on various issues which are not only of opposition political parties but also of the people of bangladesh-- tipaimukh dam, shortage of power and gas, law and order situation, extortion, tender manipulation and many other problems.
diplomats and traffic
this is a reply to mr. sikander ahmed (ds september 13, 2009) where he sides with a diplomat's wife based in dhaka to protest against my original letter published on august 30th, 2009. the records will show that the words “most of the stretched out, 4-5 lakh gas-guzzling monstrosities that have flooded and blocked dhaka's narrow pot-holed roads, streets and lanes belong to the diplomatic community and that the bangladeshi tax-payers pay for their fuel” are mr ahmed's and not mine.
an interesting conversation
as i was travelling in a bus, i heard a very good conversation . a young quite well dressed man said that everyone was jealous of america's development and so they thought the fight against muslim terrorists was bad also. an old man said, “ have you yourself seen the muslim terrorist?” america and other european countries have killed millions of innocent people in afghanistan and in iraq but still they are against criminals. the old man asked the young guy if any terrorist entered his house whether he would destroy the whole building. the old man further said that if the judge was guilty himself how could he make a right decision and how would you fight against that guilty judge. everyone listened to the conversation and the young man became completely silent.
day and night test cricket
the bangladesh cricket board (bcb) has agreed to the ecb's request to appear in the first ever day-night test during the team's tour of england in may-june 2010. the icc has not yet cleared the idea and its approval will be subject to suitable equipment being developed for the purpose. the decision taken by the bcb is a trend setting one but the reality is something different. the test may end in 02 days' time in favour of england as the tropical tigers are not accustomed to playing in the chilly weather of england during the month of may and june. the day time temperature in these months is much cooler than our winter and when we talk about the evening temperature it certainly will freeze our tigers. view the page international

reflections on eid
eid-ul-fitr is not as old as eid-ul-azha. whereas eid-ul-azha, that commemorates the glorious sacrifices of the prophets ibrahim and ismail (peace be upon them), goes back to the days of yore in the 18th century before christ. eid-ul-fitr originated in the 7th century ad. in fact, it is the newest major festival amongst the celestial religions. it saw the light of day only 1,387 years ago.
the eid-ul-fitr dilemma
eid-ul-fitr comes after ramadan, on shawwal 1, and fasting is forbidden on that day. the islamic calendar is based on the lunar cycle and important days are scheduled by seeing the crescent moon of the month. our beloved prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) also followed the lunar month for ramadan.
in a class of his own
shashi tharoor has to be the only indian who was safer last week in liberia than in jaipur. after all, no one in liberia had asked for his resignation, but the chief minister of rajasthan, ashok gehlot, a fellow congressman, did suggest that the best option for tharoor would be to resign. i cannot think of a previous occasion when a congress chief minister has asked for the head of a union minister from his own party. this must, incidentally, also be the first time that a politician is in trouble because of a misplaced sense of humour.
