sheikh hasina's release
we at this newspaper welcome the release from incarceration, however tentative, of former prime minister sheikh hasina. we hope that she will now be provided with adequate medical treatment abroad for her health-related problems. as we express our satisfaction over her newfound freedom, we recall the manner in which she was arrested last july even before charges were framed against her. we remember too the fact that she was denied bail by the courts and so was compelled to remain a prisoner.
import duty on schoolbooks
the finance and planning adviser's proposal to clamp a 25 percent import duty on pictorials and drawing books for english medium schools is not based on sound logic. first, the very thought that such imported books have contents that run counter to our social and cultural values is, we believe, erroneous or at best short-sighted. the standard english books are used worldwide as study material and don't contain anything that might be treated as objectionable. if the decision makers really found something against our mores, or not appropriate in our social context, they should have pinpointed it. exchanging views with all the stakeholders, that is, the teachers, academicians, parents, importers etc was also necessary before putting an additional financial burden on the students and the parents.

using technology in cricket
in recent years, umpire's 'wrong' decisions on the field are seen to be determining a game's fate to a certain extent and sometimes creating misunderstanding among the rival countries. technology has paved the way for watching things much more closely and clearly. umpire's wrong decision makes them unpopular and controversial. a few years ago, the use of technology in cricket became a controversial issue. but what the cricket world has seen since then is more shocking and embarrassing. watching your favourite team losing terribly because of umpire's 'wrong decision' is painful. my question to those who are against the use of technology is, if technology can be used in certain cases such as detecting the ball whether it crossed the boundary or not or confirming a doubtful catch or run out etc, why can't it be used for deciding lbw or an edge of the bat or such other questionable/confusing matters?

eco-management means the development and exploitation of natural resources in a sustainable way which is environment friendly. change and development are essential to human progress, and exploiting nature in this process is not a new phenomenon. in this march of progress, we have overexploited nature and caused harm to its environmental quality. however, we actually realized the problem only during the last fifty years when it started to be grave and there was a hue and cry throughout the globe. that there is a link between development and environmental issues was first raised in stockholm congress in 1972 and then at rio conference in 1992 and rio+10 in 2002 as a global forum and it has been realized that development is also possible by making peace with nature. this has been termed as sustainable development. it needs a point of balance whereby the present need may be met without jeopardizing the environmental quality of nature for future generation.

judges
it is mentioned in article 96 of the constitution that a judge cannot be removed by the president without the recommendation of the supreme judicial council. but, by means of interpretation of article 97, the president has the power to remove the chief justice without any recommendation of the council. according to article 97, if the president is satisfied that the chief justice is, on account of absence, illness, or any other cause, unable to perform the functions of his office then the president shall appoint a new chief justice. in this provision, by the term “any other cause” there is the reservation of power of the president to remove the chief justice.
