protect national interest
the national committee to protect oil, gas, mineral resources, power and ports has called for a half day hartal on july 3, in protest against government's signing of a production sharing contract with the us oil company concophillips on june 16, which is against the interest of the country. we think people from all walks of life should support them and make the strike successful because it is solely on their behalf. we are outraged by the government's intolerant attitude towards the protesters. they beat up the national committee leaders and activists and snatched away banners and placards from them. the committee is not politically motivated, its only aim is to protect our national resources; whenever needed, it came forward to resist the action of the government which could harm the country. the committee has forced the previous bnp led alliance government to discard a plan to engage asia energy for open-pit coal mining in phulbari through a popular movement. prime minister sheikh hasina, who was then the leader of the opposition, went all the way to phulbari to express her solidarity with the committee. now people's interest has become less important to her. it is really very strange how their perception changes with the change of their position.
we wait for thee, o rain!
rainy season, one of the six seasons of bangladesh, comes after the scorching heat of summer makes life unbearable. the nature gets a new life. trees get fresh and look green. various types of flowers bloom in this season. when the rain stops sometimes there is a rainbow in the sky. what a sight! what is most important is that agriculture depends on the amount of rainfall. the ground water level is recharged by the rains. sometimes it rains heavily for days together which causes flood. flood brings untold sorrows and sufferings. the city dwellers suffer most for water-logging. they do not get any transport to go to their destination. traffic jam increases everywhere. nevertheless, we wait eagerly for this season.
railway tickets in black market
train journey is very popular because it is comfortable and cheap. other than train, all kinds of transports' fare have already hiked. but artificial ticket crisis is the worst problem the passengers are facing nowadays. passengers do not get tickets even before 10 to 12 days of their journey. bangladesh railway has introduced online ticketing system and passengers can look into the screen which shows the availability of seats. the screen always shows that all tickets are sold, even before one week of a journey. recently, a widespread allegation was made by the passengers that some corrupt railway officials are involved in siphoning off tickets to black marketers. passengers have also complained that if someone pays extra money to the counter man, s/he can get a ticket easily. a group of black marketers move freely in kamalapur railway station and openly sell tickets charging high price. ministry of communications has already got a bad reputation. so, my request to the railway authorities please identify those who are involved in this bad practice and take stern action against them. otherwise, people will reject this popular service forever.
we need moral doctors
it has been said by perhaps hundreds of readers through the letters columns of different newspapers about the lack of proper behaviour, culture, ethics and the exorbitant charges imposed on patients by our doctors in the clinics. but there is no consumer protection law to protect us health seekers. no survey has been conducted or no standardisation has been done, no regime in fees structure has been set. patients continue to suffer!
bangladeshis abroad
most of the highly educated people have migrated to other countries due to government's negligence in providing appropriate benefits to those highly qualified personalities. so it is time bangladesh should view its expatriate population as a strategic asset, and not as a liability. not as a brain drain.
at long last!
a front page centre piece photo-news from “focus bangla” source was published on june 25, in a local english daily, which was a classic 'real life' case of 'too little, too late'. on a liberal optimistic viewpoint, one may say that it is “better late than never”!

business class bus!
the other day i was heading for karatia, tangail. suddenly a recklessly driven bus caught my attention. “hanif exclusive business class” was written on top of the bus. it had no signal lights. if this is their business class service, what about their ordinary service? last but not the least, how come these busses ply in front of traffic police?
stop finding faults!
in this world not all people will like you. and you can't please everyone. but there are some people who try to distract and demoralize others by trying to find faults pointlessly. they come and advise you what you should do or not. and if it has something to do with creativity, like composing music and stuff; they are over enthusiastic. if you start something new, they come up to depress you. criticism is alright as far as it is constructive and not discouraging. proper criticism in proper place is an art, otherwise it only ends up in 'finding faults with others'. there is a fine line between "cool, but you can do a lot better than this" and "you're no good for doing this". most people fail to criticize properly by trying to put others' spirit down but while doing that they only let their own frustration out. may be that's why kobi guru said, "lok er kotha nish ne kaan e...”
will they ever be punished?
the plunderers of the sundarbans are cutting valuable trees and selling it in public with the help of some unscrupulous employees of the forest department. it is an open secret in the locality. but none even dare to protest the crime. in paikgachha, shyamnagar and ashasuni upazila headquarters, these illegal logs are being sold in presence of the law enforcers.
our attitude towards divorce
the attack on rumana by her husband indicates that even the highly educated women of our society are not safe. rumana tolerated everything for the sake of her daughter. this was the greatest mistake she made. she could have divorced her husband long time ago. unfortunately, we still think divorce is a social crime. it is high time that we changed our attitude towards divorce. every person has the right to lead her/his life the way s/he wants.

creeping changes in saudi arabia
the seismic political changes taking place in the middle east today seem to have little effect on saudi arabia. there is no discernible opposition in that country. nor is there any cry for political change or for economic reforms. so what is happening there?
big fat south asian weddings
as i sat in a corner, observing the wedding festivities of a friend's daughter, two parallel emotions played on the canvas of my mind: nostalgia and horrified amazement. nostalgia, for the days of my youth, when a wedding was a solemn and modest affair focusing on the union of two people. and, horrified amazement at the contemporary wedding i was witnessing: an ostentatious ceremony with its gauche display of pomp and splendor.
rumanas, and why they stay
when zobaida nasreen called me up to tell me what had happened to rumana, i was on a busy street in dhanmondi and i thought i had heard her wrong. i kept asking her to repeat. she must be talking about someone else, i thought.
the people problem
every year when the population day (july 11) approaches, people show an enthusiasm about the country's population problem. but after a while such discussions fade away, just like the government's population policies. although high population is the prime problem of bangladesh, population control has not been given due importance and neither has the government taken any effective steps in this regard. on the contrary, on june 2, 2010, in the parliament, what the honorable prime minster said is really frustrating. she neither considers the population of one of the most highly dense countries of the world as a burden, nor is she concerned about the high growth rate of its population. she vowed to transform the population into skilled manpower -- which of course we all appreciate -- but without keeping it within a manageable and tolerable limit, is it really feasible? is population in bangladesh a development challenge or a development opportunity? the fact remains that, high population growth is a serious impediment towards the development efforts of the country and therefore it is crucial to realise the seriousness of the issue and to take necessary steps in this regard as uncontrolled population could very well spoil all development efforts. we must develop the nation but the increasing population of bangladesh may act as a formidable obstacle.
the economics of our loins
life, they say, and death, for sure, are beyond our control. just like my worth. “ajke tumi 100,000 taka, kalke 50,000, porshu 25,000, aar tar porer din … nai!” is what he said to me when i told him i am in my twenties and not interested in getting married at the moment. “boyosh toh are kom holona!” he said, “taar upor dekhteo eto bhalona. kaalo. shomoy thakte thakte biyeta kore felo. eto porashuna-ghuraghuri-chakri-bakri diye ki hobe?” (you're not getting younger! on top of that you're not that good-looking. dark-skinned. tie the knot while you still have time. what are you going to do with all this education-travelling-work?)
the labyrinth of budgets and finances
labyrinths are not something that one consciously steps into; one gets caught in these somewhat unknowingly. budgets are such labyrinths that are not intended that way, but they become so when you try to explain these to the people affected by it. every home needs a budget (of what to spend and where the money comes from), and so does a nation. but woe becomes the head of the household who cannot please anyone in his house with his spending plan and least of all try to get the money everyone in his or her family wants to spend. now jump the screen to the national budget that has millions of lives hooked to it. woe betide becomes the person who finds him in this labyrinth of unfulfilled desires of many and wrath of many others, and yes, like the poor head of the household he has to find the money he has planned to spend.
