history repeats itself
history repeats itself … we made joke of this famous quotation with our fellow canadian students just a few days back. to my utter disbelief and horror, history repeated itself, and this time with even more brutality. the history of the subcontinent is full of bloodshed and assassination of cult figures: mk gandhi, sheikh mujib, indira gandhi, rajiv gandhi, senior bhutto, and now his daughter benazir bhutto. one common pattern visible through all these assassinations and bloodsheds is that the targets are obvious, the comparatively secular leaders. in bangladesh we have seen life threatening attempts on hasina, who though has compromised with the secular identity of her party, still remains the strongest semi-secular leader in the country. gandhis were believed to be the epitome of secularism despite their consequent denigration. the causes of these murders are arguably different but the outcomes are strikingly similar: the assassination of gandhis emboldened the strength of bjp, the death of mujib paved the way for fundamental and anti liberation elements within the country, and the hanging of senior bhutto terminated any possibility of secular and democratic resurgence in pakistan compounded by the unceremonious role of military leaders.

helping cyclone victims
we have been watching the pictures of sidr victims of south bangladesh in cable tvs. it is obvious that the people of those areas are so poor that they cannot afford to construct strong shelters, which can sustain a cyclone like sidr. the governments in the past constructed shelters to save people from cyclone and tsunami. but those are not enough in number to accommodate all the people. the present government is preparing projects with its own funds as well as with the help of donors to build more shelters. it sounds nice. the experts also support this idea as a short-term measure to save human lives. to supplement the short-term measure additional long-term measures are also needed to reduce future sufferings of the people in the costal belt. the following projects may be considered:

energy saving bulb and health hazards
“energy saving bulb or less power consuming electric bulb” that is “fluorescent” or “incandescent bulb” has been marketed in bangladesh and is being used in most of the places --from hospitals, industrial units to homes. fluorescent lamp uses 1/4th energy of incandescent lamp and lasts as much as 10 times longer. fluorescent bulb contains toxic materials like mercury. improper disposal of it releases mercury into air, soil, water, thus endangering human health. it needs h2e( www.h2e-online.org) recommended 10 steps disposal. approximately 95% of the power consumed by an incandescent bulb is emitted as heat, rather than as visible light. an incandescent light bulb, with this 5% efficiency, is about one quarter as efficient as a fluorescent lamp (about 20% efficiency), and produces about six times as much heat with the same amount of light from both sources. both fluorescents and incandescent bulbs are hazardous for human health as well as for the environment.

can carbon trade be a solution to global warming?
carbon trading is a market mechanism intended to tackle global warming. though it dates back to 1989 it only took off as a market after the kyoto protocol was signed by some 180 countries in december 1997, in kyoto, japan. the protocol calls for 38 industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions between the years 2008 and 2012 to levels that are 5.2 percent lower than those of 1990. carbon is an element stored in fossil fuels such as coal and oil. when these fuels are burned, carbon dioxide is released and acts as what we term a "greenhouse gas". carbon is the common denominator in all polluting gases that cause global warming. under kyoto, each participating government has its own national target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. this was an important issue discussed in recent bali conference. us senate has recently discussed a climate change bill promoting carbon trading.
