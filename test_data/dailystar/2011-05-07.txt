the other co2 problem
the global environmental threat is growing as the world is going to face another problem in near future alongside the global warming and climate change. the discovery of this emerging global problem is quite recent and it has received relatively little attention until now but within the next few decades it may turn out to be one of the most severe in terms of impacts on marine life.

rabindranath: he belonged to the world
a hundred and fifty years after his birth, rabindranath tagore remains a pre-eminent, indeed the pre-eminent, man of letters on both sides of the old, historical bengal. humanist, poet, storyteller, artist, playwright, mystic, thinker, he is yet south asia's voice in a wider global perspective.
on the eve of 25 baishakh, 8 may, star literature pays tribute to the bard.
--- literary editor
the memoirs and the biographies
rabindranath tagore (1861-1941), the first non-european to win the nobel prize, created much enthrallment among the european and american communities after the publication of the gitanjali (song offerings), in november 1912 from the india society of london. a novelist, short story writer, playwright, composer and essayist, rabindranath was an educationist, actor and organiser as well. and all these made this myriad-minded literary personality well known across the western zone of the globe. the sharpness of his philosophical height demanded many documents on him which resulted in many biographies of the poet being published, not to mention the memoirs of the bard.
the poet's mystique
my first encounter with rabindranath tagore was on a cold winter's day in early 1964. he was there as a sketch in pencil, on the mantelpiece of a bengali home in quetta. the flowing beard, the penetrating eyes, that sense of gravitas --- all of this came alive in that sketch. i asked the host, a colleague of my father's, who the gentleman was in the sketch. a great man, said he. he is rabindranath tagore, a poet. young as i was, in primary school, i asked no more questions. view the page star health

rethink sri lanka
sri lanka, the pearl of indian ocean and bangladesh has a warm relationship and this has been consistent since the bloody birth of bangladesh in1971. but this relationship couldn't reach its zenith because of consistent ignorance from intellectuals to popular leaders and mass media over the years. in bangladesh public perceptions are too much influenced by the concept of 'great power' or 'super power'. if rajapaksa were the premier of any great or super power he could attract huge media coverage. there could have been a buzz for days before his arrival. in bangladesh a popular mindset works when it comes to india, pakistan, china or usa. the media jump upon ministry of foreign affairs and intellectuals start to talk in many seminars-forums about upcoming heads of government of the above mentioned countries. this zeal doesn't work for other states like sri lanka. what i say is that all these are common popular blunder. when it comes to bilateral relations, it comes with an option to achieve whosoever is in the other side. eventually we forget that in the negotiation table with great or super power on the other side is not always necessarily helping us to gain; rather we sacrifice our interest. on the contrary, when there is an opposition with equal status then we have greater chance to gain. that's why states like sri lanka should get no less attention from our leaders and media.
the mythos of obama and osama
obama and osama. two names that will henceforth be coupled. the hunter, obama, is leader of the most powerful and feared nation on earth. osama, the hunted, was leader of a borderless state -- a non-state actor -- and probably the most feared religio-political association of the modern world since the rise of the ismaili hashashin assassins between the 11th and 13th centuries.

being in love with one's language
most of us bengalis profess to love our mother tongue. most of us also think of the language movement as a quest for national identity. twenty-first february 1952 stands out as a symbol of both. it speaks for bengali language and identity. does it also speak for other languages in the world?
perceptions on a complex issue
you could choose to expend this effort: propose in a scholarly undertaking that the security of an ant is a function of human security, send it to undp and a host of human security theorists, and the possibility cannot be ruled out that your hypothesis could figure prominently in the glittering array of human security theories and what they entail that have been offered down the years. or, maybe not! i am being cynical, but, upon going through human security index for south asia: exploring relevant issues , i am totally bewildered at just how vast a range of topics human security theories cover. seemingly, almost anything and everything under the sun! pardon the hyperbole.
