dealing with population matters
the observance of world population day yesterday ought to have been a good occasion for serious reflection on how bangladesh has been dealing with the issue. in an important way, that was indeed what was done across the country. aside from the usual rituals and mouthing of platitudes, certain factors related to the population issue were brought to light. and it is these factors, or realities as we know them, that we must now handle. fundamental to any discussion of population matters, however, is the question of whether or not the overall national approach to it has lately taken a back seat to other, perhaps more 'pressing' issues. view the page sports

jahangirnagar scene
the bangladesh chhatra league has again come up with its ugly face. this time it was in jahangirnagar university. it appears they went on their 'cruelty show' to facilitate land grabbing by their paymasters. a few weeks back their fellow compatriots of barisal polytechnique even played a more harrowing drama perhaps for similar pecuniary gains. the government has shown profound anger and annoyance, but to no avail. can we suggest the ruling party to disband the chhatra league for the next two years ? even forever? i would like to remind here that in awami league's 7 years struggle against bnp-jamaat and the army backed caretaker government, the bcl had little contribution. even in the last election bcl workers were hardly active. the awami league has got such a vast number of workers in the field level that they have no need for such unruly student activists. what they need to do is to organise genuine workers in ward, union and thana level.
healthcare delivery
an important and investigative report was published in the front page of a local english daily on june 29. it was about a very sad truth. however, i wonder if any eyebrows will be raised by the officials at the ministry of health. through this letter, may i as a citizen draw the kind attention of the hon. minister of health to this matter, and the suggestions given for serious consideration.

politics in pakistan
after the recent bombing of a sufi shrine in lahore by the taliban and their acolytes, yasser latif hamdani, a columnist for lahore's daily times, wrote on july 4: "the purpose was not to create fear. the purpose was to target the soft traditions of sufism traditions that have influenced punjab's social milieu for centuries. this popular islam is the reason why there is a muslim majority in pakistan." it is the sufi tradition of non-violence and toleration in the sub-continent that attracted many low-cast hindus to convert to islam. moreover, sufism allowed sunnis and shias in the subcontinent to live in relative harmony.
obesity
i was reading a write-up duly published in the medical news today and learned that obesity is not just a problem for the usa, it is not just limited to other developed countries either - it is a problem that has spread throughout the globe, and is now recognized as an insidious killer and the major contributing cause of preventable diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease - according to professor paul zimmet, chairman of the 10th international congress on obesity, sydney, australia.
the biggest upset!
after the netherlands won against the mighty brazil, some people said that it was an upset. in this sense, it must be the biggest upset when you saw how spain ousted the germany from world cup semi-final. germany is three times world cup winner and also thrashed the mighty england & argentina in a row whereas there is nothing in the history of spain except 2008 euro championship. so, beating germany should be the biggest upset. credit must go to the netherlands not spain as they beat brazil from behind (0-1 to 2-1). some small teams score first than defend during the whole match or score more in counter attacks but they do not win from behind. if they do so, they are not the small team.
cruelty
the gruesome murder of the minor boy samiul, a student of nursery class, reportedly at the hands of his mother and her paramour has surpassed all known tragic incidents in the world. the cursed mother allegedly committed this barbarous crime to continue her illicit love with another criminal without any hindrance, as the news goes. this is simply beyond any normal human being's capacity of thinking. words fail to express our disturbed and shocked mind when we read the news of the murder of the innocent boy. we strongly abhor and resent such kind of inhuman and brutal acts.

unmitigated violence
the daily star carried an editorial on 5 july under the headlines "rumours leading to unmitigated violence". violence on rumours, small incidents or street accidents, demand for shifting of exam dates in schools and colleges, dismissal of an employee for indiscipline, transfer of a teacher from one place to another, a small quarrel between the bus conductor with a passenger, there is no word if the passenger is a student, even a feud in an office may lead to such violence in bangladesh. i heard that in the night brazil was defeated by the netherlands violence occurred in some places in bangladesh. today, i noticed a small news item in a bangla daily that a person had committed suicide after the defeat of his favourite football team, argentina. a few years back there was a street procession against a dramatist who in his drama punished a villain in his drama story.

i read with great interest the recommendations of sir frank peters of honouring bangladesh's newest hero musa ibrahim with a postage stamp (daily star 5/7/10). i entirely agree.
video game

i began driving at a tender age of 12 and i got my first driving licence in the year 1976. since then i have been driving on the streets of dhaka, chittagong, sylhet, rajshahi and many other places without one single incident of accident.
load shedding
name the country, where load shedding takes place almost every alternative hour! yes, that is bangladesh, where failure of the government has already put the entire nation into severe sufferings due to increased power shortage thus causing regular load shedding in every alternative hour in the capital city. most of the urban parts of the country remain dark for an average of 10-15 hours a day. power distribution lines have been expanded over the years to cover more consumers but the production of electricity did not increase.
my friends' outlook
when i ask many of my friends, âfriend, what are you going to do after your graduation?â most of them say, âoh that's very easy. i will go to usa/canada/australia/england/spain etc. there i will complete my post graduation and then i will take a very good jobâ then i tell them that bangladesh is going to lose you. but tell me why don't you want to come back? they say bangladesh is a place of poverty, natural disaster, terrorism .who will give me a good job, a handsome salary to run my family wonderfully? who will give me a secure life? moreover, there are no enough palaces to use my brain and my education. even there is no place for experiment. that's why i am going to say good-bye to bangladesh. view the page international
