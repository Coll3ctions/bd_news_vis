a retrograde step
we are both surprised and baffled at the finance minister's, or shall we say, the government's change of heart by the turn of a single year! only in the last year's budget the finance minister had announced that private universities would be exempted from vat in keeping with the government's goal for stimulating higher education in private sector. but there was a compulsion, too: the public universities do not simply have the capacity to accommodate burgeoning surges in the number of higher education seekers.
caring for human trafficking victims
human trafficking remains a major concern for bangladesh, despite the increasing social awareness about it. there are of course reasons to believe that of late such trafficking has come down, but that is certainly no cause for anyone to sit back in complacency. with fairly regular reports of the many travails bangladeshis, especially women and children, go through at the hands of traffickers, the significance of how much more needs to be done to neuter the problem can hardly be over-emphasised. that much is certain. but with this broad issue of putting a stop to or preventing human trafficking comes another, namely, the requirement of special care for victims of such trafficking. view the page sports

pollution
getting a proper environment is the life-blood to modern civilization. the world we live in is the most attractive place with striking landscapes and features, wild and domesticated animals, and a variety of odoriferous flowers, evergreen trees and the most wonderful creation of the almighty-- the human beings. the world has been created for the human beings so that they would applaud the lord for his power and preserves these natural beauties with undiminished care. but man has been doing the opposite thing bit by bit. trees have been cut down to make way for construction of modern buildings. waste is discarded on land and water, which breed mosquitoes. our environment is being polluted due to air and water pollution. air is mainly being polluted by smokes. when bricks are burnt, smokes are created. the compositions of such smoke particles are nicotine, thiophin, phosgene, sulphur dioxide and pyridine. these particles pollute the air tremendously. the smokes are also created when different vehicles ply along the streets. for these reasons, all the streets are filled with the smokes that adversely affect the human health conditions. burning poisonous gases like sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, nitric acids and sulphuric acids, again create the smokes. these particles make the air heavy and polluted. besides, the problems of greenhouse effects are felt throughout the world.
limping railways
railways are important for communication. the transportation costs of railways are lower than any other transport system.
university education
what our universities need most today is second-generation reforms after pursuing the policy of establishment and consolidation for over forty years. the reforms should include updating of syllabi, full autonomy, political non-interference and, above all, accountability of both the teachers and the taught. state funding of higher education should become more liberal and a sound mechanism of quality control should be put in place. university education cannot be divested from the socio-economic uplift of the masses. therefore, the government should come forward with well meaning employment/placement programs. privatisation is a fatal short cut to the problems afflicting higher education in bangladesh. at best, it is an escape from a strategic area of national life. the crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism. our whole educational system suffers from this evil. an exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career. laws for the liberal education of youth, especially for the lower classes of people, are so extremely wise and useful that to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant.
mid-term polls
why does bnp, "boro natokio party" now want a mid-term poll, as reported on may 29 by most dailies? should they not rather re-organise the party, recently beaten in the polls; without wasting time on strikes and all sorts of violence? but who are the public to question them? they 'care a fig' for the public, or public opinion, for that matter! only the opinion of the apex of their clue-less "high command" matters!
bnp's stunt
according to the top leader and other leaders, the bnp is the only political party and its members are the true patriots in bangladesh. there are no other patriots in bangladesh. according to them all other people who support other parties and follow other political ideologies, are traitors and are continuously trying to sell out the country to outside powers. they sincerely believe that the present mohajote government was installed by foreign powers and working for foreign interests. the bnp leaders have voiced demand for an interim election to test the present government's popularity because this government has failed everywhere, people are already fed up with this government and eagerly waiting for change of power.
generation of nuclear power
bangladesh is on the verge of graduation from a least developed country to a developing one with many positive criteria including over $ 750 per capita income. the pace of development is also fairly high and the demand for power is increasing by about 500 mw per year. on the other hand, we do not have any vast deposit of natural gas, let alone oil. the possibility of generating hydro-power is also bleak, as our land is mostly plain and deltaic. the future of green energy is rather limited and reportedly not viable in the long run. in such a situation, our only option is to go nuclear with courage and conviction. let the timorous politicians and scientists no more stand in the way. i must say that due to the negative attitude of the previous governments and a section of our so-called civil society, our ruppur nuclear plant remained inactive for decades. let the ghosts of three mile island in pennsylvania in 1979 or that of chernobyl in the former ussr in 1986 no more deter us. we never stop building high rise buildings for fear of calamities like earthquake which can demolish everything in the twinkle of an eye. may we not forget that while many developing countries including india and pakistan resorted to nuclear power generation, we have no reason to lag behind.
begunbari market
the begunbari area in tejgaon, with a huge catchment population of few lakhs, surprisingly does not have a market of its own. the encroachment of the road by a hundred or so makeshift shops have virtually narrowed the road and is the source of unbearable sufferings to vehicles and pedestrians. the footpaths are all occupied and the shops occupy most of the roads. piles of garbage and rubbish thrown are hardly removed causing further nuisance. the road could be an important link road between shatrasta and gulshan. there are several vacant plots in the area. it would not be difficult to identify a specific area for a kitchen market as well as a supermarket. i would request the authorities concerned to immediately evict all unauthorized makeshift shops from the area and make the road useable.
buet student's death
a road accident took away the valuable life of a buet student. he was run over by a bus, on the way to hospital he succumbed to his injuries. it is no new incident in the dhaka city that reckless driving sometimes snatches away valuable lives and the agitated people vandalise the buses and cars on the road. the drivers don't understand that life is more valuable than time. the authorities concerned should impose strict rules and regulations to control reckless driving. besides these, the drivers have to be trained to drive the cars following the traffic law to avoid such kind of occurrences. only enacting law is not enough. i call upon the people from all walks of life to come forward to raise awareness amongst us. socio-cultural organisations should chalk out colourful programmes highlighting the value of life and avoiding risk while walking on the road.
everest and youngsters
the first ever bangladeshi mt. everest conqueror, musa ibrahim, didn't merely carry our flag to the apex, but also gave a lesson to our youngsters. this is the lesson to boost our spirits.
ruling party's policy
i am shocked to see that ruling party stalwarts are always trying to find faults with their opponents, while they seemed not at all concerned with the failures of the govt. by withdrawing all cases against al people including the pm and not doing justice to the opposition party members, what are they trying to establish?
israel's aggression
israel claimed that a flotilla of pro-palestinian activists seeking to bust the gaza blockade was a provocation and that the aid it was carrying was “unnecessary.” “i don't see the need for any ship with these materials. we allow these materials into gaza,” colonel moshe levy told reporters at the kerem shalom crossing in reference to the 10,000 tonnes of building materials and other supplies the activists say were aboard a flotilla heading toward gaza.
unemployment
the country has been experiencing acute unemployment. the government has to resolve this problem because it is mainly the responsibility of the government to mitigate unemployment to a minimal level. however, instead of solving the problem, the government's activities are making the unemployment situation worse. from the electronic media it is learnt that most of govt. departments can not run their daily activities due to huge vacancies of govt posts.
modern life
people are presently giving priority to earning money, not gathering knowledge. moreover, they want to have their own way all the time. they hardly think of others. regrettably, the more people are getting used to the modern way of life, the more rude they are being to others.
jmb regrouping
it is horrible news for us, the peaceful general people of bangladesh, that jama'atul mujahidden bangladesh, the banned extremist outfit, believed to have weakened in recent years, still has around 400 full-time cadres across the country and a military wing capable of launching spectacular attacks.
nimtoli & begunbari
the whole country must be crying now. even a heartless man might also be crying at the tragedy of nimtoli and begunbari. but the tears have no value if we silently wait for another new tragedy.
things going wrong
as a sensible citizen of this country i'm absolutely cynical about our overall socio-political scenario. i really don't know what i must be proud of when everyday countless dismal reports of atrocious violence torment our conscience. the irresistible crime rate of the country is breaking all records as every day the sinister monster of carnage reigns over the innocents. murderers, muggers, and extortionists dauntlessly rule over the common people. view the page international

i'm an avid supporter of the brazilian team. right now i've only two things on mind -- football and acting. i intend to watch all of the matches. if that's not possible, i'll at least try not to miss any match featuring brazil. the excitement and rush football induces are unique. i don't feel this way about any other sport. of course this passion for the sport is amplified every four years during the world cup. i've already made plans to watch the games with my family; have even bought a brazil jersey. i'd be delighted if the final is between brazil and spain; if not any team against brazil will do, as long as brazil is in the final.
