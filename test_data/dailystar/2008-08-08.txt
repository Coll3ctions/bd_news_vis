upholding the rights of indigenous communities
there is little question that bangladesh's indigenous people, like indigenous people elsewhere in the world, must be allowed to enjoy rights enjoyed by other communities across the globe. and that is the idea that has of late been advocated in this country, thanks to the relentless efforts made by conscious sections of the population. we are happy to note that at this point of time, the conditions in which our indigenous communities live and the positive change that ought to come into their lives are a subject that has drawn the attention of broad sections of our society. evidence of such interest in the well-being of the indigenous communities comes yet once more through the launch of a book on indigenous people on wednesday. moreover, the chittagong hill tracts commission has been at work, with britain's lord avebury being in bangladesh at present to get his own perspective on the situation. it is such manifestation of interest that can go a long way toward strengthening the social bonds which unite people of various communities in this country.

taking a leaf from rahul's book
i hope it doesn't run the risk of being misunderstood as an indian sympathiser to say that rahul gandhi's visit to bangladesh was a breath of fresh air. we saw a 38-year-old dapper young man, scion of the longest ruling family in the largest democracy in the world, whose great-grandfather, grandmother, father and mother, all have been the leading lights of indian politics. it was impressive to know that he was taking interest in poverty alleviation and rural development. so far, our experience has been to the contrary. young leaders and their cabals of sidekicks have ruthlessly plundered this country.

zia...
apparently, all international standard airports must have two runways. but zia international, shah amanat in chittagong, and shahjalal in sylhet all have one major runway each. granted that the latter two's international arrival and departures are negligible, but what about dhaka? we have seen in more than one instance the whole airport becoming dysfunctional when a mishap happens on the runway (malaysian airlines some years back, saudia recently, and our own biman dc-10 crash landing in chittagong) for hours a together , creating a ripple effect in the flight traffic in the region.

bloodletting and the us
the bloodletting game is a common spectacle in some muslim countries. after the us invasion in afghanistan and iraq, it has been frequently proved that both the countries are pretty vulnerable to violence. almost every day we find news of suicidal bombings in iraq and afghanistan. and the statistics of slain people depict the spectacle of inhumanity!! mostly muslim countries are exposed to violence as some of them have become breeding grounds of terrorists. needless to mention, people of iraq and afghanistan are leading their lives amid great fear. since the us aggression took place in these countries the hellish days began.
saarc: a lame duck
saarc has so far achieved no remarkable success except holding meeting after meeting at different levels. although, we cannot find any remarkable success of saarc in terms of expectations of the huge population of the eight member countries, the inherent problems are well identified by now. ideological conflicts, economic imbalance, big brotherly attitude, external influence and lack of leadership qualities are some of the major hurdles standing on the way of achieving any significant progress. the future is not bright either.
pain killing drugs
there was never any lack of understanding amongst the physicians regarding the usefulness of this particular drug oral morphine in treating severe pain. this is particularly true and more useful for cancer patients of whom many are at the terminal stage of their life. it is cheap, affordable and essential drug recommended by world health organization (who) and international narcotic control board (incb) for cancer pain. granted that opioids, the substances from poppy plant which includes morphine also, are looked upon with scorn due to their addictive nature, but as a medication, these may provide a window of respite, a pain free existence and peaceful exit from life.
our secondary education
so far my memory goes study seemed to be like an agony for me. instead of pleasure and amusement it turned into pain and burden. if my memory does not betray me, i can recollect the events of my school life. i think most of the students in our country, have such kind of experience as i had in the past. our education system, particularly at the secondary level is divided into three parts (i.e. english medium, bengali medium, madrassa). i think it is a sign of discrimination. in the age of capitalism education is no longer a right, rather a privilege. in case of school level students education appears to be a matter of stress and burden. i think our so-called teachers are partially responsible for this stress.
militancy issue in rcc election
this letter is in response to the news item published in your daily on august 03, 2008 regarding rajshahi city corporation election candidates' reluctance to express a firm stance on militancy issue during their campaign.
what i saw in bangladesh
when i heard my mother was sick, i went to bangladesh for two weeks but i stayed a little longer than four weeks. my last visit was in 2005 and i noticed after three years that there had been a lot of change. first of all, at the airport everything was good, no hassle, quick service, all in order and everything on schedule. no hartal and no violence and i was able to use and enjoy all my valuable time. the bad politicians were all in jail or outside the country. most of the people are happy. factories, industries and ports, all institutions are working in order. the only complaint is that the cost of living has gone higher. is all this for rule of emergency? long live emergency! people have high expectations of the caretaker government, especially for system development. for example, the police still serve the government instead of serving ordinary citizens. politics is becoming more open, most of the old political actors and actresses are going back to the stage.
chaotic politics
just after skimming through the headlines i tucked the forum, a supplementary of the daily star, into my office bag while heading towards my office. it was kept on my desk, and suddenly i bumped into the one of the early cover pages of the swm portrayed on its back cover as an ad for swm. in fact that cover page with a banner heading “jcd unleashed” compelled/inspired me to write this.
general mustafiz
it is with great sadness that we took the news of the recent death of former chief of army staff general muhammad mustafizur rahman, bir bikram(may his soul rest in peace). general mustafiz was, among other things, a fine gentleman, a knowledgeable person, an expert in his field, a pleasant personality, a good orator, a good host and a good listener. ms. sarwar sultana - a former acting cabinet minister (internal administration) of the united nations administered east timor and i have had the opportunity to meet the general and his family on a number of occasions during his life time.
opening a bank account
recently, i went through a new hassle in a govt. office. i had to open an account in any branch of sonali bank. so i went to branch close to my residence-- mirpur industrial branch, sonali bank. to open an account, the bank official asked for my national identity card (nid), commissioner certificate, testimony from my office-boss, my academic papers and attestation from any account holder of sonali bank's that branch. i got everything ready spending at least three days. and at the last moment, when all the procedures were going to be complete a bank official ordered me to go to any branch nearer to my office. i informed him that my office was located in gulshan but i reside in pallabi, mirpur. i need an account with this branch. with due respect, i questioned him whether there was any rule, regulation or restriction to let me have an account in that branch. to be noted, i was very polite and sober in my dealing with him. but he was rude from the very beginning. i was astonished. being disappointed at that i went to another sonali bank branch in mirpur-12 the next day. that branch asked for nothing but nid card and allowed me to have an account number. completing all the procedures took me near about four hours. i think it was too much and such hassle is very commonplace in almost all government offices. nowhere we can blame or report against these irregularities and inconveniences. so our suffering has no end.
fakirhat
fakirhat is a union of palasbari in gaibandha district, which has the proud memories of 10 martyred freedom fighters. local people are expecting fakirhat to be a new upazila, which has been their demand to the government from a long time.
shame!
a few days back one of our freedom fighters was insulted by a war criminal. i think it is our national shame. but our government did not take any action. if our freedom fighters, who sacrificed a lot for the sake of our country, are not safe, how can we live with dignity?
smoking
we all know that smoking in public places and any kind of publicity of any tobacco products is prohibited in our country. but people are still smoking in public places and some shops have again started using banners of cigarettes. so, the law is not being implemented properly. that is why, people feel emboldened to smoke openly.
ctg's performance
when an incompetent person runs the government and fails, we don't mind. but when dr. fakhruddin's administration fails we do mind. people are very much disappointed about the poor performance of the ctg. although they had all the logistic support and necessary tools to run an administration smoothly and efficiently, they have failed to deliver.
vat and customs
we, who are in the private sector and working in manufacturing industries, need to interact with vat & customs offices on a regular basis.
points to ponder
an ageless saying states "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"! corruption in this case does not refer to financial corruption. corruption covers a vast range of things; in thoughts, words and deeds. it could well be the power driven blindness, based on the principles of "might is right"; which is getting its day at regular intervals in bangladesh! view the page international
